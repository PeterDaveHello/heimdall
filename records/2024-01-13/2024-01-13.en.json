    "originBody": "Post Office lied and threatened BBC over Horizon whistleblower Published 1 day ago Share Related Topics Post Office Inquiry Media caption, Whistleblower Richard Roll told Panorama in 2015 that postmasters' accounts could be secretly altered By Andrew Head and Tim Robinson Panorama for BBC News The Post Office threatened and lied to the BBC in a failed effort to suppress key evidence that helped clear postmasters in the Horizon scandal. Senior managers tried to smear postmasters before Panorama broadcast an interview in 2015 with a Fujitsu whistleblower. Former insider Richard Roll revealed accounts on the Horizon computer system could be secretly altered. The Post Office declined to comment while the public inquiry is ongoing. Mr Roll would go on to play a crucial part in a 2019 High Court case which ruled that bugs could cause errors in the Post Office computer system intended to keep track of transactions in local branches. Between 1999 and 2015, 700 sub-postmasters and postmistresses - self-employed people who run Post Office branches - were prosecuted for offences such as theft, fraud and false accounting, with some going to prison and others even taking their own lives. The BBC can reveal that in the period leading up to the broadcast of Trouble at the Post Office, the 2015 Panorama programme featuring the whistleblower testimony: Experts interviewed by the BBC were sent intimidating letters by Post Office lawyers about their participation in the programme Senior Post Office managers briefed the BBC that neither their staff nor Fujitsu - the company which built and maintained the Horizon system - could remotely access sub-postmasters' accounts, even though Post Office directors had been warned four years earlier that such remote access was possible Lawyers for the Post Office sent letters threatening to sue Panorama and the company's public relations boss Mark Davies escalated complaints to ever more senior BBC managers The Post Office's false claims did not stop the programme, but they did cause the BBC to delay the broadcast by several weeks. Documents submitted to the ongoing public inquiry reveal how that small victory was celebrated by Post Office senior management. Then-chief executive Paula Vennells congratulated Mark Davies and his PR team on their \"extensive work\". This was just the latest in a long line of lobbying, misinformation and outright lies that had faced a small number of BBC journalists trying to uncover the truth about the Post Office scandal. It began in 2011, when then-BBC regional reporter Nick Wallis first interviewed Jo Hamilton, played by Monica Dolan in the ITV drama Mr Bates v The Post Office. She told him how the Horizon computer system had made money seem to vanish from the tills at her branch in Hampshire. Image caption, Sub-postmistress Jo Hamilton - left, pictured with actress Monica Dolan from the ITV drama - spoke to the BBC in 2011 The Post Office said there was \"no evidence pointing to any fault in the technology\". By 2014, Nick Wallis and producer Tim Robinson were investigating new claims - for BBC regional investigative programme Inside Out - that staff at Fujitsu were able to remotely tamper with Horizon accounts. They interviewed sub-postmaster Michael Rudkin, played by Shaun Dooley in the TV drama, who said he had seen Fujitsu staff tampering with accounts on a visit to the company's head office The Post Office told the BBC journalists at the time there was \"no functionality in Horizon for either a branch, Post Office or Fujitsu to edit, manipulate or remove transaction data\" and that it had found \"no evidence\" to suggest that convictions were unsafe. We now know that 18 months before this statement, a barrister had warned senior Post Office managers a number of prosecutions might be unsafe because of bugs in the system that had not been disclosed in court cases against the sub-postmasters. Rather than admit the truth, the Post Office continued to spread misinformation. And minutes of a Post Office meeting later uncovered in court show its PR boss Mark Davies directly lobbied senior BBC management to try to stop further negative coverage of the story. \"While we are able to withstand this current level of interest, it is resource intensive. We have made representations to the director of BBC News and Current Affairs,\" Mr Davies told colleagues. The Post Office cover-up was holding, but Alan Bates - the hero of the ITV drama - had another card to play. Image caption, Alan Bates - played by Toby Jones in the ITV drama - introduced Panorama to the whistleblower At a meeting in a garden centre tea room in Shrewsbury, he told Nick Wallis he had been contacted by a whistleblower from Fujitsu - who knew the truth about Horizon and remote access. That man was Richard Roll, who had worked for Fujitsu on the Post Office's Horizon computer system in the early 2000s. Mr Bates wanted Panorama to take on the story, so Nick introduced the whistleblower to the programme team. For the 2015 programme, he told Panorama reporter John Sweeney on camera how a team of Fujitsu staff had remote access to branch accounts and could make changes to them without the sub-postmasters' knowledge. It was explosive testimony that could call into question the convictions of more than 700 sub-postmasters prosecuted on the basis of Horizon evidence, as the denial of the possibility of remote access underpinned the Post Office's legal position. The Post Office was going to fight hard to stop the story from coming out - its misinformation campaign ramped up a gear. 'Enormous regret' Panorama journalists Matt Bardo and Tim Robinson were invited to Post Office HQ for an on-the-record briefing about the Horizon system. Network manager Angela van den Bogerd joined PR boss Mark Davies and another senior manager, Patrick Bourke. Ms van den Bogerd insisted nobody could change the sub-postmasters' accounts without their knowledge. She said any alterations \"would leave a footprint. And that's the important bit.\" Matt Bardo asked: \"So in sum, it is not now and never has been possible for anybody from Post Office or Fujitsu to interfere with transactions, without the clear knowledge of the sub-postmaster?\" Mr Bourke said: \"It is 100% true to say we can't change, alter, modify, existing transaction data, so the integrity is 100% preserved.\" \"And that's true now and has been for the duration of the system?\" Mr Bardo asked. \"Yeah,\" said Ms van den Bogerd. That wasn't true. Not then, and not for the duration of the system. Since then, the Post Office has been forced to accept that Fujitsu staff could access and change accounts without the sub-postmasters' knowledge. One of the Post Office's lawyers suggested in 2019 that Angela van den Bogerd and her colleagues had denied remote access was possible because they did not know at the time. He told the High Court: \"It is a matter of enormous regret that the senior managers who dealt with Panorama were not aware that remote access to Horizon was possible.\" But documents Panorama obtained for a follow-up programme in 2020 show the Post Office had known it was possible for years. Image caption, The Horizon computer system was intended to track transactions in Post Offices, but sub-postmasters complained of mysterious shortfalls A report by consultants Ernst and Young sent to Post Office directors in 2011 warned that Fujitsu staff had \"unrestricted access\" to sub-postmasters' accounts, that \"may lead to the processing of unauthorised or erroneous transactions\". The misleading on-the-record briefing was just the first step in the Post Office's onslaught to frustrate the 2015 Panorama investigation. When it learned the names of experts Panorama was interviewing, lawyers and senior managers sent them intimidating letters. Ian Henderson, from the independent forensic accountants Second Sight, had uncovered other evidence of miscarriages of justice at the Post Office. He was warned he did not have the legal expertise to comment on prosecutions and the Post Office threatened to sue him. \"If your statements go as far as to harm Post Office's reputation then we may have to take even more serious action in order to protect our brand,\" he was told. \"For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office does not condone you speaking to Panorama and all our legal rights are fully reserved.\" To protect the whistleblower from similar correspondence, the Panorama team did not tell the Post Office Richard Roll's name. Instead, the journalists said they had spoken to a Fujitsu insider, and outlined the allegations he was making. Smears and false claims From the Post Office's response, it was clear that the whistleblower's evidence which would be featured in the film was of particular concern. PR boss Mark Davies fired off complaints to ever more senior managers at the BBC, and expensive external lawyers were hired with public money to send letters threatening to sue Panorama. The programme team received hundreds of pages of correspondence and reports from the Post Office and their lawyers - but none of the paperwork admitted remote access was possible. At the time, Mr Davies told Panorama \"there is overwhelming evidence that the losses complained of were caused by user actions, including deliberate dishonest conduct\". The Post Office's lobbying did secure them a further meeting, this time an off-the-record briefing with the programme's then-editor. Such meetings are viewed with suspicion by many investigative journalists as they can be used as a tactic to hamper inquiries and publication. So it proved in this case. The Post Office took the opportunity to smear some of the sub-postmasters Panorama was planning to feature in its programme, hinting at potential motives to steal from the tills. In one case, it falsely claimed it had documents showing a postmaster was guilty of theft. But it said it would only show them to the programme team if they promised not to share them with anyone else - which meant Panorama would not even be able to discuss them with the postmaster who had been accused. Panorama refused. The team reviewed all the available evidence, which delayed the broadcast. But nothing was found that cast doubt on the sub-postmasters' stories and the film aired in August 2015. Image caption, Paula Vennells - left, with actress Lia Williams playing her, right - now says she is \"truly sorry\" people were wrongly accused It can often be a struggle to get a Panorama to air. It's not unusual for big companies and wealthy individuals to mount intensive legal and lobbying efforts to protect their reputations. But for the programme team, this was a battle like few others - and it was a government-owned institution that was waging the war. The Post Office had failed to stop Richard Roll's story being told, but it still sought to reduce its impact. After the programme aired, the Post Office immediately published a statement on its website that said it would be complaining to the BBC about the \"unsubstantiated allegations that continue to be made\". Richard Roll's allegations were not picked up by the rest of the media and his testimony did not spark the national outrage that has followed ITV's drama. Post Office CEO Paula Vennells reported back to the government body which owns the Post Office that \"the programme contained no new information and received almost no pick-up from other media\". Mrs Vennells made no mention of the new information provided by the whistleblower. But all was not lost. Panorama from 2015 - Trouble at the Post Office The Post Office has prosecuted dozens of postmasters after their computers showed that money had gone missing. Reporter John Sweeney meets a whistleblower who says there were problems with the computer system. And he investigates claims that the Post Office charged some postmasters with theft even when the evidence didn't stack up. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) The programme had an impact on one important viewer, which would prove to be a pivotal moment in the story. Lawyer Patrick Green KC immediately realised the significance of Richard Roll's testimony. The barrister went on to lead the postmasters' legal case that showed Horizon could be to blame for unexpected shortfalls. Panorama's whistleblower appeared as a witness at the High Court in March 2019 and his account played a key part in discrediting the Post Office's insistence that remote access to the branch accounts was not possible. Mr Green later told Panorama how important the 2015 programme had been to their victory. He said: \"I'm not sure that this litigation would've happened as it did had Panorama not made that programme.\" The postmasters' victory over the Post Office at the High Court was the turning of the legal tide and led to the overturning of convictions at the Court of Appeal. IMAGE SOURCE, PA MEDIA Image caption, Dozens of former sub-postmasters had their convictions later quashed after the High Court victory Lawyers for Mark Davies told Panorama he had acted at all times entirely in good faith and that his statements had been based on the information he was given at the time. \"Our client was doing his job… to ensure that any coverage of this matter was fair and accurate,\" they said. And Paula Vennells now says: \"I am truly sorry for the devastation caused to the sub-postmasters and their families, whose lives were torn apart by being wrongly accused and wrongly prosecuted as a result of the Horizon system.\" But for years, the Post Office tried to suppress crucial evidence. The Post Office knew in 2015 that there were bugs and errors in Horizon. It knew that remote access was possible. And it knew some of its convictions were unsafe. The evidence in Panorama's 2015 film was there for the government to see too. But it took several trials, more than 90 overturned convictions and a TV drama for the Post Office scandal to get the attention it has long deserved.

The Fujitsu developer in question confirmed what the Post Office was denying, that the Horizon software at the center of the scandal, had implemented methods for secretly editing accounts. Approx 700 postmasters (self-employed managers of Post Office branches) were held responsible when large amounts of cash appeared to have vanished from tills, resulting in prosecutions for fraud and theft. I know someone who was affected by this, who managed a now-closed Post Office branch here in Wakefield, UK and it was a life ruining ordeal for her. She was accused of stealing £1,000's in cash. I'm not sure if it was a bug or someone remotely changed the account records for her branch, but the campaign the Post Office ran to smear any accusations of wrongfulness on the part of the Horizon software is shocking. reply prof-dr-ir 20 hours agoparent> currently ongoing in the UK To be precise it is finally getting some of the attention it deserves, both from the public and from the government. The miscarriages of justice date from 1999 until 2015, and the high court ruling (about the software being faulty) that finally stopped the flow of convictions dates from 2019, almost five years ago. Very little happened since then, and in particular no one has been held accountable. If that delay sounds absolutely bonkers to you then yes, that is what everyone else thinks as well. reply krisoft 20 hours agorootparent> Very little happened since then, and in particular no one has been held accountable.

But these people had to actively go out and request their conviction to be overturned. Which of course many people were reluctant to do, since it means they would be upturning their life again, and going to court and finding lawyers and etc. They understandably have very little trust in the system. So Post Office just shrugged and decided they don't need to keep that much money around. reply matteason 19 hours agorootparentAnd all the while Horizon is still in use and still making money vanish - via both bugs and the £95 million paid to Fujitsu to keep it going for another two years: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67940125 reply scott_w 20 hours agorootparentprev> Even crazier.

Not sure how the legal authorities work in the UK but people have to be held accountable, regardless of political party.

It’s granted to honor notable service in various areas, including public works like the Post Office. This acronym is apparently common enough to people from the UK that news stories within the UK call it CBE without explaining what the acronym means, so your average UK citizen must know exactly what it means. Most people from the USA are probably familiar with the term “knighthood” or “being knighted” from the UK which is referring to the same award process but higher ranking. The two titles above CBE apparently are what knighthood refers to, known as KBE/DBE (Knight/Dame Commander of the Order of British Empire) and GBE (Knight/Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire, the highest honor). So CBE is essentially the third highest honor that can be granted in this fashion. Related to the story, it seems like the CEO in question was forced to give up the CBE title two days ago in relation to this scandal reply tialaramex 17 hours agorootparentThere are a bunch of different orders you can get knighted in, the British Empire is just one of them, for example the fictional James Bond has a CMG, (Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George), and the actor Daniel Craig who played him also has a CMG, although unlike Bond he has not turned down a KCMG (Bond turns down the knighthood because it makes you more of a public figure which is undesirable for an active secret agent whereas it's no problem for an actor). The Order of St Michael & St George is also famous because it's how the \"Yes, Minister\" joke works: CMG stands for \"Call Me God\". And KCMG for \"Kindly Call Me God\" / What does GCMG stand for? / \"God Calls Me God\". She was not yet \"forced\" to give it up, although that is likely the end result. These honours are notionally bestowed by the Monarch (so these days, Charlie) under advice, so a committee will decide that yup, Paula clearly shouldn't have this honour, take it away, and Charlie will sign the appropriate paperwork. What she's done so far is write asking that it be taken away, which is almost nothing. reply sorokod 16 hours agorootparentHer name is Paula Vennells. I take this opportunity to reinforce the association of her name with the scandal in future web searches. reply Wistar 14 hours agorootparentSo, Paula Vennells's Post Office scandal? reply sorokod 14 hours agorootparentYep, the same Paula Vennells that got a CBE in 2019 for services to the Post Office. https://www.gov.uk/government/people/paula-vennells reply SOLAR_FIELDS 17 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, thanks for sharing. Based on your comment I looked it up and found 6 other orders, including Order of Saint Michael and George that you mentioned. OBE is apparently not the most prestigious one, the highest and most prestigious one is apparently called The Most Noble Order of the Garter. Interesting slice of old royal UK culture. reply pmyteh 16 hours agorootparentYes. The Garter and the Thistle (and the Order of Merit) are exclusively small and also in the personal gift of the sovereign. The Order of the British Empire is much larger and appointments are made on advice from the government. reply ChrisSD 18 hours agorootparentprevJust to clarify, I doubt many people from the UK would know off hand what CBE stands for even though they know what a CBE is. The full name is pretty archaic in any case so it's basically just trivia at this point. reply Lio 14 hours agorootparentReally? I was under the impression this was common knowledge.

In Dalmellington, that bug created a £24,000 discrepancy, which the Post Office tried to hold the post office operator responsible for. The fact that this is even possible, apart from the sheer incompetency of a software design that permits it, means that no person can reasonably be accused of stealing cash if that accusation is based on records from this system. reply creer 10 hours agorootparentCompounded with the fact that the issue was happening all over the country.

It really depends on what Fujitsu told which PO manager. reply tialaramex 18 hours agorootparentThe Post Office also paid independent people to figure out where the problem is, and the answer was \"Horizon is garbage, you can't rely on it\". So, they fired those people. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-67921974 This a pattern we've seen before 1. \"We aren't wrong, you are too involved to make an impartial decision. We need somebody independent to investigate\" 2. \"The independent investigation has finished, but we need to properly digest their report, so we can't tell you what they said yet\" 3. \"We've now realised the independent investigation was inadequate, everybody who worked on it was incompetent and its findings are useless so we've destroyed the report. We declare ourselves exonerated, we were right all along\". People tend to have this mistaken understanding of morality which assumes they're a good person and so therefore obviously what they did must be good (since they're a good person) and so they might need to uh, fix differences between the world as they've imagined it and the slightly less rosy reality. For example sure, you know that stabbing Sarah in the throat resulted in Sarah becoming dead, but you had to do that, because you're a good person and Sarah was going to tell the Police that you'd stolen $18.5M from the business. You didn't steal that money! Sure, yes, you took the money and maybe you technically shouldn't have done that, but you had a 100% sure strategy for playing Blackjack and recovering the $800 000 you lost last month, except that you got a bit confused and lost all of the $18.5M, but that's not theft, that's just a minor mistake you will be able to soon fix, if only Sarah doesn't tell these lies about stealing and get you arrested.

I, for one, don't believe her. reply nebulous1 19 hours agorootparentApparently she can't \"return\" it, it has to be annulled by the British monarch. reply ndsipa_pomu 18 hours agorootparentI hope Charlie does that then, but it depends on whether he cares enough about it. I think it would be fitting if a significant percentage of other people with CBEs started to return them with public statements about them not wanting to be associated with the likes of Paula Vennells. reply tialaramex 17 hours agorootparentIt's not really on Charlie, any more than he's the one making the lists. His mother wasn't like \"OH, we should honor that Post Office lady, I like receiving letters and I bet she's somehow responsible for that\". She just got a list with Paula's name on it, along with various crooks, financiers, consultants, political hacks and maybe the odd charity worker. Issuing Honours is something a Monarch does, but like declaring War or deciding what Laws should govern the country, they don't actually make decisions, that's a government problem. So long as the general public were barely aware of a problem, this could skate along as not important for years, but now lots of people are angry because they saw a TV show and for once when they said \"Hey this is terrible!\" instead of \"It's just a TV show it's not real you idiots\" those of us who were paying attention are like \"Yes, so what are you going to do about it?\" which as we've seen puts pressure on government to actually do something. reply dmix 20 hours agoparentprevWas it the post office itself that was dealing out charges? Like a post office inspector or whatever it's called? Or was it a normal police referral type thing? reply scott_w 20 hours agorootparentYes. The Post Office historically was wholly owned by the UK Government, so maintained its own private prosecutors instead of relying on the Crown Prosecution Service. This is why it was able to fight so hard to get convictions, they had the funds to pay their own expensive lawyers to do it. This meant those that fought the charges and lost were then forced to \"pay back\" the money they \"stole\" and also pay the Post Office legal fees and being sent to prison. The scandal is sickening on literally every level you can imagine! reply miohtama 19 hours agorootparentA good and sad example why trifecta and separation of powers is important in democracy. No one should share the role of prosecutor, jury and judge. reply scott_w 19 hours agorootparentIt was only the prosecutor, not the judge or jury. The issue is that the Post Office lied to the judge and jury about their evidence. There were a (relatively) small number of prosecutions from the CPS as well, which suffered from the same problem: the Post Office investigators gave the same bad evidence, which they used to convince a jury to convict. I don't see how separation of powers helps here. I'm sure if I looked, I'd find cases in the USA where the police and/or prosecutors told a pack of lies based on dodgy evidence to secure convictions of serious crimes, too. reply hennell 18 hours agorootparentProsecuting directly meant there was no outside eyes on a lot of the cases, no questions about if it was actually in the public interest to prosecute, or external assessment of the evidence before pushing for plea deals. It's not a foolproof system, but I think most of the cases you'd find about 'dodgy evidence' would also mention a 'overly close relationship between police and prosecutors' - because fully independent prosecutors should be rejecting cases with dodgy evidence. The police can get a bit grumpy with CPS for being quite strict at times - but it holds them to work their next case properly. The PO clearly managed to convince the CPS in a number of cases, but had they had to do that for all there would have been a lot less cases prosecuted in total, and I think there would have been questions about their system a lot sooner. It might not have avoided the problem, but it would have been much needed additional oversight into what they were doing. reply scott_w 13 hours agorootparent> It's not a foolproof system, but I think most of the cases you'd find about 'dodgy evidence' would also mention a 'overly close relationship between police and prosecutors' So the separation of powers isn’t a magic solution to the problem then. reply tialaramex 17 hours agorootparentprevIn the US the police are specifically allowed to lie to suspects, whereas British cops are not. If you can prove the police lied in a recorded interview or something used in evidence in court that's going to be a big problem for prosecutors in the UK but not in the US where it's expected. reply afandian 18 hours agorootparentprevWe know they lied. Do we know specifically if they have been shown to have committed perjury? reply scott_w 13 hours agorootparentI don’t think they perjured themselves which isn’t the same as saying they didn’t lie. It’s easy to not perjure yourself if you’re not asked the right questions. The lie came from the fact they weren’t looking into their own evidence and realising something was up when they were prosecuting hundreds of sub-postmasters. reply afandian 12 hours agorootparentThere’s been so much misconduct in public office I just wish there were some open and shut cases. reply tomalpha 19 hours agorootparentprevThis was a regular court process, with an independent judge and jury. It’s just the prosecution was run directly by the post office and not the public prosecutor. It still had very bad outcomes, and clearly with the prosecution not being independent enough, but it wasn’t an entirely closed process. reply JdeBP 19 hours agorootparentIt's not quite regular. Normally, the (purported) victim and the prosecutor are not the same person. That's another thing that has been highlighted by this case: the fact that Post Office Ltd has inherited the ability to prosecute crimes committed against itself, rather than them being prosecuted independently by the Crown Prosecution Service. (More on which at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38969076) reply saulr 18 hours agorootparent> the fact that Post Office Ltd has inherited the ability to prosecute crimes committed against itself Any private citizen or business in the UK has a right to prosecute crimes. It just costs a lot of money, so you can imagine how it's used (spoiler: large companies/wealthy individuals against poor people). reply JdeBP 4 hours agorootparentYou should have read the more-on-which first. (-: reply scott_w 19 hours agorootparentprevThe CPS also \"successfully\" prosecuted some cases based on the same evidence. If your key complainants are fabricating evidence that looks solid to a jury, separation of powers is not going to save you from the power of the state. As I said in a related comment: if I looked hard enough, I imagine I'd also be able to find similar miscarriages of justice in the USA, too. reply JdeBP 4 hours agorootparentPost Office Ltd is not \"the state\". At least nominally. It was privatized at the turn of the 21st century. As I just said, one of the things that this has highlighted for people is that a private company has a normal practice of pursuing criminal prosecutions (for fraud in this case) privately, rather than via the Crown Prosecution Service which is normal practice for almost every other private company or organization when it comes to criminal matters. More on which, again, at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38969076. And more on the expected consequences of this coming to widespread public attention, and another private organization that is a prolific private prosecutor, at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38969548. reply scott_w 3 hours agorootparentYou’re correct, it’s not any more. I’m saying it used to be ;-) reply hnfong 19 hours agorootparentprevThe key \"complaints\" of GP, as I understand them, are that being simultaneously the victim and prosecutor, the prosecutor-as-victim is more incentivized to use heavy handed tactics during the prosecution process. Whereas a generic prosecutor has a bunch of cases of reports from victims that are not related to them, and thus if a case is not sufficiently strong, they'd normally just pick another case where the evidence is strong. They also have the responsibility to independently review the evidence from victims and police. These procedural checks didn't apply in the post office cases. The procedural checks I mentioned above aren't fool-proof, but they're something. reply scott_w 19 hours agorootparent> The key \"complaints\" of GP, as I understand them, are that being simultaneously the victim and prosecutor, the prosecutor-as-victim is more incentivized to use heavy handed tactics during the prosecution process. I know what they wrote. > The procedural checks I mentioned above aren't fool-proof, but they're something. I pointed out the CPS itself also prosecuted cases based on the bad evidence provided to them, so the procedural checks also did nothing. reply JdeBP 3 hours agorootparent> I know what they wrote. Clearly you do not, as I made no complaint; but merely pointed out how it wasn't quite the regular court process that tomalpha said it to be, and pointed out another thing that has been highlighted by the case. As it has been. A lot more people know this about Post Office Ltd than used to, and it is oft-discussed when the subject comes up. reply hnfong 18 hours agorootparentprevI think we're basically on the same page, diverging only on speculative items. Do note that the fact that CPS prosecuted cases does not mean the CPS didn't throw out dubious cases. We only know the ones they did prosecute, but we don't know how many (if any) they did not prosecute. As I said, this is speculation. I also speculate that if you send hundreds of fraud cases to the CPS they might be suspicious why the rate of criminal fraud among the post office workers is so high. I agree there's no evidence that the \"private\" prosecutions made things worse, but it surely didn't help, and deprived the system of an opportunity (whether it would have been taken or not) to prevent the miscarriages in the first place. reply scott_w 13 hours agorootparentHonestly, the fact the Post Office were marking their own homework almost certainly made everything worse, in my opinion. I’m just taking issue with the idea that it was the sole cause, as we similar things happen under different systems, too. reply sorokod 19 hours agorootparentprevProsecutor and victim, extremely bad combination when a powerful organization is involved. reply scott_w 19 hours agorootparentSee https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38968431 reply benrutter 20 hours agorootparentprevSo apparently in UK law, the post office carry out their own investigations before taking charges to court (effectively replacing the police for internal post office charges) which sounds mental to me. reply JdeBP 18 hours agorootparentLots of people have told you that anyone can bring a private prosecution. But they aren't telling the whole story. Post Office Ltd, by being a successor to the government monopoly of four centuries, is in a rather strange legal position. The royal mail had all sorts of powers, historically, as it was a royally sanctioned monopoly, with a charter. The process of privatization left some odd conventions around, such as that it was normal for Post Office Ltd to prosecute things privately, when this has been exceptional for most other entities. The Post Office used to prosecute for television licence offences, for example, and that only went away relatively recently compared to some of its historic powers. Historically, it had a monopoly over telephones and telegraphy, and some of the powers that the Post Office had in the 19th century were things like compulsory purchase of anyone running private telephone or telegraph systems or prosecuting people for traffic offences on the highway just because there was a mail coach involved. The Post Office Act 1953 granted the Postmaster General some very sweeping powers, and set the bar quite low for proving fraud against the Post Office: basically, the Postmaster General's say-so for some elements. The Postmaster General also had to give consent to all prosecutions of offences against the Post Office, effectively putting prosecutorial discretion in the hands of the Post Office. And the Postmaster General also had the power to collect the fines upon conviction. And that's part of how we ended up with the situation at the start of the 21st century. reply physicsguy 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's not quite that, anybody in the UK can bring a private prosecution in the UK if the want, so the Post Office was not a special case here. It's really uncommon today, due to the cost, etc. and what often happens is that the \"Crown Prosecution Service' which is the government organisation repsonsible for prosecuting crimes normally can 'take on' a prosecution and then choose discontinue it, which effectively stops it. Note that this is only the case in England/Wales, in Scotland the system is quite different. With that said, there are several organisations that do it still - the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) still regularly brings private prosectuions. Historically, all prosecutions were private, and later, the police who investigated them carried them out. reply wozniacki 16 hours agorootparentBetween 1999 and 2015, an estimated 3500 staff employed by the state-owned Post Office service were accused of fraud, theft or malicious accounting. Almost 700 of them were convicted in courts and some 230 were jailed. Most were legally compelled to repay the amounts they were accused of fleecing, resulting in bankruptcies, marriage failures, substance abuse and even suicides. There was just one not-so-little problem – virtually all of those people were innocent Thats a lot of accusations and prosecutions don't you think, for it to go unnoticed or uninvestigated for such a long duration, dont you think? Doesnt the UK have independent non-political bodies that watch the watchers? What about protections for whistleblowers who call these things out? Frankly that sounds Banana-Republic-ish and not something you would find in a first-rate advanced economy. [1] Inside the incredible and devastating postal service scandal that could bring down the UK government https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/inside-the-incr... reply rcxdude 9 hours agorootparentIt's been called out for a long time. I remember reading about this scandal at least 5 years ago, and it was old news then. It's only blown up now because of a TV show based on it, and the government finally getting off their ass to have a public inquiry about it. That's what's so frustrating about it: it should have been bloody obvious way sooner that there was an issue, it should have stopped when someone actually voiced the issue, and then it should have been put right as soon as it was obvious it was false. Instead it has taken years and years and years of fighting before anything resembling putting it right has occured. reply JdeBP 5 hours agorootparentThere has already been a public inquiry, note. It started in 2020. It was set up by Boris Johnson. Yes, I know. reply scott_w 20 hours agorootparentprevDavid Davis mentioned this on News Agents. It seems like a holdover from when it was simply an arm of the state, where it made sense that it could just handle its own enforcement (since it carried the power of the Crown). It's absolutely something that needs to be stripped away in the modern day. reply RuggedPineapple 19 hours agorootparentIt's not really a holdover because the UK allows ANYONE to bring a private prosecution. They just have the resources to do it at scale. reply JdeBP 18 hours agorootparentThere are legal arguments recounted in modern law textbooks that the whole idea of private prosecutions in England and Wales is a hold-over nowadays. The argument goes that since CPS decisions are subject to judicial review, the raison d'être for private prosecutions, that they allow for bad exercise of public prosecutorial discretion to be corrected by private persons, no longer exists, since the bad exercise of discretion now has another remedy. There is a fair groundswell of opinion, already driven by the bad reputation that the RSPCA, another prolific private prosecutor, has garnered, against private prosecutions. The Horizon thing only serves to fuel this, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were not soon a proposal to do away with all private prosecutions on the back of these, despite the fact that Post Office Ltd and the RSPCA are institutional private prosecutors, and there's nowhere near as strong a case that personal private prosecutors are a problem. reply bmsleight_ 13 hours agorootparentStephen Lawrence parents took the option of a private prosecution. Everyone must have access to justice. reply M2Ys4U 19 hours agorootparentprevAnyone can bring a private prosecution (in England and Wales, at least. Scotland and Northern Ireland have different legal systems). The Crown Prosecution Service can take over any prosecution at the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but they didn't seem to know (and/or care) what the Post Office were doing. reply scott_w 19 hours agorootparentIt's likely they won't step in if the organisation in question has the resources to handle prosecutions at the required scale. The CPS did prosecute some cases but it's hard to blame them since they were being lied to by the Post Office investigators. reply eli 20 hours agorootparentprevIt’s the same in the US. The US Postal Inspector is federal law enforcement within the post office. reply mandevil 13 hours agorootparentNot the same at all. The Postal Inspectors are law enforcement, not attorneys. They don't do prosecutions at all, the court stuff is handled by the regular Federal Attorney's who work for the Attorney General. The Postal Inspectors are basically a specialized FBI, but like the FBI, once the cuffs are on the suspect it's out of their hands. Though they may be called to testify, prosecution decisions are made by a different group responsible to different people- literally the first point of overlap in the chain of command between a Federal Attorney and a Postal Inspector is the President of the United States (the FBI, as also part of the Department of Justice, overlaps at the Attorney General). reply jetpackjoe 19 hours agorootparentprevI imagine that in the US, the actual prosecution is handled by US Attorneys though (the DOJ), and not the Post Office reply krisoft 18 hours agorootparentprev> which sounds mental to me Isn't this very similar to how the United States Postal Inspection Service works?

What the fuck?!\" at the screen because the malice and dishonesty was so deliberate, so persistently maintained, lest the \"brand\" be sullied. I've been following this story for years, I know BBC's Panorama covered it in 2015, and was really surprised there wasn't more of an outcry in the UK about such blatant unfairness, guess technical cases like this are really helped by a TV drama with quality actors making it easily accessible to the general population, as soon as ITV aired the miniseries, the petition to have Vennall's CBE stripped jumped from 7K signatures to 700K+, and she said she would return it. (not the golden handshakes and \"performance\" bonuses though lol) I just can't believe that no-one has been held criminally accountable (yet) for the sheer (to quote the judges in the civil case) affront to justice that this represented - whether it was Post Office Limited (POL) misleading (well, lying to) the courts, or Fujitsu employees lying in prosecutions, or POL deliberately withholding evidence in their role as a prosecutor (wild that this power to prosecute as transferred from Royal Mail to the spun off entity), and some of the cynically legalistic games they played (like asking the judge to recuse himself for being biased against them, to further delay the outcome of the civil suit). And the crap they pulled with the Second Sight independent analysis that they commissioned themselves... I was just reading the Clarke Advice(s), and god-damn, I can't see how any former POL executives can claim \"we honestly believed all that stuff we said in court, honest\", after their own goddamn independent legal advice told them \"stop these prosecutions, like now, your expert witness is full of shit\" The 2nd Clarke Advice is a great read too, basically \"STOP TRYING TO HIDE EVIDENCE, JESUS CHRIST\". Oh, and some of the code that turned up from Horizon in an internal Fujitsus report is egregiously bad (how do I turn x into -x or -x into x?

Even the Law Lords (as they were typically called when the exact same body existed as notionally part of the House of Lords prior to becoming the UK's Supreme Court) were way more independent than that. A Government minister can say \"No\" to the pick of the committee which independently chooses candidates for this job, but they can't pick for themselves, the committee can just give them the same name again until (inevitably) the minister gets replaced with one who doesn't say \"No\".

But in the Post Office case, the Post Office had all the evidence, and refused to disclose it. As far as I'm aware, failure to disclose evidence that might help the defence is perverting the course of justice. I don't know why no manager's been charged. reply ndsipa_pomu 17 hours agorootparentIt's worse than that - there was evidence that Fujitsu could remotely affect the different branch computers with at least one person seeing it happen before their eyes and the Post Office absolutely denied that it was possible or had ever been possible. reply raesene9 19 hours agorootparentprevYep that's a huge challenge. The other one is that individual defendant's are unlikely to be able to afford the expertise needed to analyze a large complex setup, even if the details of the system (e.g. source code) are made available. reply beardyw 19 hours agoparentprevYes it's an interesting point.

I do think that modern cars should be fitted with a black box device with the owner having ultimate control over access to it, so they could submit it for evidence to prevent miscarriages of justice. reply acdha 19 hours agorootparent> I do think that modern cars should be fitted with a black box device with the owner having ultimate control over access to it, so they could submit it for evidence to prevent miscarriages of justice I’m not sure this is workable: if the owner had control, there’d be a cottage industry of people offering to fake evidence against camera tickets. If the owner doesn’t, it’d get requested by police and insurance routinely and since most drivers regularly break local traffic laws that’d have a big negative impact on the owners, which makes me think it’s politically infeasible. Insurance companies might try to mandate that but I imagine they are very careful about changes which could shift customers. reply ndsipa_pomu 18 hours agorootparentI think those issues could be overcome by using encryption and checksums for the logs with the decryption key held by a third party that would read and release the data on request by the owner or in criminal cases where the owner was a victim. The more likely model is that the insurance companies own and provide the black boxes in return for reduced premiums from the owner. The current situation is that some drivers run their own dashcams and can choose to provide video evidence, but that could be open to abuse if someone very carefully edits the video and no-one spots it. I agree that the drivers shouldn't be forced to self-incriminate - the police should be using their own evidence which could well be from other drivers submitting their own driving data/video. reply graemep 20 hours agorootparentprevI think \"presumed to be operating normally for certain devices is certain oversight and testing requirements are met\" is reasonable.

At least for American public companies, SOX compliance requirements make it impossible for something like this to ever happen without an explicit authorization in place. The rule is simple: every destructive action (think mutable) needs to have one requester and one approver. As long as it is logged in some system, you’re golden. This is somewhat enforced through regular publicly disclosed audits. I suppose that’s what Ernst and Young did when they noted in an audit that Fujitsu has unrestricted access to modify accounts without the postmasters knowledge, and this poses risk. What strikes me as bizarre is that no regulatory body took any action on that report. Maybe the report was private, I’m not sure - I don’t know how things work in the UK.

Fact my gas supplier identified fault in gas safty in october that they still not fixed and my concerns that impacted not only my flat but all the other flats (it does as i checked) and entire estate as fault when built and as such making every gas and electrical safty certificate for past 25 years invalid. Seems to fall on deaf ears, even HSE (Health and Safty Executive) seem to be, well they should fix it and toothless. Yet this is just nothing and whole list of failures by them that they already under investigation. Let alone all my findings and damming evidence. The the Met Police. But hard to really deal with it due to PTSD of it all and decade of abusive neighbours who literally tried to get me killed and not only proof of that ignored but made out the other way around when it is clear as crystal with evidence submitted that is not only untrue but downright blatant lie. Police ignored that and more so, much more in past that it is a history of pure and utter failings and criminal. Glad I have video and audio recordings proving it and that includes meetings in which police and housing lie and damming as hell. Yet, you would think somebody would care, but dam as I'm not alone in these situations. But look at Post Office scandal - how many people died over that and efforts to get to light.

If you hit \"Return\" again whilst the screen was frozen it would silently submit the figures again.

Two bugs are detailed here: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/09/how-the-post... > One, named the “Dalmellington Bug”, after the village in Scotland where a post office operator first fell prey to it, would see the screen freeze as the user was attempting to confirm receipt of cash. Each time the user pressed “enter” on the frozen screen, it would silently update the record. In Dalmellington, that bug created a £24,000 discrepancy, which the Post Office tried to hold the post office operator responsible for. > Another bug, called the Callendar Square bug – again named after the first branch found to have been affected by it – created duplicate transactions due to an error in the database underpinning the system: despite being clear duplicates, the post office operator was again held responsible for the errors.

Or if they turned their machine off earlier than 5pm, end-of-day processes did not get run properly. Or if their node was trying to synchronise with the central node a bit later than normal and the central node was doing a 'reindexing' operation, their messages got lost.

It was not only the bugs but also the UX and the overall process that made things worse. The system did things that the postmaster was either unaware of, or did not intend to do. When there was a customer session and a session time-out occurred it was changed into an actual transaction without the postmaster intending it; like you have a shopping cart on an e-commerce site and it transforms the shopping cart automatically into a sale after timeout. There were screen freezes and when the postmaster pressed enter while the screen freeze happend, it multiplied the amount of money, without the screen being updated. Postmasters are responsible for discrepancies, and when they called the telephone support they were occasionally told \"not to worry, it will sort itself out\". There were corrections from the outside and postmasters sometimes waited for weeks and even months for these corrections to happen to resolve the discrepancies. Sometimes they never happened. reply tgv 19 hours agoparentprevThere's a computerphile video on youtube where a prof goes through A, C, I and D and gives an example where each of these went wrong.

Are there good and practical books for example on the topic? reply pjc50 17 hours agoparentA good start might be the French \"NF525\" law, which lays down legal standards for how cash registers should work. https://www2.ikosoft.com/en-gb/all-knowledge-about-the-nf525... / https://www2.ikosoft.com/en-gb/cash-security-software-how-to... \"Any software with nf certification must not allow any concealment of data essential for VAT assessment. It must be equipped with a system for identification and tracing of all processes and information relating to collections. Concerning the registration, the security is done by electronic signature. All information recorded in the cash register system cannot be modified or deleted. Errors and returns are automatically considered as new transactions. As regards the retention of data, the minimum period imposed by the standard is six years. Furthermore, during a tax audit, an archiving system must facilitate the interventions of the tax authorities, by quickly restoring the data necessary for the calculation of VAT. Note that archiving is systematic before any purging procedure. This rule ensures that the data is available at each intervention of the administration’s agents.\" It's perhaps a bit more like signed git commits than blockchain; the requirement is that every transaction be signed and immutable. If \"corrections\" are required, the correction has to be appended to the log leaving the original in place. I believe there's also a requirement to feed all this receipt data to the tax authorities. reply codeulike 18 hours agoprevHere's a system audit manual from Jan 2000, part of the inquiry evidence.

Updating docs to a new release is easy unless the documentation system (such as react.dev redesign) or design is rewritten. Some projects seem to do this on a regular basis. Some documentation generators generate random class names (such as .gtWOdv, .ezMiXD, .gOhcvK on docs.npmjs.com by Gatsby) which makes cleaning the docs from superfluous content (such as on-page navigation) very cumbersome and flaky.

Now as a FOSS maintainer I don't owe anyone any particular set of features or bug fixes. BUT I ABSOLUTELY DO OWE THEM ACTUAL OPENNESS AND THE ABILITY TO STUDY THE SYSTEM PROPERLY. Many FOSS projects frankly kneecap Freedom 1 with a sledgehammer for anyone who isn't a well off person with reliable Internet access. And I've been up to here with it for a very long time now. For all my FOSS projects big or small my pledge is to give users complete and trivial access to the full Open Knowledge Set associated with them. Not just the main program sources and executables, but built and source forms of any official documentation that exists. Withholding any official documentation that exists from trivial and easy offline access in a useful form is fundamentally no better than withholding any part of the source code. Period. End of story. My pledge for all my FOSS projects is as follows: At the home page people within 30 seconds of having read the Elevator Pitch and decided they want to study the system properly will be able to trivially enumerate and initiate downloads for all educational information related to it whether that's source code or built forms of the documentation usable for study straight away. How the Open Source Definition and Free Software Definition don't mandate something as common sense as this I don't know. Open Source and Open Knowledge should be for everyone, not just well off people with reliable Internet access. Anyway that's what caused me to start the Freedom Respecting Technology movement. Thus if anything I said here resonates with anyone they should read https://makesourcenotcode.github.io/freedom_respecting_techn... to learn more. reply imiric 10 hours agoparentThat's a good idea, but I don't see why it deserves a manifesto, or the grandiose claims about being the \"next generation\" of open source. Just ship your software with documentation. This was a good practice even before open source or the internet took off. Old school closed source software used to ship with physical manuals, and good quality software often had good documentation as well. Some OSS CLI tools do have extensive manpages, yet users often don't read them in their entirety. So it's not just a matter of shipping good documentation, it's also about making it discoverable and easy to use. This is where projects like DevDocs step in. reply dosourcenotcode 6 hours agorootparentI absolutely stand by my claim that FRT is the Next Generation of FOSS for several reasons. To begin with even now in the 2020s billions of people alive today have never once been on the Internet. Source: https://www.un.org/en/delegate/itu-29-billion-people-still-o... Also billions more may have some kind of Internet but it's flaky. Sometimes very very flaky. They are systematically excluded from large swathes of the FOSS ecosystem. So make no mistake, the scale of the problem is VAST. We're talking billions of people here that can be helped by FRT. Again, billions, with a B. If all existing FOSS were transformed into FRTs overnight the world would be unrecognizably better by several orders of magnitude. And yes we need a new manifesto/definition. FOSS standards have completely dropped the ball on this issue among several others. Do a ctrl+f for the word \"offline\" in either the Free Software Definition or the Open Source Definition. Many FOSS implementations also drop the ball here. Happily some do the right thing. Sometimes deliberately which is beautiful to see. Often though it turns out it's accidental and one redesign of the site later I can't get docs for the latest version of the tool. Oftentimes it's the small (sometimes subtle) details that make the difference between freedom and lack thereof and the FRTD exists to make sure they are covered. Even seemingly simple things often aren't. Consider pointers, they're just a thing that stores a memory address, no big deal right, easy peasy, yet using them safely is the subject of at least several chapters in a book, and even calls for research into and implementations of safer approaches like those used by Rust. And yes one of the details the FRTD addresses is the discoverability issue you mention with the man pages. Say I'm a newbie that just learned there's a thing called the command line and I open my terminal. I see a Bash prompt, but I don't know what to do with it, or even that it's a Bash prompt. I don't know about the man command. I don't know about apropos. I don't know about GNU info. I don't know to try looking for info manuals if I can't find man pages. I just vaguely know from like the movies or something I have to type stuff, press enter, and then stuff happens. I don't know anything yet. The fact that the man pages are on my system and will be available offline does all of bupkis for me at this point. On Linux there's a man page called \"intro\" (and even though there's room for improving it) after which someone reads it they actually have a fighting chance of using the command line and knowing where to learn more. On OpenBSD there's a similar man page called \"help\" that does a similar job and starts the whole conceptual bootstrap chain. Yet nothing tells me to start my studies by running \"man intro\". On Linux a one sentence message saying to run \"man intro\" to begin your studies of the command line would go a long way for example. The difference between information and knowledge is often a few small bits of commonsensically placed metadata forming a conceptual bootstrap chain as well as one pointing to the chain's start. Not labor intensive on the part of implementers yet transforms the system from zero to superhero. Or perhaps since William Shotts wrote an excellent book called The Linux Command Line, and it's licensed under Creative Commons such that it can be reproduced and included in Linux distributions, maybe there can be a pointer telling people to read that at wherever it's stored on the system instead because it's far superior to \"man intro\". Again a one or two sentence message can make all the difference. reply kosasbest 14 hours agoprevMDN[0] is usually my goto reference for frontend stuff.

I'm a big user of both Jupyter notebooks and Observable notebooks (https://observablehq.com/) and the thing I miss most from Observable when I'm using Jupyter is the lack of cell reactivity. You've solved that incredibly well! I also really like that the Marimo file format is just Python. Here's an example saved file from playing around with the intro: https://gist.github.com/simonw/e6e6e4b45d1bed9fc1482412743b8... Nice that it's Apache 2 licensed too. Wow, I just found the GitHub Copilot feature too! reply mscolnick 12 hours agoparentMyles here (other core contributor) - We are thrilled to see you have such a strong positive reaction. It means a lot coming from you - I initially learned web development using Django and landed my first contracting gig with Django. I drifted away from writing Python and towards Typescript - but marimo has brought me back to writing Python. reply mind-blight 10 hours agorootparentCongrats Myles! Super excited that you all have finally open sourced! I'm gonna start moving my Jupyter notebooks over to this asap. I love that it's all just .py files. Have you had anyone use Marimo to write production web app code? I've been doing a lot of AI experiments for the new venture, and it's been a pain to have to switch back and forth between .ipynb files and regular py files reply mscolnick 9 hours agorootparentPeople have used marimo for production web apps. They won't get you as far as writing HTML/JS. But great for internal tools or external showcases, tutorials, interactive blogs, etc. Our friends at SLAC use marimo for their internal exploration experiments and publishing interactive apps.

I'm a big fan of your work, and as I've learnt a lot from reading your blog posts over the years, I'd be curious to know a bit more about typical use cases for wanting to work with Observable notebooks. The only reason why I'm using A JavaScript notebook tool (Starboard.gg) is to be able to access cool visualisation packages like Anychart or Highcharts. Given the hype around Observable notebooks, I feel that I'm missing something. What makes you decide to start something in an Observable notebook rather than in Jupyter? Thanks! reply simonw 8 hours agorootparentI primarily use Observable to build interactive tools, as opposed to Jupyter which I use more for exploratory development and analysis. Here are some of my Observable notebooks which illustrate the kind of things I use it for: https://observablehq.com/@simonw/search-for-faucets-with-cli... https://observablehq.com/@simonw/openai-clip-in-a-browser Those are both from https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings/ https://observablehq.com/@simonw/gpt4all-models provides a readable version of JSON file on GitHub https://observablehq.com/@simonw/blog-to-newsletter is the tool I used to assemble my newsletter A killer feature of Observable notebooks for me is that they provide the shortest possible route from having an idea to having a public URL with a tool that I can bookmark and use later. reply YousefED 2 hours agorootparentCongrats OP on launching this, looking forward to dive further in! It's great to see people experimenting in the Reactive + Live Programming space as like you mention, I think it can bring a lot of improvements to how we build software. Did you run into any limitations adopting this model? > A killer feature of Observable notebooks for me is that they provide the shortest possible route from having an idea to having a public URL with a tool that I can bookmark and use later Thanks for sharing simon! I'm working on an Open Source Notion + Observable combination (https://www.typecell.org), where documents seamlessly mix with code, and can mix with an AI layer (e.g.: https://twitter.com/YousefED/status/1710210240929538447) The code you write is pure Typescript (instead of sth custom like ObservableJS) which opens more paths to interoperability (aside from having a public URL). For example, I'm now working to make the code instantly exportable so you can mix it directly into existing codebases (or deploy on your own hosting / Vercel / whatever you prefer). reply LoulouMonkey 30 minutes agorootparentprevThanks for getting back to me, I'll go through the examples you shared. reply bluish29 14 hours agoprevThat's one interesting project. As someone who relies heavily on collaboration with people using Jupyter Notebook. The most annoying points about reproducing their work are the environment and the hidden state of Jupyter Notebooks. This does to address directly the second problem. It does however by sacrificing flexibility. I might need to change a cell just to test a new thing (without affecting the other cells) but thats a trade off if you focus on reproducibility. I know that requirements.txt is the standard solution to the other problem. But generating and using it is annoying. The command pio freeze will list all the packages in bloated way (there is better ways) but I always hoped to find a notebook system that will integrate this information natively and have a way to embed that into a notebook in a form that I can share with other people. Unfortunately I can't see support for something in any of the available solutions (at least up to my knowledge). reply 331c8c71 29 minutes agoparentNix is the only solution for reproducible environments that I would call rock-solid. It comes with costs and the gpu-related stuff is especially tricky e.g. https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/supporting-gpu-accele... reply akshayka 14 hours agoparentprevYes, the second half of reproducibility is for sure packages. A solution for reproducible environments is on our roadmap (https://marimo-team.notion.site/The-marimo-roadmap-e5460b9f2...), but we haven't quite figured it out yet. It's a bit challenging because Python has so many different solutions for package management. If you have any ideas we'd love to hear them. reply aidos 13 hours agorootparentPeople always complain about pip and python packaging but it’s never been an issue for me. I create a requirements.base.txt that has the versions of things I want installed. I then: pip freeze -r requirements.base.txt > requirements.txt Install is then simply: pip install -r requirements.txt Updating / installing something new is a matter of adding to the base file and then refreezing. reply bluish29 13 hours agorootparentThere are several problems with this approach, notably you don't get information about specific platform stuff. You don't get information on how these package are installed (conda, mamba..etc). And it does not account for dependincies version conflicts which life very hard. reply aidos 13 hours agorootparentI don’t understand the platform thing, is that something to do with running on Windows? Why wouldn’t you just pip install? Why bring conda etc into the mix? If you have conflicts then you have to reconcile those at point of initial install - pip deals with that for you. I’ve never had a situation in 15 years of Python packages where there wasn’t a working combination of versions. These are genuine questions btw. I see these common complaints and wonder how I’ve not ever had issues with it. reply bluish29 12 hours agorootparentI will try to summarize the complaints (mine at least) in obvious simple points 1- pip freeze will miss packages not installed by pip (i.e. Conda). 2- It does include all packages, even not used in the project. 3- It just dumps all packages, their dependencies and sub-dependencies. Even without conflicts, if you happen to change a package, then it is very hard to keep track of dependencies and sub-dependencies that need to be removed. At some point, your file will be a hot mess. 4. If you install specific platform package version then this information will not be tracked reply d0mine 4 minutes agorootparent1/4- Ordinary `pip install` works for binary/platform-specific wheels (e.g., numpy) too and even non-Python utilities (e.g., shellcheck-py) 2/3- you need to track only the direct dependencies _manually_ but for reprodicible deployments you need fixed versions for all dependencies. The latter is easy to generate _automatically_ (`pip freeze`, pip-tools, pipenv/poetry/etc). aidos 12 hours agorootparentprevOk. I think that’s all handled by my workflow, but it does involve taking responsibility for requirements files. If I want to install something, I pip install and then add the explicit version to the base. I can then freeze the current state to requirements to lock in all the sub dependencies. It’s a bit manual (though you only need a couple of cli commands) but it’s simple and robust. reply bluish29 12 hours agorootparentI don't think that manual handling of requirement.txt in a collaborative environment is a robust process. It will be a waste of time and resources to handle it like that. And I don't know about your workflow but it is obviously not standard and it does not address the first and forth points. reply aidos 11 hours agorootparentHaha. Ok. I think that’s where we’re just going to have to agree to disagree. reply paddy_m 10 hours agorootparentprevCan you name a package manager (any language) that handles #3 well? How does it handle the problem? reply ShamelessC 5 hours agorootparentprevYes, there are more problems with Windows. reply bmitc 8 hours agorootparentprevPoetry handles all of this properly. reply 331c8c71 24 minutes agorootparentI regularly observe it stalling at dependency resolution stage upon changing version requirements for one of the packages (or python version requirements). reply ShamelessC 5 hours agorootparentprevJust not PyTorch apparently. reply bluish29 14 hours agorootparentprevThe link redirect does not specify which point in the list you are referring to but I guess it is \"Install missing packages from...\". If so, then I really wonder if you mean supporting something like '!pip install numpy' like Jupyter or something else? I don't think this is really a solution, not to mention that this raise the question. Does it support running shell commands using '!' like Jupyter Notebook? reply akshayka 13 hours agorootparentOh, sorry for not being more clear. That's not the one. It's \"Package management: make notebooks reproducible down to the packages they use\": https://marimo-team.notion.site/840c475fd7ca4e3a8c6f20c86fce... Does that align with what you're talking about? That page has some scrawled brainstormed notes. But we haven't spent time designing a solution yet. reply bluish29 13 hours agorootparentThanks. That is precisely what I was talking about in my comment. It would solve the problem if we have some like that integrated natively. I understand that between pip, conda, mamba and all the others it would be hard problem to solve. But at least auto generating requirements.txt would be easier. But to be honest the hard part is identify packages and where they are from not what to do with information. Good luck with the development. reply Micoloth 11 hours agoprevWow.. Really great work, finally someone is doing it! Since I've thought about this for a long time (I've actually even made a very simplified version last year [1]), I want to contribute a few thoughts: - cool that you have a Vscode extension, but I was a little disappointed that it opens a full browser view instead of using the existing, good Notebook interface of Vscode. (I get you want to show the whole Frontend- But I'd love to be able to run the Reactive Kernel within the full Vscode ecosystem.. Included Github Copilot is cool, but that's not all) - As other comments said, if you want to go for reproducibility, the part about Package Management is very important. And it's also mostly solved, with Poetry etc... - If you want to go for easy deployment of the NB code to Production, another very cool feature would be to extract (as a script) all the code needed to produce a given cell of output! This should be very easy since you already have the DAG.. It actually even existed at some point in VSCode Python extension, then they removed it Again, great job [1] https://github.com/micoloth/vscode-reactive-jupyter reply smacke 10 hours agoparentYou're probably referring to nbgather (https://github.com/microsoft/gather), which shipped with VSCode for a while. nbgather used static slicing to get all the code necessary to reconstruct some cell. I actually worked with Andrew Head (original nbgather author) and Shreya Shankar to implement something similar in ipyflow (but with dynamic slicing and a not-as-nice interface): https://github.com/ipyflow/ipyflow?tab=readme-ov-file#state-... I have no doubt something like this will make its way into marimo's roadmap at some point :) reply wisty 2 hours agoprevCool. On a side note, I think the old Jupytext extension is hugely underrated. It lets Jupyter run a .py file (with markdown notes as comment in the file, displayed as notes in the web page). Both of these solve the most important part of this problems in iPython - horrible git interaction, horrible programming practice to discouraging writing library files, though Jupyter fixes most of the weird non-deterministic behaviour by forcing you to rerun the script every time you load it (rather than reactive techniques). State is OK for power users but it's known to be a massive pain for people who are just learning programming, and an issue in large projects or with interaction. With this new project having reactive updates I think it's definitely going to be great for beginners, or in gnarly projects. I wonder if it runs on pyodide (a cPython compiled to run in the browser, with matplotlib and scipy bundled). reply mvelbaum 1 hour agoprevDoes this allow to run a long running task in the background so that a user can close & reopen the tab and continue seeing all the output that has been produced thus far? This is currently being worked on in Jupyter: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/15448 reply ingenieroariel 6 hours agoprevThe list of dependencies seems very short, apart from tornado it does not seem like the other ones pull in a lot of other deps. Congrats, this looks very useful and awesome. dependencies = [ # cli \"click>=8.0,=5.10.2; python_version =0.18.0\", # compile markdown to html \"markdown>=3.4,=9.0,=2.13,= 0.12.0\", # web server \"tornado>=6.1,=4.4.0; python_version ` and the frontend instantiates it. In the meantime, maybe we can help you port your table widget and make it a marimo plugin. You can reach us in our Discord (https://discord.gg/JE7nhX6mD8) or at Github. 2. marimo was built from scratch, it doesn't depend on Jupyter or IPython at all. 3. marimo doesn't interact with the Jupyter ecosystem. We have brainstormed the possibility of a compatibility layer that allows Jupyter widgets to be used as marimo plugins, but right now that's just an idea. reply petters 2 hours agoprevLooks really impressive! But state is not tracked perfectly. Sometimes you have to manually re-run the cell. For example if one cell defines a dataclass d and another cell changes d.x = \"new value\". Then other cells using d.x will not know that it has changed. reply smacke 12 hours agoprevI'm a big fan of Marimo (and of Akshay and Myles in particular); it's great to finally see a viable competitor to Jupyter as it can only mean good things for the ecosystem of scientific tooling as a whole. reply rossjudson 4 hours agoprevArrggghh. Now I have to learn Python, which I've been actively resisting and making jokes about for years. reply SushiHippie 14 hours agoprevLooks cool! Have you looked into WASM?

We'll definitely take a look. reply SushiHippie 14 hours agorootparentprevPerfect, thank you! reply bitsrat 8 hours agoprevI read in a comment that Marimo is an alternate to Jupyter.

Great work! reply zengid 13 hours agoprevVery cool! This is something Jack Rusher cries for in his talk \"Stop Writing Dead Programs\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ab3ArE8W3s reply JayCeeM 10 hours agoparentAlso from Joel Grus as well \"I don't like notebooks\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U reply hedgehog 14 hours agoprevThis looks quite nice and it might compose well with a cache library like the one posted on HN recently (XetCache, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38696631). reply noahlt 13 hours agoparentYeah, having worked on alternative notebooks before, one of the big implicit features of Jupyter notebooks is that long-running cells (downloading data, training models) don't get spuriously re-run. Having an excellent cache might reduce spurious re-running of cells, but I wonder if it would be sufficient. reply akshayka 13 hours agorootparentWe've thought briefly about cell-level caching; or at least it's a topic that's come up a couple times now with our users. Perhaps we could add it as a configuration option, at the granularity of individual cells. Our users have found that `functools.cache` goes a long way. We also let users disable cells (and their descendants), which can be useful if you're iterating on a cell that's close to the root of your notebook DAG: https://docs.marimo.io/guides/reactivity.html#disabling-cell... reply smacke 12 hours agorootparentipyflow has a %%memoize magic which looks quite similar to %%xetmemo (just without specifying the inputs / outputs explicitly): https://github.com/ipyflow/ipyflow/?tab=readme-ov-file#memoi... Would be cool if we could come up with a standard that works across notebooks / libraries! reply hedgehog 3 hours agorootparentFunction-level caching is the best match for how I'd use it. Often the reason for bothering to cache is that the underlying process is slow, so some kind of future-with-progress wrapper could also be interesting. An example of how that could be used would be wrapping a file transfer so the cell can show progress and then when the result is ready unwrap the value for use in other cells. Or another example would be training in PyTorch, yield progress or stats during the run and then the final run data when complete. reply bsdz 13 hours agoprevThis is a great idea. I'd been planning to create something similar where cells are topologically ordered based on their dependency structure; although I was thinking perhaps to integrate with Jupyter more, eg use their existing kernel web sockets infrastructure. In my mind, one would be able to zoom out and see a graph view where hovering over a node would show its corresponding cell with content / output. Each node might be coloured according to execution status. That said, I'm not a UI expert and I never got around to it. So thanks for your efforts, I'll definitely give it a spin. reply akshayka 12 hours agoparentThat sounds really cool! marimo has a dependency graph viewer built-in, but we could definitely improve it. Coloring nodes by execution status, and annotating cells with their variable defs/refs, would be great quality-of-life improvements. reply exe34 11 hours agoprevThat's amazing! Can I edit it in another editor, save the file and have it updated live in the browser notebook? Or does it have to recompute everything? reply akshayka 10 hours agoparentNot yet, but that's something we do want to support. reply bravura 10 hours agoprevI am most intrigued by the annotation demo you showed, since annotation is painful to set up for small projects. Can you talk about it in more detail? Can I tell who the user is so I can have multiple annotators? Can I use gold data to determine which annotators aren't paying attention? Where do I learn more about how to build this kind of tool? Overall, kudos, I signed up for the waitlist. reply dimatura 13 hours agoprevI already use jupytext to store notebooks as code but the improved state management and notebook-as-app features are pretty compelling and I'm trying it out. Unfortunately, I'm quite used to very specific vim keybindings in Jupyter (https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding) that make it pretty hard to use anything else :/ reply mondrian 13 hours agoprevLooks cool. This is kind of like streamlit, which (I think) tried to escape the limitations of notebooks by giving you an API to quickly make a shareable app with sliders/charts etc. (Yet it retains some notebook concepts like 'cells'). Marimo kind of takes the reactive widgets of streamlit and brings them back into a notebook-like UI, and provides a way to export the notebooks into shareable apps. reply akshayka 13 hours agoparentThanks! One way we differ from streamlit is that ML/data/experimentation work can start in marimo — i.e., you can use marimo for traditional notebooking work, without ever making an app. But you can also use marimo to make shareable apps as you've articulated. reply esafak 12 hours agoprevCould this be used with MDX or something to embed interactive examples in documentation? That is an underserved use case. reply mscolnick 11 hours agoparentIt is not possible at the moment (we use iframes in our documentation), but once we support WASM, it should be possible. reply j0e1 12 hours agoprevThis is a welcome alternative to Jupyter Notebooks/lab- great work! One thing that would be nice is an ability to see previews on GitHub of the Marimo notebook (like Jupyter Notebook).

That's what I'm struggling with -- but I guess the point is you don't read them, you use marimo for that? reply akshayka 11 hours agoparentThanks for the question. Each cell is represented as a function that maps its referenced variables to the variables it defines. Cells are sorted in the order they appear on the notebook page. If you run `marimo tutorial fileformat`, that'll open a tutorial notebook that explains the fileformat in some detail. reply elijahbenizzy 12 hours agoprevYou've built observable but for python.

Jupyter has me taking my hair out a lot of the time. Some completely bizarre design decisions reply yowlingcat 11 hours agoprevThis is very cool. I think I need to play around with this a bit more to wrap my head around the reactivity element, but the basic shift of ipynb to standard Python would be such a huge workflow improvement for my team. We use jupyter notebooks when prototyping and trying to code review unwieldy python-in-JSON is miserable. Great to see an alternative that's worked its way around that. reply warthog 14 hours agoprev [–] Did not work a lot with Jupyter nbs but I think it would be good for you to put more emphasis into Jupyter vs Marimo into your website reply pvg 14 hours agoparentIt's right in the linked FAQ https://docs.marimo.io/faq.html#faq-jupyter reply noahlt 14 hours agorootparentIt's there, but warthog is right, it should be a toplevel section like \"A reactive programming environment\" — yes ideally people would read the description and understand the differences themselves, or consult the FAQ, but the fact is that most people will understand Marimo in relation to Jupyter and so you might as well optimize that path. reply alsodumb 14 hours agoparentprev [–] Copying from a reddit answer by OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/191rdwq/co... marimo solves problems in reproducibility, maintainability, interactivity, reusability, and shareability: *Reproducibility* In Jupyter notebooks, the code you see doesn't necessarily match the outputs on the page or the program state. Some cases in which this can happen: (1) if you delete a cell, its variables stay in memory, which other cells may still reference (2) users can execute cells in arbitrary order. This leads to widespread reproducibility issues. One study analyzed 1 million Jupyter notebooks and found that 36% of them didn't reproduce (https://blog.jetbrains.com/datalore/2020/12/17/we-downloaded...). In contrast, marimo guarantees that your code, outputs, and program state are all synchronized, making your notebooks more reproducible by eliminating hidden state. marimo achieves this by intelligently analyzing your code and understanding the relationships between cells, and automatically re-running cells as needed (sort of like a spreadsheet but better). *Maintainability* marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python programs (.py files). This lets you version them with git; in contrast, Jupyter notebooks are stored as JSON and require extra steps to sensibly version. *Interactivity* marimo notebooks come with UI elements that are automatically synchronized with Python (like sliders, dropdowns) ... scrub a slider and all cells that reference it are automatically re-run with the new value. This is very difficult to get working in Jupyter notebooks. *Reusability* marimo notebooks can be executed as Python scripts from the command-line (since they're stored as .py files). In contrast, this requires extra steps/effort to do for Jupyter, such as copying and pasting the code out or using external frameworks. In the future, we'll also let you import symbols (functions, classes) defined in a marimo notebook into other Python programs/notebooks, something you can't really do with Jupyter. *Shareability* Every marimo notebook can double as an interactive web app, complete with UI elements, which you can serve using our CLI. This isn't possible in Jupyter without substantial extra effort. You might also want to check out Joel Grus' talk on notebooks.

Sam Biddle January 12 2024, 2:07 p.m. DonateOpens in a new tab OpenAI logo displayed on a mobile phone screen in front of computer screen on Sept. 5, 2023 in Ankara, Turkey. Photo: Didem Mente/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images OpenAI this week quietly deleted language expressly prohibiting the use of its technology for military purposes from its usage policy, which seeks to dictate how powerful and immensely popular tools like ChatGPT can be used. Up until January 10, OpenAI’s “usage policies” pageOpens in a new tab included a ban on “activity that has high risk of physical harm, including,” specifically, “weapons development” and “military and warfare.” That plainly worded prohibition against military applications would seemingly rule out any official, and extremely lucrative, use by the Department of Defense or any other state military. The new policyOpens in a new tab retains an injunction not to “use our service to harm yourself or others” and gives “develop or use weapons” as an example, but the blanket ban on “military and warfare” use has vanished. The unannounced redaction is part of a major rewrite of the policy page, which the company said was intended to make the document “clearer” and “more readable,” and which includes many other substantial language and formatting changes. Most Read Coverage of Gaza War in the New York Times and Other Major Newspapers Heavily Favored Israel, Analysis Shows Adam Johnson, Othman Ali 77 Groups Worldwide Back Genocide Lawsuit Against Biden in U.S. Court Prem Thakker Undercover FBI Agents Helped Autistic Teen Plan Trip to Join ISIS Murtaza Hussain “We aimed to create a set of universal principles that are both easy to remember and apply, especially as our tools are now globally used by everyday users who can now also build GPTs,” OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said in an email to The Intercept. “A principle like ‘Don’t harm others’ is broad yet easily grasped and relevant in numerous contexts. Additionally, we specifically cited weapons and injury to others as clear examples.” Felix declined to say whether the vaguer “harm” ban encompassed all military use, writing, “Any use of our technology, including by the military, to ‘[develop] or [use] weapons, [injure] others or [destroy] property, or [engage] in unauthorized activities that violate the security of any service or system,’ is disallowed.” “OpenAI is well aware of the risk and harms that may arise due to the use of their technology and services in military applications,” said Heidy Khlaaf, engineering director at the cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits and an expert on machine learning and autonomous systems safety, citing a 2022 paper Opens in a new tabshe co-authored with OpenAI researchers that specifically flagged the risk of military use. Khlaaf added that the new policy seems to emphasize legality over safety. “There is a distinct difference between the two policies, as the former clearly outlines that weapons development, and military and warfare is disallowed, while the latter emphasizes flexibility and compliance with the law,” she said. “Developing weapons, and carrying out activities related to military and warfare is lawful to various extents. The potential implications for AI safety are significant. Given the well-known instances of bias and hallucination present within Large Language Models (LLMs), and their overall lack of accuracy, their use within military warfare can only lead to imprecise and biased operations that are likely to exacerbate harm and civilian casualties.” The real-world consequences of the policy are unclear. Last year, The Intercept reported that OpenAI was unwilling to say whether it would enforce its own clear “military and warfare” ban in the face of increasing interest from the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence community. “Given the use of AI systems in the targeting of civilians in Gaza, it’s a notable moment to make the decision to remove the words ‘military and warfare’ from OpenAI’s permissible use policy,” said Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute and a former AI policy analyst at the Federal Trade Commission. “The language that is in the policy remains vague and raises questions about how OpenAI intends to approach enforcement.” Join Our Newsletter Original reporting.

I'm in While nothing OpenAI offers today could plausibly be used to directly kill someone, militarily or otherwise — ChatGPT can’t maneuver a drone or fire a missile — any military is in the business of killing, or at least maintaining the capacity to kill. There are any number of killing-adjacent tasks that a LLM like ChatGPT could augment, like writing code or processing procurementOpens in a new tab orders. A review of custom ChatGPT-powered bots offered by OpenAI suggests U.S. military personnel are alreadyOpens in a new tab usingOpens in a new tab the technology to expedite paperwork. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which directly aids U.S. combat efforts, has openly speculated about using ChatGPT to aid its human analystsOpens in a new tab. Even if OpenAI tools were deployed by portions of a military force for purposes that aren’t directly violent, they would still be aiding an institution whose main purpose is lethality. Experts who reviewed the policy changes at The Intercept’s request said OpenAI appears to be silently weakening its stance against doing business with militaries. “I could imagine that the shift away from ‘military and warfare’ to ‘weapons’ leaves open a space for OpenAI to support operational infrastructures as long as the application doesn’t directly involve weapons development narrowly defined,” said Lucy Suchman, professor emerita of anthropology of science and technology at Lancaster University. “Of course, I think the idea that you can contribute to warfighting platforms while claiming not to be involved in the development or use of weapons would be disingenuous, removing the weapon from the sociotechnical system – including command and control infrastructures – of which it’s part.” Suchman, a scholar of artificial intelligence since the 1970s and member of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, added, “It seems plausible that the new policy document evades the question of military contracting and warfighting operations by focusing specifically on weapons.” Suchman and Myers West both pointed to OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, a major defense contractor, which has invested $13 billion in the LLM maker to date and resells the company’s software tools. Related Pentagon’s Budget Is So Bloated That It Needs an AI Program to Navigate It The changes come as militaries around the world are eager to incorporate machine learning techniques to gain an advantage; the Pentagon is still tentatively exploring how it might use ChatGPT or other large-language models, a type of software tool that can rapidly and dextrously generate sophisticated text outputs. LLMs are trained on giant volumes of books, articles, and other web data in order to approximate human responses to user prompts. Though the outputs of an LLM like ChatGPT are often extremely convincing, they are optimized for coherence rather than a firm grasp on reality and often suffer from so-called hallucinations that make accuracy and factuality a problem. Still, the ability of LLMs to quickly ingest text and rapidly output analysis — or at least the simulacrum of analysis — makes them a natural fit for the data-laden Defense Department. While some within U.S. military leadership have expressed concernOpens in a new tab about the tendency of LLMs to insert glaring factual errors or other distortions, as well as security risks that might come with using ChatGPT to analyze classified or otherwise sensitive data, the Pentagon remains generally eager to adopt artificial intelligence tools. In a November address, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks statedOpens in a new tab that AI is “a key part of the comprehensive, warfighter-centric approach to innovation that Secretary [Lloyd] Austin and I have been driving from Day 1,” though she cautioned that most current offerings “aren’t yet technically mature enough to comply with our ethical AI principles.” Last year, Kimberly Sablon, the Pentagon’s principal director for trusted AI and autonomy, toldOpens in a new tab a conference in Hawaii that “[t]here’s a lot of good there in terms of how we can utilize large-language models like [ChatGPT] to disrupt critical functions across the department.” Contact the author: Sam Biddle sam.biddle@theintercept.com +1 978 261 7389 on Signal @sambiddle.bsky.social Opens in a new tab on Bluesky @samfbiddle Opens in a new tab on X Related Pentagon’s Budget Is So Bloated That It Needs an AI Program to Navigate It Can the Pentagon Use ChatGPT?

Impressive that they could get this big this fast and just go full mask off so abruptly. Google made it about 17 years before it removed \"Don't be Evil\".

Ironic that Google unseated Microsoft and now it looks like they will take their throne back. reply glitchc 10 hours agoparentI actually think OpenAI is on an accelerated path because it knows it's days are numbered. If the tech were truly superior, we would see Apple, Google and Meta rushing to license their tech. Yet they're not, instead, they're all building their own version.

As these critical economic infrastructure sites, often strategically located underground, underwater, or in remote-cold locales, play a pivotal role, considerations arise regarding the role of military forces in safeguarding their security. While physical security measures and location obscurity provide some protection, the integration of AI into various aspects of daily life and the pervasive influence of cloud-based technologies on devices, as evident in CES GPT-enabled products, further accentuates the importance of these infrastructure sites. Notably, instances such as the seizure of a college thesis mapping communication lines in the U.S. underscore the sensitivity of disclosing key communications infrastructure. Companies like AWS, running data centers for the Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC), demonstrate close collaboration between private entities and defense agencies. The question remains: are major cloud service providers actively involved in a national security strategy to protect the private internet infrastructure that underpins the global economy, or does the responsibility solely rest with individual companies?

It's inevitable that dangerous real time AI capable of formulating plans are going to be developed for military purposes. The \"OODA Loop\" is fundamental to combat. (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) Having a tighter and more potent (in the sense of fast and accurate processing) OODA loop is a fundamental advantage. The economics and game theory of military combat is going to result in units which have potent OODA loops which can overwhelm a human being's OODA loop. Once that happens, competition between different sides will result in an arms race going far above that level of capability. Once the above happens, it's disturbingly likely that instrumental goals will arise in such entities which are dangerous not only to human beings on the wrong side, but to human beings on any side. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop reply quonn 12 hours agoprevOne problem is that many industry companies (almost anyone doing engines, vehicles, airplanes) is likely to at least do some military products, too. It may be as simple, for example, as wanting to have an LLM assistant in a CAD tool for developing an engine that may get used in a ship, some of which may be military. And the infrastructure and software is often shared or at least developed in order to be applied across the company. I think this is where this is coming from.

They have pretty much replaced guided anti-tank missiles for both sides because of how much cheaper they are, and the ability to easily fly around and hit where the armor is thinnest, or even inside the vehicle, before exploding; they can also fly inside trenches, bunkers, and other emplacementes. DJI FPV ($1k retail) supposedly has about 1 in 3 chance of taking out a moving tank that is not a sitting duck - i.e. hatches closed etc - and does not expose the operator to danger in the process. For comparison, a single Javelin is $240k. FPV drones are cheap enough that they're routinely used even against minor targets such as unarmored small cars and even individual soldiers - even after accounting for failures before a successful hit, it still ends up costing the enemy a lot more in $$$ than was spent on all the drones. reply manquer 9 hours agorootparentThe cost of the drone is not the only cost . You still need tank busting munition and the also crucially internet connectivity starlink provides or satellites provide. Starlink is cheap for its capabilities but it is still startup cost of billions of dollars if you could do it all . reply int_19h 8 hours agorootparentThe tank-busting munitions that they typically use are conventional RPG warheads, as seen in the video I've linked. They work great provided that they hit a weakly armored spot, and they're even cheaper than the drone itself. And no, you don't need Internet connectivity for those things. You need to be within radio range, but this can still mean 1-2 km away easily even on stock equipment, and more with better antennae etc. reply manquer 8 hours agorootparentConventional RPG warheads still cost money, a lot of money if you want them to reliably explode. Javelin has a warhead capacity of 9Kg, for the same bang so to speak ( armor penetration) you would need drones that can hoist 9Kg, those don't retail at anywhere near $1,000. That doesn't mean that cheap drones are not effective means of weapons delivery, they are as this war is showing. They are akin to side arms, when penetration is not a factor they are useful, but they are hardly a replacement for heavy guided munitions like Javelin. Man Pads are by no means perfect, the current gen is 30 years old, they could be made much smarter and lot cheaper than $250,000, however just $1000 drone is not going to replace them yet. reply philwelch 1 hour agorootparentMANPADS means Man-Portable Air Defense System. Javelin is an anti-tank weapon, not an air defense weapon. And the main advantage for Javelin over an FPV drone is that a Javelin is fire-and-forget; you don’t need to steer the missile yourself.

This is about the most normal thing that could have happened in these circumstances. If it matters to you, Congress has already unequivocally signaled unanimous support.

You can sit on your hands but your adversaries might choose differently and that just means you are more likely to loose in case of a conflict. So, yes, that was never going to work. OpenAI might choose to not serve those customers. But that just creates opportunities for other companies to step up and serve those customers. Somebody will do it. And the benefit for OpenAI doing this themselves is a lot of revenue and not helping competitors grow. Doing this on their terms is better than having others do it. I think the sentiments around AI and war are mostly a bit naive. Of course AI is going to be weaponized. A lot of people think that's amoral, not ethical, etc. And they are right. In the wrong hands weapons can do a lot of harm and AI enabled weaponry might be really good at that. Of course, the whole point of war is actually harming the other side any way you can. And usually both sides think they are right and will want the best weapons to do that. So, yes, they'll want AI and are probably willing to spend lots on getting it. And if you think about it, a lot of conflicts are actually needlessly bloody.

But this time the atomic bomb will be able to decide by itself whether to incinerate human race. reply wolverine876 11 hours agorootparentIt's a very different. First, Los Alamos was a project of a democratic government, serving the people of the US and allies. OpenAI is a business that serves itself. During WWII, the US was in an existential war with the Nazis, also trying to develop nuclear weapons. If the Nazis had built it first, we may have been living now in a very dark world. (Obviously, it also helped defeat Japan.) On the other hand, there are threats if an enemy else develops capabilities that provide large advantages. At least part of the answer, I think, is that the US government needs to take over development. It already houses the world's top two, most cutting edge technology organizations - the US military and NASA - and there is plenty more (NIST, NIH, nuclear power, etc.); the idea that somehow it's beyond the US government is a conservative trope and obviously false.

Making one that's _better_ than humans though, that's the tricky part. Another issue is full autonomy: even human soldiers/pilots/etc. are not fully autonomous - they will ask command if there are civilians or friendly units in the AO, as they don't always have enough information to make that decision themselves. To achieve that with machines (not necessarily AI), you either need a fully integrated system (i.e. humans are obsolete for military use), or you need an efficient and functional human-machine interface.

But that takes a lot of effort and manpower. Now take an LLM that you can feed it questions or discussions from sites, have it jump in with what appears to be meaningful content, gets a bunch of \"karma\", then gradually start putting out the propaganda.

There's also something to be said about how the West's reliance on these war games (don't know if AI-powered or not) when preparing for the latest Ukrainian counter-offensive has had disastrous consequences for the actual Ukrainian soldiers on the field, but I don't think that Western military leaders are so honest with themselves anymore in order to acknowledge that (at least between themselves, if not to the public).

    "originLink": "https://filiph.net/text/we-need-technology-that-is-less-immersive,-not-more.html",
    "originBody": "We need technology that is less immersive, not more I love this quote from Ray Bradbury about Edgar Rice Borroughs, the author of Tarzan and John Carter stories: “Edgar Rice Burroughs never would have looked upon himself as a social mover and shaker with social obligations. But as it turns out – and I love to say it because it upsets everyone terribly – Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world. By giving romance and adventure to a whole generation of boys, Burroughs caused them to go out and decide to become special.” The boys who read Borroughs’ A Princess of Mars would grow up to be NASA engineers. Or, at the very least, they'd grow up to be in support of real-world exploration and science. It’s not that Borroughs’ books were particularly scientific. Far from it. But they were exciting and inspiring. I don’t think that the past few generations have anything that quite reaches the influence of these stories. I grew up in the 1990’s, and while I romanticized space flight and advanced science as much as anyone else, my eyes went the widest from video games. Watching Star Trek, or a documentary about an oceanographer was cool, but you know what was cooler? Running around in a virtual environment where I could be a bad ass gun slinger or space marine or whatever, and have my own adventures, on my own terms. Being able to immerse myself into a world that exists to entertain me was — surprise surprise! — preferable to doing almost anything else. I don’t think we talk about this aspect of our era enough. And I believe lots of us have an emotional desire to minimize the negative impact of immersive videogames because it’s our childhood. But in this article, I'd like to posit that having such a different driving force nudges the progress of the whole human race in a direction that we wouldn’t have necessarily chosen if we were to make a rational choice. Allocating talent to the wrong problems Here’s another quote: Many of the most talented artists of our time don’t do any art — they work in advertising. (Unfortunately, I can’t find who said it, which means I’m probably remembering the wording wrong. Consider it a paraphrase.) Now, I’m not going to delve too deep into the particular topic of art and advertising. I do think there’s truth to it, and that maybe some of these people who are currently gainfully employed making ad jingles could be doing something ultimately more important for society — but I mention this quote here for another reason. It’s an example of outside forces nudging people to work on something that is not really that important in the grand scheme of things. Here’s my variant of the quote: Many of the most talented engineers of our time don’t do anything important — instead, they work on making our entertainment more immersive. They work on better 3D renderers, more appealing shaders, faster VR hardware, better spatial sound, more powerful game engines, more immersive games, more colorful phone screens, more eye-catching app animations, etc. Here’s why: They grew up playing immersive 3D video games, and romanticizing that whole industry. It pays. I don’t care how much you’re invested in the VR ecosystem or whatever — I hope you’ll agree that humanity has a variety of important engineering problems to solve, and nicer-looking graphics is quite low on that list. I know there are real-world use cases for better, more immersive rendering or bigger phone screens — but their utility pales in comparison to actual real-world research of actual real-world phenomena, does it not? The gaming industry has hijacked human play. Instead of an evolutionary learning and relaxation tool, it’s so immersive now that people get sucked into spending hundreds of hours playing games that don’t teach them anything valuable about the real world, and don’t relax them at all. I’m a gamer, and I of course enjoy immersing myself in a good AAA video game, but I had to admit to myself at one point that, long-term, playing video games for any extended period makes me physically miserable and dumber. Going less immersive I realize this probably reads as a rant. Please don’t take this as an attack. Instead, I would like for this article to be inspiring. There are so many amazing engineering problems out there. Many of them are more important than what you’re probably working on right now, and yet there are fewer people focusing on them, so there’s less competition, and more opportunity to actually “change the world.” Focusing on such problems probably pays less, but if you’re reading this, chances are you’re not a starving artist. You’re in the tech industry. Even taking a major hit to your salary will still land you way above average. You’ll live. Take it from a guy who left a nice engineering position at Google in Silicon Valley to work as a solo developer in the Czech Republic. Maybe you’re like me, and you've already invested much of your career into graphics and UI programming. Maybe you (like me!) just can’t let go of your childhood dream to make videogame-like experiences. Well, there are still options. You can make apps and videogames that don’t immerse. My first (and quite successful!) “videogame” looks like the Kindle app. My second one looks like a CAD program. There are new opportunities in things like e-Ink or transparent screens or IoT that can help people re-focus on the real world around them yet still reap the benefits of technology. My point is that you have a choice. You can still, of course, choose to push on making our technology as immersive as possible. If you develop your career on autopilot, you will probably end up doing that. But you don’t have to, and maybe you shouldn’t. — Filip Hráček January 2024 Filip is a pro­gram­ming buff with formal train­ing in jour­nal­ism.

Then covid lockdowns hit. I spent a lot of time playing Factorio. When professional sports resumed playing (in empty stadiums, with fake crowd noise on the broadcasts) I was happy to sit on the couch after work and watch baseball. Without that entertainment, there is no way I would have been able to trudge to my computer and work from home day after day, when the only thing I could leave my house for was an occasional walk and a frightful trip to the grocery store. So even if the brain surgeon is not using those \"nicer-looking graphics\" to improve brain surgery (which could very well happen), the brain surgeon might just be looking at \"nicer-looking graphics\" to unwind after a day of brain surgery, which gets her ready for another day of brain surgery.

Any \"need\" for new entertainment exists because new entertainment is being created. If new entertainment stopped being created entirely, my quality of life wouldn't actually drop at all, because there's an astounding quantity & variety of it already, far more than I can engage with in a lifetime even restricting myself to the likely-to-be-very-good stuff.

Nor will having mobile phones with less vibrant colors or application with lower engagement metrics. reply pj_mukh 15 hours agorootparentThere is a tragic flaw in your logic. There’s probably 10x engineers working on advertising then there is gaming (let alone VR). It’s not that big of an industry and doesn’t have the mass adoption attention destroying ad-driven social media does.

To me, the warning is appropriate not based on what hasn't happened yet, but based on what already has. reply pj_mukh 14 hours agorootparentThe warnings started appropriately early in 2011, there should’ve been regulations in place by 2015. VR is still in 2006. Maybe let the first ad run in VR before you ascribe all the same problems to it. reply haswell 14 hours agorootparentWhat is it about VR that makes it meaningfully different enough from the current generation of problematic technology that we don't need to worry about the same problems? This isn't a \"gotcha\" question; I'm genuinely curious. To me, VR is a new interface layer on top of a massive ecosystem, and the same people are building it. The ecosystem is where the problems exist, and VR is just the latest facade through which we interface with that ecosystem. In this framing, it's not ascribing old problems to new technology as much as claiming that the new technology magnifies or intrinsically replicates the existing problems. > The warnings started appropriately early in 2011, there should’ve been regulations in place by 2015 It's 2024 and the regulatory landscape is very poor or nearly nonexistent. Shouldn't this encourage more caution? i.e. we've already proven that looking back and deciding \"oh yeah we should have been more careful\" hasn't actually resolved the issue, and taking the same approach with emerging tech that has similar pitfalls seems doomed to repeat that. I also don't think we had any idea what was coming when we were building the stacks that underlie the current web. We now have much clearer mental models of what the Internet and technology in general is capable of, and the resulting warnings are coming much earlier (appropriately, IMO). reply pj_mukh 13 hours agorootparentSure let’s legislate social media. If the claim is the problems with VR will be the same problems as social media. Let’s legislate social media and that should solve problems in VR as well? As far as it’s just a new facade over social media and the noisy new internet, let’s legislate that. I personally think the larger space of spatial computing (VR, AR etc) presents immense opportunities outside of its ability to just be another vehicle for ads.

If \"will power\" was an unlimited resource everyone could just turn on whenever they desired, then that wouldn't be an issue and I suspect America would be a lot thinner as well. It's a limited resource, and some people have a lot more of it than others. Therefore, some of these new technologies really do need to be regulated, knowing that while we are mental and spiritual beings, we are also biological beings who sometimes don't have the will power to overcome, especially a scientifically verified means of getting around our usual common sense to moderate and balance \"things\" in our lives. reply LiquidSky 15 hours agorootparentprev>Using your neurosurgeon example, I posit that having fewer VR headsets will not prevent the doctor from unwinding.

I agree in the sentiment that we have more important issues than providing ever more entertainment – we had no issues spending our time 50 years ago; Without immersive technologies. Instead of translating the extra resources technology have given to more entertainment, we could have translated it into more free time.

I remember Marc Andreessen's comment near the height of the VR craze of ~2016, about \"reality deserts\". Some segment of the American population lives in an urban area (or suburban area / village with people they actually like), and for them, the idea that people might want to play computer games online instead of hanging out with their friends in person is unfathomable. But not everybody is privileged enough to have that situation. By the numbers, not even a majority of people is privileged enough to have that situation. A lot of people live in suburban boxes, don't have friends, and don't particularly like the people around them.

But for the experts the work may often be boring and repetitive. I am pretty sure most of a surgeon's surgeries are NOT exhilarating experiences for them, but rather routine activities. Similarly for lawyers drafting contracts, software engineers developing web backends, construction workers building houses, or singers singing their repertoire. Not all of these jobs can be automated, so some routine will always exist. reply jyunwai 15 hours agoparentprevI appreciate the comment, especially with the example with the hypothetical brain surgeon. I've also anecdotally known people personally who have become accomplished in academic research, who preferred easy-to-access entertainment to decompress after a difficult day of work. So, work on entertainment does have important value to many people. But at the same time, on a broader point, the author has a compelling general idea that it can be helpful to question how you spend your time away from work. I've spoken with people—and have personally experienced—a satisfaction from physical hobbies outside of computer interaction. Rock climbing is especially popular among the people I know (even those with busy schedules), along with martial arts such as BJJ or judo. I also know a couple people (one personally, and another impersonally through his biography as a novelist named \"What I Talk About When I Talk About Running\") whose life enjoyment is closely tied to their passion for long-distance running. Outside of physical activity, other low-technology ways of entertainment will remain important. Reading books, especially classical ones, can improve one's writing. I've also read about chess players who have attributed their strong ability to plan ahead—in life and martial arts—to their passion for the game. I've additionally known people whose interests in music performance and production led them to develop good friendships with others. Naturally, this can apply to immersive technology: video streaming or high-graphics video games also have the ability to inspire people in their day-to-day life, or help people make meaningful connections. --- My source of skepticism is therefore not with the people working toward on nicer-looking graphics, as highlighted by the author, but rather with the people who apply psychology in video game design to make certain video games addictive—especially those with free-to-play models, which employ gameplay loops to keep people grinding for rewards even when the game stops feeling fun. I think the author is focusing on the wrong part of the industry: certain game designers have had a larger role with making certain video games have negative effects, as evidenced by somewhat-recent successful lawsuits against game companies that employed loot boxes and overly-easy ways to make in-game purchases in certain games targeted toward children. Video games and streaming can absolutely have a healthy place in one's life—especially productions created for the love of the art instead of primarily for the money—but only in moderation and not at the excessive expense of other ways to spend one's free time. Graphics development isn't a problem at all, but I do think many people's lives can become richer if they also give passions that don't require a personal computing device a strong chance. reply Dalewyn 15 hours agoparentprevMore people need to appreciate that video games have been at the core of what drives computing technologies forward. reply aisuujudjdn 11 hours agoparentprevWith all due respect, I think you took the exact opposite lesson from the pandemic that you probably should have and that your story implies. reply brailsafe 11 hours agorootparentWhy is that?

I've been typing since the early 90s, and can type around 120WPM without looking or thinking about it, and it hit me that in a very real sense, the iPad (and other computing devices) are already an extension of me. I've invested the time to integrate this hardware into my brain via the keyboard interface, and once typing is automatic, the friction between brain and machine is very low. I can transmit information from brain to computer and back relatively quickly. The thing about immersive tech is that we're already immersed in tech. The next generation of VR/AR promises to immerse us even more, but I think it's interesting to consider the idea that we're already immersed and don't always realize it. When you start to look at the space around you as an extension of you (and I think there are good reasons to look at it this way - your immediate surroundings are in effect a projection/construct formulated by your brain, and the actions you take within that space modulate your average conscious experience), and when you start to look at the computing devices around you as part of that extension of you, it starts to raise really interesting questions like: If I could implant a chip in my brain, and if people could control my brain with that chip, I would probably never allow it. But when that chip is outside of my brain in a device I keep in my pocket, why am I more willing to allow other entities to feed me stimuli? I tend to agree with the broader idea that we need to be less immersed in tech, if for no other reason to reduce this kind of external control mechanism we've all hooked ourselves in to.

This definition of \"feeding you stimuli\" seems extremely broad to me. Are you \"allowing other entities to feed you stimuli\" when you listen to the radio? When you see signs and billboards on the highway? When you are having a conversation? How could you live your life without allowing other entities to feed you stimuli? How are these examples different from what your phone is doing? (And don't say \"notifications\": you have far more control over which notifications you receive than which billboards you see.)

I'm not seeing the dichotomy here. reply haswell 14 hours agorootparent> This definition of \"feeding you stimuli\" seems extremely broad to me. To rein this in a bit, here's how I'm defining this: regularly \"choosing\" to interact with a library of content and experiences that are all engineered to evoke certain emotional responses from me as the user and get me to buy more things or change my beliefs. I put choosing in quotes because once a habit loop is established, the behavior is indistinguishable from an addiction and the choice is similar to the one made by a gambler sitting at a slot machine. Listening to the radio, watching TV and talking to a friend all provide external stimuli. But clearly there are aspects of each of these interactions that makes them unique. When I'm talking to my friend, I usually don't have to wonder if the things they're saying are only meant to influence my purchasing decisions, or change how I see a political candidate, or support a particular world view, etc. Some friends are good influences. Some bad. If you choose to hang around the stoner who always wears you down and gets you to smoke a joint, that particular friend might not be a good influence. > How could you live your life without allowing other entities to feed you stimuli? I'm not suggesting that this is possible or even desired. I'm suggesting that there are certain sources of stimuli that we deem unacceptable that are strikingly similar to stimuli that we deem acceptable and that it's not clear why we categorize them so differently. In other words: If you would say \"hell no\" to a physically connected chip that feeds your brain ads for products you don't need every hour, why would you not say \"hell no\" to a device that could do the same thing without even needing a physically connected chip? (I'm saying this as a person who carries one of those devices, so I'm not a Luddite or claiming to have avoided anything). > How are these examples different from what your phone is doing? There are a myriad of differences, but I think they boil down to these key things: Ubiquity, Tracking and Personalization. Billboards (which are ugly and often the source of controversy in communities) do not know who you are, and they are not in your pocket every minute of the day. They don't insert themselves into the middle of your interactions with friends, or follow you home. > And don't say \"notifications\": you have far more control over which notifications you receive than which billboards you see. I disagree with the premise of this objection, but notifications are only a small part of this. Most people don't turn notifications off, and app makes know this. There is a finite number of billboards you can fit on any given stretch of road, and there is an infinite number of notifications you can be subject to regardless of where you are on any given day. Yes, you can disable notifications, and I think this is one of the simplest things people can do to interrupt the addiction loop. But many of the most popular apps carefully construct notifications that get you into the app for plausible reasons (comments on your post!) so they can then feed you the algorithmic payload. > If I could implant a chip in my brain that allowed me to tune into any radio station I wanted and listen to it in my brain, I'd probably do that, assuming it's safe and actually under my control. I'm not seeing the dichotomy here. I think that \"assuming it's safe and actually under my control\" is exactly where the radio and social media examples diverge. The point is that much of the content on social media is not safe, and you have less and less choice about what you actually see. With radio, you probably wouldn't choose to listen to the channel that airs Rush Limbaugh 24/7. With algorithmic feeds, you don't really get to choose what you see. reply 0xfffafaCrash 15 hours agoparentprevFor anyone more interested in this general topic, in philosophy of mind, this is referred to as “the extended mind” using the terminology of Andy Clark and David Chalmers in their famous 1998 paper of the same name. reply em-bee 16 hours agoparentprevthat's a great point. i guess i can say the same about how i interact with my computer, but for me there is a different quality to it. while the computer and phone and various messaging apps or forums like hackernews are often my only social interaction, so i spend a lot of time on that in search for someone to connect to, i also have all notifications off on all devices, and i expressly do not allow other entities to feed me stimuli when they deem it fit, to the point that you can't even call me because i won't hear the phone ring. i want to be in control. there is of course a balance to it. not getting notifications means i spend more time checking for new messages than i would if notifications were on, but at the same time i also forget to check for messages when i am actually focused on something, which i think is the more important aspect of it. so i am immersed with my tools only as an extension of my self, controlling the tools to do what i want them to do without giving up any of that control to anyone else.

Our social media profiles, our timelines, photos, and digital content, become part of our selves, and we begin to identify with these time capsules we've created of ourselves, to the point where we _are_ the person in the photo, we _are_ that person on Facebook. It's a fundamentally backwards-facing view of the self that relies on historical or past depictions of an individual in order to define their current self-concept. It implies an immutability, a static, unchanging quality to the person, since after all - there \"you\" are, or at least all your photos and your memorabilia, your self-depictions and simulacra, committed to and preserved in the permanent record of the cloud. It's also one that emphasizes the importance of external markers and signals of identity - only those that can be extraverted - to the detriment of the inner life of the psyche, the private life of the mind which is not so readily available for examination or expression. This way of looking of ourselves through a digital black mirror continues to uphold the illusion of permanence; our self is like a river, and we never step in the same one twice - unless we freeze the river (in time) and post it to Instagram. Not to mention all the vanity and superficiality of Photoshop, filters, r/instagramreality, etc etc... points which have all been discussed ad nauseam. Moreover there is the slow death of the literary personality - of one who, in times where media and bandwidth were not of sufficient capacity to generate and retain all these audiovisual representations of our selves, was primarily known through their words and their writing. This is a fundamentally different way of trying to understand one's character that requires much more participation on the audience's behalf to fill in the gaps - the gaps that can't be immediately filled in with high definition video. It becomes harder for one to be identified through their words, and more and more preferable to identify someone by what they look or sound like; another step in the long, slow march away from literacy and to other forms of information exchange. In this regard I'm reminded of David Foster Wallace uncut television interview [0], which I found incredibly fascinating - here was one of the most articulate men in society, celebrated for his literary works, appearing awkwardly and shyly on camera, sometimes meandering off on tangents in the discussion, sometimes \"pontificating\" on the interviewer's questions - how does DFW's audiovisual representation compare to his literary output?

I believe this has been true throughout human history. The greatest artists and thinkers throughout history have earned their keep by providing services to the wealthy or teaching paying students (also often wealthy). There are upsides, the artists get to eat but they also have all the benefits of being connected to their employer/patron including time spent practicing their craft. If they were to quit and focus on pure art then they would likely earn far, far less and possibly spend less time making any kind of art commercial or not. It reminds me of this survey that made the front page not long ago about author's that contained this illuminating paragraph: > While 80% of respondents considered themselves to be professional authors, only 35% said they were full-time authors while 53% said they were part-time authors (with the balance being one-book authors or undecided). The primary writing occupation of part-time authors outside of publishing books was professor/academic (8.5%), followed by book illustrator/author (4.2%), editor (2.9%), poet (2.4%), journalist (2%), teacher (2%), and entrepreneur (1.5%). So even people who consider themselves professional authors are unable to work at it full time. It makes sense, there's only so much one person can produce and it's quite difficult to find an audience willing to pay for what you make.

A model that \"advertising works because in the aggregate, it alters buying decisions and leads to more spending being directed to the advertiser\" is very actionable: it tells you exactly where the money is, why it is being spent, and then gives you leads to areas you might want to study (eg. human psychology and perception, owning a channel, producing content at scale) to make you better at influencing those money flows. A model that \"the modern advertising industry is better classed as a result of large-scale structures and societal-scale rules\" may be true, but it's pretty useless.

I don't have an issue at all with directed activities being deeply immersive - games most specifically. That is, I like the idea of putting on a headset for a half hour and playing a game, then doing something else. What I think is much more destructive is when \"immersion\" just looks like \"constant distraction\", i.e. the idea that we'll wear these immersive devices all the time so we can be bombarded with \"helpful\" notifications and, oh look, in-context advertising! That is, when I want to relax I want to relax, and I don't think something holodeck-like is bad for that. But when I want to focus I want to focus, and strapping a headset onto my face for extended periods is not going to help that situation in any way. reply ElevenLathe 16 hours agoparentThere are a few (TNG and Voyager for sure, maybe DS9 too) Star Trek stories that deal a bit with holodeck addiction (\"holo-addiction\"), and I think something at that level of immersion would absolutely cause lots of people to completely withdraw from society, especially if (real world) society is bleak (Ready Player One deals with this aspect of it). I already know 30-something childless adults who spend effectively every non-working moment in some virtual world -- these people are effectively already holo-addicted. It will only get worse if these environments are more able to block out reality. To me the sad thing about my friends in this situation is that they usually aren't in some swashbuckling fantasy epic starring them, but grinding Runescape/WoW/Eve/etc., performing the same repetitive actions over and over, with the occasional burst of actually interesting interaction or story.

This really started for me in two places: the newer one was when I pitched to the department of education for a grant program a software I called Meta-Education Environment for Simulation and Gaming (MEESG), aimed particularly at assisting in training of high-risk vocations (such as high voltage-systems repair)... but after I thought about it, I realized that the earlier inspiration was the VBS simulation I trained in the military and how I noticed the benefits directly (later leading to many hours of Arma2/Arma3 playtime, the civilian version of VBS). So the main fight I see in the future is those who think (similar to the article) all this immersion effort is vapid and superficial. I don't think it is, and for more than just training, but also for rapid iteration in a simulated physical space that doesn't waste actual physical resources until a better product is developed. Ergo, I feel there is hidden value in the virtual space yet untapped in the wider market for combining fun and relaxation with teaching valuable things about the real world. Just for example, I have been adding my local flora/fauna and edibility properties and medicial properties to one of my gameworlds recently, which could help me accelerate my learning of that particular real world thing but also make the gameworld more fun and interactive. reply Nav_Panel 14 hours agoprevReminds me of: > A very common practice in videogames is to make your game visually immersive—that is to say, to visually portray the game’s elements in such a way that makes the player, to some extent, feel like they’re “really there.” The most obvious way this is employed is via a firstperson point-of-view camera, as seen in titles like Counter-Strike or Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. In these titles—especially in the highly fantasy-simulation-dependent Skyrim—part of the idea is to “immerse” the player in the world. > The problem is, this isn’t where “immersion” really comes from. Ever notice how people get incredibly immersed in a great novel? What could be further away from the literal, realistic portrayal of reality that Skyrim brings than a set of glyphs in black and white printed on dead trees? And yet novels routinely engage people to the point where they are completely and utterly immersed. > The myth is that immersion comes from visual/auditory messages, but the problem is the human mind wanders quickly. We’re curious and inquisitive and while a picture-perfect image might in fact immerse us for a moment, if there isn’t an engaging system there for us to keep us immersed, we’ll quickly snap out of it and remember that we’re just tinkering with some computer program. > The thing that engages people in interactive systems is actually quality interaction—for games, this means interesting, difficult and meaningful decisions as frequently as possible.

There's obviously other ascii based games similar to CDDA, but there's so much detail in the mechanics, so much you can do to affect yourself and the world in a meaningful way, and open-ended lore to spark the imagination, that it ends up being way more immersive than similar games.

The production of these spacecraft is very low volume, and therefore very expensive. Research into new lithography techniques for longer-lasting battery-powered consumer devices led to low-power electronics that allow the spacecraft I make to have greater processing power for a given energy budget. Advancements in more powerful graphics chips for gaming have led to affordable (and yes, despite what you think they are affordable) GPUs used to process and rasterize the data the satellites I build gather. Unreal Engine is used to build tools needed visualize the results.

So yeah, Burroughs is a rough reference to lead with. reply em-bee 15 hours agoprevas others have already suggested, i think the contrast of immersion vs no immersion is not really the issue (only as much as immersion helps people get addicted to games). the focus on entertainment and making a profit vs doing something to advance society is. immersive games are fine. games aren't failing to teach anything or help you relax because they are immersive. they are not teaching anything because they don't have a good story that would teach something, and they don't let you relax because specific game elements are putting you under stress. to give two examples: i play elite dangerous. i can travel through space with a VR headset and i trade items between various space stations. very immersive and quite relaxing, until pirates come along and want to steal my cargo. that's stressful. and i wish i could turn that off. likewise i may play some puzzle game, that is not immersive at all, and that could be relaxing if the gamedesigner hadn't added a timer that forces me to complete the puzzle in a certain time. that's stressful. so i don't think immersion has any impact here, other than immersive games are just more attractive. both are a waste of time however if they are not educational or relaxing. but now this issue of entertainment vs advancing society is a problem of the whole entertainment industry. very little content produced is entertaining as well as teaching something. and so for me the question is not about how immersive the games are but how educational. i believe it is quite possible to create fully immersive but educational games. looking back at elite dangerous again, for example, the universe in that game is modeled after our actual galaxy. where possible, stars are named by their actual astronomical names, and their looks are designed after what we know about them and i can take a star system in the game and look up its name on eg wikipedia and learn real facts about it. compare that to eve online where the universe is completely fictional. in elite dangerous i can fly around and get a sense of the relative distances of say alpha centauri vs the north pole star or of the position of our solar system vs the rest of the galaxy. (assuming that it is all accurate) immersive and educational and relaxing (as long as i can avoid pirates) reply htk 14 hours agoprevnext [–]There's always someone complaining about good things being too good and people lose on the rest because of it.

They can't all work on the same thing. And the majority of people who are not engineers and who just work regular mindless jobs need entertainment. Also we've had entertainment since the dawn of time. People don't just go home and stare at the wall for sixteen hours before going back to work. Almost none are going home from work to solve humanity's Real Problems(tm). Entertainment holds significant value to everyone plus or minus a few percent. But really the author has a critique of capitalism and doesn't want to admit it. The complaint is that art is a product you're expected to pay for and consume, and individual artists almost can't even exist without spending all their time advertising. Imagine how much art would be produced if artists weren't forced to choose between making art and paying rent. All in all, the author is yelling at clouds because other people have values he disagrees with and refuses to understand reply tyfighter 15 hours agoparentOf course they realize that, because that's not what the article is about. The problem being described is that the distribution of talent/intelligence across the problems civilization is facing is uneven. The author's perspective is that individual interests and pay/profit incentives bias the distribution towards fun boom/bust industries (e.g. video games/VR/entertainment), and more critical industries may be losing out on this talent as a result. These are problems that capitalism can't naturally solve, because not every problem needing to be solved can be crafted into profit driven market.

    "originBody": "A decade long Steam issue, is everyone just too fast for Valve? Posted Jan 12, 2024 2FAST4VALVE By freudenjmp 26 min read Valve has shown to occasionally not act on community feedback and bug reports. A story about a decade old bug. tl;dr To fix the infamous No user logon issue in Counter-Strike that exists for over a decade, here are a few popular mitigations that do absolutely jack shit to fix the root cause. If you found this article via Google: STOP, DO NOT DO THIS! Reinstall the game Validate the game files Restart Steam Restart your computer Disable WiFi To learn what to do instead, read this article. Introduction (You can skip to No user logon if you don’t care about the history.) Counter-Strike is a famous game developed by Valve. Recently, Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) has been published and replaced (!) its predecessor Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). Some people tend to not consider CS2 a game but one big bug. While this is maybe a bit harsh, it’s not far from the truth: You could teleport yourself to any location on the map You could overcome physical limitations You could abuse a bug to inject code to other players You could be banned by specific settings in your AMD graphics driver or by playing on Windows 7 Countless other bugs that are small in itself but are causing bad gaming experience when combined Be prepared for new bugs appearing, as Valve didn’t manage to include CS2 in Valves HackerOne bug bounty program. cs2.exe is not in scope and the only (outdated) mention of CS2 is inside their description. This means that Valve is not paying for bug reports related to CS2. Effective 6/14/2023 10 AM PDT, CS:GO is out-of-scope for new reports. Reports for CS2 Limited Test are currently out-of-scope. However, this of course didn’t stop us from reporting bugs to Valve via e-mail. I hope you are not surprised to learn that these bugs haven’t been fixed nor did they bother to reply. We have at least one critical zero-day that compromises the competitive integrity of the game which is yet under the industry-standard 90-day responsible disclosure time frame. Notable is that CS2 replaced CS:GO on September 27, 2023, which is a novum. This means CS:GO can’t be played anymore by the average user. Such a hard cutoff date is a new level of “forcing things on the community they maybe don’t like”. Gamers and platforms such as my employer Esportal were suddenly forced to use CS2. It’s not as if I never worked around bugs or needed to fix them on my own in CS:S or CS:GO. It is fine to a degree and expected as no software is bug free. But the amount of bugs in CS2 sets a new standard in a negative way. Especially bugs that are only relevant to community servers which Valve cares even less about. Since middle of 2023, when CS2 release was apparent and we started to prepare support for it on Esportal, my working days look like this: journey section My working day before it even starts at 9 AM Enthusiastic to build new features: 7 Read Slack notifications: 5 Asked to fix yet another CS2 bug: 3 Realizing the bug is 10 years old: 1 My working day before it even starts at 9 AM Enthusiastic to build new features Read Slack notifications Asked to fix yet another CS2 bug Realizing the bug is 10 years old No user logon Bugs that are reported by the community for years and years are still not fixed and are now in CS2. One of these bugs is the infamous No user logon disconnection happening randomly while you are happily playing: The infamous “No user logon” disconnection mid-game For years (2008, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2017, 2018, 2021, 2023, 2023) people around the world have been reporting this issue in multiple forums including the official support forum from Valve. Note that from a technical perspective No user logon and the sometimes mentioned No steam logon are likely just different names for the same root cause. I can’t know for sure but it would make sense. There are countless proposed fixes to the issue: Fix: “No user logon” Error in CSGO using these 5 Solutions Fix CSGO No User Logon Error- 9 Fixes CSGO No user logon error fix How To Fix CSGO No User Logon Error [Updated 2023] Spoiler: None of these proposed fixes actually fix the issue. They are just randomly stopping the root cause from kicking in by pure coincidence. pie title Fixing \"No user logon\" \"Think they fixed it\" : 100 \"Actually fixed it\" : 0 100% 0% Fixing \"No user logon\" Think they fixed it Actually fixed it Esportal specific We were facing this issue on Esportal as well throughout the years. While the problem was not significant usually it was a constant companion that cost us several days to debug and mitigate it if one counts all the efforts made in the past. Yet we never really fixed the problem and only were able to mitigate so it does not happen often. CS:GO: (all times CET) First occurrence: 2019-11-15 19:15:32 (start of data information) Last occurrence: 2023-09-26 21:38:01 (the day before the CS:GO got replaced by CS2) In CS2 we were quite happy as apparently the issues was gone. We didn’t see any reports from our users and we didn’t see any occurrences in our logs. We were happy until the first week of January 2024 when we observed an increase of user reports related to this issue compared to all reports: xychart-beta title \"Relative amount of 'No user logon' tickets\" x-axis [30.12., 31.12., 01.01., 02.01., 03.01., 04.01., 05.01., 06.01., 07.01., 08.01., 09.01.] y-axis \"Share of daily tickets (in %)\" 0 --> 23 bar [0.5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 10, 18, 18, 23, 10, 9] Relative amount of 'No user logon' tickets 30.12. 31.12. 01.01. 02.01. 03.01. 04.01. 05.01. 06.01. 07.01. 08.01. 09.01. 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Share of daily tickets (in %) This is significant, I started to investigate. Coincidentally, these are the time of the day when we received the reports: CS2: (all times CET) First occurrence: 2023-12-30 19:45:15 (and the only one that day) 2023-12-31: no reports 2024-01-01: no reports 2024-01-02: no reports 2024-01-03: 15:19:30 - 15:38:26 2024-01-04: 14:27:12 - 15:57:24 2024-01-05: 14:00:57 - 17:13:36 2024-01-06: 13:01:55 - 17:35:12 2024-01-07: 12:56:30 - 17:44:09 2024-01-08: 14:15:06 - 16:41:57 My colleague connected the dots and wrote in Slack: ~13-17 PM CET is 04-08 AM in Washington (where Valve is operating from), maybe they are running some kind of routine during their night — Jane Doe, Jan 8th, 2024, colorized Previously the reported issues were evenly distributed throughout the day. Now they are concentrated in a specific time frame. We could confirm that players world wide are facing the issue outside of Esportal and thought it indeed is caused by some maintenance in the middle of the night in Washington. Though I was thinking “I looked into this bug a hundred times already without a meaningful result” we were now incentivized to fix it once and for all given the significance of the problem and the volume of tickets. The symptoms The observed No user logon errors happened 2-3 minutes after the player connected to the game. It was interesting to know, as this time span was pretty constant. Luckily, a colleague mentioned, without knowing what important information they were sitting on at that time: I don’t see my skins in CS2 until some minutes into the game. Indeed, players outside of Esportal reported missing skins as well. My colleague incepting an idea into my head without them knowing. Boom! Was this the missing piece of the puzzle? The one information that was required to connect the dots which wasn’t apparent for years? I felt like I was in the movie Inception and my colleague being Leonardo DiCaprio incepting an idea into my head. It is well-known that Valve is sensitive when it comes to skins in their games. They make substantial amount of money with skins. So what if individual skins are not shown until maybe, just maybe, the player owning the skin has been properly authorized by Steam? This would make sure people can’t spoof their identity on the gameserver and use skins they don’t own. Validation of the hypothesis I picked a random match where a report came in. Matches are played 5vs5, so 10 players connect to a gameserver in total. Looking at the gameserver logs and applying proper filtering I was able to immediately see something that supports the hypothesis: STEAM USERID validated for a given user who didn’t have issues with No user logon appeared roughly 1min20s after the user connected. Example with user Alice: 1 2 3 16:39:55: \"Alice\" connected 16:41:14: \"Alice\" STEAM USERID validated 17:17:32: \"Alice\" disconnected (reason \"NETWORK_DISCONNECT_DISCONNECT_BY_USER\") In older logs before 3rd of January the Steam validation always finished within 2-3 seconds after connection instead. I tested myself and indeed: missing skins were only a thing during night time in Washington. I was able to reproduce the issue by connecting to a gameserver at 5 AM Washington time. I was not able to reproduce the issue during the Washington daytime. Hypothesis that No user logon and no skins are connected is now confirmed. NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON Now it is apparent this issue has something to do with Steam validation. But what exactly is the bug? Coming back to the logs of the match I picked I now looked at user Bob who reported No user logon issues: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 16:40:03: \"Bob\" connected 16:40:08: \"Bob\" disconnected (reason \"NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN\") 16:40:13: \"Bob\" connected 16:43:02: STEAMAUTH: Client Bob received failure code 8 16:43:02: \"Bob\" disconnected (reason \"NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON\") 16:43:53: \"Bob\" connected 16:43:58: \"Bob\" disconnected (reason \"NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN\") 16:44:04: \"Bob\" connected 16:46:59: STEAMAUTH: Client Bob received failure code 8 16:46:59: \"Bob\" disconnected (reason \"NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON\") 16:47:38: \"Bob\" connected 16:49:09: \"Bob\" STEAM USERID validated 17:17:32: \"Bob\" disconnected (reason \"NETWORK_DISCONNECT_EXITING\") It is apparent it took 9 minutes for this user to get into the match until they received STEAM USERID validated. After the match ended, the disconnect reason is NETWORK_DISCONNECT_EXITING. It’s an internal identifiers of the Source 2 engine which CS2 is using. The prefix NETWORK_DISCONNECT_ is used to separate these identifiers from others in the engine. NETWORK_DISCONNECT_EXITING is a valid disconnect reason tells us the user closed their CS2 game while being connected to the gameserver. Another natural reason would be NETWORK_DISCONNECT_DISCONNECT_BY_USER which means the user disconnected from the gameserver by themselves without closing their CS2 game. Looking at the events before the Steam validation was successful, four disconnections are apparent with two different reasons: NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON I can reasonably assume the message No user logon is the human translation of the identifier NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON, so I started looking into this first. Interesting is that NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON is an immediate consequence of STEAMAUTH: Client Bob received failure code 8. What does it mean though? To find out, I searched for the string STEAMAUTH: in the binary file that is providing the core of the Source 2 engine, libengine2.so: 1 2 $ grep -a \"STEAMAUTH:\" engine2.so -insecure-insecure_forced_by_launchersystem/networkSTEAMAUTH: Client %s received failure code %d The last part of the match is interesting: STEAMAUTH: Client %s received failure code %d. As I confirmed this string is in libengine2.dll, I opened the file in a reverse engineering tool, searched for the same string again and found the function which is referencing the string. This helps me to understand the context of the string and what it is used for. A little trick that comes handy when looking at Counter-Strike is the CS:GO source code leak. The same string appears in the file sv_steamauth.cpp on line 792. Utilizing a decompiler I was able to get pseudo C code that reflects what the function is doing in CS2. Combining the information from the source code leak and the reverse engineering tool I was able to understand the context of the string and what it is used for. The functions look nearly identical in both versions of Counter-Strike, but not 100%. Here is what the properly readable code for CS2 looks like: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 void CSteam3Server::OnValidateAuthTicketResponseHelper(CSteam3Server* pThis, CBaseClient *cl, EAuthSessionResponse eAuthSessionResponse) { Warning(\"STEAMAUTH: Client %s received failure code %d\", cl->GetClientName(), eAuthSessionResponse); g_Log.Printf(\"STEAMAUTH: Client %s received failure code %d\", cl->GetClientName(), eAuthSessionResponse); switch (eAuthSessionResponse) { case 1: // k_EAuthSessionResponseUserNotConnectedToSteam if (!client[2506]) cl->Disconnect(NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON); break; case 2: // k_EAuthSessionResponseNoLicenseOrExpired cl->Disconnect(NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_OWNERSHIP); break; case 3: // k_EAuthSessionResponseVACBanned case 9: // k_EAuthSessionResponsePublisherIssuedBan if (!BLanOnly()) cl->Disconnect(NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_VACBANSTATE); break; case 4: // k_EAuthSessionResponseLoggedInElseWhere if (!client[2506] && !BLanOnly()) cl->Disconnect(NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGGED_IN_ELSEWHERE); break; case 5: // k_EAuthSessionResponseVACCheckTimedOut cl->Disconnect(NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_VAC_CHECK_TIMEDOUT); break; case 6: // k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketCanceled if (!BLanOnly()) sub_2F3900(client); break; case 7: // k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketInvalidAlreadyUsed case 8: // k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketInvalid if (!BLanOnly()) cl->Disconnect(NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON); break; default: cl->Disconnect(NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_DROPPED); break; } } Leaving other cases aside as I am only interested in failure code 8 at the moment, this function disconnects the user from the gameserver with the beloved NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON reason. It happens when something called CSteamServer3 tells us that the eAuthSessionResponse is one of: k_EAuthSessionResponseUserNotConnectedToSteam (maps to 1) k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketInvalidAlreadyUsed (maps to 7) k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketInvalid (maps to 8) Steam3 validation: So… what is CSteamServer3? I don’t know for sure but I can deduce from what I learned looking at the leaked CS:GO source code. Saving you from following me through the jungle of C++ classes and functions, here is what I found out as diagram followed by a textual explanation: sequenceDiagram box User computer participant CS2.exe end box Internet participant Gameserver participant Steam3 server end CS2.exe->>Gameserver: Connect with untrusted Steam ID Gameserver->>Steam3 server: Is that Steam ID valid? Note over CS2.exe: Can continue playing while the validationwith Steam3 is pending alt Steam3 server->>Gameserver: yes Gameserver->>CS2.exe: Assign skins, trust user else Steam3 server->>Gameserver: no Gameserver->>CS2.exe: Disconnect with \"No user logon\" end Internet User computer Steam3 server Gameserver CS2.exe Steam3 server Gameserver CS2.exe Can continue playing while the validation with Steam3 is pending alt Connect with untrusted Steam ID Is that Steam ID valid? yes Assign skins, trust user no Disconnect with \"No user logon\" Steam3 server is likely responsible for authenticating users. It is not the same as the Steam client that you are using to play games. It is also not the same as the Steam servers that are responsible for matchmaking and other things. It is a separate thing. Think: it makes sure to proof that you are who you are claiming to be and that you own the game you are trying to play. When connecting to a gameserver, your game (CS2.exe) tells the gameserver what your Steam ID is. As you could be a bad person, you could modify the game and tell the gameserver that your Steam ID is STEAM_0:0:0 instead. That would be the Steam ID of the first Steam account ever created. The gameserver has no way to know at this point whether your information is correct or not. This is where the Steam3 server comes into play. The gameserver asks the Steam3 server if the Steam ID is valid and whether you own the game. Note that while the gameserver is waiting for the response, you can continually playing normally on the gameserver, but without skins. If the Steam3 server says yes, the gameserver starts trusting that information. It can now do interesting stuff with it, like starting to assign your personal skins to you. This would be the moment where you and others can see your skins. And now we know what is likely happening in Washington at night between 4 and 8 AM: the Steam3 server is doing maintenance or is very slow to respond for other reasons. As we learned, that “slowness” is currently roughly 1min20s. If the Steam3 server says no instead, the gameserver knows that you (or your game) is lying and disconnects you with NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON. Looking at the logs from the match, the disconnect happens 2min50s seconds after the user connected to the gameserver. This is why users report the No user logon message appears after 2-3 minutes. This is a reasonable timeframe because in networks it’s always a good idea to have enough leeway for possible issues. It’s better to wait a bit longer than to disconnect too early. Making it trustable The above scenario is not fully complete, though. It imposes one problem: it only guarantees that the Steam ID told to the gameserver is valid and owns the game. It does not proof that the instance of CS2.exe that connected to the gameserver is actually the one belonging to the signed in Steam account running on the same machine via Steam.exe. So what is needed is a way to proof that CS2.exe is actually trustable. This can be achieved by ensuring that CS2.exe can initiate a connection to Steam3 via Steam.exe running on the same machine. As Steam.exe as the Steam client knows the account which is currently signed in, it compares the Steam ID sent by CS2.exe to it. If they match, Steam.exe tells the Steam3 server that the Steam ID is valid for CS2.exe. If it can’t match them, it doesn’t tell the Steam3 server about it. sequenceDiagram box User computer participant Steam.exe participant CS2.exe end box Internet participant Gameserver participant Steam3 server end CS2.exe-->>+Steam.exe: Connect with untrusted Steam ID Note over Steam.exe: Confirms that Steam IDsent by CS2.exe is thesame as the currentlysigned in Steam account Steam.exe-->>-Steam3 server: Temporarily store info that Steam ID is valid for game CS2 CS2.exe->>Gameserver: Connect with untrusted Steam ID Gameserver->>Steam3 server: Is that Steam ID valid?

Deducing from above, it can be reasonably assumed that the answer k_EAuthSessionResponseAuthTicketInvalid (which maps to 8) is the one we see in the logs for a failed Steam3 validation: STEAMAUTH: Client Bob received failure code 8. Reasons why Steam3 server could answer no are for example: Steam3 is broken and answers wrong things: unlikely, even Valve can be trusted to get this right Steam3 server is under maintenance: unlikely, as other users can connect The Steam ID is not valid: unlikely, usually our players are trustworthy The Steam ID is valid but the instance of CS2.exe is not trustable: likely Steam3 server doesn’t know about the Steam ID for this CS2.exe instance: likely Aha! The last two points are likely candidates for the issue. But why do some users have problems with untrusted CS2.exe instances while other users are fine? And why was it possible that user Bob was able to validate their Steam ID after 9 minutes? NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN The other disconnect reason NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN is still unclear. It’s appearing first and then the user connects again, eventually getting disconnected with NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON. 1 2 3 4 5 16:40:03: \"Bob\" connected 16:40:08: \"Bob\" disconnected (reason \"NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN\") 16:40:13: \"Bob\" connected 16:43:02: STEAMAUTH: Client Bob received failure code 8 16:43:02: \"Bob\" disconnected (reason \"NETWORK_DISCONNECT_STEAM_LOGON\") It seems like the gameserver disconnects the user with NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN. Then the game connects itself again. This is a feature of the game and it happens automatically after 5 seconds to retry the connection, hence the multiple connection attempts visible in the gameserver logs. Again: why are some users getting disconnected with NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN while others aren’t? Loops in the Source engine A loop in terms of software engineering is something that is executed until a specific goal is reached. The Source engine has one active loop at a time. When CS2.exe starts, it is started with an active loop. A loop processes things in the background, waits until they are finished and once they are finished, invokes the next loop. A loop can run for a very long time, for example the game loop runs as long as you are playing. A loop can be shutdown in case something goes wrong. In this example, a the levelload_loop is executed until the level, materials and physics engine are loaded. Once they are loaded, the levelload_loop is considered finished and it executes the game_loop: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 void levelload_loop() { bool loop_done = false; start_load_of_level_in_background(); start_load_of_materials_in_background(); start_load_of_physics_engine_in_background(); while (!loop_done) { process_user_input_like_mouse_and_keyboard(); draw_user_interface_to_screen(); if (level_loaded && materials_loaded && physics_engine_loaded) { loop_done = true; } } game_loop(); } A valid shutdown reason for this loop would be missing material required for the level. The disconnection So if a loop can be shutdown, and the disconnect reason is NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN… Yes, I hear you thinking. This means that the first disconnection is initiated by CS2.exe because some loop is shutdown. The user is not disconnected by the gameserver, but by themselves. No wonder the root cause hasn’t been found in so many years: it’s not a bug in the gameserver, it’s a bug in the game. Me at that very moment: the famous “WASSS” by twitch streamer ohnePixel The 175+ shows his and my heartbeat rate because I searched at the wrong place for years So the search of the root cause has to continue in CS2.exe and not on the gameserver side. Learning: the first disconnection before a No user logon comes from CS2.exe and not from the gameserver. CS2 startup procedure When CS2.exe is started it executes various loops from the Source engine. The final loop is the game loop which is responsible for the actual menu interaction, user interaction and gameplay. It is the loop that is running as long as the game is fully loaded and/or you are playing. As game is the final loop it can’t be the one which is shutdown and so it can’t be the one initiating the disconnection with NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN as otherwise the game would end. To find out which loops are executed before the game loop, I decided to look at the output of the game console of CS2.exe which can be enabled in the game settings. Among a lot of other things, the following can be observed: 1 2 3 4 [SteamNetSockets] SDR RelayNetworkStatus: avail=Attempting config=OK anyrelay=Attempting (Performing ping measurement) [SteamNetSockets] AuthStatus (steamid:): OK (OK) [Client] CL: CLoopModeLevelLoad::MaybeSwitchToGameLoop switching to \"game\" loopmode with addons () [EngineServiceManager] SwitchToLoop game requested: id [1] addons [] It appears there is a loop levelload (look at CLoopModeLevelLoad) which is executed before the game loop. In the end, that loop wants to transition to the game loop. And directly before that transition it says AuthStatus (steamid:): OK (OK). So the last thing that happens before the game loop is started is that the Steam ID validation is initiated. It all makes sense: levelload is called on startup of CS2.exe. While it’s not loading an actual map you are playing on, the initial screen you see in CS2 is likely considered a level too and initializing things like the intro video and the main menu. And while that initial screen is loaded in levelload it tries to initiate the validation with Steam3 via Steam.exe. Learning: levelload is an important initialization loop and is, among other things, responsible to initiate the validation with Steam3 via Steam.exe from CS2.exe as the last thing this loop does. The updated diagram with these learnings looks a bit different now. Note that CS2.exe is only considered the “initiator” of the levelload and all the game logic that was previously assigned to CS2.exe is taken over by the game loop: sequenceDiagram box User computer participant Steam.exe participant CS2.exe participant \"levelload\" loop participant \"game\" loop end box Internet participant Gameserver participant Steam3 server end CS2.exe->>\"levelload\" loop: Starts \"levelload\" loop-->>+Steam.exe: Connect with untrusted Steam ID \"levelload\" loop->>\"game\" loop: Starts Note over Steam.exe: Confirms that Steam IDsent by CS2.exe is thesame as the currentlysigned in Steam account Steam.exe-->>-Steam3 server: Temporarily store info that Steam ID is valid for game CS2 \"game\" loop->>Gameserver: Connect with untrusted Steam ID Gameserver->>Steam3 server: Is that Steam ID valid?

The game can’t be considered to be in a usable state when it fails to complete. Learning: When the initialization of levelload is incomplete (speak: CS2 has not been fully loaded/initialized), the Steam3 validation is never initiated because it is the last thing that loop wants to do. This CS2.exe is now broken and can’t be fixed until a simple restart of CS2.exe. Putting everything together, the bug is now apparent: NETWORK_DISCONNECT_LOOPSHUTDOWN is caused by premature shutdown of levelload without initiating the Steam3 validation. Because levelload detects the premature shutdown, it disconnects the user from the gameserver every time a reconnection is tested. The diagram looks like this when the bug is triggered: sequenceDiagram box User computer participant CS2.exe participant \"levelload\" loop participant \"game\" loop end box Internet participant Gameserver participant Steam3 server end CS2.exe->>\"levelload\" loop: Starts \"levelload\" loop->>\"game\" loop: Starts \"game\" loop->>Gameserver: Connect with untrusted Steam ID Gameserver->>Steam3 server: Is that Steam ID valid?

Bug invocation But why is levelload prematurely shutdown and why is it only happening to some users? Remember the multitude of people who thought they have fixed the issue? They didn’t, they were just lucky because the bug invocation is a race condition when CS2 is started in a specific way! Race condition means that the behavior of an application is dependent on timing, and that’s what happens here. The levelload loop is shutdown before it can complete sometimes. And it’s only happening to some users because it depends on the following factors: *The way Counter-Strike is started: the blame factor is 90% Speed of the computer: blame factor is 3% Speed of the user: blame factor is 3% State of the moon: blame factor is 3% Something is actually wrong with the user configuration: blame factor is 1%. Sadly I couldn’t investigate further here. And what would be the way to start CS2 so the bug triggers with 99% certainty? Triggering the bug with 90% certainty: connect to a gameserver without CS2 being open before. And that’s why everyone is just too fast (to connect) for Valve: sequenceDiagram box User computer participant CS2.exe participant \"levelload\" loop participant \"game\" loop end box Internet participant Gameserver participant Steam3 server end CS2.exe->>\"levelload\" loop: Starts rect rgb(255, 0, 0) Note over \"levelload\" loop: THE BUG:Loop shutdowns prematurelybecause Steam.exe tells CS2.exeto connect to a gameservertoo fast because you asked it to. end \"levelload\" loop->>\"game\" loop: Starts \"game\" loop->>Gameserver: Connect with untrusted Steam ID Gameserver->>Steam3 server: Is that Steam ID valid?

Can continue playing for 2min50s max Starts Starts Connect with untrusted Steam ID Is that Steam ID valid? no Disconnect with \"No user logon\" There are multiple ways of doing that: Connecting from a server browser outside the game while it’s not running yet or has just been started before Connecting to a friend via Steam friends list outside the game while it’s not running yet or has just been started before Manually connecting to a server using Steams browser protocol (steam://connect/127.0.0.1:27015) outside the game while it’s not running yet or has just been started before You can increase chances by starting CS2 and before it has fully initialized, doing one of the above. Solution Do not: Reinstall the game Validate the game files Restart Steam Restart your computer Disable WiFi Connect from outside the game to a gameserver before it has been started Instead: Start CS2 well before you connect to a gameserver. It’s good enough to wait until you see the game console or wait 5-10 seconds after you saw the intro video. Conclusion To close the question you are still asking yourself: it was possible for the user Bob to validate 9 minutes after the first try for just one reason: they restarted CS2 and weren’t unlucky that time. Another conclusion is: once a Steam ID is validated, it will never fail later for that game instance except you close your Steam client while CS2.exe is running. Closing words While I am sure the proposed solution works for 99% of all users, I am well aware that there is a very small minority of users who are affected by this error for other reasons not covered in this blog post. Guess what the Esportal matchmaking platform did until we fixed the behavior on 10th of January, 2024: it started CS2.exe and as soon as the process was available (but not fully initialized) it executed the steam://connect/: command with the appropriate matchmaking gameserver. User tickets related to this issue stopping coming in the moment we applied the fix and deployed it to every Esportal player. That said, I am ending the blog post with a graph that I really like and I do hope to never ever see a Slack message with that error again: xychart-beta title \"Relative amount of 'No user logon' tickets\" x-axis [03.01., 04.01., 05.01., 06.01., 07.01., 08.01., 09.01., 10.01., 11.01., 12.01.] y-axis \"Share of daily tickets (in %)\" 0 --> 23 bar [6, 10, 18, 18, 23, 10, 9, 0, 0, 0] Relative amount of 'No user logon' tickets 03.01. 04.01. 05.01. 06.01. 07.01. 08.01. 09.01. 10.01. 11.01. 12.01. 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Share of daily tickets (in %) Thanks to my colleagues for proof-reading and providing feedback!

The game client requests session tickets from Steam's server, then it provides the game server with a ticket proving they are a given Steam ID. The game server then has to go online to Steam's web API and verify it to ensure it has not been used multiple times or tampered with. It sounds like the CS2 client is not handling a delayed response for obtaining a session ticket. The flow is detailed here[0]. The flow the article diagram suggests would be a bit concerning since an attacker could race a victim Steam ID to join a server, etc. [0] https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/auth#3 reply iforgotpassword 4 minutes agoparentYes, it's most likely a session ticket which is not clearly expressed in the article, but the issue seems to be that the game sometimes gets interrupted before it will actually create a session ticket (or rather while waiting for the response from the slow steam servers), and then join the gameserver without having one. reply freudenjmp 6 hours agoprevHello HN, this is my first detailed blog post about one of the most annoying bugs I have ever come across in my life.

My only comment here is that the trail in the article and the conclusion don't quite make sense (well, they do, but you've kind of glossed over it slightly): > The way Counter-Strike is started: the blame factor is 90% But also: > We could confirm that players world wide are facing the issue outside of Esportal and thought it indeed is caused by some maintenance in the middle of the night in Washington. Those can't both be true. If the blame is 90% about the way counter strike is started, then the issue wouldn't be distributed over the maint window. Rather, it seems like this is the key part that should be highlighted in the summary: > So the last thing that happens before the game loop is started is that the Steam ID validation is initiated. > When the initialization of levelload is incomplete (speak: CS2 has not been fully loaded/initialized), the Steam3 validation is never initiated because it is the last thing that loop wants to do. Which is to say, that when the `steam3` server is as slow as balls during a maint window, it makes this take longer, which means you're more likely to interrupt the loop by starting a game. So when you say: > The way Counter-Strike is started: the blame factor is 90% It's true.... but maybe it's also true to say: > State of the moon: blame factor is 3%I'd love to get feedback You start the article with a tl;dr for people who came from google searching for a solution for the issue.

Presumably a faster and more robust solution would be for the Steam client to obtain (and hang onto) a signed token (from Valve) with a lifetime of a few hours, and whenever you connect to a game server that token is sent over where it can be validated locally against a public cert issued by Valve (that comes distributed with the game server contents). reply WirelessGigabit 4 hours agoprevI feel that drawing weapons has gotten slower in CS2.

Most users will thoughtlessly tap \"OK\" when asked to agree to the barrage of new permissions requested by the updated apps. The company does other things too, but this is its main business. reply simonebrunozzi 16 hours agoparentThe most notable acquisition in recent times has been Evernote.

I bet their portfolio managers did that, and then attached their names to the deal to lend it an air of credibility, probably negotiating some sweet bonuses and spiffs for themselves in the process, and now this reads like they're all a POS, which, while that may be true for other reasons, hides the likely fact that the real POS's here are the stockbrokers. reply prepend 14 hours agorootparentPeople need to be aware of their investments. If I buy shares in Phillip Morris, then I better be ok with people smoking cigarettes and everything that entails.

I'm not absolving them of their participation in bendingspoons and other such companies, I'm saying to not forget that it's the soulless portfolio managers that are the minds that move the body of evil. I do blame them for their participation, but not as much as the people offering them the opportunity to profit from the exploitation of others. It's like the Bernie Madoff \"victims\". A bunch of them were in on it to some degree so they could make a quick buck. I have no more sympathy for them than they do for me. But the majority of the people who both profited and lost from Madoff were people who were letting their 401k retirement plans be managed by a company which were ultimately being used to fund the scheme. Not a one of them likely knew that this was how their money was being used and they are all actually victims. The real jerks are the stockbroker portfolio managers. If they didn't offer to enable rich-jerk douchery for fun and profit, it wouldn't be a thing they were all doing. reply prepend 10 hours agorootparent> soulless portfolio managers Only soulless people hire soulless portfolio managers. A portfolio manager, like a lawyer or attorney, is really specific and takes a lot of selection. People choose intentionally. Madoff didn’t work with 401ks. No one had their 401k funds with Madoff. It was all rich people using private hedge funds. Also, Madoff was a fraud, not an asshole. It’s very different to harm people with adware infected, terrible apps than to run a Ponzi scheme. Madoff deceived his investors. Bendingspoons says exactly what they’re going to do and then does it. They aren’t deceiving anyone. The jerk stockbrokers are all demand side.

Since they can just sell the app, I assume it's not them writing it for the government on contract. reply samch 21 hours agoparentI don’t think it’s allowed without permission per: https://www.usa.gov/government-copyright Specifically, “Endorsement, trademarks, and agency logos You cannot use government materials in a way that implies endorsement by a government agency, official, or employee. For example, using a photo in your advertisement of a government official wearing or using your product is not permitted. You also cannot use federal government trademarks or federal government agency logos without permission. For example, in general, you cannot use an agency logo or trademark on your social media page to suggest endorsement or sponsorship by the agency.” NOAA does have a licensing program, but I somehow doubt that this app was part of that program. Assuming that’s true, then this is likely a case of poor enforcement. reply dmurray 21 hours agorootparentIs that the law, or is that more the government saying, through its publicists, how it would like its image to be used? Seems crazy that, say, an outdoor clothes retailer couldn't share a photo of a group trek where the park ranger was wearing its gear. Or that SpaceX couldn't publish a photo of NASA astronauts flying in its spacecraft - even with NASA's permission. reply jawns 18 hours agorootparentA while back, I tried to create a T-shirt using a version of the NASA logo, and it got shot down by NASA because it violated their restrictive licensing terms: https://shaungallagher.pressbin.com/blog/nasa-vsvn.html I was baffled, because I assumed that any government-created content was public domain by default. But agency marks are a big exception to that. This post goes into detail about the law about government agencies' logos and \"fair use\" arguments. reply acdha 20 hours agorootparentprevThose scenarios aren’t the same: those photos are a literal state of fact, not an endorsement. SpaceX can say they fly NASA missions because that’s a provable fact that they were awarded a contract to do so and anyone who wants to search the public procurement records could verify that. Where they (and NASA employees) would get into trouble would be saying that NASA thinks they’re the best, or that you should give them your business, too. It’s the idea that the reputation of a public agency is being committed to boost a private business that causes the legal concerns. reply dmurray 15 hours agorootparentThat seems like a very reasonable law, but it's not consistent with what was linked above and what other commentators are saying really is \"the law\". > You cannot use government materials in a way that implies endorsement by a government agency, official, or employee. For example, using a photo in your advertisement of a government official wearing or using your product is not permitted. No exemption made for photos where the government official really did use your cowboy hat or starship! No exception for situations where the government really did endorse you as a service provider of rugged outdoor clothing, or manned space missions. After all, if the situation was just \"you aren't allowed to fraudulently claim the government used or endorsed your product, when they did no such thing\" it would barely need mentioning. reply acdha 13 hours agorootparentI think this is more confusion around language for something which isn’t quite that simple. The page that quote is from is a summary, not the actual statute, and each agency will have different policies, as well as terms written into contracts for actual procurements. In general, I’ve found literal statements of fact to be uncontroversial (e.g. if you say X.gov uses Y, and anyone who looks at sam.gov can confirm the same), but it gets increasingly more likely to raise challenges the more it looks like a recommendation, especially if it includes superlatives about the product or service. Anyway, if this is remotely relevant, get a lawyer and ask the agency in question since they’ll likely have some nuances. reply mhh__ 14 hours agorootparentprevYour first example might be a little harsh, but there is a real risk if you let these things go uncontrolled e.g. the potential for fraud is enormous. reply fakedang 21 hours agorootparentprevIt is the law. You can use those photos (including competitors photos) for any use other than marketing. Other uses, for a company, don't really exist. It is often explicitly upfront in the media pages of most government agencies. SpaceX can use the photos as such for factual reporting, which usually ends up being marketing for them indirectly. That is allowed. If SpaceX were to market themselves actively as having government ties, that would not be allowed. In a similar vein, I notice most startups using government logos in their marketing. That is also not allowed - even if the agency is using your software. You are not allowed to display those logos, except for \"factual marketing\" - say, a white paper on the government agency using your software. Even mentioning something on the lines of \"DOD improved its purchasing efficiency by 10x (heh!)\" is forbidden explicitly. I'm not sure about most of the agencies themselves, but the FDA is very strict about enforcing this rule and has often fined Big Pharma for this infraction many times. reply kasperni 22 hours agoprevIf you read their Wikipedia page [1] they sound like an Italian Saint.

If you are part of the cabal, how long did it take to learn the handshake? /s reply stuartjohnson12 17 hours agorootparentI don't know what it means to be a member of the cabal. I just showed up one day and started writing edits. I have about a thousand edits now. Some of them were reverted, but most weren't. I think the reason people perceive there to be a \"cabal\" is that they edit articles that are either very contentious to begin with (national identity, gender, politics) or are high traffic and most of the content has already been discussed at length. Even in those areas, I think there is not a cabal, just lots of angry individual people who oftentimes end up being banned if they get angry enough. But I don't generally edit in high traffic areas generally because I don't like long litigations on talk pages. The last time I saw the \"cabal\" in effect on Wikipedia was when I tried to rephrase some things on a page related to a controversial topic. There were two users working together to load the page with some very biased terms. I tried to remove them but was swiftly reverted. I think that's what you mean when you say the cabal. I gave up editing that article because a long fight didn't interest me. Since then, both of the users trying to guard that article against edits have since been banned from editing in the area that article was in. The \"cabal\" as you see it is usually just a small number of very interested editors with a strong opinion. If their opinions are too strong, then they're usually in violation of Wikipedia policy and they get cleaned out eventually. I don't like to fight with those people though. My favourite thing to do on Wikipedia is clean up around the edges. If you follow this link, you'll be taken to a random article which is tagged as being written in a promotional tone. There are around 25,000 articles like this on Wikipedia at the moment. https://randomincategory.toolforge.org/All_articles_with_a_p...

That ownership can be shared and go through arbitrarily many indirections, and if it's a publicly traded company, some of its shares change ownership all the time. reply jeff_tyrrill 14 hours agorootparentI think the legal concept of \"beneficial ownership\" is the intent here: We want to know the ultimate (natural) person(s) who control the app's assets and for whose benefit the app is monetized. There is no simple rule that can be applied at scale. Determining beneficial ownership requires a case-by-case review of not just the chain of legal ownership, but management, contracts, incentives, etc. Any fixed rules can be gamed. For example, a company could license out its name as a \"franchise\" who is legally independent but whose franchise contract has so many arms of control that they de facto function as a single company. Another example is that a majority donor of a nonprofit controls the nonprofit even if they have no board seats or de jure power to appoint or fire board members. reply IG_Semmelweiss 14 hours agorootparentprevFor public companies, it is extremely easy. Just start off with a warning every time certain filing (Section 13) is made. You could conceivably do this automated. For private, large companies, its a simply attestation. You could open source monitoring for changes - if the company makes an PR announcement of any kind , or if a member of the public reports submits proof of change of control exercise in their contract, ask the company to update their attestation and compare. They don't provide it ? They get a nice little red banner alerting users of shadiness going on. reply bmitc 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's not tricky.

They most famously bought Evernote. They buy apps/products that mature and don’t need a lot of work, fire all the workers and hire a skeleton crew to manage them in a cheaper labor market. They also harvest data from the apps and resell it. reply jtthe13 22 hours agorootparentYes. That and they optimize the pricing to squeeze as much profit from captive users (or those that don't know better). They increased the pricing for Evernote quite aggressively, and reduced the free features if I recall correctly.

Nobody is suggesting anyone put 'lots of people' on a mature product. However, there are always things that need to be done.

That's just on the app side, the same is true for any build pipelines/hosting infrastructure. These apps don't run themselves regardless of how mature they are.

I’m not sure if these are connected but I wouldn’t be surprised if they are. Airlines are losing millions of dollars due to grounding their fleet and the fact that it’s happened again cannot help. The only thing keeping Boeing in the game right now is likely the fact that Airbus is sold out for over a decade. reply alexhutcheson 19 hours agoparentAirlines with Airbus fleets are dealing with lengthy periods of unavailability due to issues with the Pratt & Whitney engines that power ~60% of A320neos and all A220s[1].

That’s also where the margins are You haven't been keeping track I presume. Boeing is bleeding money on recent military contracts like the Air Force One Replacement or the KC-46, because they're on a fixed price structure and Boeing drastically underestimated the costs involved. So much so that for the replacement of the NEACP (\"Doomsday Planes\") Boeing withdrew from bidding because they refuse to get into another fixed price military programme, knowing they can't predict costs for shit and will lose a lot of money. They're only interested in costs+ contracts, which nobody seems to be willing to give them. reply cherryteastain 17 hours agorootparentThat contract was first awarded to Airbus' A330-MRTT tanker aircraft (which is currently in service with other air forces). Boeing was so upset by losing a Pentagon contract that they lobbied the US government hard into voiding the original contract award and re-opening the tender. Subsequently, Boeing placed an unreasonably low bid and Airbus walked away saying they can't make it happen at that price. So, this was an entirely predictable own goal by Boeing. reply dotnet00 18 hours agorootparentprevNot to mention the embarrassment that is the Starliner program. Now SpaceX has almost finished the 6 launches the original contract included and is moving into a second contract. Boeing has yet to do its first launch \"active\" launch. Boeing had tried to get the snakes in Congress to cancel SpaceX's contract at the start because Boeing was clearly the reliable option, we see how that's turned out. reply 7thaccount 19 hours agorootparentprevI wonder why lol. Although I will say that some of the issues that Lockheed Martin has had with the JSF and Littoral Combat Ships is that the military is asking them to build something far too complex. The whole module thing never worked out and that seems obvious. I think instead they should have tried for a couple of specific designs that served specific roles instead of building a single ship or plane that could do lots of things poorly while bleeding too much money. Disclaimer: I'm just guessing at all of this. I'm no expert. Not even an armchair. reply fmajid 17 hours agorootparentOne of the issues was wiring harnesses being too close together. The USAF has higher requirements in for redundancy and fault-tolerance in aircraft that may be shot at than civilian airliners do, go figure. Either way, it's not something that should be new for a company like Boeing that's done several generations of airliner to tanker conversions. reply ranger207 16 hours agorootparentprevThe LCS's mission modules were based on the Danish Stanflex system, which seems to be working pretty well. Since the modular mission packages have gone away, the remaining ones are going to be installed more permanently, making the LCS into more of a purpose built ship. This won't really help the LCS though because it was already purpose built to operate in the littorals, which was a role that never really made sense reply m4rtink 18 hours agorootparentprevI wonder what went wrong woth the combat module concept. The Dutch who inspired this in the LCS are using similar modules just fine apparently on their ships. reply XorNot 18 hours agorootparentprevThat's a \"fighter mafia\" opinion that's not really grounded in reality (the language of \"specific designs for specific roles\" is from them). The JSF on a per unit basis is now cheaper then some 4th gen non-stealth fighters, and the idea that it does things \"poorly\" is not supported by reality. reply nostrademons 18 hours agorootparent\"Specific designs for specific roles\" is a general engineering thing. Any engineer knows that it's easier to get good performance (in whatever dimension you're measuring performance) if you're designing for only one use case than if you're trying to be everything to everyone. Designs that try to do everything end up being overconstrained and then having to make (often irrational from the POV of any one user) compromises to fit reality. Software monopolies face this on a daily basis. Much of what we see as \"enshittification\" from a consumer standpoint comes from single products that need to serve the needs of 3B consumers. The idea of \"unbundling\" that was en vogue in startup circles from ~2013-2016 is just that startups which serve one use case for one customer base are able to eek out efficiencies that consumer tech giants cannot.

Fixed price broke a lot of BDS, because no one really has any idea what anything costs, or even how long it takes to do a thing. Sometimes I wonder just how much is left in the core of the org. My first memory of working with Boeing was from 2010, when a government encryption requirement led me down a long and tortured road that ended with me training an entire Boeing team on what PGP was (we still ended up handling virtually all of that in-house, at cost to Boeing, because it took eight months to get an answer to virtually any question, as both call and response filtered through two dozen levels of management emails). More recently the USAF tossed Boeing a softball project to glue wings and a GPS kit to Mk82 iron bombs, but Boeing couldn't figure it out - they had to subcon the job to Kratos (this was in the news, but was also confirmed anecdotally). Similar thing with \"avionics updates\" for- the \"update\" was just a request that an accurate pinout diagram be sent with the documentation. Again, core Boeing just couldn't manage that without subconning it out; they literally did not know the pin #s on a standard ARINC connector that they were themselves using. Pretty close to an aerospace company needing a subcontractor to explain what the Bernoulli Principle is. I do hope I am wrong about B. It's quite possible I've just had really bad luck when it comes to the division I deal with. But sometimes . . sometimes you wonder, \"What . . what if the whole org is like that?\" [1] That's a huge theme across multiple BDS divisions and programs, from UAS to F-15 and Super Hornet. I suspect it's also why BGS appears to be made of money. reply nxobject 15 hours agorootparentWith that in mind, would there be any negative effects to slowly giving Boeing the cold shoulder? reply MilStdJunkie 9 hours agorootparentFor suppliers, it's a valid question, and it gets more valid every year as the cost of doing business with big B spirals. Thing is, it's just so much damn money up front, that the guys up in Mahogany Row don't really care about follow-on costs, like having to support Boeing staff who don't know what a scroll wheel on a mouse does. Now, though, with (another!) active investigation, possibly one where Boeing loses their in-house DERs . . whew, who knows. From the DoD perspective? It's not really possible for DoD to offload Boeing. The old airframes - F-15, F-18, 7X7 derivatives of all flavors - are the workhorses of US jet aviation . . or they are perceived to be the workhorses, in any case. Ah, \"perceived\" . . there's a huge, ginormous other subject here, and that is the subject of a peacetime military. Specifically, whether the metrics we optimize for in peacetime have any bearing whatsoever when it comes to a hot war with a peer. History says, \"nope!\". Tech and metrics optimized in peacetime buildups almost never have decisive roles in major conflicts, for somewhat obvious reasons: the enemy sees it coming. Everyone's got countermeasures ready to go before shooting starts. The victor - the technological victor, which doesn't necessarily correlate with the winner - is the one that adjusts fastest to combat experience. That industrial agility is really the thing that needs to be optimized. Trade offs of course are aplenty here; if you adjust hardware too fast, you damage your production capacity and your logistics. Case in point: the US in WW2 were probably one of the slowest-adjusting of the Powers, technologically speaking, but none of that mattered a good god damn when US industrial capacity was greater than the rest of the planet combined. Combining capacity/readiness with agility is the magic bullet. When historians say the T-34 was the most effective armored fighting vehicle of WW2, that's what they're talking about. It obviously wasn't the best, or even a good fighting platform, but it matched Soviet industrial capability to a T while effectively countering the enemy. It was the best design for the system it was part of. Internet people get in terrible screaming matches about this, not realizing that mil historians evaluate systems, not hunks of iron.

I wonder if Southwest being such a huge airline by fleet size (much larger than EasyJet for example) would make that harder or easier. Either way I was thinking less about Southwest jumping ship to Airbus and more switching to an entirely new model from either manufacturer. I wouldn't see Southwest going through the trouble of switching to the A320 for example, but maybe to an A320 or 737 replacement. The A320 may be a newer platform than the 737, but it still dates to the 80s (admittedly better than dating to the 60s).

The A320 might be newer than the 737, but it's not really that new. I don't see a company like Southwest planning a generational shift to an airframe that itself is nearly a generation old.

That was in reference to the difference in philosophy between Boeing and Airbus about whether the pilot or the plane's computer should get the final say in emergency situations, with Boeing letting the pilot override the plane and Airbus having some protections that won't allow the pilot to do something dangerous (I'm sure I'm oversimplifying or misconstruing details, I'm not a pilot or aviation engineer and it's been a couple of decades since I heard this particular rant). With the last few years of Boeing's misadventures I wonder what he'd call himself today, \"an otherwise reputable computer scientist who sometimes gets on modern jetliners\"? reply t0mas88 18 hours agoparentThe way it works for the Airbus is that the pilot controls the plane, but there are safety parameters that determine what the controls do. Consider it like a modern car with engine management software. If you floor the accelerator all at once from a low rpm in a very old car, the engine will stumble, if you do it in a modern car the engine management software will inject the maximum amount of fuel that can be burned and not too much, getting you maximum acceleration. The same applies for the way Airbus controls work. Let's say you want the maximum climb (for example due to wind shear on landing), in the Airbus you push the throttles all the way forward, and pull the stick all the way back. The computer will figure out not to pitch you up further than the plan can handle. The same manoeuvre in a Boeing means you press the TO/GA switch twice for maximum power (because the engines are computer controlled here as well) but then you pull back on the yoke up to stick shaker activation (stall warning) and manually try to pitch just below the maximum. There is no safeguard stopping you from pulling too far and stalling the airplane. Every pilot can do that, small training aircraft that everyone learns this in don't have any protections either. But the accuracy won't be as good as what the Airbus computers can do and it requires paying more attention. Now in an emergency, systems failures, the Airbus will downgrade to how the Boeing works. Full back stick will be an unlimited pitch-up and the pilots need to manually figure out what the maximum is. reply Night_Thastus 18 hours agorootparent>Now in an emergency, systems failures, the Airbus will downgrade to how the Boeing works. Full back stick will be an unlimited pitch-up and the pilots need to manually figure out what the maximum is. You're referring to Alternate Law and the more extreme version, Direct Law. One note is that it's not always an emergency that can cause this. If important sensors like AOA or airspeed disagree (for example, due to a temporarily-frozen pitot tube), that will also reduce to alternate or direct depending on the situation. Unfortunately this can bite pilots badly if they either don't notice or don't understand the new situation quickly enough. There have been one or two crashes attributed to this over the years. [See Air France 447] reply V__ 15 hours agorootparentI went down a youtube rabbit hole about aircraft investigations once.

For example: It can be really easy to not notice a change from normal to alternate or direct law, if there are multiple problems going on at once. reply rcxdude 17 hours agoparentprevThere's a bigger difference, as I understand it, which is where airbus generally considers the pilot as managing a complex machine with a lot of automation (even without autopilots), and the inputs and controls reflect that, being a bit more abstract. Boeing basically tries to make every plane they make fly like a cessna, using the same basic controls but always adapting the interface to the same thing, even if that abstraction is leaky. There's upsides and downsides to it, but MCAS is one example of boeing's philosophy going wrong (in part exacerbated by trying to conserve the type rating and avoiding pilot retraining). reply m463 18 hours agoparentprev> Boeing letting the pilot override the plane and Airbus ... won't allow I still think it is basically true (MCAS notwithstanding).

Can't find it now. reply t0mas88 18 hours agorootparentWhat you have in mind for the Airbus crash is what the captain claimed, but it was not true. The engines responded normally and started to spool up to maximum power, but that takes time for older jet engines coming from idle. The crew then pulled as far back as the stick would go, and the computer put the aircraft at it's maximum possible pitch-up. Unfortunately that wasn't enough to clear the trees they were flying into. More details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_296Q A 737 in the same situation would have similar engine challenges. But the crew would have stalled it instead of the Airbus computer avoiding the stall.

Overall, I think this is a false equivalence and bad form of whataboutism. Boeing are caught, again, with shoddy manufacturing and design practices, and people harp on \"But Airbus aren't better!\". Even if they weren't, and they are better, why does it matter? Boeing have issues, those need to be fixed. If Airbus had issues, those have to be fixed too.

In the US we stopped giving out free meals on flights about 10 years ago, at best you can buy a $20 yucky cardboard lunch box, so the problem of the front pullout never comes up. I think the most luxurious experience in US domestic travel I had was circa 2013 on a 767 widebody from NYC to LA but there were times circa 1990 when it was common to get on a 737 from Philadelphia or Pittsburgh to Albuquerque that was 1/3 full which feels spacious but that couldn't have been economic. The industry here is competitive on price but not competitive on quality.

The 737 is a 1967 aircraft that is still flying. You don't see a 1967 car being sold in car dealerships. You can't buy a 1967 computer. You see the headline \"Airliners can't take off in Arizona because it's too hot\" but the truth is \"737s can't take off in Arizona because it's too hot\" (737 struggles to take off under good conditions, it takes more runway to take off than planes with 2x the PAX) People say \"flying sucks\", but it's more like \"flying sucks in a 737\" (the reason why your neck locks up just thinking about sitting in a window seat on a 737 is because the 737 has a circular cross section that doesn't fit the human body; a plane smaller than a 737 with a more appropriate cross section feels like riding in a 747) The Embraer E2-Jet is a smaller aircraft that has a bigger engine with better fuel economy because it's not an obsolete design that can't fit a bigger engine. Then there's the A220, bought by Airbus, that Boeing has no answer to and has chosen to have no answer to. For some reason they got possessed to develop several widebody airliners in a row but when it comes to overhauling the narrowbody planes that are most of the units, most of the flights and most of the social and economic impact of aviation, management has been on strike for decades. The industry has been trying hard to keep you from riding in a modern narrowbody or regional jet because if they did, you'd be demanding it. Once you try the A220 there is no way you'd ride the same route on a 737 if you had a choice. And the thing is the A220 has lower operating costs...

McD-D had for a couple of decades prioritized military/defense/space contracts over civil aviation and had turned into a finely tuned machine for milking government cost-plus contracts. They also had a bad case of Jack Welch management disease. Over the years after the merger, Boeing's traditional management was largely replaced by the imported profits-over-everything culture of McDonnell-Douglas. This is, to put it mildly, not your grandparents' Boeing any more. Because the design life of an airliner is on the order of 30 years, it took years to decades for the cultural change to become visible on the outside, but the 737 MAX MCAS debacle is symptomatic of the change in priorities to focus on hitting sales targets over engineering and QA, with lethal results. (The simple fact that they had to add MCAS to compensate for changed handling characteristics in the 737 MAX isn't damning on its own, although it was a marketing-driven decision: really, at 50+ years old, it's past time Boeing designed a clean-sheet 737 replacement to compete with the A320 family. But then Boeing didn't see fit to mention MCAS in the pilots' handbook. An MCAS failure can cause a 737 MAX to become unflyable if it fails and the pilots don't understand what's going on, and that has led to two fatal crashes. And the 737 MAX MCAS is controlled by a single sensor, introducing a single point of failure. A dual sensor option is available to customers, but at extra cost -- and this is unforgivable. And now we learn that new-Boeing's institutional response is to demand exemption from FAA oversight? It's not looking good!) reply PaulHoule 19 hours agorootparentThe thing is all the other major airliners today (even made in Brazil!) have fly-by-wire and a \"flight envelope protection\" system which is like MCAS but more comprehensive, better thought through, documented, etc. That is, pilots are trained in the system and a huge amount of effort went into thinking through how the system should behave when it is in a degraded condition and some parts of the system (like those sensors) aren't functioning properly. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_envelope_protection reply masklinn 19 hours agorootparentWell yes, the problems of MCAS are not that it exists (although its implementation was definitely debatable, notably the use of a single AoA sensor, and AoA sensor warnings being optional), having FBW and flight envelope correction is not an issue in and of itself. The issues of MCAS was that it was added specifically to hide type behavioural differences with previous 737s with the specific goal of keeping the type, and thus the entire purpose of MCAS precluded training pilots on its behaviour and edge cases. reply mcv 18 hours agorootparentBasically it was to maintain a lie.

Maybe it's just a good business to be in right now? reply kergonath 16 hours agoparentI think so. It seems the airlines from which the large orders came from already fly mostly Airbus. reply jmyeet 19 hours agoprevA key to understanding this is \"type rating\". Pilots are generally certified to fly 1-2 types of aircraft at a time. Budget airlines, in the US in particular, will try to maintain a single type rating across their entire fleet. This means planes are largely interchangeable with some exceptions (eg a given plane has to be certified to fly over open water on routes like Hawaii and to Europe). So any pilot can fly any plane in the fleet. That's great for keeping costs low and scheduling. As soon as you add a new type rating, you've created a second pool of planes and pilots that you need to manage. Airbus surprised Boeing when it introduced the A320neo as this was very attractive to budget airlines who were loyal customers to the 737 over decades. There were multiple iterations of 737 up to the 737NG (to that point). Beoing had a choice: develop a new aircraft. This would take longer and wouldn't keep the same type rating so they'd lose their type rating lock-in with the likes of Southwest, who is a huge Boeing customer. The compromise was the 737Max. It was faster to develop and deliberately designed to maintain the 737 type rating. But it had larger engines and they were moved forward on the plane. This could make stalls easier so Boeing (mostly) silently added a system to \"handle\" that. That was the infamous MCAS. Lack of knowledge about this and training was what caused the 2 crashes that grounded the Max fleet last time. This was exacerbated by the sensor having a single point of failure. Interestingly, there was an optional upgrade package to have 3 sensors instead of 1, which is more the industry norm for critical systems. 2 of the 3 sensors have to agree. So Being solved a short term problem but created a long term problem as that 737 lock in was both a blessing and a curse. Existing customers liked the 737 but it was an aging plane that didn't fit changing standards with plane controls, engine design and so forth. Also, to keep costs low, Boeing has increasingly over the last two decades relied on various layers of outsourcing. Airbus simply isn't shackled with 50 year old designs like Boeing is. They've made mistakes too, most notably the A380 but between the A319/320/321 (neo and not), A330 and A350, Airbus has a really solid product line. Boeing's 777 was a workhorse for long range wide body aircraft in the same market as the A350. The 787 fits here too but it seems like it's not as popular as the 777 or A350. I could be wrong. Lastly, Boeing's 747 was a massive cash cow for decades. This is what let them own the airplane market. But 4 engine planes no longer make economic sense. The same applies to the A380. So we have the 777/787/A350 instead. reply michael1999 17 hours agoparentThe A380 might have been a market mistake, but that's very different from a safety failure.

But on the development side, the situation is less clear. There is no major development project anymore since A350 is in operation. And there are no signs yet of an upcoming major program based on their research activities for hydrogen-powered of more electric airliners. So there could still be layoffs or downsizing due to hiring less engineers than the ones that go to retirement. reply salex89 19 hours agorootparent> There is no major development project anymore since A350 is in operation. Well, not having a complete new aircraft doesn't mean there is no activities. A320neo is leaps and bounds ahead on the market. While Boeing seriously needs a new aircraft in that segment, Airbus can happily modernise the A320 some more. As for new developments, they likely need to integrate the A220 into their lineup, streamline the issues they had with it, and many think that the A320 successor will likely be based on the A220, making the A220 much more important to Airbus than it seems. There are rumours about a A220-500 which will have different engines than the smaller ones. In the meantime, it's known that Boeing doesn't plan to release anything anytime soon until a new generation of much more efficient engines comes in, even though it's an uncertainty when will it be. Also, it seems that A350-1000 and A330neo sales are somewhat underwhelming, they cannot compete against the 777X or 787. By some reports, the RR engine in the A350-1000 needs too much maintenance in the hot climates of the Middle East, where a lot of wide bodies are sold. All in all, they have their work cut on multiple fronts. reply masklinn 19 hours agorootparentprevOne of the big issues wrt \"major development projects\" is that engine manufacturers are working on pretty interesting concepts but it's not clear if they'll pan out, and that means if you lock in a program too early you might completely miss out on this new generation of engines and end up with a plane missing the market. I don't think Airbus wants a repeat of the A380. Plus last I'd checked Boeing declared they're not working on a new frame for at least a decade, and Airbus is competitive right now, so the incentive is limited: Comac is up and coming, but it's still a way away (and is missing the entire support network). reply ponector 19 hours agorootparentprevIt can provide job safety only to folks at the assembly line. Even with record profits and huge backlog companies nowadays can do layoffs to please shareholders. Like Microsoft did. There is no such thing as job security anymore. Successful companies can do layoffs anytime. Why not to layoff people if they can hire in cheaper locations? reply FirmwareBurner 19 hours agorootparent>Successful companies can do layoffs anytime. Depends. Airbus probably has a strong union in France so mass layoffs especailly during pofitable times seem as likely as contact with aliens. reply ponector 19 hours agorootparentStrong union in France would be pleased if Airbus decides to layoff folks at their plant in Mobile, Alabama. reply sofixa 18 hours agorootparentThe Mobile plant is working heavily to serve the US market with A320s and A220s (on which production is starting to ramp up), so no, there is no place for layoffs while demand far outstrips supply. reply FirmwareBurner 18 hours agorootparentprevWhy would they though? Having a presence on US soild is a vital strategical and political baragaining chip for Airbus. They wouldn't jeopardize that. reply wasmitnetzen 19 hours agorootparentprevRoughly 25% of Airbus SE stock is owned by Germany, France and Spain. reply jeroen79 19 hours agorootparentprevIts not just france, airbus uses a lot of contractors in germany, uk, belgium, ... reply cgeier 17 hours agorootparentAt least in Germany, the UK, and Spain it's not (only) contractors, but Airbus itself. IIRC there are around 50k employees in Germany and France each, 13k in Spain and the UK each. reply reactordev 17 hours agoprev [–] Perfect opportunity for Embraer or the like to start designing bigger twin jet aircraft. We can’t be strangled by two manufacturers, one with a quality problem, the other with a back order problem. reply kergonath 16 hours agoparent [–] You have to be back ordered in boom times like these. You cannot build for peak throughput in such an industry, because otherwise you collapse under the weight of your pipeline when the orders decrease, as will happen at some point. reply reactordev 16 hours agorootparent [–] I know, I just really want to see more variety. Embraer, Bombardier, both are capable with the right incentives. You’re right though and thus the capitalist free market will make it a championship match between two juggernauts. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Google Assistant Changes we’re making to Google Assistant Jan 11, 2024 min read Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Mail Copy link We’re removing some underutilized features in Google Assistant to focus on delivering the best possible user experience. Duke Dukellis Vice President, Google Assistant Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Mail Copy link Since we introduced Google Assistant seven years ago, it’s been incredible to see how voice technology has transformed the way we get things done at home and work. Today, Assistant helps hundreds of millions of people around the world cross off their to-do lists. Over the years, we’ve made it even easier to accomplish your tasks with Assistant — thanks, in large part, to your feedback. And in order to keep improving your experience and build the best Assistant yet, we’re making a few changes to focus on quality and reliability — ultimately making it easier to use Assistant across devices. First, as we continue to make Google Assistant more helpful, we're prioritizing the experiences you love and investing in the underlying technology to make them even better — which means that some underutilized features will no longer be supported. You can find a list of these features, including suggestions of what you can use in place of them (where alternatives are available). Beginning on January 26, when you ask for one of these features, you may get a notification that it won’t be available after a certain date. We’re also bringing you a more consistent experience within the Google app: The microphone icon will now trigger Search results in response to your queries, which is its most popular use case. You can continue to activate Assistant as you always have: Just say “Hey Google” or long press on the home or power button (on select phones) on Android, or open the Google Assistant app on iOS. But you’ll no longer be able to use the microphone icon in the Search bar to complete actions like “turn on the lights” or “send a message.” This includes the microphone in the Pixel Search bar, which will now activate Voice Search instead of Assistant. And to ensure you have access to the best, most up-to-date version of Google Assistant, you’ll be prompted to upgrade the Google app if you’re using an older version (v12 and older). We know change can be disruptive, but we’ll do everything we can to make these transitions as smooth as possible. While Google Assistant has evolved a lot over the last seven years, one thing remains true: Our improvements are driven by your feedback. And we want to hear it. Just say, “Hey Google, send feedback” and share your comments with us. POSTED IN: Google Assistant",

    "commentBody": "Changes we're making to Google Assistant (blog.google)206 points by kkkkkkk 20 hours agohidepastfavorite255 comments afavour 17 hours agoTo me this highlights the core failure with all these voice-driven UIs: you have absolutely no idea what is possible and what isn't. Discoverability is zero, which makes big changes like this even more disruptive. I've already decided that I'm done with Google's smart assistant stuff in any case. I have a Google Home with a screen in my kitchen and the most-used feature (aside from just existing as a photo frame) was an integration with a really useful shopping list app called AnyList. It certainly wasn't complex, we'd say \"Hey Google, addto the shopping list\" and it would do it. But it was very useful: I'd have something in my hands I just pulled from the fridge (e.g. milk) and be able to add it to the list without interrupting what I'm doing. If it had to wait until I was done for me to pull out my phone I'd inevitably forget. Then one day Google decided to disable that integration. Now the only shopping list you can add to is one Google provides (which naturally has way fewer features than AnyList). They've never provided even the remotest defense for why they've removed it, it's very obviously to lock us into the Google ecosystem. So our Google Home is now a glorified photo frame that plays music from time to time (and even then prioritizes cover versions and YouTube videos over actual songs, presumably because $$$) reply pflenker 17 hours agoparentOn top of what you mentioned in your first sentence, any ideas to improve discoverability are horrible. I hate it when Alexa does not play my podcast right away but explains to me how I can change episodes. I despise Alexa for telling me that I have some notification before starting my timer. And so on - any voice only attempt to explain me something without me asking for it means adding a lot of friction between me and my goal. reply SebRollen 8 hours agorootparentThe constant \"By the way...\" from Alexa drove me nuts. If you say \"Alexa, stop by the way\", it'll get the device to stop responding with follow-ups for ~24h. I ended up creating a routine that runs every night at 4am to lower the volume to zero, automatically say \"stop by the way\" to the device, and then raise the volume a minute later, and Alexa has stopped with the follow ups reply phillco 7 hours agorootparentI just discovered this today, but if you whisper to your Echo, it will skip all of the \"by the way\" BS (it will also reply in a whisper, which is kind of creepy, but you win some, you lose some). reply 0cf8612b2e1e 4 hours agorootparentIs it actually lowering the volume or is it fake whispering at the same decibels? I could kind of believe either. reply RexM 11 hours agorootparentprevYes... when it does anything other than what I ask, it makes me feel like it's wasting my time. Alexa recently started responding with \"Good afternoon! \" and it irks me more than it probably should. I've looked to see if I can turn it off and can't find the option. I don't need pleasantries from a machine. reply ksjskskskkk 10 hours agorootparentgoal of assistants is to create a parasocial relation with your young kids so that advertisement is more effective. notice how young kids associate ok google with a way to install games and reach their YouTube videos. all those feature are for that end. you're not the target market. Good night! reply mattbee 9 hours agorootparentprevAs a Brit, when I bark \"Alexa, set a timer for 5 minutes\" and Alexa prefixes her reply with \"Good evening \", TO ME that sounds like a bitter correction-by-example to my abruptness. It's the sarcastic opposite of a pleasantry. reply filedottsx 11 hours agorootparentprevI got slightly irritated by the \"Good afternoon!\" message earlier today. Especially because I had already used Alexa a few times before it did that. reply dockd 9 hours agorootparentprevI get \"good evening\" but not the corresponding \"good morning\". reply bogomipz 9 hours agorootparentWow, is it possible that algorithmically it has decided that you are not a morning person? reply HenryBemis 10 hours agorootparentprevCan you instruct it to \"stop the greetings - go straight to the response\"? Doesn't Alexa (yet) have some LLM behind it that will create a profile just for you? reply ethbr1 17 hours agorootparentprevThe issue is that everyone removed hierarchical menus and replaced them with... nothing. There is no command ontology anymore. Consequently, discovering commands in-app is UX anathema. \"Use the internet, buddy. One of our customers probably documented how-to somewhere on it.\" reply havercosine 4 hours agorootparentSpot on! Lot of voice assistants have been following \"if we could\" line instead of \"if we should line\". For many straightforward applications, clicking through well defined interface can be the least error prone way to get the job done. reply Loughla 9 hours agorootparentprevSeriously though. The development of every company to just trash faq's or an \"assistant\" or third party forums is awful. Trying to get help with technology is almost always infuriating now. I recently had to contact windows help, and they were useless. The windows forum points to a third party software that I am convinced is malware. And while I'm ranting, why can't the download folders in windows be set to group by \"none\" and sort by \"name\" by default? Why are both \"most recently edited\" by default? AND WHY CAN'T I CHANGE IT MICROSOFT? reply adjagu 5 hours agorootparentMaybe WinSetView [0] and the options [1] it provides might be of use to you? It was able to resolve the issues I was facing so hopefully it can work for you as well. [0]: https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView [1]: https://github.com/LesFerch/WinSetView/blob/main/README-more... reply rco8786 8 hours agorootparentprevIf I had a nickel for every time I’ve disabled notifications on my Alexa settings. And yet there it is…another yellow ring. reply happymellon 12 hours agorootparentprevA usual conversation my wife had with Google: > okay Google set a timer for 15 mins Certainly, and did you know I can also set an alarm for 6 am in the kitchen? > Fuck off Google reply gleenn 11 hours agorootparentI'm not dying for them to record more than absolutely necessary, but I really hope all the voice ui engineers do log curses to know when their app is doing annoying stuff. The number of times these things screw up I definitely get really spicy and hope that feedback makes it back. reply cavisne 5 hours agorootparentI remember (maybe its still like this!) there used to be a page you could go to and see all your alexa voice clips since forever. It's amazing amazon has gone so long not caring about privacy without backlash. EDIT: Yep its still there! https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=... reply abraae 9 hours agorootparentprevI tell my kids not to rage against voice assistants in case the machines finish up in charge. reply tharkun__ 8 hours agorootparentShut up, toaster! reply walterbell 13 hours agorootparentprev> Alexa for telling me that I have some notification before starting my timer Device > Settings > Sounds > Notification > none \"Do Not Disturb\" will suppress notifications without affecting alarms and timers. reply jjulius 8 hours agorootparentI'm an Android user and have never owned an iPhone, but that sounds to me like you're talking about a push notification setting that is completely separate from an Alexa response setting. I could be wrong, but my guess is that that's why you're getting downvoted. reply walterbell 6 hours agorootparentThanks for posting that possible misinterpretation :) Everything in my post was Alexa-specific. Someone who has the stated problem can follow that precise and non-obvious menu tree within the Alexa app, and it will solve their problem. It's a device-specific setting, so can be done on the kitchen Alexa without affecting other units. Both \"notification\" [1] and \"Do Not Disturb\" [2] in my post were Alexa-specific terms that are unrelated to their mobile phone brethren.

There were voice activated games, normal stories, choose your own adventure style stories and a fun little “animal of the day” feature. Every single one of those things have been deprecated and removed for… reasons? All we can do with the speaker now is ask it to play music, get the weather, or set a timer. reply squarefoot 2 hours agoparentprev> I'd have something in my hands I just pulled from the fridge (e.g. milk) and be able to add it to the list without interrupting what I'm doing. Non user-hostile technology would happily solve this problem: you pull from the fridge what is about to finish or before throwing the empty container into the trash, put it in front of a mini camera mounted on the fridge, image (possibly also barcode) recognition would identify the product, then you say a magic word and it would be added it to your list directly on the phone, then software would calculate the best path to the shops having in stock the products in the list. Sadly, this would be hijacked by businesses in no time by making it dependent from some cloud services then selling your data to other advertisers or by pestering you with offers of similar competing products. As of today, I still prefer a pen and a piece of paper over any type of automation. reply esafak 14 hours agoparentprevIt's not just voice, but conversational interfaces in general that have this discoverability problem. That means chatGPT. I'm glad people are discovering it, if you excuse the pun. CUIs are not a panacea, not a replacement for conventional UIs. reply gr__or 13 hours agorootparentI think there's a line worth drawing here: Pre-LLM voice interfaces required you to guess the command(s) the designer of the thinking were having in mind for the action you want to perform. With LLMs you can be 10ft into human-level vaguery and metaphorism and your intent might still survive. So the difference wrt discovery is that you only have to gesture at what you wanna do and, if a matching action exists, there is a chance it will be understood. I'd wager we'll see a renaissance of voice assistants with LLMs, especially once the good-enough ones can run on device. reply esafak 12 hours agorootparentWhen you put it that way I am reminded of my youthful efforts at solving puzzles in Sierra Online text adventures by guessing the right prompt. I guess I got early training for successfully interacting with LLMs :) reply seanmcdirmid 4 hours agorootparentprevThere are obviously cases where CUIs work well: while driving if you don’t have a physical button to do the thing you want, the CUI is better than a screen UI, and if it’s a complex thing, you would never have a physical button for it anyways. In the home when you want to control devices in the morning “open all the shades” or “open the north shades”, unlock the door and start the car, etc… Not really conversations though, more like accessible commands. I don’t think we get conversations until the tech improves and the latency goes way down, meaning on device processing of speech at the very least. reply roughly 58 minutes agorootparentI’ve had exceptionally bad experiences with car CUIs - all the problems of trying to figure out exactly how to tell Alexa what to do (and then figure out what Alexa actually _did_) while going 70mph in traffic. Just give me physical buttons. reply dylan604 10 hours agorootparentprevit reminds me of all the old text games like Zorg or whatever where they gave you a cursor leaving you to figure out what you could ask/say/do. which is fine for a game. it sux for a \"tool\" reply gopher_space 5 hours agorootparent> like Zorg or whatever Ow, right in the AARP flyer. reply RandomWorker 13 hours agoparentprevFunny fact is that this is core use case I use siri to add things to the reminders app which I have a smart list called \"shopping list.\" It's amazing how great this is, and how many times I use this. reply axolttl88 13 hours agorootparentThis and music control are the uniques cases where Siri Just Works for me. “Add toothpaste to my shopping list” no fluff no nonsense replies, just “I added that to the shopping list” - and it’s on my phone’s Reminders in that list. I wonder how well they’ve optimised Siri for a just few specific use cases like this, because nothing else seems to reliably work on it. reply skinkestek 12 hours agorootparentToday for the first time I asked Siri for the weather forecast for next week and it actually replied in a sensible way. Until now I have only been saying simple commands like \"countdown n minutes\" or \"call my favorite wife\" (I only have one but thankfully she is also my favorite.) reply RandomWorker 10 hours agorootparentprevThere are supposed to be huge updates to siri this year. So lets hope they don't mess up this function. reply bombcar 7 hours agorootparentThe last major update to Siri took it from passably useable to absolute trash. Let’s hope this does better reply maaaaattttt 12 hours agorootparentprevI second this. My two other derived commands I use every day are “remind in 2 hours to do X” or “remind me Friday at 7 to take Y”. This and “timer X minutes”. I would be very sad if these were to disappear or to stop working as well as it does now (I like that if I say “remind me tomorrow” when it’s right past midnight it asks for confirmation that I actually mean the same day since it’s “already tomorrow”) reply netsharc 11 hours agorootparentMy Google Home - Lenovo Smart Clock just says \"I'll remind you today at $TIME\". The device is out of support, it has its glitches (e.g. it's still able to play and pause podcasts, but after pausing it would say \"Sorry. something's gone wrong\", if asking it to snooze an alarm it would say \"OK, alright\" and then \"snoozing for 10 minutes\"), looking forward (not!) to Google making a breaking change and it being e-waste soon. Hah, in the imaginary future where we have cyborg assistants instead of climate destruction, my robot butler will pour half a cup of tea, go back to the kitchen, and then return to pour the second half of the cup, and I'll tell my guest, \"Yeah, it's a 5 year old model, the startup that made him went bust so I'm using a firmware from a Ukranian forum... Джевс, можна мені трохи цукру?\" reply edu 13 hours agorootparentprevI do exactly the same. reply downWidOutaFite 9 hours agorootparentprevI think this kind of highlights the ios vs android user mentality. afavour is annoyed that google is trying to lock them into only using google's shopping list while you love when apple \"just works\" within their ecosystem. reply turquoisevar 6 hours agorootparentAs an iOS user and dev, I’ve been reading these comments confusedly. Apple has exposed Siri to us as developers in several ways, one of which is called “Siri intents.” The long and short of it is that app developers can hook into the Siri system so users can use Siri commands to control certain parts of third-party apps. This means that users aren’t locked into using, say, Apple’s own Reminders app, and they can tell Siri to add things to third-party to-do list apps. Users also have the option to create their own workflow via Shortcuts and give it a command phrase that Siri then responds to. I assumed something similar was available on Android, but the responses indicate that this might not be the case. reply WarOnPrivacy 7 hours agorootparentprev> I think this kind of highlights the ios vs android user mentality. I think for most folks, affordability is more about reality than mentality. Personally, I'd have no use for a free iphone. Android handsets are the only option for the functionality I use. Been that way since WinMo6. reply _nivlac_ 2 hours agoparentprevI had the same issue with the Google Assistant/AnyList integration, and I hacked together a pair of Lambda functions to move Keep list items to an AnyList list. Both unofficial APIs ;) If anybody's curious, repo with most of the code is here: https://github.com/csimpf/keep2anylist. Happy to answer any questions about it! reply pkulak 14 hours agoparentprevI still have a Google Home in the kitchen, but what I really want it to display is data from my weather station, transit info, the time, etc. I can't control that damn thing at all. I've got a TidByt coming today, which I have high hopes for! reply spankalee 14 hours agorootparentI haven't used it myself, but Home Assistant can cast to a Google Home Hub, so afaiu, you can set up a whole dashboard of widgets and controls and use it from a stock Home Hub. reply rohansingh 12 hours agorootparentI'm going to have to try that out, my whole apartment is mostly Google Home-based. That said, we are building a Home Assistant integration at Tidbyt as well. reply jfim 9 hours agorootparentprevAre you referring to casting a URL to open a browser on the home hub? I tried that in the past but it was kinda janky. It's definitely possible with something like https://demille.github.io/url-cast-receiver/ though reply SparkyMcUnicorn 13 hours agorootparentprevAnd touch interface works on the casted lovelace dashboards too! Completely opens up these displays to be a virtually unrestricted canvas for doing or displaying anything you want. reply wolverine876 11 hours agorootparentprevJust setup a monitor with some browser windows on it? Or one browser window with a local page that embeds the info? reply theptip 12 hours agoparentprevThis problem can be solved pretty soon though; given a good enough LLM, and perhaps for power users a configurable set of integrations, you should be able to make any language request, translate it into verbs, and ask for an explanation if you get confusing results. With in-context learning perhaps you can even get to the holy grail of “when I ask for X, please always apply interpretation Y” for personalization. I think the broader context here is that Google is downsizing the current Assistant team in preparation for an LLM-based replacement, perhaps once Gemini has rolled out. reply alganet 12 hours agorootparentMakes sense. What is a good LLM though? I think there's a lot of questions hidden in that part of the solution. reply theptip 10 hours agorootparentYeah, beware “no true Scotsman” here. But I think it’s a reasonable hypothesis that GPT-4 is “good enough” or close to it, and when the current assistant services get wired up to LLMs we’ll see a step function in their utility. Apple and Google are both definitely working on this. OpenAI’s voice mode is closer capability-wise, but doesn’t have the integrations; that would be an obvious product for them to do this year. If this doesn’t seem obvious in 1yr I’d say the hypothesis is likely wrong. reply alganet 9 hours agorootparentSounds to me like a silver bullet idea. \"LLMs will make it good\". I don't think voice is a good interface. \"It chats like a human\" is the lowest possible hanging fruit in terms of product design, and bets everything on the smarts of the tech that's behind it. We are so used to tooling faster than voice. Keyboards and taps are very, very fast. I want digital assistants as smart AND as fast as that, not something smart but incredibly slow to interact with because it needs to dumb itself down to human speech I/O. To me, this is also not about modality or making it more generic. I just don't want an anthropomorphized smart-ass assistant. I want smart tools that actually assist me directly, no chat. reply Cheer2171 9 hours agorootparentAgreed. I find it utterly exhausting to talk to most humans, at least when my goal is purely transactional or functional. Human conversation takes work. Let's save it for what matters. People hate call centers. I don't want to have a conversation with some human or human-parity AI at my airline, I want to change my flight in 3 clicks. In retail and fast food, self-checkout and online or kiosk ordering is popular for a reason. I've found myself feeling those same feelings when being forced to have conversations with a chatbot. Chatting with ChatGPT just for fun can be fun, but it can be just as painful as a call center if you need to get something specific done. In order to cancel a hotel reservation, I was having to chat with some bot. It made it into a whole conversation, with brief pauses. It should have been 3 clicks. reply paradox460 17 hours agoparentprevThe removal of the AnyList integration drove us to get an Alexa assistant device in the kitchen. It still works there Never thought amazon would have the better assistant ecosystem. Google already has my email and calendar and other stuff, Amazon I have to auth into them like a third party. But it's become true reply afavour 17 hours agorootparentI've been meaning to get around to trying an Apple HomePod Mini, the AnyList integration on my iPhone works okay (thought as an infuriating two-step process, \"Hey Siri, add to shopping list\" ... \"milk\") so hopefully it would be replicable on the pod, too. Seems like the least worst option. reply paradox460 17 hours agorootparentI've been playing with homeassistant voice integration and it's pretty darn good There are some gpt and llama experiments you can run there, but it's finally getting to the point where a local assistant you host yourself might be viable soon Getting audio into it and having a little speaker so it can talk back is both the easiest and the hardest part. I need to play around more with some esp32s and microphone modules reply speg 14 hours agorootparentprevI do this on my HomePod mini all the time. Take last apple out of fridge? “Siri, add apples to my grocery list.” Boom, done. Synced with my wife too. This is using the Apple Reminders though, as it seems to have less friction than third party apps… reply 1234letshaveatw 17 hours agoparentprevyou can tell someone lives in California when the most-used assistant feature isn't asking about the weather reply guyzero 12 hours agorootparentI live in California and it's still my most-used feature. I gotta know if I need to dress for 17C or 19C. reply afavour 17 hours agorootparentprevQuite the opposite. I bike the kids to school every morning. The weather is too important to be summed up by a voice summary, I need the hour by hour details. reply danielbln 14 hours agorootparentI can ask Alexa e.g. \"what's the weather at 9am\", that doesn't work with Google Assistant? reply riversflow 14 hours agorootparentNot OP, but I want to see an hour by hour forecast for the day. If there is precip, I want to see an animated active radar view, with forecast frames. “What’s the weather @ time” is inadequate. I live in California(albeit not on the coast or in the valley). reply achates 14 hours agorootparentprev\"The weather in Nijmegen is...\" reply aworks 8 hours agorootparentI tried this and Alexa replied: The temperature in Nyagen, Russia is current -31 degrees...

Turned off Siri. reply nf3 5 hours agoparentprevWho in their right mind would bring this kind of intrusive technology into their home, right into their most intimate space? I seriously don't get it.

Then one day Google decided to disable that integration. Now the only shopping list you can add to is one Google provides If I recall correctly, \"add to my list\" originally went to shoppinglist.google.com. They rolled it into Keep[1] (\"note to self,\" tags, sharing). It works well. However... In 2016, I figured \"tell me showtimes for $MOVIE in $CITY\" should work. It still doesn't work. It may never work, because \"robot butler with ads\" is no one's idea of the future. (Maybe Jeff.) A fire-and-forget voice action like \"add to list\" should still work(?).

It's an amazing tool. Today's voice assistants are the opposite. They are unreliable and completely unstable. They don't have a clear list of commands they understand, let alone some sort of menu system - the documented commands on the manufacturer's websites often don't work. They also randomly change what they can do: stuff stops working for no obviously reason. For example - yesterday, my son's Nest Audio suddenly refused to set a music alarm, claiming \"this device doesn't support that feature yet\" (it's literally a speaker for music...). It worked the day before. reply jfim 9 hours agorootparentprevVim has an actual manual and things stay relatively stable across releases. It's not the case for the voice assistants, where stuff breaks randomly and features are added/removed without notification. reply dotancohen 9 hours agorootparentWell then the problem seems to not be with the fundamental lack of discoverablility by UI poking, rather at the lack of official documentation. reply genman 17 hours agoparentprevThis looks like an anti competitive action that should be investigated. reply lxgr 6 hours agorootparentI think Google has actually removed all third-party integrations for Assistant a while ago: https://developers.google.com/assistant/ca-sunset In other words, they have just closed down that entire ecosystem.

My Android phone used to remember where I parked and show it on my Google Now feed and a push notification as I headed out, all without ever asking it to do anything. The travel.google.com site used to show my itineraries without ever adding them there. Hotels, flights, car rentals, and more would be aggregated. Doesn't do that anymore. You used to just be able to search for \"my flights\" on Google and it'd tell you about you about your upcoming flights. reply leros 13 hours agoparentThe old Google Now feed was amazing. Showed me where my car is parked. Told me when to leave to arrive places in time. Pulled up my flight details automatically. Now it's just a bunch of click bait articles. reply rezonant 13 hours agorootparentIt was fantastic. It's worth noting that Pixel's At a Glance does still tell you when to leave (and you get a notification), but as far as I can tell, the parking features are completely gone. That being said, I no longer have any clue what features exist in Google's ecosystem because their A/B and feature flag rollout system is so fundamentally broken and misused by the product teams that some features literally never arrive for some users until they factory reset their devices, and suddenly they get a fresh set of feature flags. I am still waiting on just about all of the new RCS features Google announced months ago, and just yesterday I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out why my partner's devices never received cross device timers while all of my devices do. That feature was launched in May of last year. My partner does a lot of the cooking, and our kitchen Nest Hub usually handles the timers. But only my phone and tablet receive it's timer status... I say misused above, because it strongly appears that they announce features before completion and then use an extremely shallow rollout to finish the features with the cover of \"finding bugs\". Is it actually released if the only Google accounts that receive the flags are the dev and product team members? Google, you've perverted a fantastic engineering practice into a broken mess that reduces your user's confidence in your product and breeds confusion that hurts your brand. reply kccqzy 11 hours agorootparentI have a very similar experience. When I bought an EV I wanted to turn on Google Maps' energy efficient routing feature (announced in 2021 at https://blog.google/products/maps/3-new-ways-navigate-more-s...) but the setting is simply not present. After an hour of wasted time debugging, I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get the setting to show up. I personally much prefer Apple's approach where generally features are identified by specific version numbers. If you have the version or newer, you have it.

It's incredible to me that my experience with my Nexus One in 2010 was better than it is today with a Pixel 7. The fact that it arbitrarily decides to not recognize some contacts on some days. The fact that it can't handle me spelling out a street name when it insists on replacing the street name that I'm saying with something completely different. The fact that YouTube Music would always play \"some driving music\" that it chooses over my playlist literally called \"Driving Music\", when I would say \"Play my Driving Music Playlist on YouTube Music\". And now the assistant is getting even less personalized, which means it will care even less about what you're literally saying, and just send you into a swamp of generic assumptions. Assistants were SO much more usable when they would require strict trigger language, and interpret it literally and formulaically.

You can still schedule a new event. - Asking to take certain actions by voice, such as send a payment, make a reservation, or post to social media. You can still ask Assistant to open your installed apps. - Asking to meditate with Calm. You can still ask for meditation options with media providers such as YouTube. All of these seem to fall under the umbrella of \"features that actually make the assistant an assistant\"/connecting the assistant to other apps, which I imagine is exactly the opposite of where the Assistant trend is going, especially with LLMs. Just speaking to a device about which action you want to take and not needing to think which app you need to open and navigate feels like the UX of the future, whatever this is seems like the opposite. reply jpcfl 18 hours agoparentMy guess is that a lot of these features are hard-coded, and they are deprecating them in order to replace them with a more generic LLM-based assistant. reply alejo 7 hours agorootparentIf this was the case, wouldn’t had been better to axe these features once they were ready to roll out the new LLM-based functionality? reply hughesjj 3 hours agorootparentNo you see, this way they can't easily roll back if the LLM functionality sucks and that's somehow better reply aquova 14 hours agorootparentprevAnd despite how bullish everyone seems to be on LLMs, I suspect we'll see those very same LLM features get ripped out within 5 years or so. reply tlogan 14 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps, but it seems like a strange approach.

Assistant has trained our household into thinking that its pretty limited in what it can do so everyone in our home only uses it for basic things. Since Google's assistant can't accomplish more than most basic tasks people don't use more than the basic tasks. No one wants to learn the appropriate subset of English to speak the Google assistant dialect. You really need the voice assistants to be reliable and basic or extremely capable. There is no real middle ground here for most users. Hopefully once LLMs get more integrated with voice assistants we will move more towards the extremely capable side of the spectrum. reply esafak 14 hours agorootparentJust because an LLM can better parse what you're saying it does not mean the business logic to act on it exists.

I like that it's at least slightly smaller than the Pixel 7. reply eterm 14 hours agorootparentIt's hard to describe what exactly I don't like. Initially I thought it was just a muscle memory thing but I've had it long enough now that I've got used to the different UI for everyday things and try to use it's shortcuts on my old phone. But overall I don't like it. I don't like how it handles notifications, it seems to hide most of them, and the ones it does show it doesn't show in a useful way compared to my old phone. What exactly is different I can't say, but it's weird. It also handles permissions differently. Some apps when I disable certain permissons get stuck in a permission loop because they can't cope with the idea of only having a particular permission denied. I never had this problem with my old phone despite it also having granular permissions. Seems to be related to a change in how notification permissions are handled exactly. I don't like how I can't quickly change the ringer volume. It used to be a separate slider when I hit the volume on my old phone. Changing now is a gamble and finding how to get it to vibrate mode seems beyond me. 1Password used to allow biometric unlock on my old phone. I can't get that to work on my new phone so have to type the master password (extremely long password) on a mobile device, which makes it useless to me. I'm not going to type my master password on a phone keypad in public, that's asking for it to leak. The fingerprint sensor is okay, but I preferred the below-screen sensor on my old phone. It's fiddly to get back to the home screen. On my old phone if I scanned my thumbprint it would go back to home. On the pixel it's a finicky swipe-up-from-the-bottom thing which sometimes goes home and sometimes goes to an app-switcher. Setting up the phone required giving google rather more permissions than I was comfortable with, but denying them locked out key features of the phone so I felt forced to accept. The pixel 8 is also slightly smaller than my old phone, though of course I knew that when I bought it. I didn't realise how much 0.1inches was going to feel like a major loss. I didn't want to go over-sized with the pixel 8 pro though. Overall a downgrade and really horrible experience compared to my old phone, which I only replaced because it was so old and stopped getting regular updates. It was a Huawei P20 pro and in terms of general use still feels just as fast as it did when it was new. The only feature I like that the pixel 8 has which my old phone doesn't is the wireless charging. That's a game changer when it comes to preventing wires wearing out. reply disillusioned 12 hours agorootparent>I don't like how it handles notifications, it seems to hide most of them, and the ones it does show it doesn't show in a useful way compared to my old phone.

The displays want to show you stuff, but the non-displays will tend to give you an answer. e.g. \"what time does walmart close\" will respond with \"there are several stores in your area\" and then show you a list of stores with their hours, but the non-display devices will just reference the closest store and tell you when it closes. reply culopatin 7 hours agorootparentI’ve had the Google assistant for a long time now, and it went from almost always having an answer to “sorry, I don’t understand ” or whatever the default is 30% of the time reply BonoboIO 13 hours agorootparentprevI found this on the web for you reply duffyjp 13 hours agoparentprevSiri must not like me, she never does what I want. \"Hey Siri, turn off my alarm\" (ignores me) \"Hey Siri, turn off my alarm\" (ignores me) \"Hey Siri, I'm going to buy an Android\" (turns off alarm, refuses to elaborate) reply fragmede 13 hours agorootparentMy favorite problem is \"Hey Siri, navigate home\" proceeds to open navigation and send me to a place that isn't my home.

Assistant alienated a lot of other departments from 2016-2020 with their rapid rise and rapid growth in headcount (and ability to push integrations through whether they were a good idea or not). Then they failed to make significant money, right into an economic environment where making money was prioritized much more highly than speculative researchey new markets. These changes are them trying to make themselves indispensable to other PA's metrics, so that when budgets are set, they can argue \"You can't cut Assistant, look at the drop in searches & YouTube views that would result in.\" Same reason why they were hit harder in the layoffs than other more profitable products. reply gerash 11 hours agoprevWhen Amazon echo came out, all the flaws of voice assistant were visible and it looked like a glorified kitchen timer but it's surprising how little they improved over the years.

I can see how this is absolutely frustrating for someone who uses one of these commands regularly. 2. At the same time, one of the issues with voice commands relative to say keyboard input is the lack of delineation. If I hit Ctrl + Enter on my keyboard, there's no way for the computer to interpret that any differently. However, that's not the case with voice commands. It needs to keep determining (a) what I said, (b) whether it's a command or just voice, (c) whether it's a command it's supposed to execute and that's before it even figures out waht to execute. But the problem is that as the number of voice commands increases, the number of false \"this is a command and not just voice\" triggers will increase. There's probably a genuine benefit for Google's users in the universe of commands being very small as long as the command that's removed is not one they use. I've noticed several of the options are \"you can use a custom routine to do this instead\". Maybe Google should have included the custom routine and made it togglable. reply steelframe 6 hours agoprevI once interviewed someone working in the Google Assistant org.

Some of them are probably reading HN today. But for the economy, it could be a good thing: Talent moving from moribund, unambitious, lower-return businesses to dynamic, often new ones that are hiring and expanding for an optimistic future.

Right now companies arent being penalized for layoffs because there's some uneasiness about the impact of the feds actions. A lot of people expected a recession from pushing interest rates this high, but it hasn't happened. Once it's clear that there will be no recession from the fed's actions (ie: when rates drop), CEOs will be fully responsible for their company's poor performance in the eyes of the market. reply nostrademons 16 hours agoparentprevIt's January. This is when annual budgets are set. Layoffs are a natural consequence of \"the budget for this year is smaller than last year\". Hell, even if the budget is the same size, it'll result in layoffs if anyone got promoted, anyone got cost-of-living raises, etc. A 4% cost-of-living adjustment for everyone results in a ~4% layoff if annual budgets remain constant. Also, the market is predicting rate cuts in March. There is always the chance of the market being wrong, and several prominent institutions (notably Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase) have said they believe this is overly optimistic and it's unclear if we're even done with rate hikes, let alone rate cuts. The Fed statements themselves do not come anywhere close to what the market is predicting - the dot plot (which has trended overoptimistic for the last 3 years) predicts 3 rate cuts, while the market predicts 7. reply lamontcg 17 hours agoparentprevThe Fed's suggestion of 3 rate cuts down to 4.5% are still quite high compared to the period of a decade of essentially ZIRP that preceded it. The futures market expectation of 6 rate cuts is likely equivalent to a bet that there will be a recession by the year's end. Either way you have \"end-of-cheap-money\" conditions or \"recession\" conditions and so the ZIRP-fueled hiring boom needs to get reversed. Honestly I don't think there's much of a distinction and that the end-of-cheap-money leads to these kinds of layoffs which will eventually trigger a recession, combined with vulnerable sectors of the economy (commercial real estate, private equity) popping. For all the fanfare that we've managed to hit a soft landing, the historically based fed-cycle recession predictions were always that a recession typically comes 6-12 months after the Fed STOPS hiking rates -- which means this July. reply octobus2021 14 hours agoparentprevAlso, effect of rising interest rates takes time to propagate. When mortgage rates skyrocket, mortgage originators can still go on for a few months even though they're not making any sales, as nobody's buying real estate. After a few months it becomes clear that sellers are not willing to decrease their prices and Fed is not going to cut rates any time soon, the game's over and they have to cut staff or even go out of business. Startups can continue to operate for a few months burning through their reserves even though nobody's investing in them until they... can't. When the price of bonds that banks have on their assets plunges due to increase in interest rates (they are \"marked to market\"). Depending on their regulatory requirements it can take a quarter or two. As a result the ratio of the assets of the banks in relation to their liabilities decreases. That's what caused SV bank to collapse (they had less money than they had liabilities and had to fold due to the bank run). In the case of citibank they had to put $1.7 bln into the government deposit insurance fund, which is likely related to the same phenomenon. Interestingly enough, they also reported that a big part of their one-time expenses ($3.8 bln total) included reorganization expenses, e.g. all the severance they had to pay to the people they laid off in 2023 and other costs related to cutting those people. Even more interesting, they expect the expense related to cutting 20,000 people to be between $700,000 and $1 billion. All things considered, Citibank doesn't strike me as a particularly well run organization, and low-level employees are paying the price.

Now that the stock market will probably immediately reward you if you just recite the mantra \"we overhired, COVID, etc\", it's just the latest way to juice your stock price. There's enough padding when you have thousands of employees that your products won't suffer too much, and it gives you an excuse to reorg and perhaps find more efficiencies in the process. In theory, I can see the draw of \"a reset will make us faster\". Of course, new efficiencies aren't guaranteed and the company's output may stay the same or shrink in the future, but at least the shareholders got more money. Layoffs in December can potentially be bad press, so what we're seeing now is the execution of the 2023 plan to Big Reset before the market judges this type of move as a bad look again.

How then could the dual mandate be the cause of the effect? reply nostrademons 15 hours agorootparentThey had an informal dual mandate to maximize employment and minimize inflation before then, but the purpose of the Federal Reserve as created was to preserve financial stability, avoid financial panics, and maximize employment. In other words, they had half of the dual mandate, the half that involved injecting money when times were bad to stabilize the system. The government codified the inflation mandate in response to the 1970s inflation. The phenomena of dropping rates when a recession is impending is congruent with the \"maximize employment\" portion of their mandate, which predated 1977.

I know people who take a job there and JPM nickel & dimes you on the way in, lies about target bonus not being prorated first year, and then also gives 0 raise first year. Cute stuff like \"forgetting\" to pay starting bonuses for months, etc. I've heard YoY raises that are some of the worst in the industry. To the point that leaving for a competitor is an easy 50%-100% increase in TC because of 5-10 years of surpassed raises. Another example, in 2020 when COVID hit they did some wide ranging bonus cuts to offset increases in loan reserves for expected credit losses during the pandemic.

It's super easy to reach them too, and this is with a basic checking account only. Their checking account is free with no penalties as long as you direct deposit $500 / month OR keep $1,500 in there, for most folks on this site the first option means you only need to keep the bare minimum in there to pay your bills.

I wonder how people pay rent, mortgage, and other expenses with so many layoffs. reply ptero 17 hours agoparentI am not trying to sound flippant, but layoffs happen, and especially at companies that are not doing well (and Citigroup is not managing money well) they are normal. Then, those working at Citigroup are likely to get some form of severance. While I do not know the exact composition of the layoffs I suspect that many of those are well paid and have comfortable cushion. Furthermore, US economy is still chugging along and the unemployment is low by historical standards, so a significant portion of those laid off will likely find another job. They can also downsize and/or move to an area with lower cost of living. None of this is pleasant, but it is not the end of the world. My 2c. reply pixl97 17 hours agorootparentUnemployment is historically low, but costs are historically high. In 2008 we saw that the state change from good to bad can happen rapidly and contagiously between industries. > They can also downsize and/or move to an area with lower cost of living. No, not really. There are simply no housing units available in the US to do that. All new housing is huge 2000sq/ft +. In addition housing prices are just off the charts for small houses. Your low cost of living places (I have family that lives in places like that) still want $250,000+ for a house that was around or under $100,000 less than a decade ago. reply ptero 15 hours agorootparentI did not claim that being laid off for those Citi employees would go unnoticed. Their standard of living would drop, but they would not have to live in a tent. There are many towns with low cost of housing. If those are too expensive to buy, one can rent (and probably should anyway, just to figure out the new area). The ratio of median house price to median household income today is a little higher than, say, the average over the last 50 years, but it is not 5 times higher. There is indeed plenty of housing scattered around the flyover counties. For sure, it is less pleasant than in a rich suburban town. Those small towns do not have walkable downtowns or many cafes and eating out means a basic diner (they do not have good restaurants and entertainment precisely because affluent families moved to metros). You are very unlikely to resell it later for a massive profit. But the basics (water, sewer, electricity, groceries) are there and one can certainly live there if laid off and not envisioning good prospects for the next few years. My 2c. reply nradov 17 hours agorootparentprevCome on, stop making up nonsense.

Some commenters have falsely claimed that there are no jobs available in lower cost of living areas, which we can see is obviously wrong based on the unemployment rate. The fact that San Francisco has a slightly lower unemployment rate doesn't invalidate that point. Compared to SF, Cleveland has much better housing affordability as measured by absolute price, median price to income ratio, home ownership rate, or any other reasonable metric. And there's nothing special about Cleveland; many other cities have similar or better affordability. reply bugglebeetle 12 hours agorootparentI didn’t miss any point because you’re the one who is creating false equivalencies between all US cities on the basis of unemployment rates. That there are jobs doesn’t mean that there are jobs that align with everyone’s work experiences, familial ties, or various other obligations. If I get laid off in the bay as an ML engineer and have an elderly parent who lives there that I need to take care of, that there are jobs at Sherman Williams in Cleveland isn’t very useful to me. Similarly, if I’m mid-career and pursue work in LCOL area that cuts my pay in half relative to a larger city, that could derail my lifetime earnings and ability to retire. Reality is more complicated than the simplistic narratives people use to victim blame or reinforce their just-world fantasies. reply dehrmann 16 hours agorootparentprev> unemployment is low by historical standards, so a significant portion of those laid off will likely find another job It feels like the layoffs have mostly been in banking and tech, and that gets hidden in the overall unemployment rate. reply nly 17 hours agoparentprevI got laid off this week.

I take issue with OP's claim that large layoffs necessarily imply recession. Unless you know that the laid off workers aren't rehired by a competitor, you don't know if the layoff isn't just an outcome of competition. The national unemployment rate is a proxy for it. At least at the first order, if a large number of people are being laid off (and this isn't the first layoff in the sector, Wells Fargo has cut over 40k jobs from their peak) then so far they are being rehired. And I agree with you, desk workers aren't going to take a $15/hr job at the Flying J, which is why I believe they were likely to be hired either by competition or at least in occupations consistent with their skill set and aspirations, else we'd see them show up in unemployment stats.

That is, if you have a valid argument for something, then you should accept the conclusion. Even if the conclusion is unpopular, or inconvenient, or you don’t like it. He envisioned an art of rationality that would make people believe something after it had been proven to them. And I nodded my head, because it sounded reasonable enough, and it wasn’t until a few hours later that I thought about it again and went “Wait, no, that would be a terrible idea.” I don’t think I’m overselling myself too much to expect that I could argue circles around the average uneducated person. Like I mean that on most topics, I could demolish their position and make them look like an idiot. Reduce them to some form of “Look, everything you say fits together and I can’t explain why you’re wrong, I just know you are!” Or, more plausibly, “Shut up I don’t want to talk about this!” And there are people who can argue circles around me. Maybe not on every topic, but on topics where they are experts and have spent their whole lives honing their arguments. When I was young I used to read pseudohistory books; Immanuel Velikovsky’s Ages in Chaos is a good example of the best this genre has to offer. I read it and it seemed so obviously correct, so perfect, that I could barely bring myself to bother to search out rebuttals. And then I read the rebuttals, and they were so obviously correct, so devastating, that I couldn’t believe I had ever been so dumb as to believe Velikovsky. And then I read the rebuttals to the rebuttals, and they were so obviously correct that I felt silly for ever doubting. And so on for several more iterations, until the labyrinth of doubt seemed inescapable. What finally broke me out wasn’t so much the lucidity of the consensus view so much as starting to sample different crackpots. Some were almost as bright and rhetorically gifted as Velikovsky, all presented insurmountable evidence for their theories, and all had mutually exclusive ideas. After all, Noah’s Flood couldn’t have been a cultural memory both of the fall of Atlantis and of a change in the Earth’s orbit, let alone of a lost Ice Age civilization or of megatsunamis from a meteor strike. So given that at least some of those arguments are wrong and all seemed practically proven, I am obviously just gullible in the field of ancient history. Given a total lack of independent intellectual steering power and no desire to spend thirty years building an independent knowledge base of Near Eastern history, I choose to just accept the ideas of the prestigious people with professorships in Archaeology, rather than those of the universally reviled crackpots who write books about Venus being a comet. You could consider this a form of epistemic learned helplessness, where I know any attempt to evaluate the arguments is just going to be a bad idea so I don’t even try. If you have a good argument that the Early Bronze Age worked completely differently from the way mainstream historians believe, I just don’t want to hear about it. If you insist on telling me anyway, I will nod, say that your argument makes complete sense, and then totally refuse to change my mind or admit even the slightest possibility that you might be right. (This is the correct Bayesian action: if I know that a false argument sounds just as convincing as a true argument, argument convincingness provides no evidence either way. I should ignore it and stick with my prior.) I consider myself lucky in that my epistemic learned helplessness is circumscribed; there are still cases where I’ll trust the evidence of my own reason. In fact, I trust it in most cases other than infamously deceptive arguments in fields I know little about. But I think the average uneducated person doesn’t and shouldn’t. Anyone anywhere – politicians, scammy businessmen, smooth-talking romantic partners – would be able to argue them into anything. And so they take the obvious and correct defensive maneuver – they will never let anyone convince them of any belief that sounds “weird”. (and remember that, if you grow up in the right circles, beliefs along the lines of “astrology doesn’t work” sound “weird”.) This is starting to resemble ideas like compartmentalization and taking ideas seriously. The only difference between their presentation and mine is that I’m saying that for 99% of people, 99% of the time, taking ideas seriously is the wrong strategy. Or, at the very least, it should be the last skill you learn, after you’ve learned every other skill that allows you to know which ideas are or are not correct. The people I know who are best at taking ideas seriously are those who are smartest and most rational. I think people are working off a model where these co-occur because you need to be very clever to resist your natural and detrimental tendency not to take ideas seriously. But I think they might instead co-occur because you have to be really smart in order for taking ideas seriously not to be immediately disastrous. You have to be really smart not to have been talked into enough terrible arguments to develop epistemic learned helplessness. Even the smartest people I know have a commendable tendency not to take certain ideas seriously. Bostrom’s simulation argument, the anthropic doomsday argument, Pascal’s Mugging – I’ve never heard anyone give a coherent argument against any of these, but I’ve also never met anyone who fully accepts them and lives life according to their implications. A friend tells me of a guy who once accepted fundamentalist religion because of Pascal’s Wager. I will provisionally admit that this person “takes ideas seriously”. Everyone else gets partial credit, at best. Which isn’t to say that some people don’t do better than others. Terrorists seem pretty good in this respect. People used to talk about how terrorists must be very poor and uneducated to fall for militant Islam, and then someone did a study and found that they were disproportionately well-off, college educated people (many were engineers). I’ve heard a few good arguments in this direction before, things like how engineering trains you to have a very black-and-white right-or-wrong view of the world based on a few simple formulae, and this meshes with fundamentalism better than it meshes with subtle liberal religious messages. But to these I’d add that a sufficiently smart engineer has never been burned by arguments above his skill level before, has never had any reason to develop epistemic learned helplessness. If Osama comes up to him with a really good argument for terrorism, he thinks “Oh, there’s a good argument for terrorism. I guess I should become a terrorist,” as opposed to “Arguments? You can prove anything with arguments. I’ll just stay right here and not blow myself up.” Responsible doctors are at the other end of the spectrum from terrorists here. I once heard someone rail against how doctors totally ignored all the latest and most exciting medical studies. The same person, practically in the same breath, then railed against how 50% to 90% of medical studies are wrong. These two observations are not unrelated. Not only are there so many terrible studies, but pseudomedicine (not the stupid homeopathy type, but the type that links everything to some obscure chemical on an out-of-the-way metabolic pathway) has, for me, proven much like pseudohistory – unless I am an expert in that particular subsubfield of medicine, it can sound very convincing even when it’s very wrong. The medical establishment offers a shiny tempting solution. First, a total unwillingness to trust anything, no matter how plausible it sounds, until it’s gone through an endless cycle of studies and meta-analyses. Second, a bunch of Institutes and Collaborations dedicated to filtering through all these studies and analyses and telling you what lessons you should draw from them. I’m glad that some people never develop epistemic learned helplessness, or develop only a limited amount of it, or only in certain domains. It seems to me that although these people are more likely to become terrorists or Velikovskians or homeopaths, they’re also the only people who can figure out if something basic and unquestionable is wrong, and make this possibility well-known enough that normal people start becoming willing to consider it. But I’m also glad epistemic learned helplessness exists. It seems like a pretty useful social safety valve most of the time. This entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged rationality, repost.

Virtually everyone involved from the supreme court on down had VERY good, VERY convincing arguments for compulsory sterilization (both legal and scientific). I enjoy pointing out that in Buck v. Bell, the only time the supreme court has touched this issue (and upheld a compulsory sterilization law) the lone dissent was not the uber-progressive Louis Brandeis, or the chimeric but utterly brilliant Oliver Wendall Holmes, or most of the court’s conservative wing that later opposed the New Deal almost whole cloth… it was the curmudgeonly catholic, Pierce Butler…who was just about the most unlikeable guy to a modern legal analyst. He was wrong about EVERYTHING…except this. Maybe he just got lucky. His dissent was silent. I can’t say whether it was his catholicism, his curmugeonlyness, or something else, that lead him to what I must assume is the “correct” conclusion that the state cannot compel sterilization using the same powers it uses to, say, compel vaccination..but it intrigues me that somehow, he was the ONLY ONE that got this right. Hide Doctor Locketopus says: June 3, 2019 at 5:55 pm ~new~ Hmm… according to Wikipedia (yeah, I know) Butler was also the lone dissenter in Palko v. Connecticut, which decided 8-1 that the Fifth Amendment prohibition of double jeopardy did not apply to the states (Butler thought it clearly did apply, based on the 14th Amendment). Palko was executed. Butler’s position was later vindicated when Palko v. Connecticut was overturned by Benton v. Maryland. He did oppose many of Roosevelt’s New Deal power-grab laws, rightly in my opinion. Hide ↑ Clutzy says: June 3, 2019 at 9:11 pm ~new~ Lawyer here. Just going to disagree with the Holmes was brilliant thing. I think he was trendy and fairly pedestrian outside of that. Hide ↑ theodidactus says: June 4, 2019 at 10:53 am ~new~ I think Holmes should get major points simply for being such an exceptionally good writer/explainer. Surely you can give him that, right? Hide ↑ Clutzy says: June 4, 2019 at 1:12 pm ~new~ He was a good writer. As an explainer I’d say he is fairly deficient. As least when it comes to explaining why he came to his trendy legal conclusions. Hide ↑ Steve Sailer says: June 4, 2019 at 1:49 am ~new~ If you look at sterilization laws by state, Catholic states were less likely to fall for the eugenics fad. Southern Baptist states were in the middle, and mainline progressive Protestant states trending toward secularism tended to be the most enthusiastic for eugenics. John Glad’s book “Jewish Eugenics” points out that Jews tended to be fairly enthusiastic for eugenics until the late 1960s. So the votes of Holmes (who was pretty much of a nihilist Protestant) and Brandeis were not out of line with their demographics. Hide ↑ theodidactus says: June 4, 2019 at 6:43 am ~new~ Absolutely, I’ve pointed that out before, largely in the context of saying that my own views tend to eerily conform to Catholicism even though I renounced the religion decades ago. Maybe we’re just products of what we learn in the first 10 or so sessions of sunday school. Hide ↑ pqjk2 says: June 4, 2019 at 9:30 am ~new~ username checks out Hide ↑ MereComments says: June 4, 2019 at 9:42 am ~new~ Or, maybe your views tend eerily towards Catholicism because Catholicism reflects the truth of the world. 😀 Hide ↑ theodidactus says: June 4, 2019 at 10:58 am ~new~ Well if that’s true it’s weird I absorbed all the stuff on the periphery, but none of the stuff at the hub (to my memory I believed in god about as long as I believed in Santa Claus). Here’s the fun one I bring up a lot. I’m atheist, by my understanding of the term. I hang out with a lot of other atheists…but most of them are ex-protestant. Their whole approach strikes me as VERY different from the other ex-catholic atheists I know. Not to knock them (or all the wonderful ex-protestant atheists out here) but I personally feel that ex-catholic atheists are much more amenable to chesterton’s-fence-type arguments, especially when they involve tolerating people with views and opinions very different from your own. (One can obviously see how this relates to the Eugenics issue). I also notice Ex-catholic atheists in my experience anyway have a much stronger attraction to supernatural/pseudoscientific concepts, even if they don’t believe them. (Hence the screenname). When I start talking about alchemy or scientology most atheists are like “well, that’s some bullshit. Next topic.” but I notice ex-catholic atheists seem to be more likely to be like “oooh cool!” Hide ↑ Steve Sailer says: June 4, 2019 at 10:04 pm ~new~ G.K. Chesterton, a convert to Catholicism, published a 1922 book entitled “Eugenics and Other Evils:” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eugenics_and_other_Evils Chesterton’s frenemy G.K. Shaw was a famous promoter of eugenics, as was H.G. Wells. There was a dinner for Francis Galton in 1904 in which Shaw and Wells made over-the-top extremist pro-eugenics speeches. Galton made a few cryptic remarks at the end, which I interpret as him rolling his eyes at how far Shaw and Wells were taking his idea (although I might be wrong about that). Hide ↑ Murphy says: June 4, 2019 at 3:41 am ~new~ This is something I find with a number of things. When it comes to issues where a huge fraction of the population held or hold a position…. normally there’s actually a pretty solid philosophical foundation. I think I mentioned in the last thread that at some point I want to try to create a flow chart of all the reasonably coherent/consistent positions on abortion and their philosophical underpinnings since that’s one area I used to enjoy digging into. I’m still pro-choice but that’s because I still have the same precepts… but I can see very well that a few changes of precepts would lead to a different conclusion. But as a result I find it almost distressing to see almost any /r/politics type discussion on the subject where people genuinely seem to believe that their opponents could only ever reach their position from a basis of “we hate women” People seem almost afraid of letting anyone hear the coherent and logical versions of their opponents positions. But the same goes for lots of things. Eugenics is one such. Story book eugenicists stand around kackling about wanting to advance evil. Real world eugenicists were able to point to children suffering horribly and say that that was a bad thing. To anyone familiar with animal husbandry eugenics would seem to fall out as a natural consequence. You can have a healthy herd in the wild by letting predators cull the sickly and weak or in captivity you have to do something else if you don’t want to see a herd of very sickly animals. The call for someone to manage the group’s reproduction would naturally fall out of the same kind of sentiments that call for educating the poor ,feeding the hungry and protecting the shared commons. If my precepts didn’t instead lead me to transhumanism and the general belief that it’ll all be a bit irrelevant as we get better at manipulating biology directly it would seem very logical to me. But since I don’t believe it will be an issue for enough generations to really matter it does not. Hide ↑ theodidactus says: June 4, 2019 at 6:28 am ~new~ Minnesota’s sterilization regime is the best example of “well meaning” eugenics I’ve found. It grew directly out of its child protection and welfare system, and all the primary sources I’ve encountered lead me to believe two of its three progenitors were extremely concerned well meaning people who cared a great deal about the people they were sterilizing. The third fellow, Dight (wiki him), was a bit of a fanatic and famously wrote fanmail to Hitler. Hide ↑ Jiro says: June 4, 2019 at 7:34 am ~new~ When it comes to issues where a huge fraction of the population held or hold a position…. normally there’s actually a pretty solid philosophical foundation. This fails when it comes to memes (in the pre-Internet meme sense). A huge fraction of the population believes in transsubstantiation because Catholicism succeeded in killing and converting enough people and getting them to teach itself to their children. There’s a philosophical foundation, of course, but the merits of that philosophical foundation are irrelevant (and the fact that non-Catholics don’t accept it seems to indicate it’s worthless). Hide ↑ The original Mr. X says: June 4, 2019 at 8:03 am ~new~ This fails when it comes to memes (in the pre-Internet meme sense). A huge fraction of the population believes in transsubstantiation because Catholicism succeeded in killing and converting enough people and getting them to teach itself to their children. “Catholicism” did no such thing, because “Catholicism” is an abstraction and hence not an agent. What actually happened is that people were persuaded by other people to convert and then taught their new beliefs to their children. There’s a philosophical foundation, of course, but the merits of that philosophical foundation are irrelevant (and the fact that non-Catholics don’t accept it seems to indicate it’s worthless). It indicates nothing of the sort; all it indicates is that people who accept the philosophical foundations of Catholicism generally become Catholics. Which, like, duh, what did you expect? Hide ↑ Jiro says: June 5, 2019 at 10:49 am ~new~ all it indicates is that people who accept the philosophical foundations of Catholicism generally become Catholics. To a very close approximation, nobody becomes Catholics because they accept the philosophical foundations of Catholicism. They become Catholics because they were raised Catholic, or perhaps to marry into a Catholic family, or some similar reason. You don’t see a population of people not raised Catholic who come to say “transsubstantiation makes sense, and so I have to become Catholic”. If there was any substance to transsubstantiation, you would expect this to happen. Hide ↑ Mary says: June 5, 2019 at 5:50 pm ~new~ Perhaps you are not looking in the right place. I have certainly heard of people who became Catholics because they became convinced of transsubstantiation. Hide ↑ Murphy says: June 4, 2019 at 8:17 am ~new~ philosophical foundation vs factual foundation. If you believe in souls and life after death (something a lot of people believe in because people tend to really really want to believe there’s something) then various things fall out of that. that we have no proof of the existence of such puts an awful big hole in the factual foundation but not the philosophical. It’s like a mathematical proof that starts with “assuming XYZ to be true”, it still a perfectly good proof even if XYZ turns out to not be true in the real world. Hide ↑ Mary says: June 4, 2019 at 5:33 pm ~new~ Do you have proof that we do not have proof of the existence of such? After all, a lot of people really really want to believe there’s no such proof. Hide ↑ notpeerreviewed says: June 4, 2019 at 12:21 pm ~new~ I’m not sure cackling was involved, but most real-world eugenicists do not come off well to modern readers. They justified eugenics almost exclusively in collectivist terms – national strength, progress of the Caucasian race, and stuff like that. Do you have an example of a prominent eugenicist who relied heavily on arguments about suffering children? Hide ↑ Deiseach says: June 4, 2019 at 2:41 pm ~new~ I’m not sure cackling was involved, but most real-world eugenicists do not come off well to modern readers. An example from 1895, from a story entitled “The S.S.” by M.P. Shiel – it’s very florid prose, about a reclusive detective in the vein of Poe’s Chevalier Dupin who investigates a rash of suicides and murders, and discovers a secret “Society of Sparta” which takes upon itself the eugenic duty to weed out the unfit (so it painlessly poisons both rich and poor who are producing hordes of sickly children, and these mysterious deaths inflame the susceptible into copy-cat suicides). The protagonist, if not approving of how they’re going about it, does approve of the principles behind it, and has a long speech about the unintended consequences of modern medicine allowing the sickly and unfit to live (I’ve pruned it down as much as I could): And now let me apply these facts to the Europe of our own time. We no longer have world-serious war — but in its place we have a scourge, the effect of which on the modern state is precisely the same as the effect of war on the ancient, only, — in the end, — far more destructive, far more subtle, sure, horrible, disgusting. The name of this pestilence is Medical Science. Yes, it is most true, shudder — shudder — as you will! Man’s best friend turns to an asp in his bosom to sting him to the basest of deaths. The devastating growth of medical, and especially surgical, science — that, if you like, for us all, is “the question of the hour!” And what a question! of what surpassing importance, in the presence of which all other “questions” whatever dwindle into mere academic triviality. For just as the ancient State was wounded to the heart through the death of her healthy sons in the field, just so slowly, just so silently, is the modern receiving deadly hurt by the botching and tinkering of her unhealthy children. The net result is in each case the same — the altered ratio of the total amount of reproductive health to the total amount of reproductive disease. …We are at this very time, if I mistake not, on the verge of new insights which will enable man to laugh at disease — laugh at it in the sense of over-ruling its natural tendency to produce death, not by any means in the sense of destroying its ever-expanding existence. Do you know that at this moment your hospitals are crammed with beings in human likeness suffering from a thousand obscure and subtly-ineradicable ills, all of whom, if left alone, would die almost at once, but ninety in the hundred of whom will, as it is, be sent forth “cured,” like missionaries of hell, and the horrent shapes of Night and Acheron, to mingle in the pure river of humanity the poison-taint of their protean vileness? Do you know that in your schools one-quarter of the children are already purblind? Have you gauged the importance of your tremendous consumption of quack catholicons, of the fortunes derived from their sale, of the spread of modern nervous disorders, of toothless youth and thrice loathsome age among the helot-classes? Do you know that in the course of my late journey to London, I walked from Piccadilly Circus to Hyde Park Corner, during which time I observed some five hundred people, of whom twenty-seven only were perfectly healthy, well-formed men, and eighteen healthy, beautiful women? …Less death, more disease — that is the sad, the unnatural record; children especially — so sensitive to the physician’s art — living on by hundreds of thousands, bearing within them the germs of wide-spreading sorrow, who in former times would have died. And if you consider that the proper function of the doctor is the strictly limited one of curing the curable, rather than of self-gloriously perpetuating the incurable, you may find it difficult to give a quite rational answer to this simple question: why? So any of you who had to wear glasses as kids (‘one-quarter of the children already purblind in the schools’), and are maybe now all grown up and married with kids of your own, how very dare you shapes of Night and Acheron mingle the poison-taint of your protean vileness in the pure river of humanity? 🙂 Hide ↑ theodidactus says: June 4, 2019 at 4:08 pm ~new~ Mingling of poison taints is what humanity is all about! Hide ↑ vV_Vv says: June 4, 2019 at 4:49 am ~new~ It’s not obvious to me that eugenics is wrong. Most arguments I’ve heard about it boil down to “Hitlerdidit!!!” or “it had a disparate impact on blacks/gypsies/[other underperforming minority]”. Slightly more sophisticated arguments invoke bodily autonomy, but these don’t really work for mentally incompetent people who aren’t generally considered to have bodily autonomy and are in fact usually prohibited from having sex, and certainly don’t apply to voluntary eugenics practices. Does anybody have a compelling argument against eugenics? Hide ↑ Murphy says: June 4, 2019 at 5:16 am ~new~ You mean in the broadest sense that includes parents making choices about their own offspring or in the narrow sense of the state controlling reproduction to achieve some kind of end goal related to some desired traits or health of the populous? Inpatient mental health care and an institutions desire to avoid lawsuits is not quite representative of the general case. For people with mental problems living in the community and people with even quite significant cognitive impairments the default tends to be not to restrict them from sex. Often courts are extremely hesitant to entirely restrict someone from sexual activity because it’s such a significant source of happiness for many people. The bar tends to be pretty low: understanding the basics of sex and some sexual health stuff. But even then, the basis of that is more a restriction on others than on the individual in question. That a mentally able person would be taking advantage of them rather than there being anything inherently wrong with them wanting to have sex themselves. I don’t believe your link serves as a precedent that leads to negation of a right to bodily autonomy or bodily integrity any more than parents being allowed make their kids do chores is a good precedent for slavery. What you’d find compelling kind of depends on your own precepts. If you have a strong inclination towards “the good of the many”/group over individual / communitarianism then it’s easier to argue for eugenics. It sucks for people who want kids but who get disallowed from having them but it also sucks for the people who lost the lottery and ended up divided up to deal with the organ shortage at the hospitals. If you have a strong inclination towards individualism then involuntary eugenics is kinda gonna fly in the face of a lot of your precepts. Hide ↑ vV_Vv says: June 5, 2019 at 6:33 am ~new~ Often courts are extremely hesitant to entirely restrict someone from sexual activity because it’s such a significant source of happiness for many people. The bar tends to be pretty low: understanding the basics of sex and some sexual health stuff. Doesn’t this conflict with the principle that legitimate sexual activity requires informed consent? If somebody isn’t considered able to make their own decision about, e.g. what eat for dinner, how can they possibly be able to make their own decision about something that can result in pregnancy or STD? If you have a strong inclination towards “the good of the many”/group over individual / communitarianism then it’s easier to argue for eugenics. You can argue for eugenics from an individualist point of view by pointing to the positive or negative externalities produced by people with certain traits. Welfare for the disabled and law enforcement to deal with criminals, all payed for with taxpayer money, are the most obvious examples. There is also the argument that we may have an obligation to prevent people who would live lives full of suffering from being born, if possible. I’m not sure if it is an individualist or collectivist argument. Hide ↑ Aapje says: June 5, 2019 at 6:41 am ~new~ @Murphy Often courts are extremely hesitant to entirely restrict someone from sexual activity This is not actually possible without putting people in prison or using chastity devices, both of which have consequences beyond impacting sexual activity. Perhaps you meant: forced birth control (permanent or temporary)? Hide ↑ PDV says: June 10, 2019 at 8:15 pm ~new~ People in the hospital or outpatient mental healthcare facilities can easily be, and routinely are, prohibited from engaging in sexual activity. Unless you count masturbation as sexual activity, which is a valid though silly way to draw your category boundaries; in that case they can easily be, and routinely are, prohibited from non-masturbation sexual activity. Hide ↑ theodidactus says: June 4, 2019 at 6:35 am ~new~ The “right” to reproduce (let’s call it a right) is hard to appreciate for a lot of people, and I might include myself in that category from time to time. Plenty of people get along just fine without offspring, and have no intention of having them. They find meaning in other areas of life. But the same is true of what we say and believe. Plenty of people get by just fine without burning flags or drawing pictures of mohammed or watching really odd porn. Why do you need to go and do something crazy like that? It does clear damage to the social fabric, causes obvious distress to a certain category of people, and communicates nothing of real importance. We recognize in the right to speak freely a good beyond even the marketplace of ideas…it is not just for the benefit of society that we let you watch what you want and say what you want…we do it because it’s a really really important part of being a person. So is having the ability to reproduce (even if you never use it). As another potential argument: Scott’s post above, and some of his others (See his review of seeing like a state, eichmann in jerusalem) point to the social benefit of having a large, diverse population which includes several varieties of maniac, lazy good for nothing, idiot, coward, and anxious mess. Monocultures often suck. A forest is much more susceptible to burning down, or succumbing to diseases, if you fill it with a bunch of trees that all have the same desirable properties. A society is much more susceptible to all kinds of evil if it’s full of a bunch of optimized people that all have the same responses to everything. Hide ↑ Randy M says: June 4, 2019 at 7:02 am ~new~ But the same is true of what we say and believe. I was going to make this comparison from another angle. Eugenics is like censorship–it’s not that everyone’s contribution is equally positive–some people are not even net positive. But we don’t trust the state to be wise or disinterested enough to discriminate between them. Especially when the ability to reproduce is so valued, and thus leverage for a corrupt state. Hide ↑ theodidactus says: June 4, 2019 at 7:27 am ~new~ That’s a good point I hadn’t really considered before. My argument is almost always self actualization mixed with “everyone from the top down is bound to get this wrong” but it makes perfect sense to also say, as you did, “a corrupt government could easily misuse this power” Hide ↑ Jiro says: June 4, 2019 at 7:37 am ~new~ It’s not just misuse.

Hide ↑ theodidactus says: June 4, 2019 at 11:33 am ~new~ Burning flags itself is a weird thing only a tiny minority wants, but self-expression is a thing a huge number of people want. So if we want a world where we can throw our arms wide and say “look, self-expression, isn’t it wonderful!” We need to put up with some flag burning (or other suitably nasty and completely irrational expression you hate). Similarly, having what looks, in your opinion, to be screwed up kids is a weird thing only a tiny minority of people want, but the ability to reproduce is a thing a huge number of people want. If we want a world where we can throw our arms wide and say “The ability to reproduce! Isn’t it wonderful!” we have to put up with some stuff that is going, in our eyes, to look like bad reproductive decisionmaking.

It does clear damage to the social fabric, causes obvious distress to a certain category of people, and communicates nothing of real importance. I’d say the negative externalities of free speech are much less than the negative exteralities of producing certain kind of people: you can always ignore speech you don’t like, while you still have to pay taxes to fund welfare for the disabled, the police, courts and prisons for the criminals, and so on.

Hide ↑ notpeerreviewed says: June 4, 2019 at 12:46 pm ~new~ It’s also worth noting that most of the actual historical eugenicists were extremely racist – not “product of their time” racist, but “writes literal fan letters to Hitler” racist. I mention this not to tar the idea by association, but to point out that eugenics reached the peak of its popularity when it was focused on demonizing an outgroup.

I think that “voluntary eugenics” usually means that the state will incentivize or disincentivize people with certain traits to reproduce more or less, usually by paying them or by some mean other than coercive power. Hide ↑ Galle says: June 4, 2019 at 12:56 pm ~new~ The central meaning of the word “eugenics” is “the killing, forced sterilization, and forced copulation of people in order to promote genetic traits that the state considers desirable.” That may not be the literal definition of the word, but it’s what most people think when you say it. This sort of eugenics is obviously wrong for two reasons: 1. Killing, forced sterilization, and forced copulation are all pretty evil things to do. 2. The state does not have a great track record when it comes to correctly identifying what genetic traits to promote. When you avoid mentioning the word “eugenics” and stick only to suggesting voluntary eugenic practices for eliminating genetic traits that everyone agrees are bad (like hereditary diseases) support for the practice is quite a bit higher. It’s just when you start associating yourself with early twentieth century genocides that people find you questionable. Hide ↑ notpeerreviewed says: June 4, 2019 at 3:14 pm ~new~ I think you’re mostly correct, but I’d like to add a rider: The historical eugenics movement promoted both “negative eugenics” and “positive eugenics”, and I think. For the most part, what you’re talking about is “negative eugenics”, and it’s evil for the reasons you mention. Negative eugenics policies were definitely more widely known, but positive eugenics is mentioned in history books often enough that I think it’s still fairly central. Positive eugenics would technically include “forced copulation”, but for the most part it involved voluntary policies that were quite a bit less objectionable, if maybe still kinda creepy. The biggest problem for positive eugenicists is that they rarely managed to get anyone to do it; it’s pretty hard to rope people into voluntarily basing their childbearing decisions on the needs of the state. See, for example, the Repository for Germinal Choice and the difficulties they had getting volunteers. Hide ↑ theodidactus says: June 4, 2019 at 4:04 pm ~new~ Anyone read Doc EE Smith’s “Lensman” Series? It’s badly written but the progenitor of a ton of science fiction.

Hide ↑ BlindKungFuMaster says: June 4, 2019 at 5:10 am ~new~ In the long run eugenics is necessary or we are going to hit a very low mutation-selection balance. Non-coercive eugenics seems to be obviously good (and of course is practiced in every partner choice). And eugenics based on gene modification is only problematic until it just works. Then it is as morally imperative as vaccinations. Whether Pierce Butler got it right really depends on facts we know relatively little about. We don’t know in what kind of world we would be living if the western world had gotten (and stayed) serious about eugenics. Hide ↑ Watchman says: June 4, 2019 at 9:09 am ~new~ Or we could just cracking genetic engineering. I’m also not sure why we need to be concerned about low mutation-selection balance. There’s 5 billion of us out there, increasingly connected, so the gene pool is not going to stabilise for a while. Hide ↑ theodidactus says: June 4, 2019 at 10:51 am ~new~ Yes exactly. I won’t profess to be super biologically literate, but this argument has never made sense to me given the scale of the human gene pool. By the time this would even begin to become a problem, we are quite likely to be either dead or gods. So what’s the point? As for alternate-history eugenics america, I’m not sure what I get from visualizing that, aside from a very interesting alternate history novel someone should write. Eugenics, in the form it took from the 19-teens to the 1950s, just wouldn’t work, given our knowledge of genetics today. They pretty clearly thought that “feeble-mindedness” was simple Mendelian trait, like cleft chins, though they got a little loosey goosey when they tried to express it in dominant/recessive terms (citations can be provided if curious). They also usually thought it could be identified in the field by a simple pass/fail test (some of the documents I read trained judges on these tests, which professed to be nearly foolproof and so simple even judges could administer them.) I don’t think a remotely effective “eugenics program” could have emerged before the 1960s or 1970s…if then. Again, I’m open to someone explaining to the contrary, but as I understand it, we still couldn’t effectively select for the kind of characteristics the pro-eugenics progressives thought they could select for, even if we wanted to. Hide ↑ uau says: June 4, 2019 at 12:53 pm ~new~ I don’t think a remotely effective “eugenics program” could have emerged before the 1960s or 1970s…if then. Probably depends on exactly how effective you’d expect it to be, but I don’t think it would be that hard to achieve at least some measurable positive effect. There are general things like mutational load that could be improved with many different ways of measuring “badness” even without real understanding of the underlying genetics. People did successfully breed dogs for various characteristics way before 1960. I don’t think breeding humans would be so much fundamentally harder that it’d be impossible before 1960s/1970s understanding. Hide ↑ Watchman says: June 4, 2019 at 10:46 pm ~new~ Dogs were bred for physical characteristics in the main, which were observed to be heritable even without any knowledge of genetics. Eugenics as discussed here was more concerned with character, and the breeding of dogs has been much less reliable here than in terms of physical appearance. Bad dogs still exist after all. And this is after several thousand years of selection with a new generation every one to three years (I didn’t realise bitches came into best as early as six months!). Human generations are normally in the twenty-year range, so if the analogy to dogs works we’re not going to see the desired improvements with any sort of rapidity. We’d also require a socially-dominant idea that not only was eugenics acceptable but that the originally-desired outcomes were still desirable over a span probably measured in the thousands of years; I’d struggle to identify any modern ideology this unchanging over a century, and would suggest ancient ones only appear this way because we can’t analysis the fine details of how they operated in practice. Hide ↑ notpeerreviewed says: June 4, 2019 at 11:49 am ~new~ “Eugenics” is a term coined by Francis Galton and he certainly didn’t consider ordinary partner choice to be part of it. I’m continually amazed by how broadly people use the term – historically it referred only to intentional efforts to improve the genetics of a population. Hide ↑ theodidactus says: June 4, 2019 at 11:52 am ~new~ Notably though, many progressive eugenicists turned to partner-partner selection counseling after state-backed eugenics efforts failed. It’s not a coincidence that Paul Popenoe started the marriage counseling movement. Hide ↑ notpeerreviewed says: June 4, 2019 at 12:26 pm ~new~ And Francis Galton started off by promoting voluntary eugenics, so yeah, voluntary efforts were always part of it. But that’s different from genetically-influenced attraction that’s “practiced in every partner choice,” which is the misuse I was pushing back on. Hide ↑ DavidFriedman says: June 5, 2019 at 12:20 pm ~new~ Galton’s essay is here. He starts off with: EUGENICS is the science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race; also with those that develop them to the utmost advantage. All influences include mate choice. Galton goes on to write: The aim of eugenics is to bring as many influences as can be reasonably employed, to cause the useful classes in the community to contribute more than their proportion to the next generation. The course of procedure that lies within the functions of a learned and active society, such as the sociological may become, would be somewhat as follows: And point 4 in his list is:”Influences affecting marriage.” So mate choice is part of what Galton included in eugenics. Hide ↑ araybold says: June 6, 2019 at 3:09 pm ~new~ Any sufficiently advanced sophistry is indistinguishable from reason. I don’t know enough about that case, but the eugenics movement in general tended to combine a misunderstanding of genetics and human biology with the assumption that certain ethical positions were obviously correct. In both cases, these views were so widely held that few people realized that the supposedly rational case for eugenics had no solid foundation. This is why one should check one’s moral compass before accepting the conclusions of an argument that would be harmful if it turned out to be unsound.

I should ignore it and stick with my prior.) I am reminded of a similar sentiment expressed in Hardball Questions: The outside view tells you no; judging from the superintelligence’s past successes, it could have convinced you equally well of the opposite position. If you are smart, you will precommit to never changing your mind at all based on anything the superintelligence says. You will just shut it out of the community of entities capable of persuading you through argument. It is difficult to articulate how strongly I reject this reasoning. No, I don’t think the false arguments sounds “just as convincing”, and I don’t think the superintelligence could have “convinced [me] equally well of the opposite position”. Maybe my confidence takes a massive hit and I (rightfully!) approach the topic with more caution, uncertain in my beliefs. But there’s an asymmetry there, and while the storm is strong my shelter isn’t nothing. And sometimes, there’s work to do.

You had my interest. Now you have my attention. Hide ↑ MawBTS says: June 3, 2019 at 6:12 pm ~new~ Given that no superintelligence exists, how can you be sure that one wouldn’t convince you? Hide ↑ Bugmaster says: June 3, 2019 at 6:35 pm ~new~ Isn’t that like asking, “yes but can you prove there’s no God” ? Explain to me how a superintelligence could even exist in the first place, and how it would convince me of things, and then I’d be willing to consider your argument. Hide ↑ MawBTS says: June 3, 2019 at 6:49 pm ~new~ We’re talking about whether a superintelligence could convince us of wrong ideas, not whether one could exist. Hide ↑ Bugmaster says: June 3, 2019 at 7:09 pm ~new~ Well, if an omnipotent entity could exist, then obviously it could do anything it wanted, by definition — couldn’t it ? Hide ↑ Murphy says: June 4, 2019 at 3:56 am ~new~ @Bugmaster Imagine you have a 5 year old child. You say they should never get in a strangers car. They argue that they should only get in a car with a stranger who makes a really good case for why they should do so. How much do you trust a childs ability to reject bad arguments vs an adult trying to be convincing. Note that the child yesterday spent 20 minutes searching for their nose after their uncle “stole” it. Would they be better off with a set rule of just “never get in a strangers car”? perhaps with an exception for police or something. Because adults can be really really convincing to 5 year olds. Now imagine you meet a charismatic genius, as far above you as you are above a 5 year old with a plausible sounding get rich quick scheme but it’ll need your life savings invested… Hide ↑ Bugmaster says: June 4, 2019 at 4:23 am ~new~ @Murphy: Again, I agree that a hypothetical superintelligent entity with the ability to convince anyone of anything would be able to convince me of anything. However, you are just positing the existence of such a thing, based on your assumption that the ability to convince people of things can be scaled infinitely high. That’s like saying, “I can walk to the store from my house; therefore I could walk across the USA; therefore I can walk to the Moon”. It’s not enough to just assume your conclusion; you need to provide at least some evidence. Hide ↑ Murphy says: June 4, 2019 at 4:52 am ~new~ It may not scale linearly but I suspect we have different intuitions about the difference in direction. Your intuition seems to be that the difference needs to be massive. I honestly don’t think a real super-intelligence is required. A decent sized group of merely smart people seem to be enough to convince lots of very bright people of fairly absurd things. Full grown adults with mostly normal adult cognitive capacity regularly get pulled into cults and fairly obvious scams by someone pressing the right levers. We don’t need to hypothesize a superintelligece when we can just look at regular human level intelligence that are already really really good at convincing people of absurd things. So while you seem to assume it’s home->shops->coast to coast->moon I’m seeing it more like home->shops->shops at the far end of the street->shops a couple of streets over. Taking the small step of “ok, what happens when you have something even smarter and more capable than the best human conman/cult leader/PR expert” isn’t a big leap. Hide ↑ Jiro says: June 4, 2019 at 8:29 am ~new~ Full grown adults with mostly normal adult cognitive capacity regularly get pulled into cults and fairly obvious scams by someone pressing the right levers. This demonstrates that a certain percentage of adults can be convinced of anything, not that any adult can be convinced of anything. It doesn’t follow that all adults are equally vulnerable and it is quite likely that it takes a certain type of person to fall for those. Hide ↑ deciusbrutus says: June 3, 2019 at 7:57 pm ~new~ They could construct an explanation that seemed simple to you that adequately predicts all of your observations to within your ability to measure them, and then extrapolate that model to situations that you never tested where it’s wrong. Except for the superintelligence, that’s why people believed that heavier objects fell faster than lighter ones until Galileo. It’s why EVERYONE believed that a given power accelerating a given mass yielded an acceleration independent of speed, until Einstein. It’s why phlotgetstein theory existed, and it’s why there’s an example of all of those which I can’t name because it hasn’t been disproven yet and everyone including me believes it now. There certainly ARE false things that a superintelligence can convince me of, using methods that appear identical to how a superintelligence would convince me of true things. Therefore, it only way to update correctly is to ask “What fraction of things that this intelligence wants to convince me of are true?” and update towards that. Hide ↑ localdeity says: June 4, 2019 at 12:18 am ~new~ They could construct an explanation that seemed simple to you that adequately predicts all of your observations to within your ability to measure them, and then extrapolate that model to situations that you never tested where it’s wrong. This is not necessarily possible. If there’s a sequence of ten numbers, and I know the first five and that they fit an arithmetic sequence, it is not possible to construct an equally simple polynomial (i.e. of degree 1 or less) that agrees with those five values but makes a different prediction for the next five. Or—suppose you’ve thoroughly observed Newtonian mechanics and gravitation in prosaic Earth conditions and have little knowledge of electromagnetism or light, and the AI is trying to convince you of special and general relativity: the Einsteinian theory is more complex than the Newtonian when you’re only explaining mechanics and gravitation at nonrelativistic speeds. The Einsteinian theory only becomes less complex when certain empirical observations are made, which you haven’t made. The AI would have to either persuade you to take its word on those observations, or persuade you to make those observations yourself. Someone telling you to trust them about a whole bunch of observations is kinda suspicious. Someone telling you to do experiments is less suspicious, although it is possible to mislead someone about how to interpret experimental results (e.g. I’ve heard of tech support phone scams where the scammer says “Your PC is infected. Open your system log and see all the errors there; that proves it’s infected, and the fact I know they’re there proves I know what’s wrong and can fix it”). You can’t necessarily reduce all important theories to a few equations and then count the distinct symbols in the equations. But you could be epistemically cautious with things that aren’t like that. Hide ↑ Bugmaster says: June 4, 2019 at 3:02 am ~new~ I think you might be conflating two positions: 1). A superintelligence could convince me that some false things are actually true. 2). A superintelligence could convince virtually anyone of virtually anything. Position (1) is very likely, but not very interesting; perfectly ordinary human liars can do that. Position (2) is an extraordinary claim. If I’m standing outside on a bright sunny day, the superintelligence could try to convince me that the sky is pink with white polka dots instead of blue, but it would definitely be an uphill battle — one that I doubt the AI could win just by talking to me. Hide ↑ nadbor says: June 4, 2019 at 6:25 am ~new~ FWIW I thought this entire thread was about 1) not 2) I think bringing superintelligence into this was an unnecessary rhetorical flourish. You could replace superintelligence with Velikovsky and the quoted passage would still make sense. Velikovsky won’t convince you that 2 + 2 = 5 but if he has a history of making convincing (to you!) arguments about ancient history then it makes perfect sense to commit to not updating too much on the evidence he presents in this domain. Someone smarter than Velikovsky may have a similar property in a broader domain. An intriguing limiting case is the perfect arguer who can convince anyone of anything but this is really not necessary. Hide ↑ A1987dM says: June 4, 2019 at 6:35 am ~new~ [nitpick]You mean force not power — in Newtonian mechanics a constant power results in acceleration inversely proportional to speed[/nitpick] Hide ↑ deciusbrutus says: June 4, 2019 at 4:28 pm ~new~ This is not necessarily possible. If there’s a sequence of ten numbers, and I know the first five and that they fit an arithmetic sequence, it is not possible to construct an equally simple polynomial (i.e. of degree 1 or less) that agrees with those five values but makes a different prediction for the next five. So there is literally nothing that can convince you that a sequence that starts out like an arithmetic sequence might not be one, except direct observation of the next number? Hide ↑ deciusbrutus says: June 4, 2019 at 4:44 pm ~new~ [nitpick]You mean force not power — in Newtonian mechanics a constant power results in acceleration inversely proportional to speed[/nitpick] No, I meant constant change in KE, not constant change in speed. Because different non-accelerating Newtonian observers agree about delta Ke and power, but disagree about force. Hide ↑ localdeity says: June 4, 2019 at 11:22 pm ~new~ So there is literally nothing that can convince you that a sequence that starts out like an arithmetic sequence might not be one, except direct observation of the next number? Anything that agrees it’s an arithmetic sequence for five terms, but disagrees for any later terms, must be more complicated than “P(n) = An + B”. It could be somewhat simple; but it would be strictly less simple than what I already believed. Incidentally, my dad had a relatively accessible example for something that exhibits linear response until it doesn’t (after which it follows a different line): shining a light through a piece of paper and measuring how much light goes through. After a certain point, it burns a hole in the paper, and suddenly a lot more goes through. The formula might be a piecewise function; exactly what happens during and after the discontinuity depends on the exact parameters of the experiment (e.g. do you average the amount of light measured over a period of N seconds, or just read the value N seconds after turning on the laser?). If I didn’t know that lasers could burn things, and the superintelligence was trying to convince me of that model… well, it could get me to the point of “Hmm, that sounds plausible. I will want further verification before I say I believe it.” (This is my stance on a great many issues.) Does that count as “convincing me”? Hide ↑ Dan L says: June 3, 2019 at 7:10 pm ~new~ Never said it couldn’t. The question is whether or not it would find it equally easy to convince me in an arbitrary direction. Perhaps the more intelligent than me it becomes the easier it finds the task, but the delta reaches zero only at infinite knowledge. Or to flip the direction of the problem – that my existing knowledge and rationality has zero influence on what ideas in ideaspace I find convincing. To assert that such is the case is to take an absolutist stance on the impossibility of reason. Plenty of reason to reject that. (Ok, sure – I’m a fallible human and I’m not always going to biased towards the truth. But allowing for meta-reasoning, this is a fixable problem.) Hide ↑ Murphy says: June 4, 2019 at 4:00 am ~new~ non-zero can still be really small. There’s non-zero difficulty involved in convincing a 4 year old that this is a mashmallow farm: https://i.redd.it/bu9dpgxfdnx21.jpg but adults will still do so casually, smirking over the kids head because there’s a level of effort that’s close to free. Hide ↑ Dan L says: June 4, 2019 at 8:41 am ~new~ non-zero can still be really small. The two differ by a factor of literally infinite, and lead to correspondingly different conclusions. “Really small” bootstraps to “arbitrarily large”.

Hide ↑ Trevor Adcock says: June 4, 2019 at 12:00 am ~new~ I could ask it to show me its work. The mathematical proof/computer program that lead it to have that conclusion. If I don’t have computational resources equivalent to it, I guess I’m screwed, but that seems more a problem along the lines of a bully being physically stronger than you, than an info hazard. It could do a lot worse to me if it had those powers than convince me of something wrong. Hide ↑ Randy M says: June 4, 2019 at 7:14 am ~new~ People around here have high verbal intelligence, so they have both seen the effectiveness of persuasion, but also to overestimate its scope. I’m not convinced there exists the possibility for a super AI to convince anyone of anything. However, I know there exists a level of intelligence that can convince me of wrong things; indeed, I myself posses such a fearsome intellect. Hide ↑ HeelBearCub says: June 4, 2019 at 7:46 am ~new~ I’m not convinced there exists the possibility for a super AI to convince anyone of anything. I am assuming this just collapses to you not being convinced “AI” can actually exist. Otherwise I have a hard time making sense of it unless it is intentionally hyperbolic? Hide ↑ Randy M says: June 4, 2019 at 8:08 am ~new~ Hmm, not sure if you object to what I mean or the equally valid unintended alternate reading that I only see now. “Any” can be ready as “every” when talking about capability, or it can be read as “some, single” thing, which is very nearly opposite. I doubt the potential existence of an ai that has omnipotent rhetorical powers. I fully expect an ai that can convince many people of many things, some even falsely. Does that make more sense? Hide ↑ HeelBearCub says: June 4, 2019 at 8:18 am ~new~ Yes, that clears up the ambiguity. I had been mistakenly reading you as saying that you thought it more likely that an AI would always be unconvincing. Hide ↑ Jiro says: June 4, 2019 at 8:31 am ~new~ However, I know there exists a level of intelligence that can convince me of wrong things; indeed, I myself posses such a fearsome intellect. You possess an intellect that can convince yourself of some wrong things, not of an arbitrary wrong thing. Hide ↑ Randy M says: June 4, 2019 at 8:37 am ~new~ Right. In other words, I appreciate Scott’s approach despite not believing in unlimited rhetorical powers because I know the limited version is still quite capable. Hide ↑ Walter says: June 5, 2019 at 8:11 am ~new~ “If you are smart, you will precommit to never changing your mind at all based on anything the superintelligence says.” This is the best sentence.

Hell, human level advertising has shifted from writing long paragraphs about the excellences of the advertised products, to blatant putting the product next to attractive people, putting products in movies and tv shows, buying surface of the clothing of famous sports people, etc. If the paperclip maximizer doesn’t have superscience to tile the earth into paperclips, it may try to buy some google ads, instead of trying to reason you into making more paperclips. Hide ↑ Doctor Locketopus says: June 3, 2019 at 5:58 pm ~new~ Someone (I want to say Carl Sagan, but could’ve been Asimov or possibly even someone else) once noted that when he talked about Velikovsky to historians or Biblical scholars, their take was generally something like “His history is total garbage, but the science is plausible.” Conversely, physicists tended to say things like “His physics is absurd, obviously, but his history is intriguing.” Hide teageegeepea says: June 3, 2019 at 10:33 pm ~new~ That sounds like Clifford Stoll’s description of himself in “The Cuckoo’s Egg”: he lost his job in astronomy and all his colleagues said he wasn’t cut out for that, but was a whiz at computers.

Also, I think Sagan’s own background wouldn’t require him to check with (other) physicists. Hide ↑ Concavenator says: June 5, 2019 at 3:37 am ~new~ Sagan wrote something like that in one of his books, the physicist being him: I can remember vividly discussing Worlds in Collision with a distinguished professor of Semitics at a leading university. He said something like “The Assyriology, Egyptology, Biblical scholarship and all of that Talmudic and Midrashic pilpul is, of course, nonsense; but I was impressed by the astronomy.” I had rather the opposite view.

Like I mean that on most topics, I could demolish their position and make them look like an idiot. Reduce them to some form of “Look, everything you say fits together and I can’t explain why you’re wrong, I just know you are!” Or, more plausibly, “Shut up I don’t want to talk about this!” I’d love to see some transcripts of in-depth interviews in this situation; what happens when someone without much in the way of epistemic training is posed with devastating counterarguments to their positions? (Not aggressively or anything, just having a conversation in which one person keeps the discussion pointed towards various pieces of evidence.) How do reactions vary? In particular I’d be interested to see what happens in the case of people whose default is to keep talking calmly rather than to storm out. I assume something like this exists somewhere on the internet (there isn’t a shortage of people with silly beliefs or other people willing to debate them), but I’ve never come across it as far as I can recall outside of televised debates, and those aren’t really fair because neither side can possibly concede any ground. Also, what fraction of people actually end up convinced? I’d guess a negligible amount, but would be pleasantly surprised if this wasn’t the case. Hide losethedebate says: June 3, 2019 at 9:27 pm ~new~ Jonathan Haidt has done this study. He describes it in his book The Righteous Mind, and here is a description online that’s more in-depth than the one in the book (full disclosure, I haven’t read the link). Basically, he coined the term “moral dumbfounding” to refer to the phenomenon he observed where people would have a moral judgement of a situation, then the experimenter would refute all the person’s arguments to the person’s own satisfaction, but the person would still keep their judgement, saying things like “I can’t explain why, but…”.

In my experience of having my mind changed I am rarely (although not never) convinced to change my mind on the spot, but a good argument plants a seed of doubt. We don’t usually get to see these seeds grow (or die, as may be the case). We have an argument with someone, plant a seed of doubt, and go our separate ways. They have more arguments, observe the world, have experiences, and change as a person. Eventually they may come to accept that idea you planted (or not), but it’s a slow process and it’s unlikely you’ll ever know unless you do a longitudinal study or something. But then again maybe this is just me. I don’t really know what having their minds changed feels like to other people.

Not say things like “this is a conversation, you have to give my point of view equal time 5. Not play “god of the gaps” 6. Not Gish Gallop with “i’m just asking questions” that never lets you finish a single line of argument.

Hide ↑ PDF says: June 3, 2019 at 6:11 pm ~new~ Hi Scott, If it’s really the case that a false argument sounds just as convincing as a true argument then why not change that, instead of changing what you do with convincing-sounding arguments? I mean, if rationality is good for anything, it’s exposing the differences between true and false arguments/claims, right? I also don’t understand how someone as skilled in this as yourself could be considered hopelessly gullible in just one (or a few) arbitrary topic(s). It’s been several years since the original post – do you still feel this way? What is it about the topic of pseudohistory that could make one unable to spot false arguments? This sounds a little bit like magic. Have you tried consulting colleagues with the same “insurmountable evidence” and examining their responses?

Hide ↑ Clutzy says: June 3, 2019 at 9:19 pm ~new~ History seems (to me) to be one of the places your average smart person should be able to dismiss, at least, the worst arguments. Because one need merely to have an accurate model of human behavior to understand that some things are not plausible. Sometimes, though, there are two histories that are both plausible. Many people thing Jared Diamond’s GG&S narrative of history makes sense. I don’t. I do however recognize that most of it has plausible theories that don’t diverge from what normal humans would do (my biggest gripes being with his domestication theory and his North American population calculations, the latter of which I think is not consistent with human behavior). Hide ↑ Watchman says: June 4, 2019 at 12:25 am ~new~ You are aware of how extreme the variety of human behaviours have been over time and distance? We tend to view history through the prism of our own understanding. Thus, even if we avoid the trap of moral judgement, we can still fail to actually appreciate how different the thinking involved in something even as recent as say colonialism actually was. Sure we can read the writings of Rhodes or Kipling, or anything on manifest destiny, but we’ll not be engaging with them in the same way as their contemporaries, because we don’t and can’t think like they do: we are post-colonial thinkers due to the age in which we grew up. If we can’t fully understand the context of the writers of 100 years ago, how do we appreciate the logic of a mound builder, of a ship burial or of a hermit living up a pole? We can try, and we can construct a comparative picture of their behaviours, but ultimately the major decisions about how we understand any historical behaviour are (currently) made in twentieth-century minds. Your construction of an accurate model would, however hard you tried, be an attempt to filter history according to what seems plausible to you in the here and now. Hide ↑ Clutzy says: June 4, 2019 at 1:23 pm ~new~ I’d say that your theory of a complex evolution of the state of humans is the kind of naivety that I presume causes historical illiteracy. I have no trouble understanding the actions of colonials, or slavers, or Alexander the Great. They all code to me as humans doing human things when presented with human circumstances. Things that code as false to me is when a historian presents “kumbayaa” scenario. Hide ↑ Matt M says: June 4, 2019 at 7:55 am ~new~ Because one need merely to have an accurate model of human behavior This seems easier said than done. I know a whole lot of really smart people who would disagree strongly in terms of how they “model” human behavior… Hide ↑ Clutzy says: June 4, 2019 at 1:24 pm ~new~ True, but that is not merely present in those people’s evaluation of history, it also is shown in their evaluation of the present and future. Hide ↑ MawBTS says: June 3, 2019 at 6:23 pm ~new~ then why not change that, instead of changing what you do with convincing-sounding arguments? I mean, if rationality is good for anything, it’s exposing the differences between true and false arguments/claims, right? Because it’s impossible: nobody can be perfectly informed on every single topic under creation. There’s too much to know. Even if Scott spent four years getting a doctoral-level education in history, he’d still be gullible on household plumbing (for example). Hide DavidFriedman says: June 3, 2019 at 8:11 pm ~new~ You don’t have to be perfectly informed. Scott’s claim is not merely that false arguments are sometimes as convincing as true ones but that the probability of an argument being convincing conditional on its being false is the same as conditional on its being true. I think that’s clearly wrong. Hide ↑ Athenae Galea says: June 4, 2019 at 2:40 am ~new~ While I’m not sure I agree with the strong form of what Scott has said either, I would definitely not go as far as “clearly wrong”. While the claim as taken literally is, I think a more reasonable interpretation would be “if I know that a false argument, conditional on my having heard it from a convincing source, sounds just as convincing as a true argument, argument convincingness provides no evidence either way” The claim isn’t (I’m imagining) that the average convincingness of all imaginable wrong arguments is the same as of all imaginable correct arguments, because that, as you say, would be obviously wrong. Some of the examples given are ones where both sides are able to be absolutely convincing, and so in that family of cases anyway the claim is trivially true. This is effectively “I am currently convinced, however I am aware that if I read the rebuttals to these my certainty would drop off a cliff, so I might as well throw it off now and save myself the trouble.” So to speak. Hide ↑ BlindKungFuMaster says: June 4, 2019 at 5:18 am ~new~ Liars (or motivated reasoners) have a lot more degrees of freedom. Hide ↑ baconbits9 says: June 4, 2019 at 6:40 am ~new~ I don’t think that your position holds. Scott’s position is more like ‘a false argument that has been adopted and is being presented to you is as likely, or close to as likely, to be convincing as a true one’, and if you were to flesh it out you would get something like ‘given that there is one correct position and a near infinity of false ones the most convincing false arguments are going to sound as convincing as the true ones.’ Hide ↑ emiliobumachar says: June 5, 2019 at 2:43 am ~new~ Consider survival bias. The probability of a *surviving* argument being convincing conditional on its being false is the same as conditional on its being true. Not that clearly wrong, is it? Hide ↑ Scott says: June 3, 2019 at 6:28 pm ~new~ Two posts that I think pair really well with this one, looking at the failure modes of taking ideas too seriously: * Reason as Memetic Immune Disorder, by Phil Goetz * Nerds are Nuts, by Razib Khan Hide JohnBuridan says: June 3, 2019 at 6:32 pm ~new~ Still good. Glad you reposted. A student asked me last year: how does one prove that say, the American Civil War, happened to someone who denies it? I said you both need to agree to standards of evidence which will convince both of you one way or another. But I went on to point out that frequently people have other reasons for wild beliefs that are not about evidence, but some other issue. But By Abraham! How delicate is the balancing act! I have been interested for some time in creating a small course on coping with epistemic uncertainty, conspiracy theories, and standards of evidence. Hide AZpie says: June 3, 2019 at 8:16 pm ~new~ Thought of this a lot recently, and ended up going in circles. A very, very big deal in systems such as standards of evidence and such is the fact that nobody can draw or redraw the map for science alone. It’s ultimately a matter of trust, and epistemically I find that to be a big problem. There’s no way I can ever analyze all the evidence by myself, and if there exist systematic cognitive, social or ideological biases affecting the production of information, the way it’s discussed and whether it’s going to be ultimately prioritized or dismissed, I’ll have no hope at all of ever discerning legit information from potential bullspit. That is, everything is potential bullspit, which is a wonderful doctrine – constant vigilance! Always doubt! – except that it also leads to historical revisionism, climate change skepticism, anti vaxxxing and nice stuff like that. So I’m back to square one: there must exist a system of thought with which I can deal with the information at hand and grade beliefs according to the evidence supporting and rejecting them. But if I really think it through… I do think that that’s the best we’ve got at the moment. But if I Take The Idea That I’m Gullible And Not An Expert Seriously, I’m going to run into the weeds – very, very deep. Hide ↑ JohnBuridan says: June 4, 2019 at 6:57 am ~new~ It’s such a vicious and difficult position that one realizes how horribly dependent even that smartest people are. David Foster Wallace’s introduction to Best American Essays 2007 is a fantastic little meditation on this problem. http://neugierig.org/content/dfw/bestamerican.pdf Quotes: The general point is that professional filtering/winnowing is a type of service that we citizens and consumers now depend on more and more, and in ever-increasing ways, as the quantity of available information and products and art and opinions and choices and all the complications and ramifications thereof expands at roughly the rate of Moore’s Law.

Username checks out. Hide ↑ Bugmaster says: June 3, 2019 at 6:39 pm ~new~ Maybe it’s because I’m a contrarian by nature, but still, I’ve never found this argument particularly insightful. If you discover that you can be persuaded to believe in mutually contradictory positions, then maybe you need to examine the flaws in your reasoning that are preventing you from forming correct conclusions — as opposed to just shutting out anyone who attempts to convince you of anything. This is especially important if one side is trying to convince you of A, and the other one of not-A, because in this (admittedly, rare) case, one of them has got to be right. Hide deciusbrutus says: June 3, 2019 at 8:02 pm ~new~ I’ve seen lots of cases where one side is lying to convince me of A and another side is lying to convince me of not-A and another side is lying to convince me to reject the dilemma. And in fact, the correct answer is “A and A is irrelevant to the thing that all of you are applying it to”. And also “Screw all of you who are lying to convince me of something.” Hide ↑ Bugmaster says: June 3, 2019 at 8:32 pm ~new~ Well yes, but this is not Scott’s scenario. In his scenario, he explicitly cannot identify which (if either) side is lying; at least, not right off the bat. Hide ↑ deciusbrutus says: June 4, 2019 at 4:46 pm ~new~ It is not the case that one or more of them has to be right. Hide ↑ AZpie says: June 3, 2019 at 8:25 pm ~new~ I don’t think the issue is merely flaws in one’s reasoning, but instead the limits in one’s abilities to effectively process information. “Let’s assume a perfectly rational, infinitely intelligent being…” With the Art, we can actually try to approach the first, but the second part is what really gives us problems. In most complex issues (say, nearly all political economics) I’ve found so many convincing arguments for both (all) sides I’ve lost count. I can’t keep up with it unless I devote all my life to a single question alone – and it’s not the only question that bothers me. The issue is not that my reasoning is wrong, but that I lack knowledge to relate the arguments to one another to compare and weigh them relative to the whole of facts, evidence and discussion. I can compensate to an extent by being systematic and thorough, but it won’t get me indefinitely far. Hide ↑ Bugmaster says: June 3, 2019 at 8:36 pm ~new~ I don’t think you need to be (or even posit) an infinitely intelligent being in order to reason in a rational fashion; in fact, we wouldn’t need the Bayes rule if we were already omniscient. Nor do you need perfect knowledge in order to form a practically applicable opinion. For example, when I’m buying a car, I’m perfectly fine with being 80% or so convinced that the car I chose is the best one to buy. Yes, I could be wrong; if I studied automotive engineering for 20 years then obviously I could be better informed — but the stakes are low enough so I don’t need to do that. If I narrowed down the choices, and it came down to a 50/50 split between two cars, I would either postpone my purchase so I could learn more, or flip a coin. I wouldn’t just go, “oh well, no car for me”. Hide ↑ AZpie says: June 4, 2019 at 6:54 am ~new~ Thanks for replying. One third of my “Let’s assume…” was a joke. A third of it was meant to point out that a confident epistemic status requires not only a careful analysis of evidence available to one’s mind (the Art), but also faculties capable of processing that information (smarts and knowledge). A third of it was to poke at the fact that while attempting to be rational about things and use maths to improve our decision making, we’re bound to make assumptions, not all of which are immediately obvious and not all of which are, you know, smart. My point was not to imply that rational or reasonable decision making would take infinite brain power. Practical applicability is also a matter somewhat distinct from epistemic uncertainty, but relevant enough here. However, I’d like to point out that the fact that we need to operate somehow with uncertainty does not mean that we are making good decisions, and the results of our decisions do not necessarily tell us whether we could have done better or worse – moreover, the result of our actions does not necessarily relate to our knowledge in any way. (say, I’ll decide to invest to a stock because God told me it’ll get a pump. It does. Did I know that’ll happen? This isn’t a very applicable example for the discussion at hand, but I just wanted to point out that epistemic (un)certainty and (apparent) practical applicability need not go hand in hand.) As for your example, I agree with you. Buying a car that suits my needs well enough is, however, a relatively simple situation, especially considering the fact that whether or not the car I end up buying actually is “the best for my needs” or whatever will most likely never become apparent to me, unless it suffers from some serious flaws or I’ll have some other means of finding out eventually. If I don’t, I might just assume that since I’m content with the car, I probably got the best one. I won’t know, though. However, most complicated questions aren’t such that I could assume an 80% probability of ending up with the best solution. They are such that most the times I can’t give any probability estimate for being right, unless I just pull one out of my arse to look cool. For example, I might consider which strategies Finland should choose to reduce unemployment and improve the well-being of relatively poor people. Mostly people just decide to side with a camp (right-wing, libertarian / left-wing, welfare-statist) and thereby reduce the number of possible solutions. Then they take a look at the proposed political solutions and pick one that sounds good enough to them. We can agree that that’s not rational. Being rational in such a matter is a humongous task. The amount of data one should actually consume is absolutely astonishing. We might contend that “for practical applicability, we’ll settle with x amount of hours put into it…” but that doesn’t tell us anything about our epistemic status. We might make assumptions that the data provided to us is valid, that the statistical analyses others make of the data are valid, that we aren’t being lied to, and that we have enough relevant data to form an opinion which won’t be shifted so much that we’d care. All of those are assumptions which do not tell us anything about our epistemic status on the matter. They are a way for us to input “exit program” so that we’ll have something nice to do with our time and so that we won’t starve while thinking. No matter how I look at it, it seems to me that it boils down to trust between people; nobody’s smart or fast enough to do all the science or Bayes or whatever by themselves, so we need to cooperate and believe in that cooperation. To me, that sounds like I’m never going to really be confident in my beliefs. To someone else it’ll sound like something different. What you’re saying about practicality certainly applies, and that the sort of ultimate skepticism I’m presenting doesn’t really provide anything worthwhile insofar as we’re actually trying to solve problems. However, when it comes to the question of whether or not I know spit, it matters. Hide ↑ HeelBearCub says: June 4, 2019 at 5:23 am ~new~ Despite Scott coming out of the Less Wrong, Bayesian, rationalist community, his intuitions don’t seem to actually run that way. He wants certainty. He wants to optimize for all positive outcomes (not sure if optimization is LW thing but it seems like it would be.) It strikes me that there is a phrase in the rationalist community that is actually very non-Bayesian that actually captures this problem. “If something is true, I want to believe it to be true. If something is false, I want to believe it to be false.” Sure, it’s a good principle, but at heart it establishes a binary of truth and falsehood as a certainty. The idea of something being, say, “untrue but not false” isn’t captured. Not sure where I am going with this, but it seems like there is some excessive rigidity here that denies necessary flexibility. Hide ↑ Aapje says: June 4, 2019 at 5:42 am ~new~ You can be fairly certain about probabilities. Being certain that a dice has an equal chance to land on each side, for example, which is very relevant if one decides to wager on the outcome of a dice throw. Hide ↑ HeelBearCub says: June 4, 2019 at 6:00 am ~new~ That is a facile and simple example, which isn’t really respondent to my prompt. I’m talking about the end results of highly complex systems. It’s also, as stated, something that’s untrue, but not false. Dice games are almost always, hell, always, played with participants that are not “certain” the die sides are all equally likely. You’ve hid the ambiguity using the word “fairly”, then immediately dispensed with it and used “certain” without modifier. Nonetheless, dice game participants are highly inclined to believe that the dice are fair. (“Fair” being a better word than “equal”). However, it wouldn’t surprise me to think that the the more one plays, the less confident one is in the fairness of the dice. This is due to more frequent players being more likely to displaying addictive behaviors, and the increased probability they have ever encountered loaded dice by virtue of playing so many games. So, we can put all these modifiers on the initial statement, yet it remains relatively true. Hide ↑ Aapje says: June 4, 2019 at 7:31 am ~new~ “Untrue, but not false” seems to be a case of asking the wrong question, which is a topic that Scott has frequently addressed (just like ‘true, but not correct’). Crafting the kind of hypotheses that can be answered fairly (sorry) unambiguously is at the core of science. Anchoring your beliefs on those seems like a good idea to me, even if some of the answers you want can’t be answered fairly unambiguously. Hide ↑ HeelBearCub says: June 4, 2019 at 8:13 am ~new~ It can be asking the wrong question. But, again, if we are talking about very complex systems, it might be asking some right question at the wrong time. Is homeopathy false? But what about inoculation? How about the practice of taking patient histories? Is leaching quackery? Is Lamarckian evolution disproven? Is junk DNA actually non-functional? But, this is all something of a digression. Because what I was talking about wasn’t Scott’s ability to reason through these things, but rather his intuitions. There is a mindset that is really uncomfortable with holding these kinds of ambiguities in mind. They want it to be binary, even if at a rational level they understand it is not. Hide ↑ Aapje says: June 4, 2019 at 12:36 pm ~new~ People who are truly uncomfortable with ambiguities are tankies, stormfronters or other extremists. Scott is at most mildly intolerant, which doesn’t seem like a bad habit to me. If your complaint is that Scott isn’t perfect, then I’d agree, but this merely makes him human. Hide ↑ sclmlw says: June 4, 2019 at 9:01 am ~new~ Agreed. Mathematically, once you have 100% certainty you can no longer do Bayesian statistics on a thing. I feel like there are a lot of Bayesian ‘fans’, talking about updating their priors based on evidence, but true Bayesian statisticians can’t become 100% certain of anything. That’s said, what Scott outlines is a simple case of setting very high probability priors for the standard narrative in any fields you aren’t an expert in. This itself is probably loosely based on a kind of fan-Bayesian learning-from-experience that in complex fields you can be convinced about anything by being presented a biased selection of evidence. It’s perfectly rational to ignore argument you’re not ready to analyze for accuracy, and entirely susceptible to Bayesian analysis. But that doesn’t mean most people are applying either standard. Hide ↑ DragonMilk says: June 4, 2019 at 9:37 am ~new~ How are you so sure your reasoning is reasonable? Hide ↑ MawBTS says: June 3, 2019 at 6:40 pm ~new~ But I’m also glad epistemic learned helplessness exists. It seems like a pretty useful social safety valve most of the time. In first aid classes, they give you trial scenarios. A common one is a collapsed stage at a rock concert. 20-30 people are lying around, in uncertain states of health. There could be broken bones, spinal injuries, concussions, and more. As a first responder, how do you ensure that everyone gets the care they need? You don’t. There’s no time. While you’re doing CPR on one person, six more might be bleeding out. So you just do the best, quickest job you can: make sure each person’s airway is clear, check for broken bones, and then put them in the recovery position. You do this for everyone, and only when it is done do you examine individual casualties in more detail. There’s so much information out there that often I adopt a similar, one-size-fits-all response to new theories. “Wow, that sounds interesting. I should learn more about this some day.” And then I continue believing what I believed before, unless there’s a particularly reason to do otherwise.

Aristotle often started with common peoples’ viewpoints on any given topic, along with looking at what experts thought and built his own ideas from there, and of course was very successful with his methodology. Arguments are interesting and obviously some are more correct than others but everyone has good reasons for what they argue for and there is a genius to the collective thoughts of humanity even if it seems like insanity most of the time. The best starting point is one of ignorance and asking other people what they think, you don’t need consensus but you should be looking for clues, solid ground, and inspiration. Everyone should get more comfortable andmitting to and saying that they truly ‘don’t know’. Taking a position of ignorance will open the doors to real possibilities and actual progress. reply godelski 4 hours agoparentTo speak to this directly in a scientific setting I find one of the most beneficial thing I can do when exploring a new domain is to NOT read works first. But instead to first ponder how I would go about solving the problem, maybe do some naive attempts, and THEN read. An iterative cycle of this becomes successful because of a few typical outcomes: you spend more time but generally come away with a deep understanding of motivation and why the field has moved in the direction that it now exists in (which helps you understand where to go next!) and/or in this process you find assumptions made to simplify a problem but has been forgotten and can be readdressed (at worse you have a deeper appreciation for the naive assumption). I do think this process is slower, but I find it frequently results in deeper understanding. It is (for me) faster if your intent is to understand, but slower if your intent is to do things quickly. I find that with the typical method of review to catchup without the struggling generally results in me not having a good understanding of many of the underlying assumptions or nuance at play (I think this is a common outcome, beyond my own experience). YMMV and it may vary dependent on your goals with a specific area and cross-domain knowledge. But I find great pleasure in it because it causes me to consider many things beautiful and genius where I would have otherwise saw them as obvious and and mundane. That alone is enough for me because research is a grueling task with endless and frequent failure but this helps keep me motivated and keeps things \"fun\" (in the way I think Feynman was describing). It's not dissimilar from doing your homework, checking someone else's work/a solution manual, and then trying to figure out where your mistakes are rather than simply correcting them.

It is rooted in analytic geometry. David Hume challenged this view. His main insight was that an object we call \"A\" in time T1 may not be the same object in time T2. We also need to distinguish between \"A\" as an idea of an object and \"A\" as a particular instance of object. reply voidhorse 15 hours agorootparentAlong similar lines, critiques of Cartesianism in epistemology have also pointed out the heavily social aspects of knowledge construction, see situated epistemologies etc. Even epistemologists in the analytic tradition have begun to move away from Cartesianism due to its limitations.

If you're trying to figure out the system, you should probably ask for help ASAP and build up some knowledge. Over time you'll need to ask questions about the system less frequently. If you're trying to figure out a new problem related to your work, slogging away at it for a while is more ok because it's value-add and a good learning experience. The lines are a bit blurry, but that's how I tend to think about this. reply smeej 16 hours agorootparentI had a manager when I was a new hire who had no concept of this difference at all, and it led to his firing me in my 4th week because I \"should have been coming in with more knowledge.\" He actually told me I should have just come in and started doing things whatever way seemed best to me, like he did, when he was the first employee in the company in the role. Never mind that it was a compliance-heavy role in risk analysis and I was the 5th person on a 5-person team. Sure, I knew plenty of ways to solve the problems. What I didn't know were what systems they had (or, in most cases, didn't have) in place to document investigations, which absolutely must be done. I know plenty about what I'm doing. What I need to know is how you want it recorded. And in fact he had reinvented the entire documentation system during my 2nd week, on a whim. Firing me that fast was the best gift that company could have given me, because things would not have improved between us. reply eminence32 16 hours agorootparentprevAs you get more and more experience, I think this will become easier. You'll eventually get a feel for what types of questions you should just work through yourself, and which types of questions you should ask someone else about, and the threshold for moving between the two (you'll develop a sense of \"let me investigate theory A, B, and C, and if I still can't figure it out, I'll ask for help\"). Some of this will probably be via an increased understanding of the types of problems you can and can't solve. And some of this will probably be because you'll eventually know more people who can help (something like \"oh yeah, I know Sam worked on a similar problem last month, let me see if they found a solution\") reply switchbak 16 hours agorootparentThere's also a minimum bar of seeking that you need to have both performed and can demonstrate - this shows you're doing your due diligence, and not just wasting the more senior developer's time. It also provides you the context you need to understand the solution. The last thing you want is a LMGTFY moment from someone who was interrupted from deep focus on a hard problem (or worse: a series of them). reply NhanH 16 hours agorootparentprevThe nuance here lies within the “hours” quantifier. A junior member being blocked for 3-8 hours semi-regularly is expected. Once every other month you probably should be blocked for several work days as well. In your example, the challenge would have been realizing you wouldn’t have been the first one trying to send an email in the team. Recognizing that and it is very easy to know that you should just ask the question right away. It’s not a technical skill, but something a bit more meta. reply wins32767 16 hours agorootparentThis is really bad advice. Don't let yourself be blocked for several days. Try for 2-3 hours and ask for help. reply dkjaudyeqooe 16 hours agorootparentI'd say that's excessive. An hour max would be more reasonable otherwise you're just creating a discouraging workplace. Note that would be an hour of real effort though, not half arsed googling. Making a genuine effort is more important than the time taken. reply c0pium 12 hours agorootparentThe amount of time is entirely dependent on what kind of work it is and what kind of blocked you are. Can’t get your build to succeed? Ask for help quickly. Can’t get your research model to produce useful results on the first try? Maybe try a few things first. reply NhanH 6 hours agorootparentYeah, it's a bit disheartening to hear some (presumably) experienced people advocates for never allowing the junior to dig and deal with things on their owns. I can imagine the scenario where a build fail due to some missing incantations that needs to be invoked, and sure, you shouldn't spend more than 15 minutes on trying to resolve it. But that should be rare, while the common blockers for junior tend to be their lack of understanding in even bog-standard systems and situations (why can't system X do Y, why did person Z require A). In those cases, part of the expectation when assigning them the work would be for the junior to learn those on their own. reply nerpderp82 15 hours agorootparentprevBlocked for hours is you learning and totally OK if you are learning. If one is operating open loop and stabbing at configuration options in a brute force manner to \"make something work quickly\" that isn't learning. Not saying you did this, but I do see this in a number of folks. They don't learn, and they don't form a model of the system. Those folks can be replaced by an LLM and Z3. reply SkyBelow 16 hours agorootparentprevIf you lost hours digging through the code and trying things to solve the problem, they aren't really lost. The knowledge you gain from this, the code you dug through, etc. all help builds up the experience that leads to one day no longer being a junior. Being given the answer is fast, but it doesn't lead to as much learning, especially in a career where knowing how find answers is more important long term than knowing the answers. reply Swizec 17 hours agoparentprevAs a tech lead I would rather see a team member ask me questions early than never. Nudging them in the right direction before they waste 3 days going down a path that’s never going to work is at least half my job. But it’s important that they’ve done enough research to formulate the question. A little struggle helps the learning stick. reply freedomben 17 hours agorootparentI agree, but in practice now I've come to see that this is an extremely difficult point to discern. As the vast majority of findings flow in as a trickle, there often isn't a large enough delta to identify as a launching point for asking for help. For example, if one continues to search, they will keep finding breadcrumbs leading them to the solution. It is painful to me when someone spends 3 days looking for a solution to a problem that is very custom and unique to our system (so they're not gonna find the answer anywhere on the internet), and one I could solve in 5 minutes, but you don't know what you don't know, so as a new person learning it is almost never clear at what point it is ideal to ask for help. Compounding all of this is that many personalities don't like to be bothersome to other people, and that can cause them to hesitate to ask for help, which further sends them on the search between small deltas. It's a very hard problem. reply esafak 15 hours agorootparentYou need to socialize the problem; to broadcast that you are trying to solve something. Some sort of internal discussion board could work. It serves the same purposes as the water cooler. If anyone can think of a way to make software better serve this end I'd love to hear. reply mncharity 11 hours agorootparent> think of a way An app was recently mentioned in hn comments, for \"live blogging\" as PIM - a texting-like personal record of your questions and findings as they go by - research notebook meets chat UI. With a trace like that, or even just a browser trace, an AI might, without interrupting, summarize \"what's Joe working on\" and perhaps \"how's that going?\", or even \"Hey Bob, maybe come chat with Joe?\". And it could be nice to have a PIM that helped you maintain distilled clarity of objectives and state of play. Less nice the vision of a micromanager mesmerized by the dashboarded real-time state of his team. A physics peer-instruction app, in support of \"instructor puts up a question; everyone individually commits an answer; discussion with a neighbor; answer again\", told students which neighbor to talk with, optimizing for fruitful discussions, knowing seating and the (mis)understandings implied by answers. LLMs open a lot of possibilities for the old dream of computer-supported cooperative work. When github was band new, I'd hopped it would grow far more social/meetup/hackathony than it ended up. Wander by, see who's around and what people were banging on; stop by the beginner tables and see if anyone was stuck or struggling; maybe join a push; maybe pair or group; interest profiles, matchmaking (eg round-robin pairing, or \"oh! a category-theoretic type system in-the-style-of-a-conference-bar discussion!\").

I love being able to help, and I am generally in favor of asking questions early, but not ones of the form \"hey so I ran this code and it errored. Help?\" \"... did you read the stack trace? Did you look at the code referenced by the stack trace?\" This is where I've learned responding with \"Sure! What have you tried so far?\" is relevant. reply astura 17 hours agoparentprevThis just has not been my experience at all. I've never had a problem with a junior asking too many questions. Never. I have, however, had issues with them not asking enough questions. reply spenczar5 16 hours agorootparentRight. I never got upset with a question. The only issue is getting the same question multiple times. Not necessarily the same question verbatim, by the way. When I answer a question, I am trying to “teach to fish,” and so there is some system that I am explaining. My hope is that the asker will show curiosity - ask follow-up questions - and then be able to generalize. “I learned there was a lambda for sending emails, in the sysops repo. Maybe there is a lambda for sending slack messages in there too?” Software systems are imperfect so the generalizations might break. In this case I want another question quickly, like “I couldn’t find a slack message sender like the email one. Does one exist?” reply kdmccormick 16 hours agorootparentprevI have had both problems. As it turns out, unsurprisingly, it varies from person to person. It can also vary within a single person. They might, for example, ask questions too quickly when stuck on a technical question that could be solved by reading docs, but ask questions too slowly when stuck on an ambiguous product requiment that can only be personally answered by the PM or UX person. reply steveBK123 17 hours agoparentprevYes, and I think some of the neediest juniors (or seniors who behave like juniors) have now substituted in ChatGPT for some of their nagging. The ones I see doing this most heavily are not really developing themselves and improving in any meaningful way. At least a stack overflow thread will be filled with alternative solutions, arguments, counterpoints and caveats. ChatGPT leaves the questioner with the illusion that they have received the 1 good answer. reply shadowgovt 16 hours agoparentprevFlipping the script a bit: As a senior developer, avoid cultivating learned helplessness. You can push back on this in a couple ways: 1) Instead of answering questions, give a nudge to where the solution is documented (\"Hey I'm swamped, but I'd recommend checking X for more info. If you haven't read through X yet, that's a good resource to skim\"). Keep tabs on how much your junior team members are expected to know, nudge them harder if they aren't taking the time to ingest the gestalt of what's there (it feels like a waste of time to do so sometimes... Reading isn't getting code written. But knowing what's already there saves work in the long run). 2) When something isn't documented... review the docs a junior team member writes, don't write them yourself. This both encourages them to have ownership over the system and will probably generate better docs in the long run (everyone has a notion of what docs should look like, but communication is two-way: seeing what someone writes down clues you into what you missed is necessary to record. Can't tell you how many docs I've seen for cloud systems, for example, that assume the user is logged in with proper credentials when that step alone usually requires handshaking across three services and maybe an IT team). 3) Prefer mistakes to silence. Don't bash a team member for making a correctible mistake, even in production; use it as a learning opportunity both for them and for you (if that mistake was possible, you're missing a guardrail). Actively communicate to junior members that wrong code that exists is preferable to no code; wrong code can be talked about, no code is work yet to be done. And be aware that for a lot of junior devs, the reaction to making a visible error is like touching a hot stove; cultivate a soup-to-nuts environment that minimizes that hot-stove reflex. reply spenczar5 13 hours agorootparentThis is just all excellent. There are a lot of strange attitudes elsewhere in this comment section, ones that I don’t recognize from good senior engineers. Good ones realize that a lot of their job is improving the whole team. If junior engineers are constantly asking trivial questions, maybe they need to be taught to learn! reply tstrimple 15 hours agorootparentprevI agree with all of this with one minor quibble. I'd never tell someone I'm in a position to mentor / coach / lead like this that I'm swamped. It's probably true, but that's my problem not theirs. I don't want them to avoiding talking to me because they think I'm too busy. I know that was in an example statement and not necessarily something you're endorsing, but I thought the point worth bringing up. reply picometer 16 hours agoprevSummary: Scott Alexander recounts his gullibility to various well-reasoned crackpot arguments on a topic, and describes how he to decided to trust experts instead of investing time into learning enough to assess the topic for himself. Then he reflects on the nature of argument-accepting and its relation to rationality. I don’t think the term “learned helplessness” fits well here. It suggests a lack of agency, whereas he exercised much of it, employing his skill of critical thinking to arrive at the right epistemic stance. A better term might be “bounded agency”, to pair with the concept of “bounded rationality”. We recognize that we cannot know everything, and we choose how to invest the capability and resources that we do have. This is far from any type of “helplessness”. reply bluetomcat 16 hours agoparentHe talks about the pitfalls of pure rationality. There can be competing explanatory frameworks for the same thing, and they often contradict each other. Rational arguments may seem rigorous like math, but are in practice standing on shifting sands. It ultimately comes down to what you decide to believe in. This is where traditional values and religion come at play. reply joe_the_user 14 hours agorootparentYes, It's not \"gullibility\", it's believing things in terms of the mechanism of standard argumentation. The basic thing is that arguments involve mustering a series of plausible explanation for all the visible pieces of evidence, casting doubt on alternatives, etc. Before Galileo, philosophy had a huge series of very plausible explanations for natural phenomena, many if not all of which turned out to be wrong. But Galilean science didn't discover more by getting more effective arguments but by looking at the world, judging models by their simplicity and ability to make quantitative predictions and so-on. Mathematics is pretty much the only place where air-tight arguments involving \"for all\" claims actually work. Science shows that reality corresponds to mathematical models but corresponds only approximately and so given a model-based claim can't be extended with an unlimited number of deductive steps. reply fooop 16 hours agorootparentprevI, for one, am glad that the rationality-bubble is popping. reply picometer 16 hours agoparentprevA further thought that is too much for an edit… one of Alexander’s final conclusions is: > I’m glad that some people never develop epistemic learned helplessness, or develop only a limited amount of it, or only in certain domains. It seems to me that […] they’re also the only people who can figure out if something basic and unquestionable is wrong, and make this possibility well-known enough that normal people start becoming willing to consider it. I think there’s better framing here as well: he is glad that a few people direct their own bounded resources towards what I’d call high-risk epistemic investments. I’m also thankful for this. As species, we seem to be pretty good at this epistemic risk/reward balancing act - so far, at least. reply bongripper 17 hours agoprev>I don’t think I’m overselling myself too much to expect that I could argue circles around the average uneducated person.

Too much IQ stroking for my tastes. Scott specifically though, has an established history of thinking through arguments that I find much better than most, and I still think someone who trains at this stuff will do better. To extend my analogy a little further from before, if you go to a boxing gym or boxing enthusiast meetup, there will be plenty of people there who like the idea of fighting, but don't know how to fight. That doesn't mean that a trained boxer still won't be tough in the ring though. reply staticman2 16 hours agorootparentWith boxing you know who won because the judges say so. If Scott argues something at a party, and the other person says \"I don't know why you are wrong but you are.\" Who is to say who \"won\"? Scott comes away thinking he's an amazing thinker.

I'm mostly here to learn from you people, you sometimes say interesting things I am unaware of, or introduce interesting perspectives I might not have seen for myself. I have noticed among humans though, that you argue and debate like this, because you're basically monkeys and monkeys do the social monkey thing. You're trying to achieve higher status by climbing above the other monkeys, whose status will lower (if only a little).

Unfortunately, a significant number of his articles contain schoolboy errors that anyone who wants to claim they are better at thinking through arguments than the average person should never have made. I'll mention just one such article: http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/01/empireforest-fire/ Scott says: \"...democratic nations, like the US and UK, which have gone three hundred or so years with only the tiniest traces of state-sponsored violence (and those traces, like the camps for the Japanese during WWII, have not come from the Left).\" The two obvious, egregious schoolboy errors here are: (1) Don't wars count as \"state-sponsored violence\"? The US and UK certainly haven't gone three hundred years without wars. And some of those wars were civil wars, so even the lame excuse of \"well, wars are violence, but not against the state's own people\" doesn't count. And even if we let that pass, what about the US's treatment of Native Americans? What about the UK's treatment of Ireland? And so on. To say that the US and UK have gone three hundred years with \"only the tiniest traces of state-sponsored violence\" shows a level of historical ignorance that is just staggering. (2) But even if we let all of the above pass: doesn't Scott know that the President who interned Japanese citizens in WWII was from the Left? reply naasking 11 hours agorootparent> To say that the US and UK have gone three hundred years with \"only the tiniest traces of state-sponsored violence\" shows a level of historical ignorance that is just staggering Scott is not ignorant, therefore it seems more plausible that you should reconsider whether Scott is making the point that you think he's making. reply helicalmix 14 hours agorootparentprevHave you considered that it's possible that both you and Scott are particular good at reasoning, and it's everyone else that is much worse at this stuff?

I'm not outright trying to refute you, so much as I have a belief that people tend to overstate the \"good old days\", so I usually prefer more concrete data points. reply digital-cygnet 15 hours agorootparentprevWhile Scott does make errors, I've found he works hard to avoid making them and forthright when he does (e.g., not everyone has a Mistakes page in the main navigation bar of their site[1]) What you're missing in your example is that, in context, the state-sponsored violence he's talking about is \"against one's own people\" (e.g., he also refers to it as a \"reign of terror\" a few times, like those of Robespierre, Stalin, Pol Pot, etc). I think there's a difference of kind between say the 19th century US's (awful) treatment of Native Americans (who were explicitly treated as \"other\" very consistently) and Stalin's (also awful) dekulakization (in which one-time typical members of Russian society were declared enemies of the state and purged). So his point isn't that the UK and US have done no wrong, it's that despite having democratic systems for centuries that haven't gone through the kind of reign of terror that Scott's interlocutors claim they should have [1] https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/mistakes reply pdonis 15 hours agorootparentBtw, I noticed another egregious error: \"France, where a reign of terror five years after the Bourbon monarchy is clearly contrasted with a hundred fifty terror-free years since it became democratic in 1870.\" Um, what? France is now on its Fifth republic, and the transitions haven't always been peaceful. Not to mention Indochina, Algeria (France's own leaders explicitly described what the French did to subdue Algeria as \"terrorism\"), etc. And many of the people who were terrorized in Algeria were French citizens. reply pdonis 15 hours agorootparentprev> he works hard to avoid making them He does so when he sees that there is a potential mistake to be made, yes. But he doesn't seem to me to work hard at all at questioning things that he appears to think are too obvious to need questioning.

The UK fought a war against its own people in the American Revolution. The US fought a war against its own people in the US Civil War. The US fought against Native Americans. The UK fought against Ireland. And so on. > I think there's a difference of kind I think this is even more of a hairsplitting distinction that I don't buy. But again, leaving that aside, if Scott wanted to make an argument for such a difference in kind, he should have made one. Just taking it as so obvious as not to need any argument is not justified. And the need for making such an argument doesn't even seem to be on Scott's radar. I find that either astoundingly obtuse, or astoundingly disingenuous. reply pdonis 13 hours agorootparentprev> haven't gone through the kind of reign of terror that Scott's interlocutors claim they should have There's another point about this as well. Scott claims in the article that his \"alternate model\" makes better predictions than his \"Reactionary model\" (which is something of a straw man, but let that pass). But if we look at the cases he cites, here is how they actually stack up against the models: French Revolution: Ended up with Napoleon taking power as Emperor, i.e., a monarch. Sure looks more like the Reactionary model to me. Russian Revolution: While the USSR did end up falling apart of its own weight after decades of terror gradually morphing into somewhat less terrifying bureaucracy, what has happened to Russia since looks more like \"repressive monarchy\" than \"government mellows out and does pretty okay\". Chinese Revolution: I suppose that the fact that the Chinese Communist Party has adopted some features of capitalism in order to allow the country to actually have some economic growth might count as a sort of \"mellowing out\", but it would still be very hard to make a case that China's government is closer to \"doing pretty okay\" than it is to \"strong repressive monarchy\". In other words, even if we agree that the US and UK have reached Step 6 of Scott's \"alternate model\", historically, those countries (and other countries in the British Commonwealth, like Canada and Australia) are the only cases where that has happened. Historically, reigns of terror brought on by repressive regimes have in all other cases led to new repressive regimes. (Btw, this is not to say that the Reactionary model's claim that the new monarchy in its last step is an improvement, is correct. The actual historical facts are that the new repressive regimes are often worse than the old ones.) reply pdonis 14 hours agorootparentprev> haven't gone through the kind of reign of terror that Scott's interlocutors claim they should have I'll comment on this separately because it goes deeper into the central claim of the arrticle. If you're going to make this claim, you need to ask whether the UK and US have actually avoided such things, or merely made sure they happened in other countries instead. The US under Woodrow Wilson enabled the Soviet Union to exist by failing to support the Kerensky government, even though the US had troops in the area, and by discouraging the other allied powers from helping on the grounds that everybody was already too exhausted after four years of war. (Not to mention that Communism wasn't of Russian origin; it was exported to Russia by American and British intellectuals, such as Jack Reed. And one of their reasons for doing so was that Communism was supposed to be more \"democratic\".) The US, UK, and France created the conditions for the Nazis to take power in Germany by imposing such harsh terms in the Treaty of Versailles (terms which were nothing like what the Armistice had implicitly promised). The UK under Chamberlain, along with France, enabled Hitler's Germany to conquer Eastern Europe by pursuing a policy of appeasement. The US under FDR allowed Stalin to take over all of Eastern Europe at the end of WW II (which, btw, made WW II a failure in Europe since the stated objective was to free Eastern Europe from tyranny, and Stalin by any measure was a worse tyrant than Hitler) because FDR wanted to suck up to Stalin and be his friend. (For example, read the historical book Stalin's War.) And even before that, FDR and his administration (and the press, such as the New York Times) systematically lied to the American people about the true nature of Stalin's regime, which was well known to the US government (and to reporters who were there) in the 1930s. If the American people had known what was actually happening in Stalin's Russia, they would never have agreed to having the USSR as an ally in WW II or allowing the USSR to take over Eastern Europe. The US allowed Mao and his Communists to take over China by withdrawing support for Chiang Kai-Shek. If the US had supported Chiang, the entire country of China would have a government that's basically the government Taiwan has now (since Taiwan is where Chiang and his supporters went when Mao drove them out of China). Imagine how much better the geopolitical situation would be if that were the case. Sure, if you want to make hairsplitting distinctions, none of these counted as \"state-sponsored violence\" against the people of the US or UK. But Scott's central claim in the article is that it is repressive monarchy, not \"democracy\", that causes reigns of terror. Before making such a claim and exonerating \"democracies\", one should at least examine the possibility that the \"democracies\" actually enabled the reigns of terror. And when you examine that claim historically, you find that, yep, \"democracies\" were doing exactly that. reply wharvle 13 hours agorootparentI think you'd have to make some outlandish claims if you wanted to connect most of the material you're trying to bring in to the direct topic of this piece. Re-read the pieces Scott is responding to if you want to see what I mean—the topic of this piece is fairly narrow, and most of what you're proposing to bring in is non-sequitur without some pretty wild connective tissue added, which connective tissue I doubt you'd want to try to defend. Stuff like \"leftward-trending liberal democracies tend to become more and more permissive of egregious domestic political violence in other countries over time\" would be the minimum to make any kind of even oblique sort-of connection to the actual topic of the piece, and... surely not, right? reply pdonis 13 hours agorootparent> I think you'd have to make some outlandish claims if you wanted to connect most of the material you're trying to bring in to the direct topic of this piece.

The fact that the particular \"liberal democracies\" Scott references, the US and UK, do their \"state-sponsored violence\" by proxy instead of directly is not a coincidence: it is what allows those countries to claim that they are \"liberal democracies\" and don't have \"state-sponsored violence\" for the benefit of their voters, while blaming those \"repressive regimes\" for all of the mayhem in the world--when in fact the \"liberal democracies\" themselves are just as much to blame. > Stuff like \"leftward-trending liberal democracies tend to become more and more permissive of egregious domestic political violence in other countries over time\" While I think this is actually true (the US has caused far more mischief recently in the name of \"spreading democracy\" than it did in the 19th century, for example), it is not the argument I was making. The argument I was making is simpler than that, and is summarized above. reply wharvle 13 hours agorootparentBut the argument you'd prefer to focus on isn't connected to the topic in Scott's piece, because Scott's writing to address specific claims with predictive power (as in: we can \"replay the tapes\" of history and see if what we'd expect to see, if they're true, is evident—and they're strong and confident claims, so we'd expect it to be pretty clear if it is) in a couple other pieces, to which pieces the argument you want to make also isn't connected. reply pdonis 13 hours agorootparent> Scott's writing to address specific claims with predictive power Which his model does not have. That was the point of the post of mine upthread that I referred you to. The actual cases he cites (French Revolution, Russian Revolution, Chinese Revolution) are a much better match for the Reactionary model (though with a caveat that I gave in my upthread post--the final \"monarchy\" step in these cases, e.g., Putin's Russia, is not an improvement) than they are for his alternate model. (His justification for his alternate model matching the Russian Revolution better is that Khruschev and Gorbachev were \"more mellow\" than Stalin, but step 6 of his alternate model says that the government \"does pretty okay\", which was not true of Gorbachev's USSR any more than it was of Khruschev's--not to mention Putin's Russia, as I said above.) So why is Scott so confident of his alternate model, if it actually is worse, on net, than the Reactionary model he criticizes? Because he fails to realize that the US and UK (and other countries in the British Commonwealth like Canada and Australia) are not the historical norm, but are historical outliers. They have managed to settle into \"liberal democracy\" which might be \"mellow\" and doing \"pretty okay\" at home only by exporting all of the \"state-sponsored violence\" elsewhere, where their voters can ignore it and their politicians can pretend it's the fault of those other \"repressive regimes\". In other words, the egregious historical errors Scott makes in this article, which was what I originally called out in my first post in this discussion, are closely connected to the main point of his article: he is only able to even entertain that point, much less write an entire article about it, because of the false historical narrative he has. Here's another example, where Scott restates the article's central claim (from which its title is taken): \"A monarch who voluntarily relaxes their power before being forced to do so by the situation – like the constitutional monarchs of Europe or the King of Thailand – is performing a controlled burn, destroying the overgrowth that would otherwise cause a fire and skipping directly from 1 to 6.\" Tell that to Tsar Nicholas II, who voluntarily abdicated when his high officials convinced him that it was for the good of the country. Russia not only did not \"skip directly\" from Scott's 1 to 6, it never reached his 6 at all (see above). Since this was one of the examples Scott explicitly chose, you'd expect him to at least check to see whether the actual historical facts matched his narrative. reply wharvle 12 hours agorootparentThe claims he's addressing are, boiled down: 1) That leftist movements inevitably become more prone to violence (purges, genocide, violent repression of opponents in general, \"reigns of terror\") over time, and 2) Democracies have a strong-bordering-on-inescapable tendency to incubate such leftist movements, and to grow more leftist over time. What we should expect to see, then: 1) Radical, violent leftist movements that gain power get ever-more violent over time. 2) Democracies become more unstable and prone to those specific sorts of violence, over time, and this unabated increase pushes ever closer to crisis points . What we see instead is: 1) The worst leftist violence tends to be immediately preceded by authoritarian governments (which is what these fringe folks Scott's responding to want more of—this is a very specific and out-there movement making very specific and out-there claims, not the entire field of criticism of leftism or democracy), rather than to be preceded by democracy; to reach their fever-pitch very quickly; and to cool off over time rather than doing what we'd expect based on what was claimed to be true, which would be for them to typically get worse the more time passed. 2) Meanwhile, democracies seem... fairly stable, actually, without a clear, inevitably-trending-upward trend line on leftist-induced violence and chaos, or what have you. Fluctuating, sure, but where's the trend line for specifically that? Where are the ones ending in leftist reigns of terror? All of them are supposed to be heading toward a fever-pitch of leftist purges and genocide. Like, that specific thing is what was claimed. Does it look that way? LOL no. I think what's key to following this is that the thing he's arguing against is a pretty fringe political view. He's not addressing some more-tame, more-mainstream criticism or model-for-the-development of either the left, or democracies, that might be stronger. He's trying to suss out whether the above, specifically, appears to describe actual, observable tendencies of leftism and democracies in the real world. reply pdonis 12 hours agorootparent> The claims he's addressing are, boiled down As I said in my post upthread that I referred to, I am not arguing for the claims that Scott is arguing against. (I do say that Scott's \"Reactionary model\" is a better historical fit to the cases he cites, but only with the key caveat I gave about the final step, and that caveat directly opposes the claims that Scott's \"reactionaries\" make based on that model.) I am arguing against the claims that Scott is making about his \"alternate model\". His article is not just rebutting his version of \"Reactionary\". He is making claims of his own. Those are what I am addressing. I have already explicitly quoted claims that he makes that are historically false. Those claims are what support his \"alternate model\", which his article is arguing for. reply pdonis 12 hours agorootparentprevYour claim 2) does not imply your \"expect to see\" 2). Why? Because democracies don't have to incubate leftist movements in their own country. They can incubate them elsewhere. Which, indeed, they do, as I have said. This, in itself, is not an argument for the \"reactionary\" claims Scott is arguing against, for reasons I have already given. But it is an argument against Scott's \"alternate model\". Also, democracies can grow more leftist over time (which, I would argue, they have) without becoming internally unstable, as long as a majority of voters continue to vote for policies that move further and further left. Which I think is a fair description of what has happened in \"democracies\" over the past century or more. Whether this tendency can continue indefinitely is a different question. reply wharvle 11 hours agorootparentThese are interesting claims and points, perhaps, but remain disconnected from the original material. In particular: > They can incubate them elsewhere. Which, indeed, they do, as I have said. This needs an immense amount of development to maybe qualify as both connected-enough to this topic to belong in Scott's piece, and a strong enough claim to be worth either explaining and refuting, or adopting and defending. You're claiming that things like declining to prosecute a war against the USSR after WWII is an example of an action that acted as an outlet for what would otherwise have become domestic US leftist political violence in the US. There are, like, several things about that, and your other examples, that need to be filled in before it might be clear that makes any sense at all, plus some kind of pattern of this kind of thing increasing over time needs to be established that can't easily be explained by other, more-straightforward factors. Notably an awful lot of these examples are failures to act—what's that about? How's that an outlet for a kind of \"energy\" that would otherwise push the US closer to a reign of terror? Why should we think that sort of thing can act as such an outlet? What's the connection between those things? I see none whatsoever—it is not obvious this should be entertained as a relevant and strong line of inquiry. > Also, democracies can grow more leftist over time (which, I would argue, they have) without becoming internally unstable, as long as a majority of voters continue to vote for policies that move further and further left. Maybe! But it doesn't appear to make them ever-more violent in the specific way in question. The real events and trends we have before us really don't appear to fit—not to fail to fit your claims, but by the claims made by the folks Scott wrote the piece to address. (This isn't me arguing against you—I follow that you do get that what you're aiming at is Scott's alternative model, not that you're arguing in support of the Reactionaries) You have proposed some reasons different from Scott's that this may be the case, and fault him for not addressing your proposed reasons, but it remains unclear to me that there's a strong line of argument there, specifically as it relates to the topic at hand. It's not clear to me that he should have brought it up, or that it makes his argument weaker that he did not, let alone that it's part of some set of \"schoolboy mistakes\" to have not done so. What I don't find any of this back-and-forth convincing about, is that this piece of Scott's is in error for failing to address this stuff. I definitely am not convinced that failing to entertain (or even mention) some kind of, \"the 'temperature' of US leftist domestic political violence has, perhaps, remained cool only because we did stuff like not do much to help Chiang Kai-shek\" explanation, constitutes an elementary error. reply pdonis 9 hours agorootparent> You're claiming that things like declining to prosecute a war against the USSR after WWII is an example of an action that acted as an outlet for what would otherwise have become domestic US leftist political violence in the US. I am making no such claim. My claim is simpler: Scott's argument is that \"liberal democracies\" are the best way to prevent \"state-sponsored violence\". But that argument can't possibly be valid if \"liberal democracies\" in fact cause violence in other countries. Scott's rebuttal to that claim is to gerrymander the definition of \"state-sponsored violence\" so that it only counts if it's against the citizens of the \"liberal democracies\" themselves. But that is exactly the problem: people like Scott can pat themselves on the back about how great \"liberal democracies\" are only by ignoring the historical record of \"liberal democracies\" sponsoring all kinds of violence in other states besides their own. If Scott were to remove the blinders he put on by defining \"state-sponsored violence\" in such a narrow way and take an honest look at the historical record of \"liberal democracies\", he would never have even tried to write such an article. Instead he would be directing his intellectual resources towards a much more useful inquiry: why do \"liberal democracies\" sponsor so much violence in other countries--especially when, in every other country besides their own, sponsoring all that violence never even leads to liberal democracy? Why don't they see the obvious contradiction between their stated principles and the actual results of their actions? But that question isn't even on Scott's radar, because of his ignorance of history. reply pdonis 9 hours agorootparentprev> What I don't find any of this back-and-forth convincing about, is that this piece of Scott's is in error for failing to address this stuff. Scott's argument--not his anti-Reactionary argument, but his argument in favor of his alternate model--depends on particular historical claims. Those claims are false, and they're false because of the historical errors he makes. Those historical errors are not about small or peripheral points. They are about points that are central to his argument. I have already explicitly quoted and discussed them and I won't repeat them here. I just find it difficult to see how Scott is not in error for failing to spot these historical mistakes that he makes, particularly in view of his reputation for supposedly being much better than average at making valid arguments.

Ah, that old standby \"No True Scotsman\". Sorry, not buying it. > The stated policies of the US Democratic Party barely correspond to those of leftist parties worldwide. No political party's stated policies can be taken seriously, since political parties, on immense amounts of historical evidence, will lie about their actual goals as much as they need to to get elected and stay elected. For example, the Democratic platform that FDR ran on in 1932 did not look very leftist, but the actual things he did once in office were most definitely leftist, and bore no resemblance whatever to the platform he ran on. Did any Democrats object? Hollow laugh. If you want to argue that the US Democratic party is not as far left as, for example, leftist parties in the UK or Europe, yes, that's probably true.

Unfortunately, that's not an analytic function with a known formula and computable derivative... reply bloaf 16 hours agoparentprevRight, and I think the distinction he draws between this and engineering is interesting. My experience (as an engineer) is that engineers get paid to manipulate the world around them in precise, predictable ways. As such, they tend to cultivate a core set of relatively simple principles (e.g. heat and material balances) which they take seriously by using to plan/design/etc their manipulations of the world. The engineer's creativity lies in finding new ways to combine the known-reliable principles, and stake their reputation on the result. Scientists, on the other hand, are expected to come up with new principles. If they take too many ideas seriously, there is no room left for creative new explanations. Medicine lies somewhere in between, insofar as doctors are trying to manipulate patient's health with the best principles they can find, but they also have to wear a scientists hat via diagnosis, i.e. figuring out which principles to apply to a patient. And so the reaction to e.g. fundamentalism makes sense: An engineer likes having a fundamental set of universal principles, and is comfortable using them to make plans for manipulating the world. They expect the religious world to work the same way as they do, and take those principles seriously. A scientist wants to know \"well I've got a new idea for a fundamental principle, how can we find out if I'm right?\" And the fundamentalist has no answer. A doctor will want to know how certain the fundamentalist is, and how they know those principles even apply to current situation, and the fundamentalist will have no answer. reply helicalmix 17 hours agoparentprevOne counterexample for why I think it's not always the best approach is that there are sometimes disproportionate rewards for being right when everyone else is wrong.

Creationists aren't actually faced with that question - not Creationists who believe in a God who is eternal, anyway. Things without beginnings don't have origins. If you want to actually attack that belief, you need to either 1) show that God isn't eternal, or 2) show that eternal things are impossible. Or you have to do the hard work of 3) persuading them that a purely naturalistic process fits the available evidence better than a Creator does. reply nineplay 15 hours agorootparentI'm just suggesting that Creationism requires more faith than one might think at first glance.

In particular, big fan of Julian Jaynes and The Development of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bi-cameral Mind, and the aquatic ape hypothesis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis I get that they're probably not true, but I do enjoy reading novel thinking and viewpoints by smart people with a cool hook. reply jerf 16 hours agoparentI think if you want to start down that sort of road, it's important to read lots of them. Read zero, you're probably fine. Read lots of them, you're probably fine. \"One or two\" is where the danger is maximized. And I would agree with \"likely\" wrong. Some of them probably aren't entirely wrong and may even be more correct than the mainstream. Figuring out which is the real trick, though. Related to the original article, I tend to scale my Bayesian updates based on my ability to test a theory. In the case of something like the Breakdown of the Bi-cameral Mind, it ends up taking such a deduction as a result of that heuristic that it is almost indistinguishable from reading a science fiction book for me; fun and entertaining, but doesn't really impact me much except in a very vague \"keep the mind loose and limber\" sense. I have done a lot of heterodox thinking in the world of programming and engineering, though, because I can test theories very easily. Some of them work. Some of them don't. And precisely because it is so easy to test, the heterodoxy-ness is often lower than crackpot theories about 10,000 years ago, e.g., \"Haskell has some interesting things to say\" is made significantly less \"crackpot\" by the fact that plenty of other people have the ability to test that hypothesis as well, and as such, it is upgraded from \"crackpot\" to merely a \"minority\" view. So my particular twist on Scott's point is, if you can safely and cheaply test a bit of a far-out theory, don't be afraid to do so. You can use this to resolve the epistemic learned helplessness in those particular areas. It is good to put a bit down on cheap, low-probability, high-payout events; you can even justify this mathematically via the Kelly Criterion: https://www.techopedia.com/gambling-guides/kelly-criterion-g... If there is one thing that angers me about way science is taught, it is that it is something that other people do, and that it is something special that you do with either the full \"scientific method\" or it's worthless. In fact it's an incredible tool for every day life, on all sorts of topics, and one must simply adjust for the fact that the lower effort put in, the less one should trust it, but that doesn't mean the total trust must necessarily be uselessly low just because you didn't conduct your experiment on whether or not fertilizer A or B worked better on your tomatos up to science journal standards. reply ineptech 15 hours agoparentprevSame.

There are basically three epistemologies. There's the constructive (mathematical, proscriptive), the empirical (science, emotional), and trust. The constructive and empirical epistemologies don't separate as neatly as we would like them to, but a constructive argument basically looks like: \"here's a thing that you definitely believe, and here is an implication of that, therefore you believe in the implication\" aka modus ponens. The empirical epistemology goes: \"You have made a lot of observations, here's a simple explanation for all of them that you may go check\", more or less the scientific method. The trust based epistemology is just: \"If I can establish facts about you, then I can establish facts about the things that you claim to believe, without having to see the receipts\" Each of these epistemologies has its own definition of argument, and they're all similar, but they're distinct, and the author isn't being clear about which one he means. In my estimation, the passages about ancient history are a reflection of him mistaking trust based arguments for empirical ones. This is a very common mistake. An empirical argument is of the form \"Here is the test that I used to differentiate my explanation from other explanations, and why I think this is a good test\", whereas the trust based argument for the same explanation would be \"Here is the data that my theory explains\". reply leshow 8 hours agoprev> Even the smartest people I know have a commendable tendency not to take certain ideas seriously.

Replace \"the arguments\" in this sentence with \"complexity\" for a more universal statement on human nature. Some people deal with complexity through science. This sounds great, until you realize that science is currently systematic (step by step) and not systemic (whole picture). Reality is made of interconnected systems. A systematic approach leaves blind spots. For instance, look at medicine. Traditionally, men were seen as less complex to study because of the lack of a (regular) hormone cycle. Our medical system is largely based on authoritatively treating women as \"smaller men\". This results in systemic ignorance of women's health. Even in veterinary medicine, kittens are often treated as \"smaller puppies\". This results in needlessly dead kittens. The difference between essential complexity (complexity created to handle complexity) and inessential complexity (complexity driven by another purpose) is also important. Some people rely on inessential complexity to derive authority: they sound like an expert when they talk about their \"complex\" system. Understanding systems and system dynamics is useful for discerning between good information and bad information. If you can visualize an argument as a system (and as part of a system), it is easier to avoid getting lost in the details. reply com2kid 15 hours agoparent> Some people deal with complexity through science.

    "originBody": "CLI USER EXPERIENCE CASE STUDY: TOPIARY 5 October 2023 — by Christopher Harrison  ux  rust  topiary Command line interface (CLI) tools have a reputation for being difficult to use. Whilst powerful once mastered, a CLI inherently lacks a litany of user interface “nice-to-haves”, simply by virtue of its medium: Simplicity: Common tasks should be easy to perform. This is often not the case, but worse is when tasks can be tweaked in myriad ways, leading to a combinatorial explosion of flags, options and modifiers. Memorability: How does one remember all those different options? It’s not realistic, which is why we so often resort to double-checking the usage text, man pages, or search engine/generative AI du jour. Discoverability: Reminding ourselves how to perform what we know (or assume) can be done isn’t the same as guiding us towards the full gamut of what’s possible. Even when reading the entire reference manual (or source code), this isn’t a sure thing: useful emergent behaviour often goes undocumented. Familiarity: So we effectively resort to guessing. --help must give us the usage text, right? There are common idioms that are pervasive, but even this is not a guarantee. Clarity: Open, meaningful communication is generally a good idea in all walks of life. How often have you run a CLI command to be presented with zero output, relying on echo $? to see if it even succeeded? Or, at the other extreme, so much logging noise flooding your terminal that you can’t tell what’s going on? tar, lampooned in the above XKCD, is — at nearly 45-years-old — a product of its age. The current GNU (and, to a lesser extent, BSD) tar implementations go some way to improve things, but old habits die hard and it’s still very common to see tar chzPf-and-friends in the wild. Regardless, more modern tools also suffer from similar problems; anyone who has used Git, or shudder GnuPG will attest to this. As Topiary — Tweag’s code formatting engine — matures, I took the opportunity to modernise its CLI before suboptimal patterns become entrenched. Sowing the seeds of change In its early development, Topiary’s CLI was largely motivated by need. When features were added, they were often exposed as command line arguments, with little thought about the overall experience. This is what it had organically grown into: CLI app for Topiary, the universal code formatter. Usage: topiary [OPTIONS] |--input-files [...]> Options: -l, --languageWhich language to parse and format [possible values: json, nickel, ocaml, ocaml-interface, ocamllex, toml] -f, --input-files [...] Path to an input file or multiple input files. If omitted, or equal to \"-\", read from standard input. If multiple files are provided, `in_place` is assumed [default: -] -q, --queryWhich query file to use -o, --output-filePath to an output file. If omitted, or equal to \"-\", write to standard output -i, --in-place Format the input files in place -v, --visualise[=] Visualise the syntax tree, rather than format [possible values: json, dot] -s, --skip-idempotence Do not check that formatting twice gives the same output --output-configuration Output the full configuration to stderr before continuing -t, --tolerate-parsing-errors Format as much as possible even if some of the input causes parsing errors --configuration-overrideOverride all configuration with the provided file [env: TOPIARY_CONFIGURATION_OVERRIDE=] -c, --configuration-fileAdd the specified configuration file with the highest priority [env: TOPIARY_CONFIGURATION_FILE=] -h, --help Print help -V, --version Print version Syntax tree visualisation is a good example: This was toggled with the --visualise argument, which took an optional parameter to switch the output format between GraphViz DOT and JSON. Visualisation was designed as a different mode of operation, to aid the development of formatting queries, but being expressed as an argument could imply to users that formatting should still happen. This implication is reinforced by the presence of formatting-specific arguments, such as --skip-idempotence and --tolerate-parsing-errors; run together with --visualise is meaningless, but it worked regardless. At a more fundamental level, there’s the question of I/O: From where is input read, and to where is it written? The input to a formatting tool is kind of important, to say the least, and if Topiary is to do anything besides cooking silicon wafers, it’s probably a good idea to do something with its result. Yet an awkward dance of --input-file, --output-file and --in-place was imposed. Those may seem self-explanatory — and they were, in the beginning — but things change: When support for formatting multiple inputs was added, --input-file became --input-files. However, what happens if I try to visualise multiple inputs? How do multiple inputs map to outputs? The usage text says that --in-place is assumed in this case, but what if I also specify an --output-file? What if I want to work with standard input or standard output? What about read-only files? Is --in-place permitted in these cases? Why do I even have to specify --input-files (or its short form, -f)? Of course I’m going to be providing an input of some kind, so it’s a bit redundant. While some of these questions were answered by the usage text, to really know the behaviour of edge cases, you’d have to experiment or start reading the source code. Then there are the little things. Like when providing custom configuration, how do --configuration-file and --configuration-override interact? (I actually did have to read the source code to figure that one out!) What about logging output, presuming there is any; how does one access that? Death by a thousand cuts. Don’t get me wrong: Topiary’s CLI was certainly functional in this state. However, it leant too heavily on assumptions and the Topiary team’s collective (but inscrutable) knowledge. This made it clumsy, sometimes surprising and, overall, imposed too much friction on new users. Mighty oaks from little acorns grow So I decided to fully rework the CLI. My mandate was clear: Make illegal states unrepresentable This is a classic idiom from strongly typed functional programming, where the type system is leveraged to forbid invalid input. The same logic applies to command line arguments and, as Topiary is written in Rust, I was able to achieve this using the same mechanism. Topiary uses the excellent clap command line argument parser library, which has a feature to derive the parser directly from your types and their annotations (such as doc comments). This makes the definition of the CLI arguments purely declarative, leaving you with only the work of setting up your types correctly. All my other CLI modernisation work stems from here. To give some examples of what’s now unrepresentable (i.e., will fail): Attempting to visualise multiple files; Specifying a formatting language when formatting files (which instead use inference on the filename, driven by the configuration) or, vice versa, specifying an input file when formatting standard input; Specifying a formatting query file without a formatting language when formatting standard input. Separate modes of operation Formatting and visualisation are two distinct modes of operation; they do different things and take different options. Visualisation with --in-place wouldn’t only be wrong, it would be catastrophic! The former CLI also had an additional “pseudo-mode” of outputting the raw configuration to standard error, for debugging purposes. The old-fashioned way of separating modes in non-interactive CLI tools was to have multiple binaries. This tends to both pollute the global command namespace (ImageMagick’s convert, anyone?) and can be hindered by a lack of consistency amongst related tools. The new hotness — and by “new”, I mean “for the last decade, or two” — is to use subcommands to mark this separation. So that’s what I did: topiary format formats your code. topiary visualise visualises your code. topiary config outputs the computed configuration, as TOML. (Formatted, of course!) topiary completion is a new feature, which generates shell completion scripts to aid discoverability. All have common options and each have specific options, facilitated by the types I defined. If a new mode is developed in the future, it can just be added without breaking backwards compatibility. Make use of familiar idioms Interaction with a CLI tool, that misses out on the visual cues and metaphors that a GUI can provide, should be like a dialogue. (Preferably a productive and friendly one, rather than one that ends up with you questioning your life choices.) To that end, a de facto lexicon exists amongst CLI tools with common behaviours that should be adhered to. It would be weird, for example, if --assist was the option to show the usage text, rather than --help. There are a few things I’ve done in the new Topiary CLI to improve its conversation skills: While --input-file and the likes are not unheard of, it’s far more common, when input is required, to use positional FILE arguments. This also plays nicely with, say, scripts that one may wish to write. The point of a formatter is to format its input, it therefore stands to reason that --in-place is implied when dealing with files. (A notable exception to this is sed, but as a “stream editor” first, it has a little more right to an --in-place option, which is not its default.) The ability to format standard input is still important, though. In which case, rather than using the - file convention, files are simply omitted. This allows Topiary to be put into a script pipeline and enables this common interaction: $ topiary format --language json ⟵ Invocation {\"type\":\"your code here\"} ⟵ Standard input⟵ EOF { \"type\": \"your code here\" } ⟵ Formatted standard output Logging information has always existed in Topiary, but you wouldn’t know unless you read the README fairly thoroughly. It used to be exposed through the RUST_LOG environment variable, which is an artefact of the env_logger library. This has been changed to a --verbose flag, following the common idiom of “more occurrences means more output” (e.g., -vvv maps to debug logging). Make common tasks easy and unsurprising Topiary exposes a number of options. These knobs allow you to change its behaviour in various ways and, while they shouldn’t be hidden away, they shouldn’t obstruct the “happy path”. This echoes the design principles that were laid out for Topiary’s formatting styles: uniform and “good enough”. The same can be said for the CLI: Simplicity, over steampunk. Some examples I’ve implemented: Formatting all your project’s files is just a matter of running topiary format PROJECT_DIR. Topiary will recursively walk the directory (no longer having to rely on shell expansion) and format every file it understands. Visualisation defaults to GraphViz DOT output, rather than JSON. A PDF of the syntax tree can now be created with the very natural: topiary visualise /path/to/my.file \\dot -Tpdf \\ > syntax-tree.pdf Topiary’s configuration is sourced from a priority list and then collated in one of three ways. This affords a high degree of customisation, but can make it difficult to introspect the runtime configuration. However, topiary config will not only output the computed configuration — which can then be reused, for reproducibility’s sake — but Topiary will also annotate it in a way that lets you understand where it came from: # Configuration collated from the following sources, # in priority order (lowest to highest): # # 1. Built-in configuration # 2. /home/user/.config/topiary/languages.toml # 3. /home/user/my-project/.topiary/languages.toml # # Collation mode: Merge [[language]] name = \"json\" extensions = [ \"json\", ] # etc. Don’t paint yourself into a corner You may be thinking: If Topiary is primarily a formatter, why can’t I just skip the format subcommand and have the CLI assume that as the default? It’s a good question and one which I asked myself. The most common task for the Topiary CLI will be formatting, so by my earlier admission of “making common tasks easy”, surely this optimisation would be beneficial? The answer to this has two parts: Firstly, clap doesn’t make this easy to do, when using its derivation feature. Subcommands can certainly be optional, but to force the parser into a “default path or subcommand path” state machine, while maintaining coherent usage text, significantly goes against its grain. Shortly after publishing this article, Ed Page — the principal contributor of clap — reached out to let me know that clap can actually do this, and quite straightforwardly. As to my second point, below, while generally true, he also suggested an interesting compromise, which the Topiary team will work on implementing. More importantly, however, is that if Topiary commits to providing a stable interface — which it certainly does — then other subcommands (current and future) are effectively blocked by virtue of the positional and arbitrary file inputs. What happens, for example, if you want to format a file called config? This second point is crucial. Not only does it have the effect of prohibiting legitimate subcommands, but users will come to rely on this shorthand which fossilises the interface with suboptimal behaviour. For the same reason, I don’t allow subcommand or long option inference (that is, expanding partial CLI arguments when there are no ambiguities). There are, however, a handful of subcommand aliases which are helpful to make common tasks quicker to type (e.g., fmt for format), or when alternative spellings are common. See the forest for the trees The full usage text for what I ended up with is too long to paste into this article, but it can of course be found in Topiary’s documentation. Besides, maybe a little demo would be more illustrative. Here’s how it looks with completion in zsh (i.e., don’t blame Topiary for the clipping): The path trod to arrive at this destination was not random. It was informed by my own experience with CLI tools, guided by the direction in which clap steers you. Further polish was added on the advice of the Command Line Interface Guidelines book. That said, UX research is a legitimate discipline — involving testing and analytics on, you know, users — which is usually the purview of GUIs. I’m not aware of any UX research done in the realm of CLIs, but this may be an interesting lead to follow. In the meantime, the changes discussed in this article, as well as numerous “quality of life” improvements to the CLI codebase — and other enhancements to Topiary, as a whole — landed in Topiary v0.3. Making such sweeping changes was a big job that required careful planning and review. However, I think the results speak for themselves and that this upfront investment will pay off as Topiary blooms. Thanks to Nicolas Jeannerod and Erin van der Veen for their reviews of this article.

    "commentBody": "CLI user experience case study (tweag.io)166 points by Xophmeister 23 hours agohidepastfavorite137 comments atoav 22 hours agoAs someone who teaches these things occasionally to non-tech people I think the hard thing about CLI tools are the following: 1. The terminal when you first open it is intimidating to most and doesn't offer any help to figure out how to use it. If people think something is hard, they will have a harder time understanding it as well (same goes for thinking something will be boring, there have been studies on that) 2. Text editing in the terminal works different than literally anywhere else. You can't simply click and mark text, shortcuts are different, etc. 3. You have to get that text has to be exact, you have to know syntax rules with where to put spaces, how to work with quotes, escape strings and all that. That is just not easy. For those of us who already speak any given shell, this may be aomething we forget. But it is like learning a language and a way to think. Once you are fluent, it is easy. But it is worth it in my opinion, especially if you want to work with niche special tools or if you want reliable tools that will just work for decades. reply nkrisc 19 hours agoparentThe biggest issue I’ve see , particularly regarding your first point, is simple discoverability of capabilities. It is very difficult, at least initially, to even begin to discover what’s possible in a terminal environment. There are so many important things that a new user simply needs to be taught, or they will likely never discover basic functionality - such as how to even open, read, and navigate the manual. The UX barrier to entry is very high without hand-holding or extensive online searching and a strong willingness to persevere in the face of adversity. GUI applications (generally) solve the initial discoverability barrier by simply showing you what’s possible. I remember being a kid looking at DOS and wondering “what do I even do?” It was essentially a blank screen with very little indication of how to proceed. My dad had sticky notes on the monitor with the commands to enter to run games. I never really looked at a command line again after I started using the Windows desktop until I started really learning programming after college, and it was just as daunting at first. reply palata 9 hours agorootparentWhile I understand (and agree) with your point about a GUI \"showing you what's possible\", I would like to add some nuance: 1. People have to learn the basics of the GUI. Take someone who lived 50 years without seeing a computer and show them Windows. They will have to learn that they can move the mouse, left/right click, and even move while clicking. They will have to learn that some parts of the UI are interactive (e.g. buttons) and others aren't. It is not as intuitive as people tend to imply. My father still double-clicks on elements that - to me - obviously don't require a double click (like a hyperlink). And many people are completely lost if you move them from their Windows to macOS or some Linux UI. Or even between two flavours of Android. 2. Once you know the basic of GUI (\"there is a start menu\", \"I can click on buttons\", ...), the UI does not show you that there exists apps like Photoshop to edit pictures, or like Slack to talk to people. You have to somehow learn about the app from somewhere, install it, and only then you get their UI that \"shows you what's possible\". I would argue that the CLI is actually quite similar. Once you have learned the basics (\"I can change directory\", \"I can `man cmd`\"), then you have to discover apps somehow (e.g. a friend saying \"install git with `apt install git`\"), and then you can just open the manual with `man git`, and it will most definitely show you what's possible. The difference, I think, is that people generally don't really want to learn the CLI (it \"looks old\", I guess?), and many apps don't provide proper manpages (pretty sure most developers don't know how to even create manpages, or package their app for their distro). reply SoftTalker 4 hours agorootparentprevI disagree that GUIs show what is possible. I am often baffled by my iPhone as to how to get it to do something. Even Apple's own apps are wildly inconsistent. Once you learn \"man\" and \"man -k\" the cli environment is emminently explorable, and it's not just \"try poking at it and see what it does\" it's all laid out in written documents that you can read in advance. reply Exoristos 9 hours agorootparentprev> I remember being a kid looking at DOS and wondering “what do I even do?” The DOS we had came with a few-hundred page manual. The same for any major programs that ran on it. These must have been exhaustive, as I don't remember being stuck at any point, honestly. reply atoav 4 hours agorootparentJup. But where in the terminal does it tell you that (A) there are man pages and (B) how to look at them? The answer is: It doesn't tell you anything. So either you grew up in a time where computers with terminals were new and interesting enough for you to try, or you were a teenager that was bored enough to try, or you had somebody show/tell you. But what it does not do is explain itself. reply 082349872349872 10 hours agorootparentprev> important things a new user simply needs to be taught, or they will likely never discover basic functionality In the ancient times, we'd say \"RTFM\" to people who attempted to \"discover\" functionality instead of Ring the Fing M. reply dullcrisp 9 hours agorootparentWell maybe that was the problem. reply 082349872349872 2 hours agorootparentImagine if people had to discover algebra instead of learning it. We'd probably still be subject to the whims of kings and priests. (to what extent have we made progress in software by standing on each others' shoulders instead of each others' toes, and to what extent have we been fortunate that the EEs have been standing on each others' shoulders this short century?) Note that I'm not anti-discoverability in general — it's just the ticket for GUIs. I just happen to believe that attempting to make CLIs discoverable would nerf their greatest power: that single-character changes can have drastic effects on behaviour. We have high display bandwidths, even in our pockets, so why not have GUIs for infrequently used software and CLIs for power used software? reply roenxi 20 hours agoparentprev(1) is an important point, but I think it doesn't go far enough. The terminal offers no help at all to a casual user (the funniest case of this is watching a new user trying to quit vim [0]). There are a specific set of skills required to learn how to use the terminal - a combination of knowing when and how to read man pages, when to look up Stack Overflow, when to look up YouTube videos, and where to hang out to learn about more esoteric commands exist like `parallel`. Without those skills - and there is no recommended path on how to get them - the terminal is unusable. It isn't a case of people thinking it is hard, it is actually logically impossible to learn how to learn terminal commands without getting lucky at the start. Software has two phases - a learning phase and a using phase. A lot of great software ideas died quietly because there wasn't a sanctioned route to scale the learning curve. [0] Or this classic: https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs249/Resources/ed_is_the_standard... reply palata 9 hours agorootparent> The terminal offers no help at all to a casual user (the funniest case of this is watching a new user trying to quit vim [0]). I think that's because casual users did not learn how to look at a terminal. If you start `vim`, it shows you a few lines that say \"type :help for help\". The help starts with \"how to move around\" and \"how to quit\". But people ignore that. One could say \"people don't ignore it, it's just not intuitive\". But I have seen many casual users struggle with GUIs, too. The difference, IMO, is just that they learned the basics of GUIs, and never had to learn the basics of CLI. I don't really believe in something fundamentally harder with CLIs. reply Phiwise_ 16 hours agorootparentprevTo add on to (1), expeeienced hackers trying to educate new users really should first immerse themselves into descriptions of the \"bad old days\" of utility programming to help get back into the mindset of the novice they're trying to relate to. Your ed link is good, and I like the \"Power Tools for Power Fools\"/\"Teeminal Insanity\" chapter of The Unix-Haters Handbook for something slightly more modern: https://simson.net/ref/ugh.pdf#page=185 Just like no one really uses ed anymore, the C shell is pretty much dead and many userspace programs have had their edges rounded over the years, but the experience of trying to imagine working around their foibles gives the perspective necessary to helpfully advise someone trying to learn an acceptable shell today (except that they'll have more use for their effort at some point) because they're pretty much the same kind of transition. Compare these highlights to that ed page: >Pipes are not the be-all and end-all of program communication. Our favor-ite Unix-loving book had this to say about the Macintosh, which doesn’t have pipes: \"The Macintosh model, on the other hand, is the exact opposite. The system doesn’t deal with character streams. Data files are extremely high level, usually assuming that they are specific to an application. When was the last time you piped the output of one program to another on a Mac? (Good luck even finding the pipe symbol.) Pro-grams are monolithic, the better to completely understand what you are doing. You don’t take MacFoo and MacBar and hook them together.\" Yeah, those poor Mac users. They’ve got it so rough. Because they can’t pipe streams of bytes around how are they ever going to paste artwork from their drawing program into their latest memo and have text flow around it? How are they going to transfer a spreadsheet into their memo? And how could such users expect changes to be tracked automatically? They cer-tainly shouldn’t expect to be able to electronically mail this patched-together memo across the country and have it seamlessly read and edited at the other end, and then returned to them unscathed. We can’t imagine how they’ve been transparently using all these programs together for the last 10 years and having them all work, all without pipes. >This morning I read an article in the Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, “Expertise in a Computer Operating System,” by Stephanie M. Doane and two others. Guess which operating system she studied? Doane studied the knowledge and performance of Unix novices, intermediates, and expert users. Here are few quotes: “Only experts could successfully produce composite commands that required use of the distinctive features of Unix (e.g. pipes and other redirection symbols).” In other words, every feature that is new in Unix (as opposed to being copied, albeit in a defective or degenerate form from another operat-ing system) is so arcane that it can be used only after years of arcane study and practice. “This finding is somewhat surprising, inasmuch as these are fundamental design features of Unix, and these features are taught in elementary classes.” In both cases, we have someone moving from a relatively monolithic, high-level, restricted, commercialized system that focuses on uniformity, error-bar tolerance, and DWIM/intuitiveness of the intended or common use-case over giving every capability equal billing to one that focuses on completeness, atomicity, and implementation simplicity/efficiency. Learning this transition has two phases because the best way to keep going with the learner's current knowledge has two phases: Before making the transition they probably learned the old system through self-tutoring and exploration; the stakes were low enough and the environment painstakingly organized to be similar enough that a little curiosity and a little induction from past experience explained basically every level of the user-visible stack, and the slab of composed foundation functions that made the first-blush system run were either walled off fully or guarded to wave away novices. Pre grokking the new software, though, the user lacks the idioms that make it possible to write a more complete computing system out of less code, and so don't know when to apply what even if they've read up on most of the pieces they need already. It's like a transition from an upper-class aerospace engineer or hedge fund manager exploring Animal Kingdom Park to making a trek through the indian jungle. Even if you're carrying a reference tome on the region there are intangibles you're just missing, so you're far more likely to get lost and confused or hurt yourself if you don't walk right in the footsteps of someone expeeienced for a good long while. It's similar with the terminal: When you're successful, things are clearer and simpler than a jumbled heavyweight gui, but when you make the \"mistakes\" that come along with not almost entirely knowing what you're doing it can be unhelpful, mystifying, and rarely dangerous, because the experienced users happen to be the most-engaged target market. Not everyone has Apple money, after all. The phase change back to effective exploration, and actual use over learning through apeing, only comes after they've got both most of the terrain and most of the problem-solving strategies in their head all at once to hit a self-sustaining critical mass. Something akin to the Khan(academy) flipped method is what I think is most important to remember when teaching: most experienced users think in terms of learning new skills through integrating new components, while beginners tend to know less about the implications of recombining the utilities they're already aware of in the less common and simple ways than show up as line snippets in crash courses. New users can read a man page as well as you can recite it by heart, but what they really need tutoring in is how to know they're reading the right part of the right page and what your experience says to do with it. Just getting that all off my chest as someone who didn't have anyone to teach me and used to be spectacularly bad at teaching others, so someone might learn from my mistakes. reply Solvency 8 hours agorootparentYour ChatGPT account needs to be reboot. reply yjftsjthsd-h 18 hours agoparentprev> 2.

I can't remember the name, but there was even a terminal emulator that tried to present commands as dialogs. * There is no enforced standard for commands other than using a file name to invoke them. * Different languages and frameworks have different and multiple ways of parsing command lines. For example Gooey (a python gui tool) works with scripts written with the argparse library but dodes not work with optparse. * The terminal is not the shell. That means that to present a gui, you'll have to launch something that runs outside of the terminal to present the gui. * It's common for developers to write command line tools with out understanding the shell and os's input and output system beyond reading and writing files. I routinely have to teach jr developers about stdio, stderr, pipes etc... That said, there's great potential to take advantage of shell autocomplete files to make better guis for commands: https://blog.deepjyoti30.dev/tab-autocomplet-cli-apps . Someone probably already has done this... reply JeffSnazz 18 hours agorootparentThe idea is that you'd build it into whatever command-line parsing tool you use. Presumably this would be runtime-specific.

I have been thinking a lot about providing a shell-like experience as a quick way to make advanced functionality available in an app, without having to build fully fledged GUIs for them, but I’m not sure whether that would work. Clearly, discoverability and text input are the key issues, but I don’t know if alleviating those is sufficient to make the interface actually interesting and useful. reply atoav 4 hours agorootparentI think using text to interface with computers is a genius idea and if it didn't exist someone would have ro invent it. But the way text interfaces on computers look nowadays are mostly shaped the way they are for historical reasons. It doesn't need much. First the text should be editable like other text on the OS, the cursor needs to be reactive ro mouse input. Second expected shortcuts should work, that means things like Ctrl+A to select all, Home to go to start of line, Ctrl+C for copy, Escape to cancel things, etc. I know there are reasons to everything and I am used to terminal shortcuts as well, but there is literally no reasons why we can't ensure they are the same there as everywhere else. Next thing would be the startup experience. If you start a terminal the first time, it should offer you some introduction. Sure, a seasoned user like me would be annoyed by that, but if you make it so it can be ignored by the likes of us or people that set the right environment variable, cool. Lastly, maybe it also a bit about the colors and fonts. I like bright on dark, but I can see how people who see this for the first time get flashbackanof every hacker scene they ever saw in any movie. And the subtext there always was: \"You only understand this if you sacrifice all your social life\". Imagine how a terminal would look like if it was made for kids and how that would make people judge their own ability to get this instead. I think a lot of the reason why terminals still look the way the do (apart from the fact it just works), is gatekeeping. Some nerds like that this is arcane, secret knowledge that looks as if it is hard to aquire. They don't like others to understand unless those others are also nerds. reply 082349872349872 1 hour agorootparentIf you can make a friendly terminal, go for it!

You teach so your experience is probably very different from us SWE/SREs who only work with other technical staff for the most part. 2. You can add cursor and mouse control to your .nanorc. I'm not sure if bash, etc have that. With that said, I have cursor enabled in my .nanorc along with a bunch of other stuff. The cursor thing.. I'm kind of confused on how you use it, but I rarely use it. It's (to me) weird. I think I just havent used it enough to really know its capabilites. I think as a teacher it'd be super helpful to you to have a base set of dotfiles that your students just git clone when they start the class. Or even better, have them write their own and just provide them the settings you want them to enable. When I bring new SREs on board, without the base dotfiles for them to grab on day 1 it takes practically a week for someone to get setup and ready to work. Have each of them commit their dotfiles to their own repos, probably forked from yours. That will get them familiar with github. Then try to get them to actually build out a github portfolio. I spent 6 months interviewing for a few positions last year and I was really surprised how few people had githubs with anything on them. It's not my main criteria but it's nice when someone has put effort into their gh/gitlab/etc profile and projects. Also please teach them about filesystems. Most of the younger people (20s) I interviewed knew very little linux/containerization/filesystems.. I think the filesystem thing is from them growing up with MacOS and iPhones. They don't need to dig into anything beyond their \"folders\" if even that. 3. Absolutely one of my CLI annoyances here. I wrote another comment explaining why it frustrates me. Related to your last sentence- I'd say 99% of the CLI/TUI apps I write are things that give you an easy front end (TUI and simple commands/flags) to perform backend systems tasks. So I have a ton of them as an SRE. The main reason I like to put things in a TUI and not just CLI flags is that ANYONE can hop in and use it because the options are all displayed to you front and center. You just use arrows or numbers to navigate. I do TUI *AND* command line flags because some people want to do it quick and fast, or make aliases, etc for what they're doing. THen there's the TUI which opens if you don't run a flag, the TUI is so, so helpful to people new to the apps. This lets me democratize the various apps I've created and let anyone who isn't me use them. It's great. Here's one example of my TUI+CLI apps. This is super old it's much prettier now. https://i.imgur.com/dxXwRzD.gifv reply bee_rider 14 hours agorootparentI’ve worked with helping beginner students set up their environments a bit. I’m skeptical of the idea of providing too much in the way of custom dotfiles or anything like that. Students will come with their own systems. Mac, or Windows, usually. So a professor or grad student who naturally uses Linux and isn’t really a software deployment expert might have trouble getting a rock-solid portable collection of scripts. It might seem like an odd difficulty for smart and technical people to have, but administrating other people’s systems is a totally different skill from research after all! More importantly, in a class of a couple hundred, somebody will find a way to get off the happy path. No matter how well you design it. Hopefully they’ll come to a teaching assistant or something, but there’s a good chance they’ll go to YouTube or something instead. In that case, it is best if their installation is as standard as possible. Also the filesystem problem is such a thing and you have dredged up some feelings, hahaha.

Lightweight, embed commands in scripts, command history, etc. However, the tension between CLI power vs GUI ease-of-use really hit me when I'm the user of personal utilities I wrote. Coding a console utility that uses command line arguments is always faster and easier than a GUI app. So, being lazy, 99% of my utilities are CLI. But I also annoy myself as a user when I can't remember what the syntax options are for the CLI that I coded so I end up having to open the source code and re-examine the argc and argv sections to see what the spelling or ordering is. If this happens often enough, I give in and expend the extra effort rewrite the utility as a GUI app with radio buttons, checkboxes, etc. That said, I still like CLI tools. E.g. I wish banks and credit cards had a pseudo SSH terminal that I could run text commands to list transactions. I really don't want to click around the bank's website or use a smartphone app. reply sanitycheck 19 hours agoparentIt's funny, I started in the C64 era and have probably used a CLI for something roughly every day since then. But for me, using a CLI is still just a necessary evil - give me a GUI (or TUI) instead and I'll always take it. The reason is that my memory sucks, and has always sucked. If I'm not typing a command every day, I'll forget it very quickly. If I am typing a command every day it's probably an alias or a script I've written to save myself some time so the \"real\" command is already forgotten. So in reality if it's not cd, ls, less, sudo or grep the chances are that I've forgotten it. Where the CLI really shines is automation. Software I can control with a CLI in a script is amazing. So what I really want is for everything to have both a GUI and a CLI.

I've found a positive feedback loop where the more I know how to do things without looking anything up, the more I use the CLI, the easier I remember things, the more things I discover, etc. I read once that when learning a new language, you should aim for content where you know 80%/90% already. It seems to be true for learning the CLI, and especially for integrating that learning into my day to day job. - sd (https://github.com/ianthehenry/sd) for lowering the cost of creating a \"documented alias\".

Python's argparse is pretty good in this respect. Even if you don't supply help text and good metavar names, it'll at least give you --help output showing which options are supported, and adding help text and helpful metavar names is not much additional effort. argparse has inspired a number of knockoffs in other languages, and the ones I've used are pretty good at --help output too.

Anything with `-` or `--` is an optional. Just like all the basic unix/linux tools. You don't have to `ls --thing` to list a folder, just `ls`. Or `cat --magic --args the_file` and so on. If I require an 'option', it becomes a command or an argument for the command, i.e. `tool --list-files` becomes `tool ls`. Copy for example: `cp src dest` works, `cp` on its own, doesn't. I even tend to write extensible CLI tools, `tool-ls` will drop into the same folder as `tool` and running `tool` will detect `tool-ls` and present it in the list of commands. Just like git. reply strunz 15 hours agoparentThis only works with CLI that take a few arguments.

Gigantic truck size vanilla icecream with garlic dip and tuna flavour. That'll be $79.99. You have options but sometimes you have to pick a few. If you argue for positional arguments, try ordering ice cream: large chocolate strawberry. Does that mean chocolate flavour or dip? reply swozey 20 hours agoparentprevOne of my huge frustrations is the inconsistency between various apps or even in the same app. Sometimes it's \"executable -help\" or \"executable --help\", sometimes it's executable -h, or --h. I also find it really annoying when running a bad/wrong/typoed command doesn't give you a \"You wrote fkuc but did you mean ....\" those are super helpful. IMO, if you use --help, you also should be using -help, and -h --h, unless you're using C and c to seperate two different commands. Which I don't like AT ALL. Don't make --help show help but --HELP show something different. Use a different word/letter. I write TUI apps ALL the time and it's not hard to do ANY of this. It's super easy in go and ruby. There are two big things I do - I add CLI flags that you can run directly - \"executable --help\" which does the same thing as opening the TUI app with a nice little TUI menu where anyone can use it and select their options and put a couple of inputs in to get what they want done. So, if you DON'T want the potentially slighty slower of uising the TUI vs a CLI command with a few flags you can just run the commands directly. Hell, if someone puts the wrong CLI --flag in instead of letting it just bomb with a *nix error have it echo the actual command flags. Don't make me have to dig around for commands. And don't send me to your manpage with --help. God I hate that. Manpages sometimes are absolutely awful. I want ONE command flag that you made some esoteric word for, I want a nice concise list of the flags. I do NOT want a 5 page manpage written so dry and cumbersome that it's such a pain to read that we have other cheatsheet apps.. I ONLY want the manpage if I ask for the manpage. reply TheCleric 20 hours agorootparent> IMO, if you use --help, you also should be using -help, and -h --h I tend to go by the paradigm of single dash for single character options, and double dash for full words (and common things like —-help should have aliases like -h). reply swozey 19 hours agorootparentThat's interesting. Did you come up with that yourself or is that a common standard? I've always wondered why the style of command flags wasn't \"more\" standardized after 32 years of Linux being around (not that thats the first time flags were introduced, just an easy stop so I don't have to dig into that since it's not super relevant). So, maybe it is somewhat/completely standardized and I'm just not aware of where that information is? I think your style would still frustrate me. I'd first type \"executable -help\" thinking that was probably the - and -- option, and get a command not found error. I wouldn't think that think we're using - and -- differently. reply darnir 19 hours agorootparentThat used to be a fairly common standard. You'll notice nearly all the old GNU / BSD tooling use this paradigm. It is even codified in GNU's coding principles. In fact, when you do that, you can even merge all the single character flags together. For example, I can type, `ls -lah` instead of `ls -l -a -h`. Pretty handy. My pet peeve is commands not supporting -h for help and making me write --help. This is especially worse when the command already supports single character arguments. reply tom_ 19 hours agorootparentprevThe --long-option thing is a GNU thing: https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-... reply swozey 18 hours agorootparentI've never even thought about this.

Thanks this is super helpful I never knew this was a GNU thing. reply yjftsjthsd-h 18 hours agorootparentNote that there's an opposite convention that I think originated with the BSDs, where -ofoo is equivalent to -o -f -o -o reply cb321 17 hours agorootparentThat only holds when 'o' and 'f' are both boolean \"flags\" taking no arguments. If 'f' is more like --file=x then it takes an argument. More specifically, getopt(3) in POSIX lets programmers very this by giving a format string. \"o:f\" would make your example parse as \"-o\" \"foo\" while \"of:\" would make it parse as \"-o\" \"-f\" \"oo\" and an \"of\" format would make it parse as you describe, \"-o\" \"-f\" \"-o\" \"-o\". ( darnir mentioned parts of this above: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38968612 using the term \"single character flags\" to indicate no argument. ) Also, while --long-option is GNU, gcc which is perhaps the aboriginal GNU command-line utility uses single dash as in, e.g. `gcc -pipe`, though it also accepts `gcc --help`.

We will always need CLIs for things that are to cumbersome or rare to add into GUIs; but they have to become easier to use, and provide immediate value.

It's just short for !-1 !123 runs the 123th command in your history !gi runs the most recent command in your history that begins with letters g and i !* is the args to the most recent command !$ is the last argument to the most recent command !:0 is argv[0] of the most recent command (i.e. the program name) These can be combined: !g:$ is the last argument to the most recent command that began with g They are also really handy in backquotes since you can do things like grep foo `!findegrep .cc` because your find command was almost right Sometimes you can get away with a ^ substitution: git add foo.cc bar.cc oops ^add^reset There are a lot of such commands that let you use the basename of the argument etc. After a short while they are so automatic they are easier to type than the actual command name (\"I just want to do that thing again but with this filename\"). These have actually become so deeply wired that I had to think to write them down because I use them “without thinking”. So this is handy with normal commands: git-add foo.cc!g:0 bar.h git-add foo.cc bar.ccgit-reset !g:* But with subcommands, you end up matching against all the git operations; !* matches all the arguments to the `git` command including the subcommand so you can't conveniently say \"yes, that last git command but I want to change the subcommand\" reply swozey 19 hours agorootparentprevThey're saying that they don't want sub commands (executable --action actionsoption). They prefer (executable --actions-option) which is a command flag as opposed to chaining commands off one another. Example: https://i.imgur.com/dxXwRzD.gifv reply gumby 4 hours agorootparentI don’t care if you have `git add` as long as you also have git-add, which is more easily scriptable and simply easier to use. The `git add’ approach always reminds me of using a mouse and a menu (ugh): select the git option, drag down until you get to the “add” subotion and then…. Supposedly that’s more “discoverable” and maybe it is, but you don’t need discoverability for the things you use every day! reply olejorgenb 16 hours agoparentprevI've never understood how people manage to use ! in a useful way. Primarily I think because if you get anything wrong, repeating the command does something completely different. But maybe I'm not fully familiar with all the functionality because I don't understand why sub commands would make a difference? reply gumby 7 hours agorootparentI answered a similar question above; here’s the link to my comment, with examples: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38975420 reply olejorgenb 15 hours agorootparentprevI guess it's because !TEXT does a prefix search for TEXT in the history and TEXT can't contain spaces reply matheusmoreira 18 hours agoparentprevI think it's very user friendly. As a user I can easily access functionality when the application's modules are organized as a little taxonomy of commands. Hierarchy is good. > Among other things it makes the shell’s ! commands harder to use. How so? reply gumby 10 hours agorootparentI answered a similar question above; here’s the link to my comment, with examples: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38975420 reply swozey 18 hours agorootparentprevI write a lot of tui/cli apps and I've never even considered doing sub commands. I always do --my-action-1 and --my-action-2. I can't think of any huge positives from using subcommands. I know for a fact that that will take longer to write and add some complexity to --args-* and I also feel like getting a quick --help option would be a lot more cumbersome. Maybe a good way there is to list commands then tabbed/dashed indented under the root command list its subcommands. reply gbalduzzi 16 hours agorootparentI like that sub-commands usually have a different --help output git --help git add --help The former returns general information about the whole git executable, while the latter returns specific details about the add command. It also gives an immediate intuition of entering a whole different flow that can not be composed with other flows, something that you don't have with --args There is a hierarchy between commands and options that is not expressed when both use the -- syntax reply williamcotton 20 hours agoprev??

It makes sense for complex tools that incorporate many different actions. Every action is essentially its own CLI tool. That approach isn't suited well to the traditional Unix mindset where a single tool is supposed to do one thing and do it well – \"ls\" is meant to list files and \"tr\" is meant to replace characters, and you should be able to pipe them together. reply cb321 18 hours agorootparentNot to challenge anything you said, but rather expand upon it.. git just followed a grand tradition of software version control systems in general (sccs/cvs/svn/..): https://lobste.rs/s/dnazns/contextual_clis#c_b7rl9k reply jvanderbot 19 hours agoprevMinor point, but on a recent project I stepped around Clap, looking for something that was small, focused, and fewer silly edge cases.
