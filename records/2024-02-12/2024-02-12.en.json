    "originBody": "Balancing cube This cube manages to balance itself on a corner, and can simultaneously rotate around its axis in a controlled manner. It does so using clever controls and a set of three reaction wheels. The original idea for this device comes from researchers at ETH Zürich, who demonstrate their “Cubli” in this video. Its design has been improved in some ways in later years. Notably, Bobrow et al (University of São Paulo) introduce an improved controls concept, reducing the number of required IMUs (inertial measurement units) to just one instead of six. I decided to pursue the challenge of building one myself. Even though the idea isn’t new, previous works are largely closed-source. I plan to change that. This means that I had to reverse-engineer and draw everything from scratch. The result of my work, which is completely open source (GitHub), is shown in the video below. You might think: ANOTHER USELESS MACHINE?! When I published my M&Ms sorting machine, I received lots of similar remarks. Indeed, it has no practical value, but similar applications such as sorting of fruits, vegetables and nuts based on colour do. For this cube, the situation is similar: while this is mostly a great learning experience and research project, reaction wheels are often used in satellites (such as the James Webb telescope) for attitude control purposes. A spacebound reaction wheel. Source: Wikipedia. Mechanical design The mechanical design of this cube is mostly the same as that of the original Cubli, but it has some subtle differences. The main structure consists of eight “cornerstones” and six face plates. Three of these face plates have additional features to support a motor and reaction wheel assembly. All parts were drawn in (con)Fusion 360. My student days are over, so I had to say farewell to Siemens NX. The latter isn’t used much (if at all?) in the DIY community anyway, so I can share my designs with others more easily now. Most structural parts are made of stainless steel for its excellent strength. The faceplates are made of aluminium to save weight. These don’t need to be made of steel since the assembled structure will be more than stiff enough when made of aluminium anyway. All metal parts in this project have been manufactured by PCBWay. I’ve used their PCB prototyping service before and was interested in their CNC capabilities. Part of the cost for these parts was sponsored by PCBWay. The ordering process was straightforward and I like that a quote was automatically calculated directly after uploading the part and specifying the material type. I’m satisfied with the parts and their quality: a small production issue was quickly resolved and all parts fit together without issue. Pictures below: judge for yourself. I had fun with the design of the motor and flywheel assembly. I was looking for a robust design – after all, the wheels can reach speeds up to 6000 rounds per minute – while also keeping it lightweight. Even though I’m a mechanical engineer by education, construction principles aren’t my main strength, but after all that’s the reason for projects like these: to learn! I finally came up with the following. The motor is connected to a stainless steel bridge using three countersunk screws. The bridge eventually connects to one of the aluminium faceplates. A small hub is mounted onto the shaft of the motor and secured using three set screws. This hub is critical: if the center hole is not perpendicular with respect to the flat triangular face, the wheel will not be aligned with the motor shaft, causing vibrations and wear. A reaction wheel is mounted onto the hub using three countersunk screws. This step requires a bit of trial and error to correct for imperfections in the hub and wheel, which may cause the misalignments I mentioned earlier. I resolve these by placing tiny pieces of paper between the horizontal contact surface of the hub and wheel and this provides satisfactory results. After all, these parts aren’t taken apart very often. A small radial ball bearing is inserted into one of the faceplates and secured using cyanoacrylate (“super”) glue. This ball bearing will support one end of the motor shaft. The other end of the shaft is also supported by a bearing within the motor itself. Finally, the motor shaft is inserted into the bearing and the bridge is connected to the faceplate using four bolts. This process is repeated two more times. This result in half a cube. The remaining faceplates don’t require any special assembly steps and can be directly assembled. Notice how one of the motors is oriented differently with respect to the bridge to which it attaches? That is done on purpose: it simplifies the cabling work later on. The result is a strong yet relatively lightweight structure. The aluminium faceplates are relatively weak by themselves, but won’t budge when assembled together. Electromechanical design For the motor and motor controllers, other balancing cubes use Maxon motors from the “EC flat” series. While it’s possible to find cheaper alternatives, the motors and their controllers are critical parts and I don’t want to skimp on them. The cube will balance by applying torques to the motors. Many DC motors do not even come with datasheets that specify the torque constant (which defines the relationship between torque and current), and many brushless motor controllers such as ESCs only offer speed control, but not current control. Both are essential in making this project a reality, so the choice for components of high quality is obvious here. I selected a 60 W motor and a compatible 4-quadrant motor controller which can deliver currents up to 6 A. At 24 V, this corresponds to almost 150 W. While this is well beyond the nominal power rating of the motor, it is no problem to briefly overload the motor. Moreover, the controller has a built-in I2t algorithm which limits current to the motor if the winding temperature is estimated to become too high. It is unlikely that the cube hits these limits in normal operation anyway, because currents are generally very low while balancing. The software that comes with the Escon motor controllers is pretty great. There are motor commissioning and tuning tools and a nice dashboard showing the status of the motor and its inputs/outputs during operation (shown in the screenshot above). For the battery, I chose a 6S1P lithium-polymer battery. The motors are rated for 24 V so a six-cell LiPo battery (nominal voltage 22.2 V) is a good fit here. The battery has a capacity of 1300 mAh (29 Wh) which is enough to run the cube for at least an hour, normally. The motherboard is a custom design and integrates the three motor controllers, IMU (hidden), ESP32-S3 development board, and some supporting components such as protection circuits and voltage regulators. The board also anticipates adding mechanical brakes to the cube, by providing outputs for RC servo motors. Mechanical brakes will enable the cube to jump up to the balancing position by itself. I haven’t finished the development of the brake design yet. Assembling the circuit board was fun. I started by applying solder paste and placing the surface-mount parts. After reflowing it in a small toaster oven (more details about how this works here), I soldered all the through hole parts by hand. Later, during integration and testing of the various components, I found that I had made a few small routing errors which I quickly corrected using bodge wires. It turns out that only one digital input on the motor controller supports PWM and I routed the PWM signal to another (unsupported) input. I also designed a board to mount the battery onto. It’s much simpler: it has two XT60 connectors and two switches (wired in parallel because of currents up to 18 A) to turn the cube on and off. Controller design and tuning I didn’t actually design the controller the cube myself, but ported the work by Fabio Bobrow from Arm Mbed to Arduino. I’m also using an ESP32 instead of an STM32 Nucleo. Nevertheless, rewriting the code was a good chunk of work. Also, since I’m using a different IMU (the ICM20948 by TDK Invensense), I had to rewrite the corresponding “driver”. I still spent quite some time studying the design of this controller and will spend a few words to highlight some nice things about it. The design of the main attitude controller is most interesting. It is perhaps best explained as a negotation between two contradictory objectives. The first objective is to keep the cube in its desired orientation, that is, at its unstable equilibrium position. A second goal, however, is to keep the wheel velocities to a minimum. Not considering this second objective could lead to wheels speeds getting out of control, saturing the motors, and thereby effectively rendering it unable to exert torques on the cube. The two objectives are in conflict: if the ‘desire’ to keep wheel velocities close to zero is too great, the cube simply falls over. Like mentioned before, if it is too weak, the wheels might literally spin out of control. The trick therefore is to find gains that result in good balancing performance and disturbance rejection while keeping wheel velocities somewhat low. There is another elegant mechanism in the controller to deal with constant errors. What are constant errors? For example, there might be a small difference between the configured equilibrium position and the actual equilibrium due to imperfections in the weight distributions of the cube. In a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller, the integral part deals with these kinds of errors. This controller uses the position (in degrees) of the wheel as the integral! In my opinion, this is actually a very intuitive way of visualizing an integral controller. When I modify the weight distribution of the cube (in the video: by placing a tomato on it), you can see the reaction wheels increase and then decrease in speed: they are moving to a new position to compensate for the increased error! Commissioning and tuning the controller was, by far, the largest piece of code-related work. Like any experienced controls engineer, I spent a few days flipping the signs of various signals before I got them right. Then, I had to find the right gains for the controller. The tuning methodology as described in Bobrow’s dissertation didn’t work for me, so I resorted to tuning the gains by hand. Note that my cube uses different wheels compared to Bobrow’s cube, so reusing the gains was not possible. Using an iterative procedure, I finally obtained the gains that result in the stabilizing performance as shown in the video (which is very good, in my humble opinion). That’s it! A balancing cube. It’s the only fully open-source cube in the world which achieves a balancing performance similar to that of Cubli, as far as I know. I hope that others will now also be inspired to build this cool device. Here are some links to similar cubes which are at least somewhat documented (more than just a video or photo): Cubli (ETH Zürich). Cubli (University of São Paulo). ReM-RC’s balancing cube. “AAU3” self balancing cube by Lukas Jensen. Next steps: jumping up I plan to add mechanical brakes to the reaction wheels. These will enable the wheels to be braked rapidly, resulting in much larger torques than the motors can deliver. This enables jump-up manoeuvers which in turn enable the cube to get to its equilibrium position on its own. This feature is currently unique to the original Cubli, as far as I know. I don’t particularly like the braking mechanism that Cubli uses for various reasons, so I’m going to use a different approach. I’ll share results in a future post! Thanks for reading.

We couldn't figure why and the clock was ticking. We made a script to run it twice, fail then success, and the demo was good. Then we debugged the issue, which was something trivial (I can't remember the details) but proper debugging and fixing under time pressure is never trivial. So, an interviewer might appreciate that balancing of signs if told that it is the fastest way make it work (and pass your demo,) only to fix it later. Once proven that the hacked code gives the right solution maybe you could have offered to send them the correct code on the next day or keep working on it if they wished so. reply Elte 23 minutes agorootparentLong ago in high school, I entered a LEGO robot competition with some friends. Tests were line following, collision detection, etc. One of the tests involved the bot being sent on a collision course with a wall. It had to detect running into it and turn around. This was one of the easiest ones to complete, but shortly before the test started we realized that our pressure sensor was malfunctioning and didn't send any more signals. There was no more time to swap it out, I don't even think we had a spare to be honest. Not wanting to give up points on an easy test, we gauged the distance the bot had to cover in the test, and quickly uploaded some new software. At the start of the test, our bot moved forward for 4 seconds, stopped, then turned around. Full points on that one! Some times things just need to work and we can worry about them working _correctly_ later... reply AceJohnny2 10 hours agorootparentprevLove to hear it. Interviewing sucks from all perspectives, so as an interviewer I try to give leeway for the stress and time pressure the interviewee is under. But the key thing is they must express their reasoning for their approach, and \"I don't have time to dig into this\" will get you a long way, at least under me. (Obviously there are nuances, but there is not enough space in this comment to elaborate) reply hackernewds 9 hours agorootparentwhich makes interviewing all the more annoying because then your success applies to which interviewer you get reply Mtinie 4 hours agorootparentSuch is every aspect of life, fortunately or unfortunately. reply lloeki 3 hours agorootparentprev> Instead of actually trying to understand the source of the error, I just sped-run tweaking different values +/- 1 until I got the expected result. That's perfectly valid, when one knows a specific step or result must be positive or negative. Not that much different from dimensional analysis, which speedruns you to get/fix to proper formula (at the cost of skimming on dimensionless constants). Similarly, interviewer was not impressed when they cut me short and started walking me through some step and I pointed to them that their result was obviously wrong as it was dimensionally inconsistent and if they didn't cut me out the formula must have been something like baz*foo/bar^2 or something and now we just have to figure out the constants. reply sen 7 hours agorootparentprevWrap up that speed-run up in an automation and refer to it as “fuzzing” and you can sell it for millions these days. reply actionfromafar 10 hours agorootparentprevWell, the three hardest things in computer science are after all naming things and off-by-one errors. reply biomcgary 9 hours agorootparentI thought the two hardest things in CS was naming things, off-by-by one errors, and cache invalidation, but I must be remembering that incorrectly. reply spenczar5 6 hours agorootparentsynchronization, too reply klabb3 9 hours agorootparentprevsynchronization.

I learned why recently from the book Open Circuits: The Inner Beauty of Electronic Components. There is a mechanical component that is more stiff before being used, which can lead one to think that they simply had the USB connector the wrong way around. I highly highly recommend the book by the way, to anyone on HN. Goes all the way from mechanical components to resistors, nixie tubes, CMOS sensors, processors etc. Excellent photography that reveals the internals, along with operation explanations and history for each component. reply herbcso 13 hours agorootparentThat looks amazing!

So unless you're using a cheap unlicensed cable, look for the symbol facing up and you'll always be correct reply quectophoton 3 hours agorootparentAfter all this time I'm not going to trust a decoration. When I'm connecting an USB cable horizontally I always think \"hol up\". So I always remember to plug it with the hole up. When I'm connecting it vertically I think \"hold right\". So I know that if I want to hold it right, I have to put the hole right. Has worked for me so far. EDIT: Though \"left\" and \"right\" are more vague compared to \"up\" and \"down\", so connecting vertically assumes a specific \"mental point of view\". I'm just using one that's intuitive for me, but it might not work for everyone. reply j5155 12 hours agorootparentprev…unless, of course, the port is upside down/sideways ;) reply lozf 7 hours agorootparentprevOr 4 when it turns out you're trying the HDMI port instead. reply jamiek88 2 hours agorootparentOr the fricken e-Sata port back in the day. reply signalToNose 3 hours agorootparentprevThe holes in the contact on the cable should be up when plugging into the laptop reply mewpmewp2 15 hours agorootparentprevJust 3?

I eventually concluded that the real problem was with the implementation--I was working with code that was written by others and went a little crazy with coordinate transforms. Oops--worked as expected on one non-HP plotter. Drew the image inverted on a HP plotter. The HP implementation appeared to break if you flipped the world too many times. That was a *long* time ago, my memory is fuzzy by now. (And in later days I saw a firmware update for a laser printer cause it to spew gibberish when fed embedded HP/GL2 code. This was in the era where there were still DOS programs running under Windows and somebody didn't check that it still worked right.) reply corethree 15 hours agoparentprevIs there a way to model this theoretically?

I mean I realize you have to test the thing for \"bugs\" just wondering if a theory to perfectly model it is even possible. reply dutchkiwifruit 13 hours agorootparentSome things certainly can be modelled, but for others it is easier to simply try. For example, will applying a positive current to the motor make it spin in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction? It really depends on the behaviour and configuration of the motor controller, and in this case it was easier for me to just try. The trick is to do these tests at a sufficiently low level, because that’s usually where these issues are, in my experience. reply robocat 10 hours agorootparent> sufficiently low level Final try at ground level: https://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/space-disasters/rocket-f... reply dgoldstein0 14 hours agorootparentprevI think it's possible. But you'd have to be really careful with your equations, then have to be really careful to know which direction is positive in each signal and make sure to make the wiring and/or math match that.

Get an Arduino or ESP board, make some leds blink and go from there. reply dylan604 14 hours agorootparentArduino + LED = Hello World for electronics. Find a project online that tickles your fancy, and then recreate that. If your thing doesn't work, you know it is something you did incorrectly as the project has been built successfully by others. During the course of that project, you will pick up on so many little things. As an example, I had a project with more buttons than pins. Just something as simple as adding a few resistors to each button allows multiple buttons to be connected to the same pin. You just have test the voltage to know which button. Sounds simple, but I learned it from someone else's build. Nobody likes walking through tutorials for tutorials sake, but it's still useful and rewarding if you can build something functional as a tutorial. reply skybrian 2 hours agorootparentJust in case someone gets the wrong idea, doing \"hello world\" first is a good habit for everyone when starting to use a new device or a new lab setup, not just beginners. It's to make sure that the environment is set up right. Is the device getting flashed? Does it start up at all? If you make a change (blink at a different rate), do you see your change? reply matheusmoreira 8 hours agorootparentprev> If your thing doesn't work One of the things I find paralyzing about electronics is the fact energy is involved. Software just outputs garbage to the terminal if I screw it up. Circuits though? Isn't it possible for components to be literally destroyed, fires started? reply aaronmdjones 5 hours agorootparentYes, you can start fires with uncontrolled currents. This is what fuses are for. Also what my sibling comment said; start small, blow up small things by making mistakes (like putting a transistor in the wrong way around and pushing several amps through its inherent body diode; we've all been there), and then you'll be confident enough to start playing with actual power electronics (if you want to). What you'll find though is that, as a result of everyone before you making the same kinds of mistakes, there exists protection circuitry for almost everything you would want to do. For example, Lithium-Ion batteries are quite unsafe if you treat them without the respect they deserve, but that's what e.g. the DW01-P IC is for, and many Li-Ion charging ICs feature NTC thermistor inputs (e.g. the LTC4053) to stop charging if the cell is outside of some safe temperature range. If you're really worried, a CO2 extinguisher and a bucket of sand go a long way. reply dylan604 7 hours agorootparentprevum, what do you think is powering the CPU/GPU combo you are writing software for uses? I guess you missed the period of \"releasing the magic smoke\" of software. But if you are designing a project that uses enough power to start fires, you've chosen poorly for your starter projects. Most electronics are using 3.3v or 5v while sipping miliamps. Sure, you can smoke a chip that wants 3.3 from feeding it 5v, but if you're designing a project near flammable substances, you're doing it wrong. reply stavros 15 hours agorootparentprevYep!

No. The reaction wheels are generating torque to change the orientation of the cube, not just shifting its center of gravity. reply s0rce 14 hours agorootparentNot really sloshing but you can pump fluid in tubes to mimic a reaction wheel https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19910016066 Can also probably provide some thermal advantages as well.

To get a sustained rotation, you'd have to keep pumping the liquid around continuously, which isn't terribly practical. Neat idea, though! I wonder if it's being used anywhere, or if reaction wheels won out. reply jdiez17 2 hours agorootparentThat’s exactly the same principle as reaction wheels.

But would other approaches be feasible for a desk toy or an art object? reply YZF 13 hours agorootparentprevJust brainstorming here but I don't think they need to be particularly precise or strong. You can likely use many materials as long as you can get enough weight (lead weights?) on the circumference. E.g. 3d print the flywheel structure (can be made thicker for rigidity if that's an issue) and glue some lead weights on. Looks like you can have slightly larger wheels too. reply dutchkiwifruit 13 hours agorootparentI spent quite some time (almost) perfectly aligning my reaction wheels. Vibrations at multiple thousands of RPMs are no joke. Then again, such speeds are typically unnecessary once the cube has settled into its equilibrium position. ReM-RC on YouTube has built a similar cube which uses 3D-printed wheels with steel bolts in the circumference [1]. My wheels are oversized when you just consider the balancing application, but I want to add jump-up functionality later, and the wheels need significant inertia (and also need to run at significant speeds) to accomplish that. [1] https://youtu.be/AJQZFHJzwt4 reply YZF 12 hours agorootparentCool. The 3d printed wheels presumably would have some dampening properties vs. the steel ones. You can also attempt to balance them at speed (moving/adding/removing the weights) to try and minimize vibrations like you do with motorcycle or car wheels (I guess there's multiple modes though). Fun project! reply newaccount74 12 hours agorootparentprevIf you can make the flywheels flat, you could cut them with a waterjet, which would be cheaper and faster than milling.

The original Cubli uses bicycle brake pads, but this has its disadvantages. I'm thinking about using a (possibly bidrectional) band brake for my cube, similar to the one used in the \"M-Blocks\" [1].

The power MOSFETs and motor windings should be able to handle it. It's all heat dissipation, and this only lasts a fraction of a second. reply jacquesm 20 minutes agorootparentThose M-Blocks are really clever, the way they move the reaction wheel around to allow it to simulate having three wheels when it has only one. But that limits the 'balancing' capability, though that's - for a cube - mostly a gimmick as far as I can tell, the locomotion capabilities are far more useful and they seem to do that just fine. There was a popular mechanics article a many years ago about a box that moved without any outward visible means of locomotion. Inside it were a slide with a little tin can and some metal balls, going one way up the slide was easy and nearly friction free, the other way it released and fell, then bumped into a stop at the bottom which was enough to cause the box to slide a bit.

For instance, you could have two fans spinning to pump air from one side of the device to the other but that would still be mechanical. You could do the same with fluid and so on.

Finding a New Software Developer Job Posted on February 11, 20246 Comments For the first time ever, I was laid off, and had to find a new software developer job. I managed to find a new one, but it took longer than I thought, and it was a lot of work. I was in contact with 30 companies, got a no from 8 companies, no reply from 6 companies, and offers from 3 companies. Here is what I learnt from the process. Laid Off At the end of October last year, I lost my job. I was completely surprised, but in retrospect, maybe I shouldn’t have been that surprised. The times were getting tougher, and many companies had been laying off people during all of 2023. If the company is not making enough money, eventually there will be layoffs. In my case, we were 17 people let go that day, including 8 developers. A few minutes after I had the Zoom call with the CEO, my access to all company resources was cut off. Apart from not being able to finish what I was working on (I had several unpushed changes), it becomes harder to say goodbye to everybody. Many of my colleagues reached out on LinkedIn, which was great. Some even set up Zoom calls so we could talk about what had happened, and say a proper goodbye, which I really appreciated. Being let go was a new experience for me. The closest I have been in the past is during the dot com bust, when the project I was working on at Ericsson was cut. They were not yet laying people off (that came a bit later), so we were offered other roles within Ericsson. But I decided to change to another company instead (they reached out directly to me, since I had worked with them at Ericsson). All the other times I have changed jobs, it’s been on my own initiative, while still being employed. I typically stayed on for three months (the standard notice period in Sweden), finishing up what I was working on, before starting at the new company. The upside of being cut off immediately is that I could immediately spend all of my time looking for a new job, while still getting paid for some time. Even though I was surprised that I was let go, I didn’t panic. My philosophy has always been that I should be prepared to find a new job at any time, since you never know what will happen. So I keep a list of companies that I would like to work at. I also stay friendly with recruiters that contact me, in case I need to get back to them. Finding Roles I started looking for another job immediately. The best source for this was LinkedIn, but I found some jobs through other means. LinkedIn Open to work. The first thing I did was to change my LinkedIn “open to work” status to “Immediately, I’m actively applying” (from “Flexible, I am casually looking”, which I normally use). I kept the visibility to recruiters only, not all LinkedIn members (which would set the green #OpenToWork photo frame). I have seen arguments for and against using #OpenToWork – it lets more people know you are looking, versus it makes you look desperate. It is hard to know which is better, but I decided to only let recruiters know. As soon as I changed this setting, I got contacted by maybe five recruiters per day for the first week or so. I suppose the LinkedIn algorithm alerts recruiters to people that have just changed their status. The quality of the roles was about the same as I normally get (albeit at a much higher rate) – some I really liked, some were OK, and some were definitely not for me. Applying to known companies. Next, I went through my list of companies I would like to work for, and looked to see if they had any open developer roles. I first looked on the company page on LinkedIn, then clicked on the Jobs tab. Many of the companies were actively recruiting. A good thing when you click on an ad is that you can see how many people have applied, and how old the ad is. Sometimes I would also go to the company home page and look at their career page. But I found it convenient to go through LinkedIn, where the format is the same, and you can see if any of your contacts work there. Sometimes you can also see who has posted the ad. Job ads. I also looked through job ads on LinkedIn. There is a search function, and I tried different searches, for example “Golang Stockholm”. It works well enough, and I would click on anything that looked interesting. LinkedIn also has a “Recommended for you”-section and “Jobs where you’d be a top applicant”-section (only if you have Premium), and I guess they use your skills and previous searches to populate these. These also showed a good selection of job ads. There are however two problems. The first is that searching for fully remote jobs is unreliable. Sometimes it turns up good ads, but sometimes it turns up roles that are e.g. remote only in the UK. It would be good to be able to search for fully remote roles in Sweden, fully remote in EU, or fully remote worldwide. The second problem is that it is not possible to get only the latest ads, for example ads that are less than a week old. So I ended up having to page through a lot of ads I had already seen. After I had found a new job, I saw a good solution for this in a tweet: use Google, set the time interval to last week, and search for e.g. “golang fully remote site:linkedin.com/jobs”. Reaching out. I also reached out to around 15 recruiters that had contacted me on LinkedIn in the past, but nothing came out of that. I knew that the roles they contacted me for would not be open, but I thought that they might be recruiting for something similar. On a few occasions I sent a direct message (InMail) to managers that were recruiting (some encouraged you to do this in their bios), but I don’t think I got a single response. Perhaps I was not a good enough fit, but it was still disappointing. Other Sources In Sweden there is a site that is matching developers with employers called Demando. You fill out a profile, listing your skills, and giving a minimum salary you will accept. Companies advertise jobs there too, and you get a message if there is a match. I already had an inactive profile there that I activated, setting a relatively high minimum salary. I got contacted by one company there, which I later got an offer from. I also found a job ad there for a company I would like to work for. I did not find that ad on LinkedIn. I applied to them, and got an offer from them too. So pretty good payoff from using that site. I also briefly looked at a site called RemoteOK, but didn’t find anything that I applied to there. My general sense was that the quality of job ads there was much lower than on LinkedIn. I also had a look at Efianancialcareers, but there are almost no fully remote roles there (and they are hard to search for). On the first of every month, there is Hacker News thread called Who’s hiring. I looked there briefly too, but I found it too hard to find something relevant there. I later found another good way of finding companies to check to see if they have any open roles: google “competitor to” or “alternative to” and a company name, to find similar companies. Applying and Tracking All recruiters I was in contact with asked for my CV, even though it is mostly the same information that is already on my LinkedIn profile. It is almost as if it is a sign that you are serious. This is fine with me, since once I had an up-to-date CV, I just attached that one. When applying to companies directly, most companies ask for a CV (even when including your LinkedIn profile), and many also asked for a cover letter. I saved all the cover letters I wrote, and when I needed to write a new one, I copied the most similar previous one I had, and modified it to fit the new application. Soon after I started to send out applications, I created an Excel sheet to keep track of my applications. I included company name, date the application was sent, recruiter or contact person, and a column for general notes. Looking at it now, it has 30 entries, but I didn’t send applications to all of them. In some cases, I added an entry after speaking to a recruiter, but then nothing came of it. 6 companies I applied to never responded at all. In some cases, the ad was more than a month old. But if the ad is no longer relevant, they should take it down instead of leaving it up and not responding. In some cases, I tried to contact the recruiter that had posted the ad, but I didn’t get a response that way either. Ideally, all companies should respond. But I don’t mind too much if I don’t get a response if I haven’t been in contact with a person at the company. However, if I have had an interview with them, I think they should at least let you know if they are not interested. At one company, I had an initial interview with a recruiter at the company. She said she would set up an interview with a manager. Then crickets. I mailed her after two weeks, asking what was happening, but didn’t get a response. Two weeks later, I sent another mail saying I was no longer interested, and got an half-hearted apology back (but no reason for why she never got back to me). So this exchange now colors my view of that company. Tools I Paid For I have never had LinkedIn Premium before, but I decided this was a good time to try it, so I paid for a month. However, it was quite disappointing. Maybe I could see more profile viewers, I am not sure, but it is definitely not showing who all of them are. And even if it had been, it has limited value in a job search. I also got a number of InMails to send each month (maybe 5?). I sent a couple, but they were not very useful for me either. Then there was the “Jobs where you’d be a top applicant”, but that too wasn’t very useful for me. So I cancelled after one month. Before cancelling, I had the option of extending it for two months for the price of one. I also paid for a GoLand license for two months (quite expensive), since I was looking for Go jobs and wanted to practice in an environment I am used to. I signed up for Github CoPilot too, because I wanted to try it. It’s quite good, but I didn’t use it much, because I wanted to make sure I did all coding by myself at interviews. I already had a subscription to ChatGPT, and that came in very handy for many take-home assignments. I signed up for Leetcode too, as I have done in the past when preparing for interviews. Mostly I like the paid version because you can get the editorial explanation for the solutions. I practiced a bit in Leetcode, so it was worth the expense. One company used an IQ test from Alva labs, so I paid for a practice course called Alva Logic Cram Course from 12minprep (there were lots of vendors, but this was relatively cheap). It was definitely worth it, I did much better on the test than I would have, had I not practiced beforehand. Reflections Times are definitely harder now compared to the previous decade. There were still many open positions to apply for, but it looked like there were many more applicants for each role than in the past. On LinkedIn, where you can see how many applicants there are, many job ads would have more than a hundred applicants. Further evidence of times being tougher is the number of companies that I never heard back from, even though I believe I would be great for the role. There is also a big focus on having experience in a given language. In the past, I have started a job developing in Python without any Python experience. The same for Golang. It didn’t take me long to get productive in each language. Partly this is because many imperative languages are very similar. Of course, knowing the libraries and ecosystems is good, but in my experience not strictly necessary. But many recruiters now told me that it was a hard requirement from the hiring companies to have at least two or three years’ experience in the given language. The Interview Process For a typical job there were four or five interviews: an initial interview with a recruiter, an interview with a hiring manager, one or two technical interviews (either live coding, or going through a take-home assignment). There could also be an interview with a product manager, and/or one with a CTO or founder. All in all, quite a time commitment. I was applying for both local and remote roles. For the remote ones, all interviews were naturally on Zoom/Meet/Teams. For local jobs in Stockholm, most companies wanted in-person interviews. This caused some problems, because it takes time to travel into the city. I could easily do many remote interviews in a day, but one in-person interview would take half a day with commuting. Mostly I managed to schedule in-person interviews on the same days, which helped. The advantage of the in-person interviews is that you get a better feel for the other person, and you can see what the office looks like. Preparations Since before, I had a Word document that I called Interview Tips. In it I wrote down things to think about before an interview, in a format that is easy to review quickly. One section I added now was Behavioral Questions. These are questions of the form “Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a coworker. How did you resolve it?”. Typically, you should answer them using the STAR framework: Situation, Task, Action, Result, Reflection. In the past, I have failed interviews because of these questions – I hadn’t prepared, and couldn’t come up with good examples on the spot in the interviews. This time I went through a good list of such questions (Rock the Behavioral Interview) from Leetcode, and thought about examples to use. Once I had good examples, I wrote the question and my answer down in the document. Before an interview, I would review what I had written down, so I would be able to come up with good examples. This worked well, I didn’t fail any interviews because of behavioral questions. In the document I also wrote down little snippets of code in both Python and Go. I tried to cover many common patterns and idioms. I did this so I could refresh my memory and quickly come up with the right syntax in a coding interview. I ran all the snippets first, to see that I hadn’t made any mistake, and included relevant output. Reviewing these snippets before an interview made me feel calmer and more prepared. I also watched a good video by Gergely Orosz, Confessions from a Big Tech Hiring Manager: Tips for Software Engineering Interviews, on technical interviews in general. Some takeaways: be curious and collaborative, and ask questions. Interviews In all my initial interviews, I was open with the fact that I had been let go from my previous job due to cut backs. I didn’t seem like disclosing this was to my disadvantage. I was never nervous talking to recruiters or managers – I always knew what to say, since I had done it many times, both in the past and for this round of interviews. It is easy for me to articulate what I am looking for in a job, and what my strengths are, because it is very clear in my mind. I was also not nervous before non-coding technical interviews, since I feel I know most technologies I have worked with quite well. However, I was nervous when I had coding interviews. I don’t exactly know why, but my brain seems to work at only 50% capacity every time I have to do live coding. So, it can be hard for me to come up with a solution, or remember some syntax, when trying to solve a problem. Luckily, all live coding interviews went well this time, but probably mostly because I had prepared a lot. Of all non-coding interviews, I failed only one (I failed several coding and take-home assignments though). For the one I failed, I was asked what timeout I would set on a database connection. I was more thinking about how long an individual user could be prepared to wait for a page to render, so blurted out too high of a number. This was enough to fail an interview that otherwise went pretty well. Coding Tests Compared to when I last interviewed a few years ago, there were more take-home assignments this time. Take-home assignments are a lot less stressful than live coding, but they also take much more time. Regardless of what the companies claim, I would say each assignment took at least six hours. There is an unfortunate asymmetry here: it is easy for a company to demand that you do a take-home assignment early on in the process, with almost no cost in effort to them. For the job-seeker, it is at least six hours of work that may or may not pay off. Even so, I noticed that each time I got going with an assignment, I loved the programming – being immersed in a task, structuring the code well, finding good names etc. It was extra obvious because I wasn’t programming as much as when I had a developer job. I did five take-home assignments, two in Java, two in Python, and one in Go. I failed one and a half. For the Go assignment, I wrote a working solution, but did not include tests. This wasn’t stated as a requirement, but I should have included some even so (when developing the solution, I used a more interactive approach, which meant running the code a lot as I developed). That assignment was also failed because I did not include caching to speed it up (to me it was not clear that it would be run more than once though). The other assignment, I failed because of hidden test cases and sloppy coding from me. The task was really good – I was given test cases, but no implementation. I implemented enough of the system to pass all the existing test cases. My instinct told me that I should add more test cases on my own (that’s what I would have done if this was on the job). However, I thought that I had already spent a lot of time on it, so I didn’t. When we went through my solution in the interview afterwards, they had run some extra (hidden) test cases on my solution, and discovered two errors in my code. Both had to do with cases with empty input. I felt really stupid for not being more careful implementing the solution. In the end, I still got an offer from that company, and that’s why I am counting it as only half a failure. For the take-home assignments, it was quite helpful to have access to ChatGPT. Getting a working framework up for what I wanted to do was a lot quicker that way. Of the live coding assignments, I passed three and failed two. In the first one I failed, I had to write a limited chess program, that only supported two kinds of pieces. It needed a project structure, a data model, valid movements for the pieces, and tests. I started from nothing, and I had to send the solution in within two hours. It was very tight and stressful. I got most of it working, but not all functionality. I also had a bug in the movement code. That combination made it a fail. The other live coding was less well prepared from the company. I downloaded a repo from Github with some initial code. But there were no working tests, and it took a while to set up an environment to work in. I also had to ask many questions on how the logic was supposed to work (with 50% of my brain capacity), and in the end I took too long. For all live coding tests, I used the IDE on my computer, and shared the screen over Zoom. Salary A couple of times in the beginning, I gave too high of a salary number, resulting in cancelled interviews. So I changed my tactics to instead tell them what my salary had been each year for the past four years, to give them a sense of what I was ideally looking at (I had had quite good salaries). Often, they would say “well, we can’t pay that”. To this I would respond that since I currently don’t have a job, I don’t really have a minimum acceptable salary, it will depend on what they (and others) can offer. This would often mean that we could continue the process. Sometimes it also meant that I had a chance to show what I had to offer, which might later translate to a better offer than they initially intended. Once I had my first offer, it became easier. Surprisingly often when I asked the companies what the salary range for the role was, I would get an answer. This was really good, because I could say no to the ones that offered less than I was prepared to accept. In one case, I didn’t check what salary they were prepared to pay. I only found out when I got an offer from them (after a lot of interviews and a take-home assignment). I did this because I really liked the company, but their offer was very low. In hindsight, I should have checked upfront, instead of wasting a lot of time and effort on them. Even before this job-hunting round, I had quite a good sense of what salaries companies in Stockholm pay developers. It got even better after talking to many companies. In Sweden, you think in terms of the monthly salary. You also have to consider if pension contributions are included or not (in most cases they are included, and can be an additional 10 to 15 percent, which is implicitly included). A very average developer salary would be 55K – 65K SEK per month. Almost all companies are prepared to pay that. Getting a salary of 80K a month and over is more difficult, but definitely not impossible, even in a tight market. In addition to salary, many companies can offer options or equity, and/or a bonus. In the end, you also have to weigh other aspects of the job. How interesting is the product and company? What language will you work in? What will you learn? Who will your colleagues be? Choosing One company I interviewed with was very positive, and ended up asking for two references, which I provided. But the next day, they announced that they would go with another candidate. I was quite surprised, since I thought I would get an offer from them. It’s ok if they find somebody else, but I was upset that they wasted the time of two of my references. The recruiter later apologized and said that she was convinced they wanted to give me an offer, but the manager had picked somebody else. I don’t know what to think, but it was quite a disappointment. Even if you fail to get offers at most companies you apply to, you only need to have one where you are successful. In a sense it is a numbers game – go through enough processes so that you get at least one offer. In the end, I had three and a half offers to choose from (I didn’t formally get an offer from one of the companies, mostly because I knew it would pay less than two of the offers I already had, so I am only counting it as a half). I managed to get them more or less at the same time. I tried to slow some companies down, and speed other ones up, by delaying interviews, or being able to have interviews as soon as possible. I was lucky to have more than one offer, because then I was in a much better negotiating position. The top two offers were both very good, and I could see my self taking either. In the end I got everything I was looking for – a very interesting job, and a good salary. Lessons Learned Stressful. Looking for a new job is a lot of work. It is hard to relax, even on weekends, because there is always some interview preparation you can do. It wasn’t until I had a firm job offer that I could enjoy my time off (I had a few weeks off before I started). Takes time. I thought it would be quicker to find a new job. But there are four or five interviews to schedule, and often a take-home assignment to do. You also want to read up on the company and product. Then the companies usually can’t schedule the interviews as fast as you would like. Add that you will fail interviews, and the process can easily take months. A numbers game. Even if you fail a lot of interviews, it only takes one company where you are successful for you to have a new job. So apply to many. I also realized that I am bad at judging if I did well or not. Almost every time I was rejected, I was surprised. People to discuss with. I have two former colleagues, Patrik and Peter, that I discussed my jobhunting process with. These discussions were really useful. There are so many aspects to consider, and having somebody who understands to talk to helps immensely! Responsive recruiters. Recruiters that consistently get back to you quickly are great! It is such a simple way to build confidence in the company they represent, yet so many recruiters really are bad at it. Reach out. If a colleague of yours is let go, reach out to them (through LinkedIn or other means) to say goodbye. It meant a lot to me, and I think most people would appreciate it. Conclusion I am lucky. I love programming, and I have a lot of experience. Even in a tougher market it was comparatively easy for me. It still took a lot of work, but I ended up with a great new job as a senior developer at Swissblock. I hope my jobhunting experience can be helpful to other developers looking for their next jobs.

When I helped interview candidates, 19 out of 20 candidates flunked the FizzBuzz test, and couldn’t write any code whatsoever. So when I went looking for a job I expected simple tests. I was entirely wrong! Like you write, modern tests require speed coding in unknown IDEs, libraries, and web and test frameworks. I thought it was a ridiculous way to test applicants. You write that GoLand is quite expensive. I see JetBrain lists GoLand for 30 euro a month so I assume that’s not it. What GoLand do you mean? Henrik WarneFebruary 11, 2024 at 8:36 pmReply Thanks! Yes, I mean GoLand from Jetbrains. It costs 30 EUR per month, which I think is a lot if you pay for it yourself.

    "commentBody": "Finding a new software developer job (henrikwarne.com)321 points by Tomte 14 hours agohidepastfavorite249 comments angarg12 12 hours agoI'm a ML Engineer at FAANG and I have been passively looking for the last half year. Common wisdom might make you think that I should be having companies throwing wads of cash at me, but my experience has been very different. * It's true that my profile attracts many messages from recruiters. However ghosting is the name of the game. More than half of recruiters have ghosted me at different stages of the process. Overall I'd say that attention from recruiters is a great vanity metric for your ego, but it means shit unless you can convert that into job offers. * Although there is a lot of demand, the bar for hiring is also very high. Specifically companies are looking for someone with experience in their exact tech stack. Given there are a few major ML frameworks and I'm only familiar with one of them, that rules out a lot of jobs. In one case a company screened me out because I only had 6 years of experience in a particular tech instead of their required minimum of 8. * So far my only outcomes have been 1 rejection and 2 downlevels to senior (I'm targeting Staff+ positions). Although I haven't been dedicated to job hunting, I haven't been successful either at receiving an offer. * In terms of salaries, most companies tend to top out around half of my current comp. I have only spoken with less than a handful of companies that could offer more. I guess that has always been the case with FAANG, but seems more pronounced now. Overall I think that currently the job market for ML Engineers is still better than for Software Engineers, but it's nothing like the fever dream market of 2020-2022. reply PheonixPharts 8 hours agoparentFAANG reputations are no longer evenly distributed. Even though most people's opinions of the company have changed, Google engineers are still widely considered to be high quality. Apple engineers also have a great reputation but it's very rare to see them on the market. Facebook/meta engineers tend to be above average but have a reputation for being aggressive corporate ladder climbers. But if I hazard a guess, if you're struggling to find work, you're at Amazon. Amazon's aggressive hire->pip pipeline has, at least in my experience, destroyed their reputation. I've worked with plenty of ex-Amazon engineers in the past few years and they were all notably below average in skill. This is not to say that you are (if you even work for Amazon), but Amazon is no longer the resume bump it once was, if anything quite the opposite. Talking about \"FAANG\" is not really relevant anymore since there is a pretty big range of expectation for engineers coming out of each of those letters in the acronym. Additionally none of those companies command quite the attention they did a few years ago, as they've all shifted from demanding engineering skill to demanding the ability to survive in a large mega-corp. reply CaptainOfCoit 8 hours agorootparentAs someone who has sometimes hired people from FAANG into startups I've worked in, I'd say it's 50/50 if the person will actually be a net positive to the organization. A lot of times the people coming from FAANG seem to be under the impression that what their previous company was doing is 100% the best, in all cases, and they try to cargo-cult their previous culture into the new company. Sometimes they're able to adapt though and have a really positive impact overall. But the sour experiences really woke me up regarding seeing it as a mostly positive signal that someone worked at FAANG. So I wouldn't see FAANG as a guarantee about anything, no matter which company was their previous one. reply Silhouette 6 hours agorootparentThe culture around FAANGs has always been a bit strange. People associate making a lot of money with being good at building tech at both a personal and a company level and unfortunately that isn't necessarily valid in either case. New hires who have been living inside the Big Tech bubble for a while can come with issues that others here have already described. Consequently startups should probably downlevel many people coming from FAANG roles for exactly the same reason that FAANGs downlevel many people who haven't been worshipping at the altar of scalability in their previous roles. The skills and methods are different and some of them aren't very transferrable. Of course that's not to say good people who have been working at large scales can't or won't adapt. But on day one nobody cares that you've been a Staff/Principal leading projects with 25 developers and a mature development environment if you're joining a startup that needs to raise a Series A before the end of its runway this summer. The abilities you need in that environment are things like identifying the most essential supporting work that can't wait while still spending most of your time on getting the main job done and hitting the deadline. If you can't roll up your sleeves and get the job done then you don't need to worry about a PIP. There are only 10 of you anyway and you're all out of a job in six months if any of you doesn't pull their weight. reply beacon294 2 hours agorootparentIt would be absurd to downlevel these folks. Probably the mismatch is an investment and both org and employee will need adjustments that are mutually beneficial. reply Silhouette 1 hour agorootparentIt would be absurd to downlevel these folks. In which direction? Both make sense to me. A good employee might adapt to their new environment quickly and in that case obviously they should then be levelled up appropriately. But there is nothing about being Staff/Principal at a BigCo that says you're going to be anything special as a senior in a startup - in fact the opposite can be the case for reasons others have mentioned - and there is nothing about being an excellent contributor at a startup that says you're going to navigate the scale and the politics of a BigCo effectively. It seems reasonable to start a new hire at a level where you would expect they do have the required skills (including soft skills) and then look to make more effective use of them if and when they've settled into the new environment. reply angarg12 7 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure what part of my comment made you think that my current employer is an obstacle in job hunting. Actually it's quite the opposite, as I mention I get a lot of attention from recruiters even though I'm not actively looking. The issue I'm observing is that this attention doesn't clearly translate to more job opportunities. If my current employer was the problem, wouldn't recruiters and hiring managers not bother reaching out, or reject my applications (I haven't applied to any job directly recently so I can't say). reply PheonixPharts 7 hours agorootparentI'm speaking to your point about: > Common wisdom might make you think that I should be having companies throwing wads of cash at me My point is just that you're misunderstanding \"common wisdom\". In 2016, yes a job at any FAANG would mean that you have no trouble getting a new gig. In 2024 Amazon employees do not have a great reputation, so there's no reason to think of yourself as part of a group that \"common wisdom\" would show preference towards. Nobody with \"wads of cash\" sees Amazon on a resume and thinks it's something special and worth reaching out for. FAANG in general is not as appealing as it once was, and Amazon in particular is not a strong signal at all. Someone working at OpenAI today would likely have the response you're imagining is reserved for FAANG. Recruiters are also playing a numbers game, especially in this tech job market. My inbox has ample recruiter message for roles that are not even relevant to my skills, I wouldn't mistake that for signal. reply NoahKAndrews 6 hours agorootparentI think they were saying that because they're an experienced ML engineer more than because of what companies they've worked at. reply snotrockets 6 hours agorootparentprevAmazon, like any other big company, is a 1000 different small companies in a trenchcoat. Same for the other FAANGs. Each has just as least as many meh engineers as it has great ones. reply throwaway_32242 5 hours agorootparentprevI kinda agree that Amazon is no longer a resume bump. But otoh, if a company holds a lower expectation on an ex-Amazon candidate (compared with average - \"quite the opposite\" as you said) just because the pip thing exists, I'd say that's very short-sighted and irrational, and would probably think again if I really want to work for them. Similarly, if they automatically think that an ex-Googler is worth hiring without proper evaluation. \"Reputations\" of companies you worked for should have the absolute minimum influence on any hiring decisions. Don't blame others if you don't have a proper hiring process that works for you. reply majormajor 10 hours agoparentprevI think the assumption would be more that FAANG would throw wads of cash at non-FAANG candidates than the reverse. There's a few \"common knowledge\" things (assumptions, but often accurate) about recruiting from FAANG that would certainly explain the lack of \"wads of cash\": * Golden handcuffs are real and deliberate and in many ways rational: very few other companies have similar-sized wads of cash to throw OR similarly-scaled problems where FAANG-level salaries are likely to produce significant ROI * FAANG stacks tend to have a lot of amazing in-house niceties that can't be found elsewhere, so there's a certain \"are they an expert or are they just an expert at using Google's internal stack\"? Would they be productive out of the gate or would they need to rebuild all that stuff first? Everybody wants the prestige of telling their CEO or their investors that they poached people from FAANG but few have the wallet or the precise scenarios to get into a bidding war about it. I had these issues as a HM in 2020 trying to hire ML engineers. (At mid-size places there's also often a \"WTF do we do with a ML engineer\" problem where if you aren't a data scientist or a general SW engineer, it's hard to carve out a role in between. Especially if the org has data scientists who aren't particular \"engineer savvy\" in terms of workflow and tooling. And then the ML engineer makes things shiny and version-controlled and all... and the data team mostly just ignores it since moving over to that stuff isn't one of their KPIs...) reply n_ary 4 hours agoparentprev> In terms of salaries, most companies tend to top out around half of my current comp. While, I am not in ML or ever worker in FAANG, here in EU my experience is also the same recently. Infact, I’d say I am fairly underpaid given my experience & responsibilities but the latest openings are disaster in terms of comps and benefits. Also, unlike what my EU brethren will parrot, most opening cite “hybrid” & “flexible” but then they reluctantly share much late in the interview that yeah need to be in office at least 3-4 days a week, and we prefer in-person meeting because “collaboration”! Sadly, watching the wages going down(despite all the touting of inflation adjustment), EU is slowly catching up to US fever without catching up to the wage levels. reply piecerough 11 hours agoparentprevAs a FAANG employee, working with ML, what do you want to get from other companies, besides more money? It's hard to have more chips, for example. You run less experiments, you have less throughput in an already computationally tight environment. reply angarg12 9 hours agorootparentFully remote would be a pretty nice perk, ever since our companies forced us back to the office. I believe this alone might be one of the easiest ways for smaller companies to poach talent these days. Other than that, I enjoy working in hard and impactful problems. I'm privileged that I was able to do that in FAANG, but it's unclear how long this will last. I know that is very trite to say that your company has changed, but I truly feel it. Our company missed the LLM train and we are scrambling to play catch up now. Also we mostly pivoted from bold and inspiring initiatives to efficiency and cost cutting. Most of the initiatives in our pipeline for this year are pretty dull \"let's save some dollars here and there\". Nothing wrong with that, but given the choice, the chance of working on a moonshot vs helping a trillion $ company save pennies might convince one to change jobs. There is also the very trite but very true aspect of \"small cog in a huge machine\". I might engineer a new system that brings in tens of millions of dollars to the company, and I'd be lucky if 3 layers of management above me knows about it. Those kind of initiatives might influence the entire company in a smaller organization. All in I recognize I'm quite privileged and doing pretty well in my current job, and that's why I'm passively looking. TBH one of the aspects is that I got FOMO from all the talk about ML engineers being in high demand. However my experience so far has been very underwhelming. reply AznHisoka 8 hours agorootparentWhere have you heard that ML engineers are in high demand? I don’t think they are immune from the tech slowdown that’s affecting the industry. Of course, LLMs and AI are all the rage, but the demand for that is in the services/APIs not necessarily the demand for ML engineers reply lumost 4 hours agorootparentI suspect we'll see a broad slow down in classic ML approaches. If I just need a basic classifier -> GPT-4 can do an OK job. Spending an afternoon prompt tuning is vastly cheaper than a dedicated team of scientists and engineers curating datasets and running experiments. For many SMBs, this effectively eliminates the ML function. reply breather 11 hours agorootparentprevThe traditional answer is stability. I think that's still true despite the sense of looming layoffs. Everyone always knew the layoffs would come one day anyway... reply cannonpalms 11 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like a Staff title may be in play, although it wasn't made clear whether this would be a promotion. reply oortoo 11 hours agoparentprevObviously, learning all popular tech stacks is not entirely realistic, but IMO when a SE or any engineer is looking for work, at least 1-2 months of researching and getting proficient with the full breadth of what's out there for your interest is going to pay off. Unless you are moving jobs to just do the exact same thing somewhere else (who wants that) you kind of have to take it on yourself to show up the the interview appearing like an expert in skills you hope to get to really grow comfortable with on the job. You may even need to exaggerate your experience. Ultimately, specialization should be more about how you think than what facts you know, but the hiring market won't see it that way, meaning you need to just get really good at faking it and not be afraid to back it up later after some late-night study sessions. The other half of this is that 'levels' don't always translate across environments. Just find work that resonates with you, and you will move up. Obsessing over the level (or even the pay) is probably limiting. reply neilv 11 hours agorootparent> You may even need to exaggerate your experience. [...] meaning you need to just get really good at faking it and not be afraid to back it up later after some late-night study sessions. Please don't do this, and don't normalize other people doing it. Dishonesty isn't something I want to have to be understanding about in colleagues. Like, maybe they just see it as a little while lie, and some job-hunting Web pages told them is ordinary to do, and you'd be at a disadvantage if you didn't do it, and you're even to be commended for your scrappy can-do resourcefulness in fudging. I'm ready to be understanding about many situations, but I want dishonesty to be something we can summarily nuke from orbit. Also, when I'm in an interview to possibly join a company, I don't want there to be more rationalization for crappy interview process. (\"I see from your resume that you have decades of experience, including sole author of open source packages, but you could be lying about all of that, you dirtbag, so let's derail this meeting by focusing all our energy on some BS test that's been gamed to heck.\") reply singron 7 hours agorootparentI was really amazed about how many people lie on the resumes. E.g. a recent study [0] said 70%, but there are many of these with similar numbers. There is a difference between putting your best foot forward and just straight lying for financial gain, which is fraud, and can (very rarely) send you to jail. Personally, if I suspect dishonesty, it's a strong no-hire. If I even get a whiff of dishonesty, I'll at least flag to recruiters, hiring managers, and interviewers, and we've actually compared notes and realized a pattern of behavior before. It is hard though since a lot of the stuff they would lie about are things you can't verify. 0: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2023/11/05/70-of-... reply entropi 1 hour agorootparentprevWhile I agree with you on the principle, I would not blame anyone who lies in such a BS market to be honest. If for a person, the choice is between not being able to pay rent because they had 6 years of experience in a given stack instead of 8, vs. exaggerating in their cv, I dont think it is reasonable to expect complete honesty. Also we all know most of the companies are often very dishonest, so why should we expect complete honesty from the workers? reply otteromkram 10 hours agorootparentprev> Please don't do this, and don't normalize other people doing it Unfortunately, that's how the competitive market works. People shouldn't be penalized for the tech stack that their company used vs. what companies are looking for. Skills from one platform to another are very fungible (eg - Java/.NET, AWS/Azure), so \"beefing up\" a resume is what's required if you plan on getting any calls back. > Dishonesty isn't something I want to have to be understanding about in colleagues. I have some bad news for you... > .. I don't want there to be more rationalization for crappy interview process. No one is forcing you to participate in interviews which require doing a coding test or system design review. You are more than capable of withdrawing your candidacy. I would bet that a lot of equally-skilled people are lining up behind you and ready to do that extra work in order to stand out and get a job. Don't place yourself on too-high of a pedestal, my friend. reply neilv 9 hours agorootparent> Unfortunately, that's how the competitive market works. That's how some people think the competitive market works. It's not universal. Which is why I just contradicted that, and called to not encourage those beliefs. Put loosely, half the job of an engineer is to tell the truth. What I think you're characterizing is a corporate bullshit shoveler who just wants to go through the bullshit motions to get a paycheck. I really don't want some impressionable junior engineers to see multiple people on HN encouraging lying. I do not want to wade through that, to separate the merely misled junior engineers, from the hopeless anti-engineers. > You are more than capable of withdrawing your candidacy. And I do. But I'd prefer that the situation improve. reply okr 8 hours agorootparentI am pretty tolerant when it comes to not knowing things or time for learning new skills. With this fast changing industry i can not help it but tolerating. But when i catch someone lying at least twice about something technical, i do my part to make sure the person is not hired or next to leave. There is no trust. reply lazide 2 hours agorootparentAn engineer who can’t admit they don’t know something when it matters is actively harmful to the work of engineering. reply mrexroad 2 hours agorootparentThis. I am genuinely excited when I am faced with a problem set where I don’t know something (e.g. need to research, explore, gain a skill, or otherwise educate myself) — seriously, it’s the best. The only thing better is learning (or being told) that I was wrong about something and then re-evaluating my belief/understanding stack in order to find and correct the error. I have such little patience for folks fronting or faking knowledge/expertise - it’s such a fucking waste of time for everyone else. reply Aurornis 11 hours agoparentprevSome perspective from the other side of this situation: I was a hiring manager at a company that paid well but not FAANG level. We had an office near a couple FAANG offices. We had a lot of applications from people who wanted out of FAANG. Some problems we encountered when working with FAANG applicants and a few ex-FAANG hires: * Non-transferable knowledge: Many of them had a lot of experience working within the abstractions and structures of their FAANG company, but struggled to work with foundational concepts once removed from their FAANG infrastructure. Some of them spent years trying to rebuild copies of the FAANG tooling they were familiar with just to accomplish jobs that didn't really need it. * Experience mismatch with the current team. An extension of the above point: Some candidates were high level at FAANG but less experienced with day-to-day operations than our in-house Senior/Staff devs. This put us in an awkward spot where we'd have to pay them more than our current high level engineers to bring them in, but they'd be operating at a level below them at least to start. We opted to promote from within in these cases. * Compensation cold feet. Many would tell us they just wanted out of their FAANG co at any cost and knew it would come with a compensation cut. But when it came down to offer time, they'd get cold feet about leaving money on the table. Even in cases where we paid within ~$50K of their FAANG comp, some of them just couldn't let it go when it came time to put in their 2 weeks' notice. * Boomerang FAANG employees. Some people would join us, then miss the structure of blending into a big, highly structured FAANG company. They'd bounce back to the same FAANG or another FAANG within 6-18 months. * Higher rate of candidate ghosting us than with any other cohort. It was rare for an average candidate to ghost us once the interview pipeline had started, but for whatever reason the FAANG applicants had a very high rate of getting half way through the pipeline and then disappearing without a word. Many times they'd appear again a few months later asking for a second chance, only to repeat the process. I'm not suggesting these apply to you. Only trying to provide some perspective. Anything you can do to alleviate these concerns early might help an application process. Of course, if your goal is to secure FAANG level compensation and Staff+ titles, you might just have to accept the reality that continuing in FAANG is far and away the easiest way to get there. reply angarg12 9 hours agorootparentThank your for sharing, it's great to hear different perspectives on the topic. Non-transferable skills is actually one of my biggest concerns about working at the same company long term. These tools are often so far from the industry standard that it can hurt your employability long term as you mention. It's no secret that devs often interview with companies they don't intend to join just as a warm up exercise. I confess I've been guilty of this. The boomerang is quite interesting. Up until very recently this was a very well known career move. People would leave the company for one year just to come back at a higher level and higher salary. As a \"loyal\" employee I find this furious, but alas I guess it's my fault for working for such a lousy company and not pulling the same move. If it is any consolation, at least our company change the rules so that it's harder to pull this off, so you should see this much less often these days. Regarding your last comment I'm not particular about leaving FAANG, as I aren't about working for FAANG. Considering my priorities it's very likely I'd only take a competing offer from another top tech company. For now I'm comfortable enough staying in my current company and passively looking for a better opportunity. At the same time I want to avoid becoming too complacent, and I'm aware the rug might get pulled from under my feet at any moment (hello layoffs?). reply manp2 5 hours agoparentprevWhats your recommendation for backend engineers that want to transition to ml engineers?

Best of luck to your job search, god speed reply hnrodey 7 hours agoprevI believe the current hiring woes in the US are more nefarious than just being picky. First, I believe US companies are figuring out how to hire foreign teams at lower cost. I get multiple emails per week from companies offering us their team at low rates. South America and India are common places. I personally witnessed this at my last company where they drastically cut US/North America staff in favor of Indian teams with a pure cost motive. Literally dozens of jobs including SE and supporting roles shipped overseas. Second, I believe US companies are asserting back control over the labor market. Employees took a lot of control in the Covid era so companies have to be looking to fix that. I hope something changes soon. I’m in the early stages of a job search and it’s a tad frustrating.

My employer disproportionately lays off US citizens and preferentially hires in Latin America. I spent part of today looking at my employer’s main competitors. One has a bunch of programming jobs available in Mexico. Another is hiring primarily in India. It isn’t ChatGPT that will take US engineering jobs. It is cheaper devs in other countries.

But if you don't have an image on LinkedIn or put a generic image (of your dog or something) then it hurts you in job searches. People will deny that it hurts you, but I guarantee it does. I've been in many meetings where people make comments about weird photos like that which portray you negatively. So I have accepted it as a necessary evil.

While I used to put my photo as usual for years because this is how we do Lebenslauf, then one of my immigrant friend got severely discriminated(with clear evidence, guess the HR lady was new hire), so I started leaving my photo out in protest. While I got some issues for a while about “better knowing our colleague and avoid hiring scam(?)”, eventually this stopped after I got some experience. Now, if someone asks me for a photo or is concerned(one of my parents is immigrant background so I have a slightly hybrid name), I just tell them to know me better in person when I am in Office and they can take a photo with me when I meet them. That all being said, the photo was more of a cultural thing in the past, it was useful for identification and filing purposes as well.

If I ever had to get paid 5 figures after 30 years I worked literally switch careers. It's Sweden / Stockholm, not Silicon Valley / San Francisco. I've looked up real estate there just to point out how ridiculously inflated prices are here. A nice looking 67 square meters apartment, 15 minutes from city center, was selling for some €190,000. By comparison a 50 square meters rather communist-looking apartment here (Romania) sells for €160,000 - €180,000. A 5-figure salary in the €80,000 - €90,000 range is fairly outlier both there and here. €7,500 gross translates to about €4,400 net both in Sweden and here. To buy an €190,000 apartment here, the mortgage is in the €1,200 per month. In Sweden as far as I know, a rent is in the €600 - €1500 (depending how far from Stockholm city center).

Since then I've taken 3 interviews and gotten two great offers in the 50+% percentile for US based software engineering roles. I'm a not-that-bright grug-brained developer, so I'm sure it wasn't because I was blowing people out of the water with my brain power. I'm not sure I have the energy to do a numbers-game applicant strategy. I hate interviewing generally, and live coding causes my brain to lock-up. So I only apply places I am genuinely excited to work for, and places that I reason would be generally excited to have a good team player who is nonetheless a grug-brained developer.

Strong left wingers are likely to have moral objections to the American medical system's notoriously ruthless business practices. In other words, they probably want people who don't have particularly strong political views. Sadly, political affiliation and political belief are not protected classes under US civil rights law so employers can legally discriminate on this basis. This is actually a big part of why the American political system is so dominated by corporate interests because many people are terrified of hurting their career prospects if they participate in the political process. reply therealdrag0 1 hour agoparentprevI feel like coding exercises are nearly already IQ tests and it’d be simpler to just IQ test than have to try to come up with unique coding problems. reply justech 10 hours agoparentprevI don't know where I found it, but I saw a job ad for a dev role that asked for an MBTI test first (it's about personality types thing like INFJ INFP etc).

I hope that having a bunch of unemployed developers out there will disrupt things. I suppose either way wages are going down though. reply hansvm 12 hours agoparentprevIt's a long day for sure, but honestly I don't really mind it as a candidate, and that boils down to a few reasons (1) The time cost isn't as high as it seems. If I get as far as a phone screen I'm getting an offer, nearly guaranteed. The flow chart then looks like (a) if I don't get a phone screen, that awful process is no worse than the status quo, (b) if I do, I just find out in the phone screen if the battery of interviews has high latency (an 8hr day is fine, 8hrs over 2 months greatly complicates a job search) and drop out early the 20% of the time that happens, and (c) from there I have an 8hr day to a guaranteed job. Each offer then costs roughly 0.95/0.8~1.2 full interview processes, or 1.2x 4-8 hours. (2) That time cost is a bit annoying when it comes to competing offers (a single solid day isn't crazily expensive when you're about to get a 40% pay boost, but 5 solid days for a job search is ... 5x as expensive ... fine, but not ideal, and hard when you have finite vacation days). Somewhere around 1/2 of employers don't actually seem to care about producing proof of competing offers though. If they make an offer, you counter that you're worth some fixed XYZ instead (ideally doing enough research to choose the levers they're most likely to accommodate) and will sign immediately if they can make that happen, they'll go above and beyond to agree to your counter-offer. It's a waste of time for the whole industry to require counter-offers in the cases where everyone knows what you're worth (admittedly, when that's not the case, counter-offers are an unfortunate necessity to prove your worth). (3) The average tech interview is 10-20min solving the techno-babble and 30-50 probing what they know about the company and the team. New companies are very risky, and they work fairly hard to keep damning evidence out of the face of the public. You can mitigate a lot of risk by background-checking the executive team, but a present-day boots-on-the-ground view of things, ideally with the several overlapping/competing views you get from multiple team members, allows you to bounce out of problem situations early. reply brailsafe 11 hours agorootparentSeems like a very personal and fortunate take depending on what you do or when in time that experience is based on, not that it's irrelevant, just far from generalizable, especially right now. Companies are looking for almost any reason to turn someone away, so a guaranteed offer coming from a phone screen, or for that matter even getting a phone screen, is either exaggerated, you're consistently incredible, or/and you're consistently incredible and in a niche with very little competition and big names on the CV. Even the author of the article admits they got quite lucky with the low numbers they experienced before getting an offer. I don't mean to be dismissive, but the markets are quite varying and intensely either saturated, competitive, or/and sparse right now, depnding on which market you're in and what your CV or skills look like, to the point where as a frontend dev I'm considering just switching to knitting or something more lucrative reply singron 6 hours agorootparentprevFwiw our hiring pipeline has 30%-70% of candidates make it to the next stage once past the phone screen (it has varied somewhat as we re-ordered or changed process). Assuming 3 stages until offer (e.g. HM interview, tech screen, full-day interviews), and offer-acceptance, with 50% success rate at each stage, 1/8 get an offer and 1/16 accept it. At 60% it's 1/4.6 and 1/7.8, so the exact rate makes a huge difference. The corollary to this sensitivity is that if you are just slightly better or worse at interviewing, you can see a huge difference in the number of companies you need to pass screening at to get a job. In practice, companies get more people into the pipeline than necessary to reduce the chance that it dries up without making the hires, so as a candidate, you will also have to take that into account.

An average company probably doesn't need exceptional developers. If you're not a tech company and you don't have an extremely challenging setup, your survival as a company doesn't rely on exceptional IT skills. You can do a lot with less than 10 virtual machines, any decent web app framework (Spring? Laravel?), and a version control system. Even apparently insane requirements are entirely reasonable: 100 thousands transactions per day is... 1 TPS. Make that 10 TPS to adjust for peaks. Unless you're doing extremely complex queries, you can definitely handle 10 TPS with reasonably limited resources.

My current group is what you might call \"debug fire jumpers\" (not 100% of the role, but a significant fraction of it). Knowing I can call in an expert in an area that I am fuzzy, and there is no judgement, and we can collaboratively solve the problem, is what enables the team to deliver.

For tech companies and a few non-tech companies but with a strong tech environment (think HFT), IT is where you gain an edge on your competitors.

It's also not an efficient way to figure out if both sides are a \"good fit\" because you're basically doing a whirlwind tour of video chats with people you most likely won't work with.

Two back to back storms, there was about 12 hour window where you could get in or out.

I don't remember if he got trapped due to the third storm too. It wasn't completely cut off. During the first storm, I got head notice of the next one and rebooked my flight out of the east coast to be one day earlier, and threaded the needle by politely asking customer service. I was in and out of the east coast for a week. Anyways, Some cities on the east coast are less prepared than others for this sort of thing. reply LeafItAlone 12 hours agorootparentI’m familiar with travel in that storm. It sounds like they didn’t really make an effort. They _didn’t_ get back, which is different from they _couldn’t_ get back. Which is probably why they got fired.

We should fix the modern interview loop (very hard) but the idea we’d ever go back to one hour is kind of out there. reply Clubber 12 hours agorootparentThat is making the assumption that any time spent over the traditional 1 hour helps you confirm whether the candidate is performant or not. I dispute that assumption and figure any time outside of that initial hour makes a hiring mistake that much more expensive. Calculate it this way. I can spend 3x 1 hour (3 people interviewing a candidate for 1 hour) and have a 60% chance of hiring a performant person. I could also spend 3x 6 hours and have about the same chance. When that 40% non-performant candidate shows up and I have to repeat the hiring cycle, It's significantly less expensive in both labor costs and opportunity costs for the 3x1 interview style than the 3x6 interview style. This doesn't take into account all the talent that has no need or interest to go through a 3x6 interview process (I am one of them). >the idea we’d ever go back to one hour is kind of out there. Ya like I said, the industry just kinda does what it does, complains about not being able to find talent, and will never learn. reply Klonoar 11 hours agorootparent> I dispute that assumption and figure any time outside of that initial hour makes a hiring mistake that much more expensive. Okay, sure - dispute it if you want. It doesn't change the fact that the industry seemingly collectively decided that 1 hour isn't a sufficient amount of time to gauge fit/effectiveness/etc. My point to you is that given the above, you have to make a choice. Spending the extra few hours gives you some hopeful assurance of what you're getting.

We've never had anyone tell us they were concerned about that. What liability was senior management at your company concerned about? reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentThe same one FAANG used to tell us that we couldn't do it either. To paraphase \"We want to give the candidate every chance to prove themselves, and cutting the interview short gives them a bad impression of the company (and it would make it easier to sue us for unfair discrimination).\" Since it was just a few (or in this case 1) interviews, and that makes it easier to claim that I cut it short because queue whatever protected class. Which, if someone was going to be that kind of jerk to a candidate, I guess doing it on the first interview WOULD be the one, eh? It would just be my word against theirs, instead of x interviewers vs theirs. And I guess the riskiest type of candidate for that kind of crazy behavior WOULD be the person who felt okay blatantly lying on their resume about such a fundamental fact AND EVEN SHOWING UP FOR THE INTERVIEW, come to think about it. We didn't get sued in this case though. I think the interviewee was just surprised someone was interviewing him who actually knew how to code. reply Clubber 5 hours agorootparentGod I couldn't imagine conducting 6+ hours of interviews for a candidate I knew failed it within the first 30 minutes.

The thought was roughly as palatable as intentionally ‘groining’ a coworker on a guardrail or letting a kid walk into traffic. After getting chewed out, I never walked them out early though. I guess that is why FAANG told us to not talk between ourselves and put everything into the system for the HC independently - so we wouldn’t know what we were in for, and would give each individual interview a fresh shot without all the anticipated pain and suffering. Makes it easier when you can’t see the nut shot coming I guess? Makes sense, but yeah - terrible. To be fair though, out of hundreds of interviews I’ve done, that was top 5ish for bad.

I applied for a Sr. Frontend position, and they have me do a takehome where I recreate some small component with some time-travelling functionality. It was actually quite fun to do and I enjoyed building it, but the feedback afterwards was maddening. One of the points of feedback they gave me was that what I implemented wasn't 1:1 aligned with the design they gave me... The design they gave me was a blurry JPG with compression artifacts that was maybe 300x300 embedded into a random Notion document they sent me with an extremely vague list of requirements. I even explicitly asked them if they could give me a higher quality version of it so I could match it more closely, but they said that was the only document they could give me. When I tried to somewhat align the picture to the actual design I was implementing, the border-radii of the elements was so blurry from the compression that it was literally impossible to know whether I got it exactly right or not. They also gave me no notes on specific fonts used (the one on their marketing site was a licensed font that cost money), specific brand colors (I had to go to their marketing website and hope the green I saw on the buttons there was the one they were expecting) or anything else of the sort. It was obvious they expected me to spend at least 6 hours on it considering the feedback, but they explicitly said 2 hours and didn't give nearly enough reference for me to go off of to know what they truly expected from me.

For long-lived connections on networks I don't trust, I arbitrarily set the timeout at 10s. On networks I trust, I set it to one second. Looking at 99.99%-ile connection times on my production network, it's bimodal with peaks at 1ms and 28ms. (Guess which connections are from one physical machine to itself, and guess which connections are to a different machine.) I have no idea what the correct answer to an interview question that asks this is, though. Like, I never connect to my database inside the request flow, I have a connection pool and wait for a connection to become free in the pool. So \"connection time\" is really a function of how utilized the pool is, and has only a passing resemblance to the health of the database. Maybe 10 connections are running \"begin; lock table foo; select * from foo where expensive_condition\". All 10 connections in the pool are blocked on a lock, and that doesn't mean the database is unhealthy and you want to shed load. So do you want to show the 11th person \"sorry, our site is down, come back later\", or do you want to wait for the random expensive queries to complete? I'd wait. (I suppose I wouldn't take an exclusive lock on a table to serve a web page either, but who knows what the interviewer is doing.) reply tracerbulletx 11 hours agorootparentThe correct answer is to talk through how you'd evaluate making the decision based on the requirements and measured usage patterns, talk about what you've used in the past and why, if you haven't really been in a position to decide this or think about it, don't lie or randomly pick a number but just get out whatever you do know about it.

What is the connection used for? End users, a backoffice tool, or a batch process? then he should have asked: what is our SLA? What's in the DB, how big are the objects, the queries? How frequent are they? Even so, I wouldn't venture any number if you don't do some profiling or at least some tests with the most common data, and with edge cases. It can be anywhere between milliseconds and full seconds, maybe more?. Reminds me of an interview once, I asked: the website is slow, you're in charge of it, what do you do? He just said \"buy more servers\"...slow down there, Rockefeller. reply jval43 12 hours agoparentprevIt's unclear from the question, but they were apparently looking for a very small number. But is that connection timeout, or query timeout, or something else? If you have long-running complex data processing or ingestion jobs, query timeouts could well be measured in minutes or hours. So a small number doesn't make sense there, and the connection technically doesn't timeout. For connection timeouts, if you run a connection pool then timeouts of a few seconds or more could be fine and be the difference between the system being completely down vs just slow in case the load / contention unexpectedly increases. Not great of course and it won't hold for long, but might help in some very specific bursty scenarios. If you are able to safely re-use the connections in the pool most of the time the timeout matters even less. Reusing connections is usually possible, but it depends on the database and what errors require establishing a new DB connection. And of course with a pool you actually have 2 'connection timeouts': one for establishing a new connection to the DB and a second one for acquiring a connection from the pool. The second one is usually most relevant for an application, but both matter. But even without a pool a higher number (say a few minutes) could possibly make sense given a specific scenario. A database with a connection limit is equivalent to decrementing a semaphore (acquiring a lock), and there are cases where you'd want to wait for just a bit longer to acquire that lock instead of just timing out. A slightly longer timeout won't hurt if e.g. you implement a retry mechanism anyways instead of aborting. Not saying long timeouts are a sign of great engineering, but context matters a lot for these sorts of questions. reply lr4444lr 12 hours agoparentprevMy guess is, very low: it's a shared resource for multiple clients, hit multiple times per request, and should probably be on a sub 100ms basis tops with a few retries. Or it's a trick question: you should use shared connection pools to minimize the overhead of new connections, and should simply be part of the app startup. reply squigglydonut 6 hours agoprevThe author has a lot of experience.

Speaking of LLM, I'm surprised I'm not seeing any job skill requirements for LLM related topics or even vector database experience. Are the bigger companies so far behind the curve here? reply brailsafe 11 hours agorootparentIf you're not applying specifically to AI type jobs, would you expect to see LLM or vector database experience alongside React? Seems like that would be a silly set of requirements to look for in anything but a low-interest rate environment, especially at comoanies that have a real product or have been around for longer than a year. reply andy99 13 hours agoparentprevRejections are great info, especially quick ones. It's the companies that never respond or start the process then ghost that are the real problem. There you learn absolutely nothing. reply BadHumans 13 hours agorootparentYou learn nothing regardless. There is never any information about why you get rejected or why you were passed over. The only difference between getting rejected and not getting rejected is that you at least have closure on that application. reply patientzero 12 hours agorootparentI think quick rejections are a good indication to work on your materials and/or position selection, possibly delaying your send rate.

    "originBody": "2024: announcing the year of the OpenStreetMap vector maps OpenStreetMap will take a large leap forward with the introduction of vector tiles on openstreetmap.org this year. This is the first of a series of blog posts where we will share our progress. To lead our vector tiles project, the OpenStreetMap Foundation has hired Paul Norman, a renowned figure in cartography and open data, whose journey with OpenStreetMap began in 2010 with a chance encounter on the xkcd forums. His role in the community took off with his work on OpenStreetMap Carto in 2013. His volunteer involvement with the OSM Foundation, including contributions to several working groups and a tenure on the OSMF board, highlights his commitment to the project. Professionally, he has held various influential positions at MapQuest, CartoDB, Wikimedia Foundation, and Amazon. Billions have seen the products of his work. To read more from Paul, visit his blog for technical deep dives into vector tiles, follow him on Mastodon or on Twitter. Vector tiles represent a significant advancement in how map data is processed and presented. Unlike traditional raster tiles, which are static images with pixels, vector tiles are like the ‘SVGs’ of the mapping world: you get lines and points. This stores geodata in a format that allows for dynamic styling and interactivity, enabling the user to adapt the visual appearance of the map without altering the data. If that sounds like what you’ve seen on other maps, you are right! Vector tiles have become industry standard in interactive maps that, unlike openstreetmap.org, don’t get updated often, and where you can simply recalculate your whole database occasionally. But the map displayed on openstreetmap.org are quite uniquely different! They get updated incrementally and constantly, a minute after you edit; it’s a critical part of the feedback loop to mappers – and how the author of this blog post got hooked in the first place. This is why we have to invest in our own vector tile software stack. In the direct future, for users, this will mean a new, modern-looking map style with seamless zoom on openstreetmap.org. Looking further ahead, the most exciting part is what this vector tile project will make easy for volunteers and tile users: 3d maps, more efficient data mixing and matching and integration of other datasets, thematic styles, multilingual maps, different views for administrative boundaries, interactive points of interest, more accessible maps for vision-impaired users, and I’m sure many other ideas that no one has come up with yet. This technology is not just a leap in aesthetics, but also in functionality, enhancing the overall user experience. In the 2021 community survey (page 15), there was no clear sentiment on what the foundation should do on vector tiles. We noticed a split in preferences: some advocated for volunteer-led development, others for professional engagement. The ecosystem has evolved since then, making it easier to build on top of existing software bricks. We see our project as a reasonable balance between the two most popular answers. Investing in core software is also part of our multi-year strategic plan. The OpenStreetMap Foundation depends on donations to finish this project. If you would like to support our year of vector tiles specifically, you can donate and leave ‘vector tiles’ in the donation message. Every contribution, large or small, directly supports our ability to ensure that OpenStreetMap can be open, accessible and dynamic for all. Your support is not just a donation; it’s an investment in the future of open-source mapping. We’re just at the beginning of this exciting journey. Stay tuned as we will delve deeper into the schema and style aspects in future blog posts.

But most websites using openstreetmap don't get their maps from there but from companies like mapbox, maptiler, and others that typically already provided vector maps. Openstreetmap itself has been lagging behind a bit. Protomaps, mentioned elsewhere in this thread, is awesome for self hosting vector maps. The way it works is that you upload a single large pbf (protobuf) file with all map content and then use lambda functions to extract vector tiles from there. Put a CDN in front of it and you have cheap map hosting. Amazing stuff. I met Brandon Liu, the person that built this, some time ago at a meetup. Well worth checking out his stuff.

I have noticed that most apps that use OSM data provide offline vector downloads for each region. Are most of these apps building their own vector databases? I assume that OSM themselves providing vector tiles will be game changing, allowing app developers to skip creating their own vector downloads as they could just hook into the live vector tiles. No doubt this will make providing OSM maps a much simpler process. reply cldellow 7 hours agoparentYou often want to build your own tiles for specialized applications. Any map schema is a tradeoff -- if you include every feature in every tile at every zoom level so that the renderer can pick and choose what to show, you bloat the tile file size. The blog post is very light on details. My intuition is that this is primarily focused on powering the map on osm.org in service of people who edit OSM getting to see faster updates. This would be in keeping with their current raster tiles, which are not meant for use in \"real\" applications. There are enough technical challenges in rolling out vector tiles with minutely updates for editors on OSM -- in my opinion, they should solve it for OSM first before thinking about committing to a specific schema for public use by other apps. Still, anything that incentivizes innovation on vector tiles is pretty exciting. One option that could be interesting: provide \"fat\" builds of tiles that have every feature, and create tooling to do something akin to treeshaking so people can simplify the resulting tiles to only contain the features they need for their use case. reply orblivion 6 hours agoparentprevI recently made a self-hostable web app* that works the same way; the user downloads regions with a point and click, I have the data on S3. I used Protomaps, which is vector library for the browser. I did look into seeing if I could just download the maps straight from Protomaps. I didn't end up doing so, I think it's because they didn't seem to have an API that I felt like I could scrape wholesale. But also, it turns out that there's a question of how that data is generated. There's a certain schema of what sorts of things show up in the browser, perhaps with styles giving options for how to display them. But which raw OSM data you decide to include, and which visual element it corresponds to, is up to the producer of that data. So thinking of Organic Maps and OsmAnd, I bet they choose slighly different things and probably change it over time. * https://sandstorm.org/news/2023-12-05-osm-on-sandstorm reply stereo 5 hours agoparentprevPost author here! Yes, most apps have to create their own tile or download server at the moment.

And I did get it working! But it was not near as cool as it could be because of two dramatic events: OSM Foundation violated the trust (nice way to put it) of a participant, OSMBuildings.org, in the search for sponsorship [3] (four years ago, such lost progress :( ) The other is that LeafletJS’s developer is Ukrainian and can’t advance his project [4]. Please consider those two issues when contemplating donating to OSM due to this press release. While I applaud OSM abstractly, it exists because of a massive amounts of public contributions of IP, not because of $$ from a commercial sponsor.

The OSM Buildings folks called themselves \"OSM Buildings\", using the OSM trademark. They offered a commercial service. The OSMF was OK with this. It seems the OSMF is OK with a lot of things -- including permitting Cesium to use the OSM mark in their own commercial project. Live and let live, may a thousand flowers bloom, etc. Rather than reflect on the fact that their name was not really theirs, but relied on the goodwill of the OSM mark, the OSM Buildings folks decided to ragequit and shut down their project, dramatically claiming that their name was \"seized by a multimillion dollar company\"? The whole thing is bizarre to me. reply neomantra 6 hours agorootparentI was trying to understand it from both sides and not getting much. Some of your color helps too (like the euro amounts). It all was bizarre and sadly the whole thing blocked some progress. I had come back to temper my response because for sure this is great work by the tech team. reply cldellow 5 hours agorootparentSome more colour is that the OSM Buildings project didn't even ask permission to use the OSM mark. If they were a community project, this was permissible. If they were a commercial project, they ought to have sought permission from the OSMF. Given that, it seems pretty reasonable to me that the OSMF's stance was basically: your name is your problem, if you think someone is infringing on it, it's up to you to enforce it. The OSMF runs on a shoestring budget - something like $400,000/year, vs Wikimedia Foundation, which runs on $170,000,000/year. It would be a real shame if a potential donor thought this particular instance was a reason not to donate to the OSMF. reply neomantra 6 hours agoparentprevMaybe faux pas to reply to my own comment I made further connections with this. I literally had cloned and was fixing OSMBuildings.org because, among other things, it wasn't clamping values correctly [1] -- it's why my charging markers are white. But I felt conflicted doing that. I was happy with what I spiked with OSMBuildings and started exploring commercial services like MapBox and a few other OSS projects. Operating projects and companies and organizations is not easy. It sucks what happened there. I'm not a hater and actually looked to Patreon or similar Paul Norman -- and maybe the 'vector tiles' earmark literally means that? But, I'm not happy with that previous behavior of the organization... So it's great the OSM Vector Tile service will be dramatically improved...

They never asked to use the trademark, didn’t participate in community discussions, and used OSM + a very generic term for their project name. Cesium asked for our permission to use the same words, and simultaneously, but not in exchange for any permission, joined as a member to support the foundation. That money went to paying for the infrastructure that runs the project. We never asked osmbuildings to stop using the name. We’ve never granted exclusive trademark permission to anyone - if you wanted to launch a product called “neomantra OSM buildings”, we’d find it cool. If you start an interesting project, pick a non-generic name. reply bdon 6 hours agoparentprevLeaflet is a separate project from OpenStreetMap - it's just one popular frontend for viewing tiles served from openstreetmap.org, like OpenLayers.

I haven't spent a lot of time looking into it. But the last time I looked at commonly-used vector tile formats, the one I found was clunky to generate/parse. (And/or, maybe I just missed the right one. Please correct me if there is something out there that is clean and simple -- and has common library support.) reply penorman 1 minute agoparentMapbox Vector Tiles are, for better or worse, the industry standard. They have good library support and are good enough that no one is rushing to reinvent them. If you want to distribute sets of tiles to people, PMTiles is the best container format as you can just throw the file on hosting that supports HTTP Range requests (e.g. S3) and add the appropriate plugins to your client library. If you have to support clients which can't do the range requests from pmtiles, you can throw a thin layer in front of it to turn HTTP z/x/y requests into the pmtiles range requests. There are no good file formats for distributing minutely updates of tiles but there's no need for this. If you are keeping your tiles up to date up to the minute you have a reasonable internet connection and you can just download individual tiles instead. reply philips 9 hours agoparentprevHave you tried pmtiles? https://docs.protomaps.com/ reply philips 9 hours agoparentprevAlso a post from Paul Normans, mentioned in the parent post, covers some options. https://www.paulnorman.ca/blog/2022/10/tilekiln-storage/ reply somishere 7 hours agorootparentNot an expert, however (lol) - even if the recommendations here are solid - this doesn't feel like a particularly well-reasoned comparison. IMHO maintaining a large number of files on disk (be it 16m or 1.5b) should be a non-starter (not to mention that zipping them to slightly reduce the count removes one of the benefits of having them in the first place). A database makes sense - as does SOC between generation and distribution if it brings benefit - but immediately writing off SQLite because of write performance[1]? Similarly the arguments against pmtiles feel outdated and ignorant of the developing nature of the protocol (appreciate it's a 2yo post!). OSM deciding on a format here has potential to significantly shape things to come. Hopefully Paul has progressed his thinking a bit since this was written. [1] https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/consider-sqlite reply bdon 6 hours agorootparentMost of the development for pmtiles has happened in the last 2 years, including a maturing server implementation (http://github.com/protomaps/go-pmtiles) but some key parts are still missing like the ability to decode an archive in native mobile applications. sqlite (mbtiles) already has ~10+ years of integration into the mapping ecosystem so that still works better if you want to move tilesets around to desktop applications and mobile devices. The situation Paul is addressing is one unique to OpenStreetMap itself, which is minute-level updates of a global scale tileset. This is a use case pmtiles is designed explicitly not to address, where using a database is a better fit. reply somishere 5 hours agorootparentAppreciate you weighing in directly Brandon! To be clear though, I didn't mean to say that protomaps was potentially a better solution (of course an uncompressed DB makes much more sense), simply that the developing nature of the protocol meant that it's inclusion within the \"ecosystem\" shouldn't be a closed case :) Which is to say, distribution of OSM data feels like a large part of the process. Of course there are various bottlenecks / considerations around edits / writes, but in practice surely reads are the bigger vector. I wonder how many OSM-external use cases rely on \"minutely\" updates or need the full fidelity of the raw data source. Feels like there is a solid case for providing less frequent (hourly, daily?) official updates via official \"single-file\" formats that could be widely distributed to the benefit of all, and e.g. allow OSM to loosen up their hot-linking policies and ensure continued investment in the chosen protocols. But mainly I was questioning how a somewhat proven format like SQLite, with its many benefits (interoperability, distribution, etc.), would be so easily dropped from consideration without even a test having been run. Just my thoughts of course! reply bdon 3 hours agorootparentThere is nothing stopping the OSM Foundation from say, offering a complete SQLite (or PMTiles) tileset download on planet.openstreetmap.org, technically, legally or otherwise. Creating and archiving the tiles shown on osm.org would be at least a couple terabytes once you get to around zoom level 16. The key distinction is \"official\" - the only \"official\" data product of OpenStreetMap are its XML and PBF data dumps at planet.openstreetmap.org. The frequently-updated tiles you see on osm.org are \"quasi-official\", they're created by a separate project called OpenStreetMap Carto. These tiles have a special status within the OSM ecosystem for historical reasons; by virtue of OSM being map data, it should probably show something for human eyeballs on the website. The design goals of OSM Carto are to show feedback to map editors; the linked vector tiles project is intended as a successor, or at least complement, to OSM Carto. The consumption of the tiles by third-party sites is a side-effect tolerated by OSMF; the general consensus within OSM seems to be that a consumable tile service for third parties is outside the scope of the project. reply somishere 2 hours agorootparentGreat context + points. Thanks! Definitely not in a position to question the status quo, let alone the OSM community consensus. Other than to say that - even if the focus is currently on internal software / editors alone - it still feels like a massive opportunity. And one that aligns with a number of strategic goals of OSMF[1], specifically around efforts to grow the community, extend the core developer base (and more) ... by fostering a closer relationship between OSM data-derived products / the wider (non-editor) community. Let it be known I love scope creep. [1] https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Strategic_Plan reply cldellow 6 hours agorootparentprevThe SQLite limitations might also be solvable by sharding the databases (so each sees 1/N of the write volume), tiering them (so tiles that are written most recently are in file A, then file B, then file C), or a combination of these approaches. I'm assuming the requirement is not really to build a single .mbtiles file, but to have some way for a process to serve the correct tile when given a z/x/y tuple. reply maxerickson 6 hours agorootparentprevWhat does the pmtiles protocol provide to help update the tiles in place? That's the challenge with the osm.org feedback map, you need to quickly update the small fraction of tiles that very recently changed, while hopefully not processing the remainder. reply bdon 6 hours agorootparentIt doesn't, pmtiles is designed for tilesets updated at a daily to quarterly frequency, by replacing the entire archive on cloud storage. for minute-level updates serving tiles out of PostGIS is the best current approach, which is the approach Paul is taking for the OSMF project. reply agumonkey 1 hour agoprevOSM is a great project reply nzeid 9 hours agoprevAs a religious OsmAnd user I welcome this.

If an artist pays a model and paints her, is the artist to be prohibited from destroying the painting because it sucks, and because the model wants credit? What about a music producer who pays a studio band to record a song that turns out to be terrible -- is the producer prohibited from deleting it? It's the tax write off for destruction that's fucked up, as @cnees says. Failures are part of the process of creation. If the producer says the market value of the work is zero, they've committed tax fraud if it's not. The solution to their \"attribution\" problem was found by directors a long time ago when they didn't want their names on a film: it's directed by \"Alan Smithee.\" https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000647/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 reply imgabe 5 hours agoparentThe line is at claiming a loss for tax purposes. Destroy the film if you like, but then you get no tax break. There's a similarity with the \"hobby loss rule\". In order to be a valid business who can deduct business expenses like losses, you have to demonstrate that you have a \"profit intent\". That means that you make at least an attempt to turn a profit on your work. If you don't, it's considered a hobby and you don't get to deduct any expenses. If Warner Bros is going to make movies just to delete them without even trying to sell them, that sounds like they're just indulging in a movie-making hobby rather than being in the movie business. reply konschubert 44 minutes agorootparentI don’t get your point. If you run a business, money that you spend is subtracted from your earnings. Are you alleging that they made the money for fun? That they never intended to release it?

That’s not cheating and it makes a lot of sense if you think about it. reply _giorgio_ 3 hours agorootparentprevThey can't decide that the value is zero if they got public offers from Amazon, Netflix etc It's clear that the loophole is to ask Amazon and Netflix to make a secret offer.

Why shouldn't they be able to deduct there very real losses. reply imgabe 4 hours agorootparentThey're not real losses. They could sell the movie. They could release it. They're deliberately forgoing those options and deleting it. You don't have a loss until you attempt to generate revenue and find that the revenue is less than your expenses. If you just throw your product away, that's not a loss. Ultimately we write tax policy for the benefit of society, not for Warner Bros. In theory, we could write tax law so that it made financial sense for a factory to produce widgets and send them directly into an incinerator, because they could claim this as a \"loss\" and offset profits from other activities. But we shouldn't have a tax law that does that, because that's a huge waste of society's resources (materials for the widgets, fuel for the incinerator, people's time and labor). We could use those resources to do something more productive and tax laws should encourage companies to do productive things that improve the world, not spin their wheels for imaginary losses.

You can deduct the material and factory expense of making of making defective widgets. If you trash them, you write down the value of your assets. >But we shouldn't have a tax law that does that, because that's a huge waste of society's resources (materials for the widgets, fuel for the incinerator, people's time and labor). This is the crux of things. Those arent society's resources, and never were. They are resources of the warner Bros and the widget factory. Tax law isnt and shouldn't be about forcing people to do what you want. If someone wants to waste their time and resources, that is their choice.

They are free to waste them as much as they want. It's just not a tax-deductible business expense to do so. There is a difference between \"we won't allow you to do something\" vs. \"we won't subsidize you to do something\". It's one thing to want to waste your resources, it's another thing to demand that everyone else pay you to do so. What's to stop the CEO from building a mansion with the company's resources and selling it to himself for $1? Then having the company write it off as a loss? Oops! It was just a bad business decision and the company lost money. Oh well! We can't stop them from wasting their resources if they want to! reply s1artibartfast 3 hours agorootparentFundamental to the whole premise of taxes is that they are applied to net profit. If a company spends $1 to make $10, they get taxed on $9. If they spend $8 to make $10, they get taxed on $2. Nobody is giving warner bros money. They arent getting a cash tax refund. They just spent more money and made less profit. If they wanted to make zero profit, and pay zero taxes, that is their choice! If a commpany wants to sell houses at a loss, that is legal, and happens all the time. If they are self dealing, the shareholders could have an issue with it, or the IRS if the CEO doesn't report it. Guess what, Companies DO give CEOs many millions of dollars of salary and stock. Every bit of that is tax deductible expense for the company. >Oh well!

If a company spends $1 to make $10, they get taxed on $9. If they spend $8 to make $10, they get taxed on $2. Yes, the key word there is net profit, and the ways to calculate net profit for tax purposes are prescribed by law. Not every single penny a company spends is automatically a deductible business expense. Some things are, some things partially are, some have to be amortized over time, some are not deductible at all. There's thousands of pages of tax law delineating this and it is not in the slightest without precedent to declare a particular expense non-deductible. reply s1artibartfast 2 hours agorootparentSo there is a moral argument for what an ideal world should be like, and legal argument for what the rules are. From the moral perspective, it is clear that WB clearly had real expenses. They spent money, bought rights, and tons of workers were paid good money. Now you pivot to the legal argument. The current law clearly supports what Warner Bros is doing, so that doesnt help you either. like I said before. It seems like this entire thing boils down to a control issue. you dont like how WB is running their company and doing with their property. It isnt you business, both figuratively and literally. reply imgabe 2 hours agorootparent> From the moral perspective, it is clear that WB clearly had real expenses. They spent money, bought rights, and tons of workers were paid good money. Yes, they had expenses. You seem to have a very very rudimentary understanding of accounting and have conflated expenses with losses. An expense is not a loss. If you buy a factory for $1 million, you didn't lose $1 million dollars. You now have an asset, a factory, that is worth approximately $1 million. You don't get to go to the IRS and say \"I lost $1 million dollars this year because I bought a factory\". The IRS will tell you, no you didn't. You still have your $1 million, it's just now in the form of a factory instead of cash. Likewise, WB spent money and created an asset, a film. That film has a market value. Maybe they don't like the film, but that doesn't change the reality that it's worth something. We know approximately how much it's worth because several other companies made offers to buy it. Instead WB wants to lie and say it isn't worth anything. So, no I don't like how they are running their company when they want to lie and cheat to get out of paying the taxes they owe. You can't buy a factory for $1 million and then turn around and say \"yeah, it's not worth anything anymore\", and you shouldn't be able to say a movie isn't worth anything when it very clearly is. We do not gain anything by enabling companies or anyone to deny reality. reply djur 2 hours agorootparentprevIndividuals certainly aren't taxed on their net profit, so I don't see how that could be \"fundamental to the whole premise\".

I sell the next one for 0 dollars to my cousin so I can write it off immediately. If the movie works, money stays in the family, if it doesn't I already got deductions and it was a no-op for my cousin. reply Veserv 55 minutes agorootparentOh no, you are presenting a simple problem that would take you, cryptonym, all of 30 seconds to figure out a solution to since you are obviously smart enough to think things through. In fact, you could even cheat by looking at the other responder who responded before you suggesting a public auction which is what I was alluding to by saying \"anybody\" as in you must allow all people (within reason) to compete to purchase, not choose a specific person. Can you try to spend 30 seconds countering whatever problems you came up with and only then propose non-trivial problems? I promise I gave the idea more than 30 seconds of thought and did think of the obvious problems, it is just tiring to exhaustively list out and pedantically enumerate a complete proposal instantiated for this specific domain. That is also why I explicitly said it solves the central 90% and would require tuning and mechanisms to reduce abuse since I do, in fact, know the proposal is incomplete, just that the problems I am aware of with this class of solution generally appear to be quite amenable to solutions that should be at least as robust as the status quo. reply throwaway69123 3 hours agorootparentprevPublic auction seems appropriate reply konschubert 40 minutes agoparentprevIf the market value was nonzero, why would they be scrapping it? They could still count the delta between their production cost and the money they got as a loss and deduct that from their taxable income, no? They have no incentive to underestimate the value of the final product. Income - expenses = taxable earnings. As a business, the money you get by earning a dollar is always bigger than the taxes you pay on it. If they’re scrapping it, they are clearly deciding that the cost of finishing and marketing this movie is greater than the value of the movie.

You can simply ask yourself \"do I want to live in a world where this happens\" - and any decent person would say \"no\".

They are much worse than merely being disliked, which is why there are laws. reply interroboink 6 hours agorootparentI feel like that just moves the goalposts. Instead of deciding what should be law or not, now we are deciding what constitutes \"mere dislike\" vs \"something worse.\" It's ultimately the same issue, no? reply LoganDark 5 hours agorootparentI once fell and hit my head, sliced it right open. It was traumatic. Not any of the aftermath like having to go to the hospital or so on. Just my head being hit. I could have died. I could have died. It took me days to process this. There was something in my head for days preventing me from thinking properly, from feeling emotions properly. There was no concussion, no actual cranial damage. It was all psychological trauma. Imagine if it wasn't an isolated event but if you knew there's someone out to get you, and who continues to be a risk to your well-being. Say, domestic abuse. SA. Something like that. Try saying there's nowhere to draw the line between that and \"mere dislike\". No one should have to suffer that. That's why there are laws against things like rape and murder. reply interroboink 2 hours agorootparentI didn't mean to say there's nowhere to draw a line. I meant to say that the question of where to draw the line is open to discussion, in both cases. To be honest, I don't entirely understand your example, since in the first case you're talking about an accident, and we can't exactly pass a law saying \"accidents are not allowed.\" But in the second case, you can pass a law against SA and such. So in my mind, the difference there is in realistic enforcement options, not on the merits themselves. If we could somehow magically pass a meaningful law against accidents, then maybe we'd consider it. Accidents are things that just about everybody dislikes, after all.

If you're running \"Loot Boxes Unlimited\" and your business is taking off like a rocket and you invest $300 million in a new HQ, and then just as your finishing up, congress passes a law making loot boxes illegal and you're no longer going to be able to afford moving into that new HQ, you get to write off those expenses just the same. You must offset them by any gains you get from any part of it you do sell off, but you're under no obligation to sell the building, you can just keep it on the books depreciating slowly. Most companies will try to sell what they can to recoup some of those losses, because recouping any of the loss tends to be a better financial option than the write off for that same amount. But selling a building doesn't have the same legal and contractual entanglements that selling a movie might have. Additionally a building is still useful even if you can't use it for what it was originally intended for. But who is going to buy a movie they can't release? You'd need some company with enough money to buy a produced movie (even if at a discount) who also thinks they could release it and make enough money on it to cover their costs AND who will also be willing to take on all the contractual obligations like licensing and residuals. And chances are in addition to all of that, they also have to be willing to license the various properties that the movie studio already owns (or worse, re-negotiate the rights from the original holders that the studio had already previously negotiated). It's also important to remember that those expenses would have been written off whether or not the movie was released.

They have to petition the DGA for permission to do so, which is only granted in the event that the director can show that the producers took creative control away from the director and substantially changed the product from the director’s creative vision as a result. In practice, this rarely happens, as the DGA is extremely reluctant to allow directors to take their names off of movies simply because they weren’t happy with how it turned out.

There's no obligation for anyone to bring something to market regardless of how far along it is. After I read the article: Still not persuaded. It reads like motivated reasoning, the person doesn't like things not getting released and says that governments should step in. There's some mention of taxes and lost work, but nothing tht holds water. As an example: if it cost you $100M to make a film and you write that off you could reduce your tax burden by as much, netting a $15M lower tax bill if your rate was 15%. By contrast if you release it you've no guarantee of that $15M, especially once promotion and other costs are factored in. If it's a trash movie that'll also damage the firm's reputation---something that's tough to quantify but no less real. That's not great, but its I wouldn't want to live in a society where that was criminal.

The only thing I can come up with here are royalties, but they should be based on some percentages of revenue right? If you release a turd movie that cost 100M to make and only nets you 5m in revenue after royalties, can't you still write off the 95m and have almost 5m more than you would otherwise?

In the streaming era, it's very easy for the revenue created by hosting an older piece of content to be dwarfed by residuals.

Is there any good reason to think ego is a part of it? reply aquova 11 hours agorootparentThe article itself puts it forward. > The offer to sell the film was, to put it mildly, not undertaken in good faith. It appears that the company would rather take less money by writing off the movie than sell it for even a few dollars more than that, because they might risk having a rival turn it into a success, which would further embarrass them for never even having tried to market it themselves If it was really bottom line thinking, they'd accept the $70M, more than double what they'd get in tax benefits, and have another distributor release the film. Instead, they'd rather trash the film than risk looking like fools if they allowed another company to reap the benefits for releasing a hit. reply feedforward 11 hours agorootparentprevYou're right, it's just part of the absurdity of Rand's vision. In the real world people do work and create something, but some bean counters figure out the heirs who own the majority stake of a company can make a few more bucks by destroying the thing, so it is done. reply nyc_data_geek 11 hours agoparentprevSure, that sounds fine, but the taxpayer ought to not be responsible for footing the bill in any way. The studios do this for the tax writeoff, which is tantamount to robbing the people paying taxes (eg:us) blind. reply gruez 11 hours agorootparentIt's not \"robbing the people paying taxes\" because the money was never theirs to begin with. Taxes are paid on profits, and if profits are not made they're not owed. Suppose I make a painting worth $1000. If I had sold that, I would have been required to pay taxes on that at the marginal rate, say 40% so $400 worth of taxes. Instead of doing that, I set it on fire. Does that mean I just robed taxpayers of $400? reply isthatafact 11 hours agorootparentIt feels like tax fraud. Given that it is apparently not possible to prove that they deleted the movie, it seems like the IRS should assume that they still have the movie. I bought a stock share for $1000. I wanted to sell it for $2000, but no one was willing to pay more than $400, so I decided to tell the IRS that it was worth zero and take the full tax write off (which was tax fraud). On top of that, refusing to release or sell the movie should have triggered a shareholder lawsuit. reply gruez 11 hours agorootparent> Given that it is apparently not possible to prove that they deleted the movie, it seems like the IRS should assume that they still have the movie. Even if they didn't delete the movie, the fact that they claimed to have deleted the movie and used it as a tax credit basically makes the value $0, because in the unlikely event they have a copy around, they wouldn't be able to sell it without having all of the profits seized from them. reply dahart 5 hours agorootparentprev> Given that it is apparently not possible to prove that they deleted the movie Why does it matter if they delete it or not? As long as they don’t sell it, they don’t make a profit on it, and don’t pay taxes on the profits. If they didn’t delete it and then actually sold it after enjoying their tax break, then they’d be committing actual tax fraud. > refusing to release or sell the movie should have triggered a shareholder lawsuit And yet it didn’t. So maybe shareholders are fine with it? Why should shareholders sue when a company doesn’t release a product? This literally happens all the time. reply blowski 11 hours agorootparentprevI bet the owners of the film studio had a really hard Christmas that year, with no profits. The issue is that the studio takes the profit if it succeeds, the taxpayers take the losses if it doesn’t. reply muricula 11 hours agorootparentprevIt's not setting the fire which causes taxpayers to lose money, it's writing off the loss against taxes you would have otherwise paid on profits made from other movies. reply gruez 11 hours agorootparentNot an accountant, but tax write-offs aren't some sort of no tax glitch that you make them seem. You can only deduct losses that you've actually suffered, not imaginary losses. If you spent $10M into making a movie, you can't value the movie at $80M and then use that against all your other revenues to pay less taxes. If this were true every company would be making fake movies to destroy and pay less taxes, not destroy actual movies that they spent millions on. reply derivative7 11 hours agorootparentprevTaxing people on income they didn't make but the government imagined they could have made in some situation that didn't happen sounds like a slippery slope to be standing on. reply sib 11 hours agorootparentprevMany of the people on this site are involved in technology (software and/or hardware) product development. If they work for a company that spends $10M in development salaries & related costs to build a product, and then decides not to release that product, the company certainly deducts those development costs from its revenues when it files its taxes. This is true even if some third party had made an offer to acquire the product - there are many valid reasons why the first company may choose not to sell it. reply BobaFloutist 11 hours agoparentprevAh, the work of fiction based on an Ayn Rand novel?

Or when a creation has already been duplicated and given to the world and they think they have any right to claw that back. reply anon373839 8 hours agoprevCan anyone with an accounting background explain what is actually happening on the books to make this economically advantageous? By forfeiting any revenue on these films, the studio is reducing its tax burden but isn’t it increasing its overall economic loss? reply compumike 5 hours agoprevIf we eliminated the accounting fiction called \"depreciation\", and instead simply had all expenses deductible in the year they were incurred or paid on a cash basis (with net losses carrying-over to future years), this wouldn't have happened. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 6 hours agoprevSo how do these tax write offs actually work? I'm assuming that when the film is produced, they spend money to receive an asset, no different than e.g. buying a machine. With a machine, they could write it off over time, or (I assume) they can delete the movie/scrap the machine to immediately book the remaining value as a loss? If they don't do that, I think a machine is valued according to the purchase price and written off over X years. How does a movie get valued and written off? There's a good argument for banning write-offs for salvageable assets that are scrapped (regardless of whether it's machines, inventory or movies) - I've heard the tax impact argument made for the destruction of still-usable assets too. reply mdasen 11 hours agoprevTo me, the weird thing is that the tax write-off doesn't even seem to make sense. Let's say you spend $80M making a film and you write it off for a $30M benefit. You're still in the hole $50M. Let's say that you sell the film for $20M and write off the remaining $60M loss for a $23M benefit. In the latter case, you're only in the hole $37M instead of $50M. That's a lot better. Is there some weird accounting rule where you're allowed to write off full losses, but not partial losses? I understand writing off losses: if you make $100M on one project and lose $50M on another project, you pay taxes on the $50M you've made - but you're only getting a fraction of the money back. It's better to get 100% of $20M plus a fraction of $60M than getting a fraction of $80M. No one seems to be explaining how this is working in Warner Bros Discovery's favor. Sure, I get canceling popular shows where the actors might be looking for more expensive contracts. I might think it's short sighted given that you need popular shows to keep your subscribers, but I get what they're trying to do. I understand licensing content to a competitor for a quick pay day. Again, it seems short sighted, but I get what they're trying to do. What I don't get is why it's better for them to completely scrap content than to let it flop upon release. The only possible explanation I can see is that they'd be able to claim the tax relief earlier. If they released it in late 2023, they'd have to wait to claim any losses since they'd be making money off it into 2024. If they cancel it in 2023, they can take the write off for 2023. It must be something else, right? reply crooked-v 6 hours agoparentIt doesn't work in their favor. It does, however, work in the favor of Zaslav's specific desires about slashing content that has to pay residuals in favor of residual-free reality shows and documentaries. reply philsnow 11 hours agoprevCriminal fraud issues aside, I would think that all of the artists had a reasonable expectation that the work they were doing would be released, and would then become part of their resume. Since it didn't get released, they collectively and/or individually might very well bring a civil suit against the company for lost compensation (where compensation is defined as some combination of cash and reputational gains, and this latter part became zero). reply bongodongobob 5 hours agoparentI worked for a month on a server migration project that ended up getting axed.

The expenses of producing the movie can already be offset against their profits. That's how business works: you only pay taxes on money you earn after expenses. So how, exactly, do they get an additional write-off for destroying the film? If you deliberately destroy something of value, why should you get to write that off your taxes?

From what I’ve heard from people at leading labs, it’s not clear that dpo is worth switching to from RLHF reply patelajay285 18 hours agoparentprevThis is developed for researchers, so I assure it’s very hackable and configurable. ;-) but appreciate the feedback on the title! reply behnamoh 17 hours agoparentprevThis. If I'm the type of person who wants to do RLHF, then I'm the type of person who wants control and doesn't like delegating it to imported libraries. reply patelajay285 17 hours agorootparentThis is built for ML researchers out of an academic lab. There's a ton of functionality in the library (beyond RLHF and alignment) that ML researchers do every day to write papers and run experiments that the library helps abstract and make repeatable and usable. Unless your research hypothesis is specifically around improving or changing RLHF, it's unlikely you should be implementing it from scratch. Abstractions are useful for a reason. The library is quite configurable to let you tune any knobs you would want. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 11 hours agoparentprevHonestly the amount of complicated boilerplate that you're supposed to write from scratch every time you do something with ML (in some of the major frameworks) deterred me from touching anything ML-related for a long time. As far as I understand, what the training loop is supposed to be doing is pretty static and you don't need to understand most of it in order to \"do ML\", but at the same time it's full of complicated things to get right (which would be much easier to understand when controlled through well defined parameters instead of mixing boilerplate and config). reply brigadier132 18 hours agoparentprevI always appreciate these projects because I just dive into the code itself and copy out what I need once the wrapper becomes too much of a burden. reply patelajay285 17 hours agorootparentThat’s totally valid and something we would even encourage!

Abstracting things even further and making assumptions. Of course you can use them. Of course you can remove them after and use the underlying code.

If it was \"RLHF a LLM inI'm not a fan of the RL/SL dichotomy, because the line gets so foggy. If you squint, every loss is a negative reward, and every policy improvement a supervised target.

But also because what used to define it was the human-curated datasets: SL contained input/output pairs, while RL contained episodes with sporadic rewards. Nowadays, many datasets have different forms or are synthetic.

Until proven otherwise, with a model that users actually find useful, I don’t think this can work. It would be nice. But I’ve seen too many nice ideas completely fall apart in practice to accept this without some justification. Even if there are papers on the topic, and those papers show that the models rank highly according to some eval metrics, the only metric that truly matters is \"the user likes the model and it solves their problems.\" By the way, on a separate topic, the 90/10 dataset split that you do in all of your examples turns out to be fraught with peril in practice. The issue is that the validation dataset quality turns out to be crucial, and randomly yeeting 10% of your data into the validation dataset without manual review is a recipe for problems. reply patelajay285 11 hours agorootparentIt's a demo snippet of how to setup the workflow, it's not meant to be a working production example a self-rewarding model or a faithful reproduction of the original paper. Whether self-rewarding LLMs are a good idea or not, it's a valuable and very active area of research in the literature today. This is a library for ML researchers who should actively research and study these avenues along with the pitfalls you're mentioning. But in order for them to do that, building these workflows have to be accessible to them, which is what this library is meant to do. It's not meant for the \"hobbyist\" ML-community, they should not be using synthetic data today in this way, it would likely lead to subpar results for any practical model or task. reply sillysaurusx 10 hours agorootparentThere’s a lot to unpack here. First, I’m an ML researcher. I don’t go around saying so because appeal to authority is bogus, but since every one of your comments seems to do this, it’s unavoidable. You say the code is for ML researchers, then flat out say that it’s not a working production example, nor is it a faithful reproduction of a paper. So what is it? Whether you want it to be or not, your audience is the hobbyist ML community, because without benchmarks to back up your code examples, no one from the research community will trust your examples without actual proof that they work. That’s the hard part of research, and it’s most of the effort. My advice is, write something that can train useful models. Implement a production grade workflow, and show some reasons why it works. If you’re trying to get the wider ML research community to buy in to this, there’s not much other way to do it. No one will want to take easy code that does the wrong thing, and most of your examples show the wrong thing to do, like the 90/10 split. You’re also a bit defensive about accepting feedback. Trust me that it’s better to accept that your code sucks and does the wrong thing, and then try to make it suck less and do the right thing. That’s how the majority of good software is written, unless you’re cperciva. But he’d also publish a paper explaining why his code is correct. Anyway, the whole point of posting this to HN is to get feedback on it. (If you were hoping that a bunch of people would suddenly use it, then you need to appeal to the hobbyist community. They’ve told you a bunch of things that you’ve straight up said is out of scope.) And it sounds like you were hoping for feedback from ML researchers. Maybe others will chime in, but for now, that’s the best I’ve got. reply patelajay285 10 hours agorootparentI think you're interpreting hostility where there is none, so I don't have much to say other than it's an infrastructure library, a demonstration snippet doesn't need to show how to train a production grade model. I appreciate the feedback and it's noted. reply sillysaurusx 9 hours agorootparentWell, this is a decent example. I didn’t say you were hostile, just defensive. As an ML researcher, infrastructure libraries need to show how to train a production grade model, or else they’re useless for research. This is why research is hard. You keep handwaving this in various ways, but if you want ML researchers to take this seriously, you need a serious example. \"Production grade\" doesn’t mean that it needs to have a deployable API. It memes the model needs to not suck. And until your training code can train a model that doesn’t suck, every ML researcher will view this and think \"this code is guaranteed to produce a model that sucks,\" since there’s no evidence to the contrary. It’s incredibly hard to get the details right, and I can’t count the number of times I’ve had to track down some obscure bug buried deep within abstraction layers. I’m trying to help you here. Ask yourself: who are my users? Are your users ML researchers? I already explained the problems we have, and why your library doesn’t meet those needs. Are your users ML hobbyists? You’ve already said no to this, and I think that’s a mistake. Most ML researchers behave as hobbyists, in the sense that they’re always looking for simple, understandable examples. Your library gives that, but without any of the rigor necessary to show that it can be trusted. Are your users ML devops, since it’s infrastructure? No, because it’s training models. So you’re excluding every possible user, whether you realize it or not. But we’ll see; in a few months, if your library has significant traction, I’m empirically wrong. But I’m trying to help you avoid the default outcome of nobody uses your code because you’re not designing it for any particular user. reply patelajay285 9 hours agorootparentThanks for clarifying, for the record, I generally agree with you. I think we just disagree on the snippets and how in-depth they need to be. Our library is built on HF libraries (we don't implement the training code ourselves), which are popular and commonly utilized by researchers, and people know how to build good models on those libraries. The package is simply meant to provide an easier interface to create some of these complex multi-stage LLM workflows that are starting to become common at ML research conferences and reduce boilerplate code around common functions (caching or tokenizing). But I hear you on it would be useful to also have some examples that show a proper, reliable model being trained with the library v.s. just example models. The project is pretty early, and we'll work on adding more examples. reply bbstats 16 hours agoprevI can abstract this to 2 lines reply ilaksh 12 hours agoprevHow do you normally do DPO?

    "originBody": "Why Software Engineers like Woodworking Read in 3 min Share The smell of fresh pine sawdust filled the air, with more floating up as I sanded the last rough corner of the stool. My toddler was happily sanding her own block off to the side. Woodworking was a new hobby I'd picked up. My old ones, coding, reading, writing, had kept me stuck to my laptop, holed up by myself. Not very toddler friendly. A surprise gift laid the seeds of an idea. As a boy, the best summer days were when my dad and I would transform scratch wood into bird houses, planes, and eventually even rube goldberg devices. It was time to rekindle the flame. A few youtube videos and a HomeDepot run later, it was time to pause my side coding projects and foray into a new world. Except it wasn't that different from the old one! Woodworking felt strangely familiar. Even its dopamine hits triggered the same spots that programming would. Turns out, the best parts of woodworking aren't actually that different from software engineering: 1. You build your own tools The best software engineering moments are when you building your own tools. That's work with purpose. Woodworkers do it too. They call such tools \"jigs\". Some jigs might be built to meet niche needs (like drilling straight holes). Others, just to save money. As always, you have to decide what's the value of your engineering time. 2. Too many tools There are mind boggling varieties of woodworking tools out there, each optimized for a slightly different situation. Want to saw wood with the grain? Against the grain? Need a quick but ugly cut? Need a smooth cut and don't mind it taking longer? What about curved cuts? And that's just for saws! Each one is optimized for a specific use case, but unless you have an infinite budget you'll need to decide which ones are actually required for what you want to do. Anyone who's had to choose a storage layer on AWS knows what it's like to understand your tools, figure out what they're best for, and which one most closely matches your needs. 3. Finite (non-monetary) Budget Money isn't the only thing you budget. Any limited resource needs to carefully doled out. With software, the budgets might cover hardware constraints (CPU/memory), networking bandwidth, latency targets, engineering man-hours, etc. Turns out, there's one inflexible budget with woodworking: Physical space! There's only so much room in my garage (even after I cleaned it). Whatever tools I get have to fit in there along with my work bench. I have to be really picky about what I spend my storage budget on, and some beloved items, like a razor sharp table saw, are simply not possible. 4. Design first, build later In both worlds, sketching out your designs before building pays huge dividends. You get a clearer picture of what you'll make and you figure out how the different parts will interact. Otherwise, you might have to throw away days worth of work because you took a slightly wrong turn. 5. Waiting Except with woodworking, you yell \"The glue's drying!\" On the plus side, it lets you work on multiple projects at once. 6. You have Users! Once my wife learned of my plans, the requests for custom pieces started rolling in. Knowing that whatever I build has an eager recipient awaiting it is rocket fuel for motivation. And since it's my wife asking for it, it's easier to justify buying the tools I \"need\". One big difference With woodworking you actually get to hold your creations. Intrigued? Woodworking has the same highs as software engineering (and even more if you spend enough time around glue). You get the same fast feedback loops, close interaction with your users, while avoiding some of the more tedious aspects of software engineering. Plus you're never on-call. I can see why these guys gave up software. That's not my path though, programming is too near to my heart and my day job lets me do more than just write code. But it does help answer a question I've asked myself a lot: What would I do if I was born a hundred years ago, before computers were invented? And the answer is now clear: Find something to build.

    "commentBody": "Why software engineers like woodworking (2021) (zainrizvi.io)173 points by mooreds 14 hours agohidepastfavorite112 comments avemg 10 hours agoThe things I like about woodworking: * It's tangible. I can put in a couple of hours of work and then step back and see exactly what's been accomplished. * The techniques are hundreds/thousands of years old. New tools come along (not as quickly as they do in software), but at the end of the day, we've pretty much decided on a handful of best ways to do things. There's always new stuff to learn, but you're very rarely inventing something from whole cloth. * And my personal favorite: Every project has a definite end. That jewelry box or coffee table is FINISHED. Sure, after a time I might put a new coat of finish on something, but once a piece leaves my shop it's done. I'm not forever tweaking this or that about it, trying to make it something it was never meant to be or tearing pieces of it apart to redo the joinery or whatever. reply winrid 1 hour agoparentTell that to my grandfather, who at 73 is still adding onto his house that he built when he was like 20 :) reply andy_ppp 8 minutes agorootparentHouses are more like software projects than furniture. reply haroldp 9 hours agoparentprevCovered in sawdust right now from building a pull-out drawer for a kitchen cabinet. It came out square and the joints were tight enough to hold it together for the dry fit. Very satisfying. I am still mostly terrible at this. > It's tangible. This is the best part for me. Programming often reminds me of the \"I sell air\"[1] scene from City Slickers. The down side of this is that there's no undo. You have 300 operations to step through and if you mess one up you probably need to start over. > The techniques are hundreds/thousands of years old. Watching Clickspring recreate the Antikythera mechanism[2] has made it obvious to me that loads of secret knowledge was trapped in guilds and missing from the historical record as a result. You can do so much with basic hand tools. The down side is that there's so much temptation to buy expensive shit. Or worse, think you can't build anything because you don't have $15,000 worth of pro tools. I really needed a thickness planer on this project. > Every project has a definite end. So much. Fuck maintenance.

This, but ;) I really like that you don't have undo but you still don't have to start over. You have to learn how to build things and what to do when you inevitably eff up and how to cover it up! And then you go around the house and check how the builders/tradespeople covered up their mistakes or how they were simply never as perfect to begin with as you think you need to be. The difference being that unfortunately you will know forever where you effed up and even if you cover it up so that nobody will ever notice unless you tell them, you will be able to see it. I can still see the tile in the bathroom being siliconed in instead of grouted where we opened it up to allow access when re-piping the house vs. the regular grout even though objectively it's exactly the same color and even the texture is close enough. I siliconed it just in case because this was the second to last extra tile, so if we ever need to open it up again, I want to be able to just cut the silicone vs. destroying the tile like the contractor did to gain access the first time. Same when I do woodworking. I will always remember/see the gap that was too wide after I cut it incorrectly and filled it in with sawdust and glue from the exact same wood. I keep a bunch of containers w/ the different wood types' sawdust for just these cases. reply conductr 4 hours agorootparentI like that it forces me to really be smart about planning out those 300 operations, plan around constraints like tool/material availability, and then sometimes even re-evaluate mid stream when you realize your plan was off a little reply dajt 8 hours agorootparentprevI do 'model engineering' which is mostly metalwork, and it's about the same. You end up with something tangible but it really hurts when you make a mistake many hours into a part and have to scrap it and start again. Especially if it's not plain old steel, so just cost a lot. You do learn to save a part from some types of mistakes but it's not always possible. I think it's great that software lets you build castles in the air and mistakes generally only cost time, and fixes or improvements can be incremental but it does get old when many projects are scrapped before being used so you feel like you're just wasting time. I find the 'no undo' and a perfectionistic streak add immeasureably to the stress of my 'hobby' but now I have finally finished my steam loco after 10 years I do like looking at it and driving it. reply iAmAPencilYo 7 hours agorootparent> ... I have finally finished my steam loco after 10 years I do like looking at it and driving it. That sounds fascinating! Could you share some more about your project? reply fho 2 hours agorootparent\"Blondyhacks\" on YouTube is currently in the process of build model steam locomotive. You might want to check that out. reply Doxin 1 hour agorootparentOr one of their previous projects if you'd like to binge start-to-finish. reply otikik 56 minutes agorootparentprev> You have 300 operations to step through and if you mess one up you probably need to start over. As long as this is a hobby and not a job, you don't \"need\" to start over. If you mess up you got a lot of very useful scrap wood for the next project. reply coffeebeqn 9 hours agorootparentprev> You have 300 operations to step through and if you mess one up you probably need to start over. Only if you’re a perfectionist. You can always adjust the plan or do some annoying work with glueing. And usually it’s one part of a bigger thing that can be redone individually. Unless you’re sculpting a giant piece of wood like marble reply irrational 8 hours agorootparentprevNow I want to see a YouTube series where they show how to the same task with different tools. Here is how we use a planer. Now we will do the same thing using a router sled. Now the same thing with some hand planes. And so forth. reply jtuente 3 hours agorootparentJonathan Katz Moses, Stumpy Nubs, and The Wood Whisperer all have different videos like that. And then there's all kinds of channels that do pro, journeyman, novice builds of the same idea, sometimes as competition. reply ajmurmann 9 hours agorootparentprev> The down side of this is that there's no undo. You have 300 operations to step through and if you mess one up you probably need to start over. This is why I love ceramics and wheel throwing in particular. It's relatively quick, but at any step something can go wrong, especially at my skill level. Sometimes you throw the same piece, apply the same glaze and it comes out quite different. It prevents you from getting too attached to any one piece and forces me towards a zen-like attitude. In some way it makes it even more a balanced to software engineering. reply mejutoco 2 hours agorootparentI really like this aspect of ceramics. Plus, before the clay goes into the kiln and is glazed it can always be recycled, so no guilt. reply wlesieutre 9 hours agorootparentprev> You have 300 operations to step through and if you mess one up you probably need to start over. I’ve heard a couple of people say that the #1 skill of master woodworkers is fixing mistakes. Keep at it and you (usually) won’t have to start over. reply bradly 8 hours agorootparentI help teach woodworking and there is a lot of truth in this. There are very few mistakes in wood that cannot be fixed. reply wkjagt 7 hours agoparentprevI spent weeks practicing dovetails with a Japanese pull saw until they fit just right. It was very satisfying. A kind of feeling I could never achieve writing code. reply exe34 1 hour agoparentprevI suppose also the table it rests on stays horizontal, the hands that hold it stay similar enough, and there's no subscription fees to the app store :-D reply hasmanean 7 hours agoprev“Those who work with their minds must rest with their hands.” Japanese woodworkers would spend the first half of the day sharpening their tools. The secret of Japanese woodworking is the steel they used…and their insistence on air dried straight grained softwoods. It helps make their precision joinery possible. It was also a technique designed for longevity so you could remove a piece from a hundreds year old temple, exactly replicate it and put a new one in. No metal fasteners meant no hidden weak spots due to rust which would fail in an earthquake. reply hasmanean 6 hours agoparentI sometimes think about how good software quality would be if we all wrote test cases in the morning and coded in the afternoon. Motorola used to have a processes something like this…write and review tests at the same time as requirements are being approved, well before any coding starts. The number of defects we’d find in final system test was very small. reply 14u2c 58 minutes agorootparentI mean test driven development is a the practice used by many organizations and individuals. reply cfn 7 minutes agoprevI don't know if anyone mentionned it yet, but a big thing is that, while woodworking, you spend most of the time standing up AND moving around. reply __MatrixMan__ 8 hours agoprevI was once asked: \"Are you a rock climbing mathematician or a cat mathematician?\". It was a joke designed to break the ice, but it turns out that 3/5 of that class were climbers, the others were enthusiastic cat owners. No outliers. I'll add software engineering and woodworking to the list. I wonder what other surprising relationships there are out there. reply cwbrandsma 4 hours agoparentAre you a woodworking software engineer or a musician software engineer? Actually, that is probably the same group. reply Sander_Marechal 1 hour agorootparentSoftware Engineer by trade.

Of course, being in Austria \"doing sports\" almost universally included climbing. Oh, and I don't have a cat but live in the mountains ;) reply mauvehaus 7 hours agoparentprevThe reverse holds too: I know more people with PhD's through climbing than any other area of my life that's intuitively nerdier. reply urthor 7 hours agorootparentBecause it's the complete opposite of being a PhD student I'd imagine. reply aleph_minus_one 1 hour agorootparent> Because it's the complete opposite of being a PhD student I'd imagine.

N.B. Never aspired to an advanced degree, but I know a lot of people with them. reply carabiner 3 hours agoparentprevRock climbing is the new golf, and tech workers are the new big shots that have replaced stodgy investment bankers. I never mention that I'm a rock climber anymore. It brands you as a techfuck these days. No evidence has been presented that woodworking is disproportionately popular among programmers. I bet if you go to some carpentry meetups you will not find a high number of programmers. Programmers are not special for having hobbies. If you talk to a non-programmer some day, you may find that they have hobbies as well, such as cooking, writing, music, and gardening. Most people have hobbies. reply aftoprokrustes 34 minutes agorootparent\"Rock climbing is the new golf\": I never thought about it in this way, but it makes a lot of sense. In both sports, most of the time is spent waiting/resting.

That's actually a remarkable statistic. reply __MatrixMan__ 3 hours agorootparentIt would've been more statistically remarkable had there been more than 5 people in that class. reply globalise83 1 hour agoprevIf you are a software engineer interested in trying out woodworking, but don't want to invest in a lot of bulky and expensive machinery, I can heartily recommend balsa glider development as fun and small-scale evening hobby. I learned how to do this in pandemic lockdown, and it is a really relaxing but also intellectually demanding form of woodwork. Basically all you need to start are two large sheets of balsa wood (2mm and 10mm), a box-cutter type knife with a very sharp blade, a cutting mat, hot glue gun with glue, and a box of A3 size laminating sheets as used for laminating paper notices etc. Total cost less than GBP or USD 100, with ongoing costs being only the cost of new balsa sheets, glue sticks and spare blades for the knife. Then you need to learn a bit about aerodynamics, where the centre of gravity of a glide should be, optimal dimensions of wings to body, etc. Then you can start to design and test your own designs, starting with something easy, and graduating up to designs with 1 metre plus wingspans. Last summer I managed to get one of my designs to fly over 150 metres from the top of a 25metre hill. Best part is that if you have a hill nearby, you can spend a nice summer evening flying it until it breaks. reply aivisol 1 hour agoparentCan you recommend some resources for glider designs to a beginner? reply reacharavindh 1 hour agoprevIn addition to all the tangible results, the thing that draws me the most to my woodworking time is the lack of abstractions. It is me, lumber and simple application of tools to get the result I imagined. No layers of abstractions to work through - everything is right there in front of your eyes. reply Jean-Papoulos 2 hours agoprevI feel like woodworking is almost an exact opposite of programming. I can run the code to see if it works and it costs me nothing. In woodworking however, \"let's cut that off to see how it looks\" is not an option most of the time. In general, trial and error is quite limited (notably due to budget and time reasons) in woodworking while the opposite is true in programming and that fundamentally changes the way you work. reply eternityforest 11 minutes agoparentIn coding the implementation is done by computers, devops, and business people, your job is pretty much like detailed planning, aka writing code. In woodworking the plan is basically trivial compared to how hard the implementation is, and does not exactly define the finished product, because there's made-to-fit steps. reply bradly 9 hours agoprevI left my dream job at Apple to pursue woodworking. If anyone is interested in dipping their toe in, I help out at a 2.5 day weekend workshop on the central coast of California where you come and make a piece a furniture with a master woodworker. We get a lot of software engineers from both the bay area and Seattle. reply michaelbarton 5 hours agoparentHow do you make a living? I do woodworking at a local workspace. It seems like the margins are pretty tight unless making very high end furniture reply bradly 5 hours agorootparentUnfortunately not from woodworking yet, but I’m hopeful. I have some rental income, some savings, and I still do some consulting a few months out of the year. Dining tables seem to be the best margins, but I don’t have enough work to do commissions, so I’m going out of pocket to build on spec. The good news is a lot of high end furniture is very simple. I good sense of design goes a long way. reply michaelbarton 4 hours agorootparentThanks for sharing your experience! That is similar to what I heard from others too. I wish you the best of luck with building the business! reply mauvehaus 7 hours agoparentprevFort Bragg? Is that the central coast?

He and his family have been great and I’ve met amazing people there. His workshops are my favorite weekends of the year, and I’m working during them, so I highly recommend it if you can swing it. reply johncessna 9 hours agoparentprevI was just looking at Esty wondering if it's time to start making some smalls to see if I could make a living off of them. reply TulliusCicero 7 hours agoparentprevWhat's the name of the workshop? reply bradly 6 hours agorootparentJory Brigham Workshop https://www.jorybrighamworkshop.com/ reply jerriep 9 hours agoprevI do baking and make confectionary, and I think it is for much the same reason that programmers also like woodworking - the fact that it is something physical that you can touch and feel (and taste, in the case of baking). Then there's the smell as well, which may be relevant for woodworking too. reply hnick 1 hour agoparentI appreciate baking since it's very algorithmic. It's typically a lot more precise than general cooking, and I love that about it. Just follow the steps, like my brain has been trained to do, except this time I am the runtime. Don't talk to me about cake decorating or any of that side of things - couldn't care less and will make a mess with a piping bag. reply felbane 7 hours agoparentprevI have never felt more at peace than when I took a weekend course for hand tool woodworking and spent the better part of an afternoon using hand planes to square and flatten stock in prep for the next day. The sounds and smells melted away everything else. reply nathantotten 8 hours agoprevThe last time I went to Woodcraft, the guy there was raving about the CNC and recommended I get one. Hard pass. Woodworking is my escape from computers. I’m sure if you do woodworking for a living a CNC is amazing, but I’ll take the slow path on this. reply ehnto 7 hours agoparentI actually quite enjoy the intersection of computing and woodworking that CNC provides. It's nice to be able to use my skills to make tangible things, but admittedly the CNC also intersects several hobbies I had always wanted to try: woodworking, robotics, electronics and metal machining. There are definitely times where I just want to work with my hands in the workshop but I have plenty to do there too, so a detour to the CNC doesn't feel like it detracts from that. reply aaronbrethorst 3 hours agoparentprevIt feels like there’s an interesting parallel to tease out between photography and woodworking for software engineers. I’m an avid and reasonably accomplished photographer, and an absolute n00b at woodworking. I own a MILC digital camera and mostly make photographs with my iPhone these days, but greatly prefer making photographs on film with medium and large format cameras. They’re not necessarily better per se, but the physical connection I get to my work from shooting on film, and then processing and printing by hand is what really matters to me. I think there’s a time and place for digital (I love being able to send photos and videos of my toddler to the grandparents in near real time), but I find making physical artifacts to be a much more fulfilling outcome than having another couple hundred DNGs to delete in Lightroom. reply fuzztester 3 hours agoparentprev>I’m sure if you do woodworking for a living a CNC is amazing, but I’ll take the slow path on this. Similar here. I do wood carving as a hobby. I could buy some carving tools, like chisels of various shapes and sizes, and a mallet or two, but I prefer to just use a knife - a normal kitchen knife, a Cartini, somewhat more expensive than a no-name brand, but still cheap. Of course, that means that I cannot create even moderately complex pieces, but that's okay. I am still a beginner at it, and I am fine with creating only simple stuff. I just do it for fun. After some time, I do plan to research some carving tools, and may buy a few if I get good advice on it, and if the tools seem to make sense for me. reply heikkilevanto 1 hour agorootparentIf you ever get to that point, by all means buy the chisels. But make the mallet(s) yourself. reply SmokeyHamster 7 hours agoparentprevTo an extent, I agree, but it depends on what you're doing. A CNC can get accuracies and scale that's hard to reproduce by hand. Also, a lot of hand tools can be very hard on your joints. Once that slippery layer on your bones between the joints is rubbed down, it never comes back and then you have painful arthritis for the rest of your life, so anything you can do to avoid grinding your hands down, you should do. reply 65 6 hours agoparentprevI loved using my CNC when I had one. Having one is the perfect encapsulation of a programmer: too lazy to doing anything tedious, automate everything. reply jstanley 1 hour agorootparentI find CNC is very much like programming: I'm too lazy to spend an hour making something by hand, but perfectly enthusiastic to spend a day getting a machine to make it. reply gedy 7 hours agoparentprevCNCs are great if you are doing creative work like carved panels, I'd never have the skill, time, or patience to do work like that. I really love my Shapeoko reply OliveMate 47 minutes agoprevOne day I'd like to get into wood carving, making little decorative figures and the like, but the lack of space + storage is currently a major roadblock for me.

I find it interesting, but I find a lot of things interesting. I also own a saw and some clamps, but that is about the extent of my woodworking reply adityaathalye 3 hours agoprevTime Ewald makes a case for \"Programming with Hand Tools\" in this talk he gave at Clojure/conj 2013. He too makes a connection with wood working. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShEez0JkOFw Summary: For most of human history, furniture was built by hand using a small set of simple tools. This approach connects you in a profoundly direct way to the work, your effort to the result. This changed with the rise of machine tools, which made production more efficient but also altered what's made and how we think about making it in in a profound way. This talk explores the effects of automation on our work, which is as relevant to software as it is to furniture, especially now that once again, with Clojure, we are building things using a small set of simple tools. reply hardlianotion 49 minutes agoprevI can't help thinking that this title would be improved by adding \"some\". reply Terr_ 10 hours agoprevThat reminds me of a satire going around, about what it would be like if carpenters were hired like software engineers. (In particular, requiring an arbitrary number of years of \"walnut\" experience.) reply Gigachad 10 hours agoparentI guess the difference is that woodworking stuff you can show pictures and videos of stuff you've made. While software engineering is often sensitive internal information or team work where the stuff you did is very mixed with what others did. reply jpgvm 6 hours agorootparentI would agree if I didn't have a reasonable body of work of either OSS software I have written or large OSS projects I have contributed to. The two together demonstrate I can make whatever I want from scratch and that I can work well enough with others to be part of something bigger. The fact I still get ridiculous coding \"exams\" etc or pointless take-homes makes me think that most of our industry still doesn't take attracting and hiring actually good talent very seriously. reply fatbird 2 hours agoparentprevYou offer \"years of walnut experience\" as if it's patently silly to do so, but woods vary quite a lot by many relevant characteristics, and if someone showed up for a walnut job having worked exclusively with maple, I'd be sceptical just because I've been learning the difference first-hand between the two. Walnut is brittle and open-grained and presents a different set of challenges than a forgiving close-grained wood like maple or birch. It's like someone interviewing for a Python position saying \"I've got zero Python experience but a lot of JavaScript experience, but how different can they be? They're both interpreted languages used for scripting and web dev, right?\" I might not reject them out of hand, but I'm going to prefer a comparable candidate whose direct experience is with Python. reply Terr_ 2 hours agorootparentIIRC in that particular example--found an HN entry but the link is dead--the applicant affirmed that they'd worked with walnut, but couldn't put a year-number to it. reply evilhackerdude 59 minutes agoprevi thought i could enjoy woodworking, but i was wrong. i attended two 1-day woodworking courses: hand tools and machine tools. i made a nice bench/stool thingy that i still enjoy daily. however, every time i work with wood, my mind immediately goes to CAD, 3d printing and wishing i had a CNC. i look at my soft baby hands (i can’t go bouldering for shit) and walk to the keyboard, create a parametric model in a notebook (build123d is great!), slice it and send it off to one of my printers… sigh reply readingnews 10 hours agoprevI did woodworking long before programming of any kind. There are some subtle but critical differences... Mess up bad in programming, you may loose your job. Mess up bad on the {table,band,radial arm}saw or jointer,planer,lathe and you may loose a {finger,limb,LIFE} Cleaning up in woodworking is pretty much required, where as in software, some one typically has to yell at you to do it. If you do not clean the table saw, or dust collector, it will stop functioning. This happens a lot sooner in woodworking than the \"technical debt\" of software. Personally, I prefer woodworking to software, but I think a lot of people romanticize woodworking or trade types of hobbies after doing software for a while. The truth is that it will take you a long time to be able to bang out one of those picture perfect awesome furniture items... and that piano level, three feet deep finish you see other people do... Yeah, tell me how easy that was to get. It is just like software in that respect. Good clean code takes time.

Here's a few comparisons off the top (WW=WoodWorking, Soft=Software Dev/Engr): * WW: must plan well. If you're working on a provided plank of wood, you can't \"uncut\" if you cut something shorter than should for example, Soft: iterative - and figure things out after some or none initial planning, and easily fix things later * WW: higher risk of fatality/injury, Soft: relatively very low risk. Low liability for artifacts produced - but could serious affect users (e.g. cybersec). * WW: expensive, non-scalable, Soft: scalable, non-expensive (unless u want expensive hardware) * WW: visceral/earthy experience almost always - even on failed pieces, Soft: depends on what you produce * WW: Tangible, Soft: Intangible * WW: Can be repetitive - planing, jointing, routing, Soft: less repetitive * WW: Creative, Soft: Creative reply hammond 9 hours agoprevI've often told people that programming is like woodworking: - jigs are like functions - stops are like constants - experience teaches you the order of operations, how things fit together - woodworkers build a lot of their own tools - custom tools are usually made by same stuff the products are - both spend time optimizing their workflow - wood is quite soft, like software! reply tharkun__ 9 hours agoparentjigs are like functions Jigs (and power tools that use them) are like co-pilot!

His room has southern and western exposure and I've been tearing my hair out trying to figure out how to make it acceptably dark in there for nap time[1]. I have essentially zero experience with woodworking, but I was drawn to it due to the practical effects of being able to solve problems I see in my home in ways that exactly fit my needs, instead of having to go with a 'good enough' off the shelf solution. Building even something as simple as the cornice had a steep learning curve, and I think my wife probably rolled her eyes behind my back more than once when I said I had to go to Home Depot yet again for another thing I hadn't expected I'd need for it, but I'm glad I persevered. The next thing I build will undoubtedly be easier to make, better constructed, and will continue to be the exact right thing I need to solve a problem in my home. [1] The complete answer here is blackout curtains with curtain rods that wrap around, the window cornice, chip bag clips to get an acceptable seal in between the two curtains. It sounds straightforward, but it was a process to get there, as I kept taking half steps that proved ineffectual as the season progressed and the room kept getting more and more sunlight. reply Prcmaker 7 hours agoprevWoodworking is one of my many non-technical hobbies, used to switch off from the world.

    "originBody": "100% user-supported February 10, 2024 · 1 minute read Why Obsidian is 100% user-supported and not backed by VC investors: We want to stay small, we don’t need to hire lots of people We follow strict principles that we do not want to compromise Our users are happy to support us, we don’t need VC money Obsidian will not exist forever, no app will. However, the files you create in Obsidian are yours, and can hopefully last for generations. VCware is built with a five year horizon, it is not built to live on for decades. Many startup founders raise VC money because they need the upfront capital to build their product, or they see it as a shortcut to growth. For some products the capital truly is necessary, but too often it’s fueled by impatience and the inertia of Silicon Valley. In the short term, VCware tends to subsidize pricing to acquire users. It’s easier to grow if your product is cheap or free. But this generally comes at the cost of hoarding user data, and locking in customers. Once you’re in you can’t get out. To keep raising money, VCware must paint an increasingly enormous vision of their future, which becomes impossible to live up to. This leads to increasingly disparate priorities that gradually make the product worse. What starts off as a useful app becomes burdened with crap. Eventually all VCware must exit. That means being acquired or going public to pay back investors. It’s expected that 9 out 10 startups will fail. That’s just part of the math in a VC portfolio. The startups that have big exits pay for the ones that fail. It is now possible for tiny teams to make principled software that millions of people use, unburdened by investors. Principled apps that put people in control of their data, their privacy, their wellbeing. These principles can be irrevocably built into the architecture of the app. Principled people have always been able to make principled software. The difference is that now you need far less money and far fewer employees to reach far more customers. That wave is only just beginning. If you have principles and enough patience, being 100% user-supported is by far the most fun way to build.

Of course it will be a bit awkward here on HN due to somewhat obvious reasons but hopefully elsewhere the term becomes used. I think one thing that royally pisses me off even more then an initial VC backed launch is a seemingly stable, premium product going from \"user-supported\" to accepting VC funds (eg: Bitwarden). Just the absolute worst. Now I know I have to deal with this migration away for the whole family at some point in my (probably near) future. reply Sytten 9 hours agoprevI am 2.5y into a bootstrap business (proxy alternative to burp suite). We are not nearly as successful as obsidian, but we managed to hit 30k$ ARR. Honestly if I didnt have a contract on the side with high pay and low hours I would not be able to do it. Even with that if I compare what I would make as a full time dev I am not sure I will ever break even. I used to judge/lament VC backed software, now I understand. Wish there was a third way, but it doesn't really exist. There could be with gov subsidies, Canada gives a looooooooot of money to business just not small ones (sucks to be poor).

Shoot your shot. reply lmeyerov 14 hours agoprev+ this It was super painful transition for Graphistry. Certainly as a founder responsible for payroll and having only so many hours in a day. Likewise, as business where people in serious gov, enterprise, etc teams are making mission bets on our team, it is both enabling & stress-relieving to know that we can prioritize listening to our customers more than what we think the next funding round's VCs need to hear. It's been night & day launching our new genAI analytics tool louie.ai: this time around, we've gotten to work entirely based on customer design partner feedback & revenue, vs next round VC funding pressure. Still major pressure given who our customers are etc, but of the positive kind. We haven't taken further fundraising off the table. Importantly, this time around, if/when we do an A, it can now be very much on our terms, and in a way we feel won't unnecessarily jeapordize our customers & team. As always, context matters. If a company is making $500K in month 3 because the founder is selling back to his old F500 buddies, or it's an n-th time serial founder who VCs line up to burn $100M on no questions asked, or it's yet another Cisco spin-out-and-in, sure. Likewise, we've been figuring out sustainable growth, and that changes a lot.

The difference is that now you need far less money and far fewer employees to reach far more customers. Absolutely.

You have to have a vc/crowd/self funded runway just to be able to attempt to get the critical mass for 100% user supported software. It can take years to build the product and customer base. Everyone has to eat. Not everyone can do it nights and weekends while they have other income, or hit the career jackpot and save it all up front. Congrats to them though for living the dream! reply kepano 12 hours agoparentI have explored just about every way to build and fund a company, including the VC route. The 100% user-supported path is by far the most fun (to me). reply dtkav 11 hours agorootparentYou and the Obsidian team been a huge inspiration to me. I love how the principles of File-over-app, user-funded, and private-first can align your incentives not just with the user, but with what feels soul nourishing to actually build. It seems like there's an art to targeting a niche market segment that VC funded companies won't be able to compete in because the \"gold vein\" isn't large enough to support the hypergrowth and expected returns. OTOH if you plan to keep your team small then you can just set up shop and stay lean. I've been building a product that integrates with Obsidian (hopefully ready to share soon), and it has been the highlight of my career to design and build software with these principles and to not be worried about balancing misaligned incentives. Thanks for building a great product -- I'm super happy to subscribe and support y'all.If you have principles and enough patience This is what I've been struggling with for the past few years but recently, have come to the conclusion that success WILL come, I just gotta be patient and keep making regular progress.

The stuff in the blog post sound great, so as long as the code is open and modifiable by users, I might take a look. reply Yujf 15 hours agoparentIt is not open source. But because you are just editing markdown, you should not get locked in (however it does have some features and plugins that will not work anywhere else...) reply input_sh 13 hours agorootparentEven when they step away from Markdown, like for example the canvas feature (https://obsidian.md/canvas), they make sure to build it on top of JSON files instead of inventing a more proprietary format. Does any of the competition use it? Not that I'm aware of. If Obsidian disappeared tomorrow, could anyone reasonably replicate it? Yes. If you don't want to pay for sync, you have other options. If you want to publish your notes, you have other options. Technically you need a subscription to use it for commercial purposes, but they have no way of enforcing that, plus there's a carve out for freelancers and for those like me working for NGOs. The point I'm trying to make is that not only are they user-funded, but all of their revenue comes from the most optional subscriptions you're gonna find in a for-profit product. reply mateusz_ 15 hours agoparentprevYep, like Notion. The main difference is that it stores all the data in text files on your drive/repo reply Macha 15 hours agoparentprevIt's a markdown based notes app. They do have Obsidian Publish which is a static site publishing/hosting tool from the notes that you could use for docs, but honestly I'd suggest something more explicitly designed for multi user for a documentation use case. reply hammond 11 hours agoparentprevYou might like Joplin or Logseq, which are open source. I hope one day the folks at Obsidian will make it FOSS. I don't think it will negatively affect them at all. reply bearjaws 15 hours agoprevIf Obsidian went VC or public it would be enshittified in 5 years or less. reply Lariscus 14 hours agoparentThere is no guarantee that they wont do any of that in two weeks and since it is closed source you are basically forced to accept the enshittification or have to switch to another product. This is the reason I haven't tried Obsidian yet. I will never use another closed source note taking app again. reply kepano 14 hours agorootparentFor portability and durability of your data I find that \"File over app\"[1] is more important than open source. These are all separate vectors: - VC vs user-supported - Files vs databases - Open formats vs proprietary formats - Open source vs closed source - Extensible vs non-extensible - Private vs privacy-invasive An open source app can still be VC-backed, store its data in a proprietary format, have terrible APIs, and include telemetry. 1: https://stephango.com/file-over-app reply Lariscus 13 hours agorootparentGood point, I want both. The app should use files and be open source. reply lynndotpy 11 hours agorootparentprevI feel similarly, but this is specifically why I chose Obsidian, I've been a big Markdown/LaTeX user for years, and I jumped from vim to StackEdit to my own Nextcloud instance, and I've happily settled on Obsidian for the past 1.5 years. In each instance, my notes were pure Markdown files backed by a simple file system. I was able to bring my hoard of Markdown notes with me. As a bonus, I think there are a lot of technical Obsidian users who are ready to jump ship at the slightest whiff of shit. If Obsidian were ever bought out, I'd expect the Logseq contribution graph to go hockeystick shaped. reply sircastor 14 hours agorootparentprevIt’s interesting to me that a competitive open source platform hasn’t really shown up. I know it’s all markdown, but given that it’s closed source. Open source people love to make competitive open platforms. reply dtkav 11 hours agorootparentI am a huge proponent of open source software, but there's something to be said for building a sustainable lean business that can employ a handful of talented folks to work on continuously improving the product full time. It's hard to compete with that. reply adhamsalama 15 hours agoprevWould be nicer if it was open source, like SiYuan Note. reply inferense 15 hours agoprevnext [9 more] [flagged] robocat 8 hours agoparentPlease always disclose you are part of the team whenever you mention acreom. Just putting \"building https://acreom.com\" in your HN profile/about is not enough. reply kaoD 15 hours agoparentprev> acreom is VC backed, and doesn’t implement any of the mentioned practices ...yet. In typical VC fashion it will totally respect the user forever (wink, wink) until they want to actually cash out. PS: would've been a nice touch if you disclosed acreom is yours. reply borski 15 hours agorootparentBeing bootstrapped doesn’t somehow absolve founders of that. It’s a false sense of security. VC-backed companies eventually exit, yes, but bootstrapped companies often just… die. And, plenty of VC-backed companies do not commit the cardinal sins described in this article; lock-in, anti-user practices, and so on. I ran a VC-backed cybersecurity company for nearly 10 years, and we never engaged in any bad-for-the-user chicanery, and our VCs never pushed us to. This is an article to promote Obsidian (which is fine, and I have on my list to try) but on very shaky ground. Being bootstrapped, in and of itself, does not somehow imply Obsidian will be around longer or less crappy to their users. It’s entirely about the founders and what they prioritize; not how they got their funding. reply ghufran_syed 14 hours agorootparentbut I think the point is that by being \"100% user supported”, the way to get rich is by getting more paying users by “making things people want” vs optimising a metric like “growth” in order to temporarily fool the next investor into overpaying at IPO or acquisition. reply borski 9 hours agorootparentThe way to get rich if you’re VC-funded is also to make things people want by getting more paying users. You don’t become Dropbox or Stripe by having a terrible product. The fools optimizing for “growth” without anything sustainable aren’t going to get rich (on average), and are focused on the wrong customer - the VC. VCs don’t force you to do bad things. Bad founders do bad things, and they sometimes raise money. That’s all. reply wmf 12 hours agorootparentprevSadly it's common to make things (not enough) people want and still run out of money. reply inferense 15 hours agorootparentprevyou’re right, disclaimer: I am the founder not unless these values are provided by technical decisions over policies or promises. in acreom’s case, you own the software as well as your data and there’s not much we can do about it since we built it that way (local-first, offline with optional sync, e2ee, markdown without any acreom specific formatting) reply lmeyerov 13 hours agorootparentUntil the founder gets tired, replacement CEO gets hired, and with VC board encouragement, sells to PE or BigCo who switches the defaults 18mo later. Users get the choice of dead, CVE-riddled software or following the company's structure. Conversely, with a less misaligned board & company structure, a friendly hire (e.g., internal) can take over and the board stays aligned. Ex: Mozilla. Protecting this is super hard...

However, many editors can accomplish the same goal by highlighting or changing the text colour of todos. reply globular-toast 1 hour agorootparentEmacs package for that (highlights others like FIXME etc): https://github.com/tarsius/hl-todo You could make it have the outline thing if you tweak your theme. I wouldn't start installing or hacking your fonts to get this kind of stuff. reply pie_flavor 4 hours agorootparentprevFira Code supports stylistic sets, so you can actually configure whether == and === (and != and !==) do that, and leave weirder ligatures out of the defaults. In VS Code, for example, you would change editor.fontLigatures from true to \"'ss08'\" to make them still ligate together, but with breaks between the = signs. I use ss06 to make backslashes faded when they're used to escape other characters. reply IdreesInc 11 hours agoparentprevGlad you like it, I've never seen it in a font before so I am unsure if there are any others that add it in. I've definitely appreciated the ligature as I use the font, but I did wonder if others would find it annoying reply lifthrasiir 7 hours agorootparentI do think it's a better use of ligatures, and I generally dislike most ligatures in coding fonts [1].

I think he’d really like this. Thanks for sharing it. I really like the TODO and NOTE ligatures. I have been using Comic Code for a couple years now and kind of wish it had those. reply andai 11 hours agoprevLooks way better than I expected from the title. The vectorization did wonders. I think I saw a similar font in a HD Minecraft texture pack. I wanted to suggest a RuneScape font, but it would probably be too skinny. reply t_mann 11 hours agoprevJudging from the one screenshot example, I actually like Monocraft better. It really has that nice Minecraft/retro look, and I think this could actually help get kids who are into Minecraft into coding. That being said, I actually still like Miracode better than most typical IDE monospace fonts (at least as a novelty). That's really cool, where did you learn to make such designs? reply michaelcampbell 7 hours agoparentSame for me, but I grew up and mostly learned my earliest programming on 8-bit machines so the monocraft style is way more in my burned synapses. reply crazygringo 15 hours agoprevI applaud the attempt! That being said, I sadly do not find this to be particularly \"readable\". The choice to introduce octagonal-style 45° segments rather than normal rounding makes it quite difficult for me to read. The worst glyphs for legibility for me are \"r\" and \"p\" -- you've actually increased the size of the diagonal segment that connects to the stem, compared to diagonals on letters like \"o\", which really throws off the forms for me, and doesn't seem to be inspired by anything in the original font. If anything, rounded connections to stems in fonts tend to be reduced rather than exaggerated. (As in the font used by HN, Verdana.) I wonder what this would look like if you used curves rather than introducing octagonal corners, and didn't exaggerate the connections to stems? Keeping in mind that curves usually do things like extending slightly beyond the baseline or at the top. reply IdreesInc 15 hours agoparentThanks for the in-depth comment, it's definitely been a balancing act trying to determine how to handle things like the diagonals/curves. I originally made things more \"curvy\", but it made the font look similar to comic sans or other handwriting fonts for some reason. Perhaps a sharper curve algorithm would avoid this, though the \"angular\" look does make this font into something a bit more unique than the other programming fonts available. reply crazygringo 15 hours agorootparentHappy to help! Font design isn't easy, but it's very rewarding. You might look at the famous Eurostile font which does a kind of \"rounded rectangle\" style of curves which might work well here. One more note -- I think this font actually works great as a display typeface. The octagonal angles and exaggerated stem connection give it a ton of personality, and display typefaces used for headings, titles, packaging, etc. are where personality is more important than readability. So I think you've produced something really cool -- just not necessarily as a coding font! reply binary132 12 hours agoprevI dunno if you're going to get away with calling it a \"Minecraft font\". reply dinkleberg 7 hours agoprevI've installed it and am enjoying using it so far, nice work! reply politelemon 15 hours agoprevHow is that \"TODO\" done in the joined up way? reply xxr 15 hours agoparentIt’s a ligature defined in https://github.com/IdreesInc/Miracode/blob/main/src/ligature... reply politelemon 15 hours agorootparentOh neat, makes sense now that you've shown.

The best decision I made was to make a unit testing system for the font, so hopefully that'll make things easier for people in the future. reply Solvency 16 hours agoprevLove the font but wish you'd share your custom algorithm. I've designed a number of pixel fonts in the past I'd love to convert to strokes in this way. Any chance you'd release a little conversion kit? reply IdreesInc 15 hours agoparentDon't worry, it's completely open source! Miracode is a fork of my other font \"Monocraft\" which is under the GPL. As such, Miracode is also GPL, and the font files themselves are under the OFL. Since it's a fork, there are a few extra files that are not actually executed which may be why you aren't seeing the algorithm. Check miracode.py for the script that generates the font! No promises that it'd work on other fonts though, the \"algorithm\" was made over a weekend and as such could definitely use some optimization. On the bright side, I did include a unit testing system which might help others convert fonts in the future. reply Solvency 14 hours agorootparentAwesome, thanks. I'm only versed in JS and Lua and all of my pixel fonts are basically glyphs on a big sprite sheet of 32x32 pixel grid cells. How difficult would it be for me to simply patch what you've started to work off something simple like bitmap data to export a TTF of converted vector data? reply lifthrasiir 7 hours agoparentprevI've done so in the past and I believe it's not much different from usual pixel-art scaling algorithms. At some point though you would want more control over which corner should be sharp or not, and that resulted in my own semi-bitmap font with a subpixel handling [1].

I use a cloud server instead and Radarr/Sonarr combined with Real-Debrid(to download torrents) and Usenet to download content. I have a 16TB server on which I have downloaded all movies with IMDB rating > 6 and a good number of votes. This allows me to run Plex/Jellyfin on my TV and stream.

For example, 4K is clearly more enjoyable on my 40 inch ultra wide monitor with good color gamut. And good quality 4K, not something ultra compressed. reply jjeaff 12 hours agorootparentI get TV shows in 720p and movies in 1080p. On my 75 inch TV, it's hardly noticeable unless I do a quick switch back and forth between a 4k and 1080 source of the same movie. reply globular-toast 12 hours agorootparentThat's the thing. I can totally tell the difference between 1080 and 4K. But not once have I been watching a 1080 blu-ray and thought it would look better in 4K. reply SahAssar 12 hours agorootparentprevLets say you want the IMDB top 500, most of those will not have a scan that is better in 4k than 1080 or even normal DVD (480p).

And 1080p os faster at everything: downloading, playing, streaming… reply LeonenTheDK 13 hours agorootparentprevThat's kind of what I'm thinking, after getting my 4k HDR TV I was blown away by the filesizes needed to make full use of it. Just the most popular stuff and limited to 1080p or less though... Yeah 16Tb is pushing it. reply globular-toast 12 hours agorootparentprevInstead of telling someone they're wrong you could just assume they mean 1080p. If we're talking 1080p encodes you can totally do it in that size. If you're using 73TB for barely a collection you're just wasting space. reply k4rli 11 hours agorootparent>50GB/movie remuxes do look great though. I wouldn't say a waste of space. Storage is cheap anyway and getting big bitrates is also satisfying. This seems like the FLAC vs 320kbps \"debate\" where people claim to not see any difference, except with movies it's a much more noticeable gap between average and top quality. Also the compact versions rarely have enough channels and bitrate for a good speaker setup. reply globular-toast 1 hour agorootparentIs it? If the guy has 73TB of storage let's say it's 6x 16TB disks (one redundant). Looking at Seagate IronWolf NAS disks that would cost over 2k.

I would have imagined the torrent framework would be agnostic to the actual file encoding. reply ashconnor 8 hours agorootparentTo clarify it works better with big files vs small files. Compression has no impact. reply appplication 8 hours agorootparentIs that just efficiency (per byte, etc) or would the network actually work better (faster real downloads for larger files vs smaller)? I’m imagining there’s some tradeoff at some point. reply Cyph0n 13 hours agoparentprevIt’s quite amazing how much you can do with a working self-hosted setup and a decent amount of storage. The open source community around self-hosted services is stronger than ever. A few of my favorite lesser known self-hosted projects are Audiobookshelf, Komga (comic/manga reader), and Kavita (ebook/comic/manga reader). reply GaryNumanVevo 40 minutes agoparentprevI have a similar setup (32TB NAS + Jellyfin). I use three different Radarr instances (1080p/4k/Anime). Every movie that I've liked on LetterBoxd gets downloaded automatically in 1080p / 4k (1080p for streaming outside my home). Jellyseer allows me to give access to friends and they're able to request stuff easily that's not on streaming. I also use Infuse on AppleTV which has support for Dolby Atmos / Dolby Vision.

I expect many other \"hoarders\" are in a situation where what they are actually trying to do is provide a good discovery experience for others where it is not entirely clear what they would want.

Admittedly, I haven't been in the shiny round disc game for more than a decade and a half, so maybe they bumped up the bitrate for 4K content??? According to Sony[0], up to 100Mbps is supported. This is just way higher than anything I had ever played with, and find it difficult to think that HEVC would even need that bitrate.

There's no reason it should require an installer package when it can be distributed as a self-contained app. I'm not giving authorization to an unsigned installer file made by some anonymous Russians. reply ojosilva 12 hours agorootparentIt would be interesting if Github here could put a green check next to the release files certifying they were entirely built from the sources in the repository that link to a corresponding ref/tag SHA. \"No external files involved in the build\". Obviously this would only be possible if the release files were built by GH Actions and the environment was a special one, absolutely sealed from the open internet that GH would certify, filter and curate. Still, this would not prevent some shady file in the repo or build hack to go unnoticed, but maybe it could become a starting point for delivering safer binary distributions from open source projects. reply NotPractical 13 hours agorootparentprevThe \"unsigned\" part isn't surprising, considering Apple would never approve it. But the installer package is far from ideal. It's typically only used when a program needs to install a privileged helper service, and I don't know why Popcorn Time would need that? Edit: It appears to be just a .app file? Unless the .pkg is bundled in there... reply GeekyBear 13 hours agorootparent> The \"unsigned\" part isn't surprising, considering Apple would never approve it. Apple doesn't have approval rights when you distribute Mac software outside their App Store. Signing just requires that you have a developer certificate and pass a virus scan. reply NotPractical 12 hours agorootparentJust based on the Apple developer documentation, it appears that you're correct: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizin... I was actually surprised not to at least see \"your app must agree to abide by some basic terms of service\" on the list of requirements. It seems like a mostly automatic system. At the same time, I would also be surprised if Apple were explicitly alerted by Hollywood lawyers of the fact that an app like Popcorn Time was endorsed in any way by them, and they didn't proceed to revoke the signature. reply jrockway 12 hours agorootparentI kind of doubt it. Right now Microsoft is paying money to distribute it to people (Github). Code signing is not really any stamp of approval from an \"app store\" type agency, it's more of a self-certification thing. It's similar to TLS on the Web; Let's Encrypt issuing a certificate says \"Let's Encrypt checked that the website was able to receive traffic for the named domain on the issuance date\", not \"Let's Encrypt wishes that it made this website itself!\" reply nick_ 15 hours agoparentprevThe homogeneity of a JavaScript codebase has a tenth the half-life of an \"enterprise\" lang/framework.

The big libs have been pretty stable for the last decade though, even if the ecosystem itself feels quiet messy, likely because there are so many interested parties, each having their own ideas of how it should be.

I do not wish for it to be shut down again, but I hope people realize that every popcorn time user is one less qbitorrent user that accidentally leaves their client open in the background. I have a theory that most seeding is done by people who are unaware they are doing it or don't even know what it is. Tech like webtorrents, clients for portable devices and this are harmful to the network in the long term. reply palata 12 hours agoparentUnless they bring new users that would not normally use torrent and that happen to participate while they watch their movie? reply CamelCaseName 15 hours agoprevPopcorn Time is back? reply hbcondo714 14 hours agoparentI guess it “returned” a couple years ago, as discussed heavily here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31972681 reply denuoweb 14 hours agoparentprevThe code never went anywhere. reply freefaler 14 hours agoprevStrem.io + plugins + real-debrid.com beats the old and the new popcorn time reply xtracto 9 hours agoparentI use stremio with some torrent plugin. I've read about debrid , but don't really get it's advantage. Is it mainly to avoid being identified as torrenting by authorities? So if i live in a torrent friendly country it doesn't matter? reply plastic_bag 8 hours agorootparent> Is it mainly to avoid being identified as torrenting by authorities? So if i live in a torrent friendly country it doesn't matter? It's not just that. Streaming from an proper server always beats streaming from P2P connections. The former is much faster to stream, forward, and rewind, making the whole streaming experience better. Especially when watching 4K content or old movies with relatively less number of seeders. reply swat535 5 hours agoparentprevAdditionally you can use Infuse if you are in Apple ecosystem and use their AppleTV app to watch everything on your TV! Just setup Infuse with Real Debrid as WebDAV and you're set, you can even get the subtitles downloaded! reply Jonovono 12 hours agoparentprevAmen. Keep spreading the gospel.

I think popcorn time is some kind of application for watching movies, but beyond that, I don't understand many of the comments in this story. I was into torrents 20 years ago, but I have not kept up with it. Currently, I get my movies from Netflix, and nowhere else, and I'm basically happy with that. Judging from internet comments, I might be the only one. reply dylan604 14 hours agoparent> I get my movies from Netflix, and nowhere else, and I'm basically happy with that Mr. Hastings, is that you? The Netflix library has become so small and full of crap, that I find it hard to honestly accept that anyone could be satisfied with that alone. reply recursive 13 hours agorootparentI exist, and I'm not paid by Netflix. You learn something new every day. reply dylan604 12 hours agorootparenti'm happy for you. i personally, and i know i'm not alone, feel like the Netflix service is no longer near the value it was. Before, it was cheaper and had oh so much more content. Now, it is much more expensive, less content and of less quality. So, you can continue being happy with it if you truly are, but do not think those of us that have been long time subscribers that we're the strange ones reply recursive 12 hours agorootparentNo, I think I'm the strange one. I can't remember the last time I saw someone say Netflix is satisfactory. I've been a netflix subscriber since before it offered streaming. It used to be better. But I still like it. reply andsoitis 13 hours agorootparentprev> The Netflix library has become so small and full of crap, that I find it hard to honestly accept that anyone could be satisfied with that alone. 260 million paying households around the world disagree. In last quarter alone, 13 million new households started subscribing. https://apnews.com/article/netflix-fourth-quarter-results-vi... reply yur3i__ 13 hours agorootparent260M households does not equal 260M satisfied with Netflix alone. Almost everyone I know with Netflix also has at least one, if not both, of Disney+ or Prime Video reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentThanks for confirming that I didn't imply something that the GP read into it. They posted numbers like they were well informed, but conveniently left out of those numbers that you pointed out had more than 1 subscription that you've pointed out. I just didn't think this was something that needed to be pointed out in an honest conversation, and would only be needed by shills for Netflix reply andsoitis 7 hours agorootparentYou said that the reason people don't subscribe to Netflix alone is because the library has become so small and crap. Your thesis is incorrect. Nobody ever only got their TV and movie entertainment from a single source. If you pay attention to consumer sentiment with respect to video streaming services, you will know that the #1 thing streaming subscribers value is original and exclusive content first. https://www.fool.com/research/state-of-streaming/ No studio has a monopoly on exclusive and original content. reply dylan604 7 hours agorootparent> Your thesis is incorrect. How much Disney content is now on Netflix? Gotten smaller. How much Paramount content is now on Netflix? Gotten smaller. How much WB/HBO content is now on Netflix? Gotten smaller. please, show me where my thesis is incorrect. Netflix was the only streaming site which meant ever studio used them for streaming, plus they also had their shiny round disc service. Now, Netflix is claiming they want to get to 100% only their content which is just PR spin because nobody else will license them content. If you think they have more content now than they have in the past, you are sorely mistaken. Arguing the point just shows your lack of honesty. I no nothing about the \"poll\" you link to other than they did not ask me. I don't care about exclusive content produced by the streaming platform. I care about the depth of the content available. The streaming platform fragmentation has pushed me away from caring about ANY of the platforms. Cutting the cord from cable providers was meant to be a cheaper solution than paying for the various cable packages. Now, there are so many streamers that must be paid for separately, they add up to the same as the old cable providers people were wanting to \"rebel\" against. Nothing has changed for the consumer's wallet. It's just cutting out the cable middleman, and now going straight to the studios. reply andsoitis 6 hours agorootparent> Now, Netflix is claiming they want to get to 100% only their content which is just PR spin because nobody else will license them content.

Can you tell me about your self and what you do so I and others can better contextualize your comments? reply sbarre 13 hours agorootparentprevNetflix's US catalogue is not the same as many international markets where they are still the only game in town and have the streaming rights to much more stuff. reply imafish 12 hours agorootparentprevI am a paying customer. Mostly due to my kids enjoying a lot of their stuff. It used to have a decent amount of content for me - but as time went, I just found less and less interesting content and now I no longer bother to even browse Netflix. reply ogurechny 12 hours agoparentprevThere is a giant market for one-click piracy solutions for the technologically illiterate. It's actually the same market on which legal services operate. Their competitors are streaming sites, various pay-to-pirate services that promise to do your work for you, and applications that combine torrents coming from popular catalogues with covers and descriptions from general purpose services into a nice interface. Choose a movie, and downloading starts in the background without the need to figure anything out. The latest and greatest Hollywood hits always have peers, and the rest does not really interest the general public. Because the users self-select for laziness and blind trust, it's a perfect feeding ground for malware operators, just like “system optimizer” and “system cleaner” applications are. Clients like “Zona” or “MediaGet” can sometimes be seen in torrent peer lists, and it's a common joke among tech support crowd that if one of those is installed, for some reason, the system always has malware to clean. Of course, the only “official” version may not display any unwanted behavior — at least initially — but there are 50 other sites in the search results with totally not suspicious installers. The other thing is there is no “deep learning” here. Authors do not scan ALL the available torrents and figure out which is which, they simply use metadata filled in by users in catalogues. Those are the same torrents anyone can find and download. reply squeaky-clean 14 hours agoparentprevIt's a torrent client that is able to download the torrent file sequentially, rather than in random chunks. Meaning you can stream a movie torrent instead of the old-fashioned method of needing to wait for the entire thing to download before you can watch. It's a combination torrent client and media player. reply ogurechny 12 hours agorootparentAny decent torrent client (apart from Transmission?) has had sequential downloading for years. It was never a unique feature of those idiot-oriented wrappers. reply EasyMark 5 hours agorootparentWell it combines website lookup + bittorrent client + viewer. If you're happy with apps that you use for that then popcorn time doesn't really bring anything to the table except the all-in-one solution. reply shpx 13 hours agorootparentprevIt also shows you a list of movies, shows and anime in the app and lets you search for one without having to go to a separate website. reply alpenbazi 15 hours agoprevNice, project resurrected? reply diimdeep 14 hours agoprevcloc Popcorn-Time.app/ 16195 text files. 11358 unique files.5044 files ignored. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Language files blank comment code --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- JavaScript 6015 106427 177209 638087 JSON947 36 0 214754 Markdown 964 42676 224 101002 YAML9 19 20 97485 CSS46 6016 985 88269 SVG2557 0 17 43048 TypeScript 581 2481 78577 37547 Amazing reply alecsm 15 hours agoprevJust yesterday I was thinking about Popcorn Time and now I see it here. reply krembo 14 hours agoparentCan you think of my bank account having 30m$? tnx reply dylan604 14 hours agorootparentReminds me of the Little Johnny joke about \"I need a bike!\" reply alecsm 14 hours agorootparentprevI got you. reply edm0nd 15 hours agoprevIMO just join a private group and use Plex. You'll never have any ISP woes/issues. reply forevernoob 14 hours agoparentAs long as private trackers have absurd seeding rules and require you to sign up (initially) without your VPN active, I won't be touching them with a ten foot socket. reply kevincox 14 hours agorootparentFrom what I have seen about published seeding rules most trackers as switching to pretty reasonable rules. Typically the only major sin is not seeding for a minimum length of time (usually a few days). Then there are ratio rules but these are typically assisted by bonuses for long seeding even with no downloads and freeleach for new and popular torrents. There are still a few trackers where the site ratio stat is zero-sum but for the most part this isn't the case. As long as you do make content available you will not be punished. reply Cyph0n 13 hours agorootparentThe challenge is twofold on “elite” private trackers: 1. Getting into the tracker requires ratio proof from other reputable trackers. 2. Freeleech becomes less common, which makes maintaining a >1.0 ratio difficult without a seedbox and IRC based tools (eg, autobrr). reply satvikpendem 14 hours agorootparentprevGet a seedbox and set it to seed indefinitely, you solve both problems at once. reply Cyph0n 13 hours agorootparentprevI think they mean join a group that uses a shared Plex server.

Then on a server in my house I sync the files locally with syncthing and run plex locally. Jellyfin is another similar app to plex but it’s open source and while promising is not quite there yet for what I want out of a media app. reply 14 15 hours agorootparentprevI know reddit had censored and shut the sub down but in past I used r/plexshare. You probably could just search for one on yandex or something. Google sucks for a search like that. The problem I had with plex was it can at any moment be shut down. Plex is actively looking for those sharing services like this and shutting them down. Then it would be offline from anywhere from 1hr to 12 hours. Usually pretty quick but more then one night I sit to watch my show and it had been shut down. I used a site called all media access I believe and they charged $10 a month. It was however with it in my opinion. They have since moved off plex and on to something like iptv but I just am not with them anymore so don’t know the details. But if I was you check out all media access. reply atif089 13 hours agoprev [–] Popcorn Time app takes ages to load even on my 5600X.

(cbc.ca)167 points by thunderbong 8 hours agohidepastfavorite490 comments atomicnumber3 6 hours agoAnecdata: I am 31 and have 3 young kids. They have 0 cousins and, on top of that, 0... second cousins? Cousins-once-removed? Whatever the one is for my cousin's kids. My kids are my grandma's only great-grandkids. And I have... 6 cousins. On top of that, at my last job, on my team of 15, I was the only one with kids, and only 1 of those 15 engineers were under the age of 30. At my current job, my team is 8, and again we're all about 30, and nobody is even thinking about kids at all. It baffles me. And it's also a bit inconvenient that nobody else at work has such pressing obligations, it makes me feel bad (though not too bad at this point) that I *have* to log off at quittin' time, sharp, to go relieve my wife of some childcare and make a family dinner. reply bongodongobob 5 hours agoparentYou're baffled people aren't having kids?

Edit: the replies - y'all are out of touch. Visit an average family in the Midwest with a household income ofThe avg American is completely priced out of owning a home right now. You haven't disproven this statement in any way, you've just linked to some statistics that show we can still afford rent. reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentNo, I'm not. I'm citing the numbers in the table entitled \"Quarterly Homeownership Rates for the U.S. and Regions: 1964 to Present\"* (emphasis added). That table is talking about homeownership rates, not householdership rates, and the definition they give is this: > Homeownership Rates. The proportion of households that are owners is termed the homeownership rate. It is computed by dividing the number of households that are owners by the total number of occupied households (table 5 and 6) Here's the table: https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/histtab17.xlsx And for the benefit of others, here are the definitions: https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/definitions.pdf * EDIT: I was also citing \"Homeownership Rates by Age of Householder: Fourth Quarter 2022 and 2023\", which is likewise about homeownership reply hmcq6 3 hours agorootparentThat table doesn't break things down by age. Just own it dude. You pulled the \"49% of people aged 30-34\" thing from this chart https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/qtr423/tab7.xlsx or some variation of it and you misunderstood it. reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentSorry, I just updated my links to include the citation for the age breakdown, which is in fact the link you linked to. Note the title of the chart you linked to (tab7.xlsx): \"Homeownership Rates by Age of Householder\" (emphasis added). This is percentage of householders who own the home that they are the householder of. EDIT: Also, while I'm at it, here's \"Homeownership Rates by Age of Householder: 1994 to Present\" (again, homeownership), which shows a 39% homeownership rate under 35 years old, which is about the same rate as it was throughout the 90s. It broke 40% in the 2000s for a while before coming back down, but was never higher than about 43%. https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/histtab19.xlsx reply hmcq6 3 hours agorootparent> This is percentage of householders who own the home that they are the householder of. It is not. It's a ratio of homeowners in an age group to the number of renter households in that age group, which is kinda a useless statistic. To explain why it's a bad metric take this real (but simplified) example. My roommate and I share a \"household\". Lets pretend that besides my roommate and I there is only one other person aged 30-34 in the US and they own a home. The Homeownership Rates by Age of Householder chart would say 50%. 1 owner household / 2 total occupied households. Now if you read that chart and take it to mean that there is only 1 homeowner and 1 renter, you would be misunderstanding what the statistics mean. There are more renters than homeowners in our example but the metric doesn't reflect that because it isn't meant to. reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentThis is a fair argument and as late as it is I don't have a reply—you're right that there are limitations that I hadn't considered, and I'll have to look at the numbers more closely to figure out what they mean *. However, I want to note that this represents a sudden change of pace from your original \"49% of us are homeowners or renters\" and \"you've just linked to some statistics that show we can still afford rent\". When you misunderstood the situation, you insisted that I \"own it\" that I was wrong (when I wasn't). It would behoove you to do so yourself instead of pretending you understood the numbers all along. * Edit: as an initial thought, I'd argue that the same argument often applies to the homeowner number—my wife and I jointly owning one house balances out you and your roommate. reply hmcq6 2 hours agorootparent> you insisted that I \"own it\" that I was wrong (when I wasn't) Don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining. You said \"49% of 30 to 34 year olds and 58% of 35 to 39 year olds owned a home in Q4 2023 [2].\" And your anecdote is not unexpected at all, but come on dude. You're really gonna try to pick at my ELI5 example with anecdotes? Anecdotally, my (otherwise) homeless ex also lives with me. Anecdotally, most of my friends rent with 3-4 roommates. Anecdotally, none of the single people I know own a house, a few of the couples do. But annecdotes don't mean anything objectively. Why don't you go meet some people age 30-34 and ask them what their experience is? How can \"49% of 30-34 year olds own a home\" in the same US where 6 out of 10 people don't have a spare $500? How can everything be fine in a world where health.gov is warning us \"*Due to a limited rental market with few affordable vacancies*, people with the lowest incomes may be forced to rent substandard housing that exposes them to health and safety risks, such as vermin, mold, water leaks, and inadequate heating or cooling systems. They may also be forced to move in with others, potentially resulting in overcrowding. Overcrowding is defined as more than 2 people living in the same bedroom or multiple families living in 1 residence. Overcrowding may affect mental health, stress levels, relationships, and sleep, and it may increase the risk of infectious disease.\" Do you think health.gov is warning us because it's just a couple of guys living in overcrowded housing or do you think this might be a bigger issue? https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/suze-orman-explains-why-most... https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-deter... reply kenjackson 3 hours agorootparentprev> 49% of people aged 30-34 aren't homeowners, 49% of us are homeowners or renters. Wait, this is saying less than 50% of people aged 30-34 live in a home that is owned or rented by them (or their spouse)? I can't imagine a region where this is close to true, since probably near 100% where I live either own or rent. Is there a regional breakdown for this? And where do these people live? With their parents or in a shelter? reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentThey're wrong, they got confused because the header column on the data is labeled \"age of householder\". This is because the data is the ratio of householders who own their homes to total householders, broken down by the age of the householder. The title of the tables I'm looking at are \"Homeownership rates by Age of Householder\", which makes it pretty clear what they mean. https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/qtr423/tab7.xlsx https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/histtab19.xlsx reply hmcq6 2 hours agorootparentprevIf two or more people rent the same \"household\" (house, apartment, couple of rooms) they are only counted a single time. 1 homeowner and 1 renter = 50% 1 homeowner and 2 renters in the same apartment = 50% 1 homeowner and 200,000 renters in the same apartment = 50% 1 homeowner and 2 renters in 2 different apartments = 33% It's a ratio of homeowners to the number of buildings the rest of us rent out. reply naniwaduni 1 hour agorootparentprev\"Homeownership\" rate is a bit of a misnomer, since it's the proportion of occupied housing units which are occupied by their owners. Homeownership by age of householder restricts the reference set of housing units to those which are occupied by a householder in the specified age group. reply hayst4ck 2 hours agorootparentprevHome ownership rate is a poor statistic to make the point you are attempting to make, particularly because homes are \"bought\" with debt. Saying someone can \"afford\" a home because they are in one doesn't speak to being able to afford a home or not. Government programs to promote home ownership by taking riskier debt is an even more complicating factor. That was at the core of the 2008 financial crisis, IIRC. https://www.longtermtrends.net/home-price-median-annual-inco... Here is a statistic that is a better measurement of affordability: \"Home Price to Median Household Income Ratio.\"' It shows homes are less affordable. If we could see the 25th percentile it would likely even paint a bleaker picture, at least if you believe those stats. reply voidfunc 4 hours agorootparentprevHN has a blindness for the vast land area of America that isn't The Bay Area, NYC, Seattle, Boston, and a handful of other insanely expensive locations. Home ownership has probably plummeted in those markets (I don't have the data) but it leads to certain types of comments being passed around as fact. The narrative on Twitter/TikTok that every Millenial and GenZ is starving to death and on the brink of being homeless is really exhausting. reply vlovich123 2 hours agorootparentThere are also people who pretend like problems highlighted in the Bay Area and other metropolitan cities are unique to them. Yet every time it looks like those are just the first wave of the changes that are heading to other regions first. Like the wave of homelessness. People made fun of SF, then it spread to the broader Bay Area, then LA, then other parts of the country. Turns out the effects of income inequality and how it impacts housing are rippling through the US. While it may be too doomer, it’s worthwhile to listen and understand the struggles of people who aren’t you to understand what’s coming.

The algorithm has turned (some) people into whiners and doomers. It really sucks to watch them take defeatist attitudes on everything in life. I see lots of these young 20-somethings on Reddit thinking their lives are over. It's absurd. They have their entire lives ahead of them, and all it takes is one break into a career. They even think climate change is going to \"kill all of us\" before they're elderly. That's not even what the science says. On the topic of having children, though - people aren't having kids because they're choosing to focus on themselves. There are ten times as many forms of entertainment today as there were in the 1980s, and people can endlessly consume content in their hands. You can go glamping at a music festival, post it on Instagram, and hook up with new friends and romantic partners you meet. All incredibly easily. Our culture has become built around experience and consumption. I know people in their 40s that are partying, going to clubs and concerts, doing bar crawls, cruises, visiting abroad, jet setting, and climbing the corporate ladder while living incredibly active lives. They don't want to give up their lifestyle to suddenly have to raise children. reply Defletter 2 hours agorootparentIt's wild that, not too long ago, you could afford a house and a car on a single income as a mailman. That is unthinkable today. We understand there are ways to be successful, but it's like that saying: anyone can be successful, but everyone can't. I know a lot of people who spend their money on experiences because they genuinely believe they won't get a retirement, so they might as well enjoy their life while they can. I'm part of this group. I don't think the world will literally be over by then, but the future looks bleak. We've also been drilled from birth that you should never have a child if you can't afford it, and people are taking that advice to heart. And because you can't afford your home on a single income anymore, more and more parents are having to rely on childcare, which is itself expensive. The issues are just compounding. If you just want to believe that everyone is too enamored by their phones to procreate... that's your prerogative, but yikes. reply namdnay 51 minutes agorootparent> It's wild that, not too long ago, you could afford a house and a car on a single income as a mailman.

Expectations for quality of life were lower, sure, but the problem of not being able to find a place to live anywhere near your family or job, that is relatively new and getting worse. > in a handful of countries, for a few skin colours, for a couple of decades. fueled by burning cheap fossil fuels taken from poorer countries Also: I know it's trendy to make everything about skin colours these days, but that's a distinct USA-ian bias. The rest of the world doesn't work that way. I won't argue against exploitation of poorer countries as that, indeed, was a big theme in the last century or two. However, note that whatever many hard problems people in those poorer countries have, affordable housing isn't one of them. reply Duanemclemore 1 hour agorootparentprev>mailman Is a bad counterexample, as that's still a good, high-paying (union!!!) job. But aside from that tiny gripe you're not wrong about the rest. reply atoav 2 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who is doing well financially I don't think you found the reason. The gist of it is: There are worlds and circumstances into which people want to bring kids. We mostly failed to create that world and those circumstances. If tou want to know what a solution looks like look at western democracies with high birth rates. E.g. France, Ireland, New Zealand, Denmark. The rest is probably due to individualism. Kids cost time and energy and capitalism tells us we should live our best lives. And the best live does not involve herding 6 kids, even if they are your own. We created this world willingly, and the low birth rate is a consequence — and so is the need for migration if we wanna stay wealthy. The thing is: now that the genie is out of the bottle we are not gonna be able to force people to have kids. We can just create circumstances in which they are willing to. I am in my 30s and I am unsure if I will ever be able to retire. I am sure however that I will have to change my job and career multiple times throughout my life. Despite me being financially well off, I am not sure if I would be able to support kids in the future. This is not about being whiny. I just think if I had kids it is my responsibility to throw them into a world that can sustain them. This one can't. reply dmurray 1 hour agorootparent> We mostly failed to create that world and those circumstances.

Those countries all have a fertility rate [0] almost identical to the US - three of them are lower if you look at 2020 figures. All of them have been relying on immigration [1] to maintain their demographics, with various levels of backlash in recent years. The US is still ahead of all but Ireland on that immigration list.

People with inner desire to procreate will spread themselves, people without it won't. Pro-natalist cultures (e. g. orthodox jews) will procreate as well.

That doesn't mean those with mortgages aren't struggling to pay. Also if true, that is insane that the average american lives in a home that they own by the time they're 35. That is so far and wide not the case here in Australia. Here in Australia, we don't have fixed rate mortgages for the life of the mortgage we have variable and fixed upto around 1-5 years. Our interest rates have gone from around 2-3% to over 5.8% and the value of homes since COVID have gone up enormously, some 30-40% across our cities and nationally combined 27%. I know we're just talking about the US here I assume, but I earn a chunk above the average salary and I be considered \"at risk\" in affording the average cost of a home. I know plenty of people who bought their house 3 years ago right when COVID kicked off, of which they would not have been able to afford it today given the increase in just house prices. reply skissane 3 hours agorootparent> Here in Australia Australia has made a bunch of home-ownership-unfriendly decisions which the US hasn't – e.g. in the US you get a mortgage interest deduction on your primary residence, in Australia you only get it on investment properties (joint filing for married couples, which the US has but Australia doesn't, also helps here); in the US owner-occupier mortgages are normally no-recourse, in Australia they are almost always full recourse; US government policy encourages long-term fixed interest mortgages, the Australian government has no comparable policy Some of it is also geography – Australia is very centralised, with most people living on the coast. Each state has its population dominated by a single metro area which also serves as the state capital – quite unlike the US where majority of the time the state capital is outside the state's largest metro area. Australia's comparative lack of rainfall inland is a factor, but political culture, and hence decisions by politicians, also plays a big part – suppose NSW moved its capital to (say) Dubbo or Bathurst? Many government jobs would leave Sydney, followed by many consulting/etc jobs which provide services to the government - right now, central and western NSW has plenty of affordable housing, but a big shortage of jobs providing incomes to pay for that housing. Never going to happen: it would require a degree of originality and thinking outside the box of which Australian politicians are constitutionally incapable. reply NoPicklez 2 hours agorootparentSome of those things I agree with, however the issue was primarily sparked during COVID like in many countries. Houses prices were relatively affordable prior to COVID and increases in inflation. Australia kept its record low interest rates in place during COVID, then we had runaway inflation to record high’s like many countries did and our reserve bank failed to increase interest rates even slightly to help with the increases to inflation. We increased overseas migration significantly to help drive growth in the economy which has created an enormous shortage of housing supply. As a result, interest rates have soar’d coupled with record high inflation our cost of living has skyrocketed including housing prices. As I said since 2019-2020 house prices have increased 30%+ Our country has always been centralised to the coast and isn’t necessarily the reason for these costs reply skissane 2 hours agorootparentPeople have been complaining about housing affordability in Australia for years. I remember endless discussions of it, media articles about it, and feeling its pain myself, 20 years ago. No denying it has gotten worse, but it was already rather bad. That said - we bought our house (NSW Central Coast) in late 2015 for AU$550K. At the peak of the COVID price surge, those property value websites were saying it was over AU$1 million. Now they are saying it is only AU$850K. Still gone up a fair bit compared to when we bought it, but also fallen a fair bit off the peak. Of course, those websites are not completely accurate, but what they say is consistent with sale prices of comparable properties in our neighbourhood reply NoPicklez 1 hour agorootparentThat’s fair enough. Complaints are valid, I do feel that things have become too unaffordable. I lived in a rental which was sold in 2019 for $580k and I remember people thinking that was high, now that house is worth $760k. Looking at suburb medium prices skyrocking in only 3 years does put a dampener on things reply hnick 1 hour agorootparentprevReminder that Dubbo (population of only ~40,000) had to have water shipped in on trucks during the recent drought, so there are valid environmental reasons for the current layout too. A lot of those cheaper places are struggling, they cannot support large populations, and it's been said we've used up the good topsoil over the last 200 years so farming may be facing some issues in the coming years too. I do think we should decentralise, but it will likely look more like Newcastle and Wollongong growing, which will probably feed commuters into Sydney more than they already do. Also note, Canberra kind of fits your description - a regional \"town\", servicing the government. And it's also very expensive. As in, recently reported to be the second most expensive place in the country to buy a house, after Sydney. I think our issues are far more political as you point out, so other fixes are just bandaids, but anything that impacts home prices will be unpopular with the dominant voter bloc. reply sjy 3 hours agorootparentprev> that is insane that the average american lives in a home that they own by the time they're 35.

Every industrialized nation is going through the same phenomenon and not all of them are having housing crises. It's a combination of various associated costs to raising children (housing, early childcare, food, schooling, extracurriculars, hobbies, etc.) that have risen faster than most people's wages. The nuclear family model also significantly diminished the role of parents and other senior relatives in early childcare which would've created significant savings in terms of both time and money. Also, living without children or even a partner at all has become significantly more viable in the past 40+ years or so. It wasn't until 1974 when women in the United States could unconditionally open bank accounts out of their free will: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Credit_Opportunity_Act. To not marry and have children would've practically been a form of ostracization. So many people, especially women, \"settled\" into marriage and family life simply because there was no other option. I think the decline in birth rates is a fair tradeoff to forcing fewer people into a lifestyle they did not want which would inevitably result in broken families and broken kids. What society needs to figure out is how to decouple productivity from raw human headcount, as well as how to avert potential humanitarian disasters that may occur when the decoupling happens. reply ImHereToVote 26 minutes agorootparentThe only economic metric that has a strong correlation to declining birthrates is hours women work for a salary. reply caturopath 4 hours agorootparentprevI think this is very confused. People these days are really rich compared to people in the past who had more kids, poorer people in countries like the US have more kids on average than richer ones, and poorer countries on average have more kids than richer ones. (People don't seem to have fewer kids because they're poor; they seem to have fewer kids because they're rich!) Despite major housing issues, people live in bigger, fancier houses than ever, homeownership rates in the US are higher than most of the history of the US, and homelessness, though tragically common, still only directly affects a tiny minority of people, on the order of a fifth of a percent, which is not the sort of thing that seems very connected to the widespread change to having fewer children. reply keiferski 3 hours agorootparentYes this is my read too. It’s largely a cultural problem, not a resource one. The baseline expectations have gotten so high that not have a giant house and the latest electronics means you somehow can’t afford kids. reply brailsafe 2 hours agorootparentIf you're responsible for yourself in either the U.S or Canada, and have built some kind of a life as an adult in a place that isn't right next to where your parents still live, assuming they're still together, then children are an expensive liability rather than necessary and relatively cheap labor used for supplying the rich ones with chocolate. Likewise, access to free in or inexpensive birth control and sex education allows a person to make less risky decisions for longer, rather than popping out 5 kids and figuring it out. If you can figure out a way to afford the liability and it's important to you, great, otherwise it's sort of illogical. reply keiferski 2 hours agorootparentIt’s a liability only if consumerism is your only value. Which for a lot of people, is absolutely the case. And it’s only logical if you only care about your own individual desires. It almost isn’t worth arguing about, though, because the reality is that society is ultimately made up of people that have kids. All the rationalizations in the world won’t change the basic facts of biology. reply debok 1 hour agorootparentI completely agree with you. My wife and I made many lifestyle \"sacrifices\" in order to have kids. I put \"sacrifices\" in quotes, because driving in a cheaper car than your professional peers is only a sacrifice if you you are consumerist. reply brailsafe 1 hour agorootparentprev> It’s a liability only if consumerism is your only value. It's a liability if it's a liability. A consumerist liability is buying a brand new car with a loan if it seems like my income might disappear before the payments do. Not knowing how long you'll be able to keep paying rent in the place you've spent your entire adult life is just a logical consideration. Though people are obviously choosing to be consumers too, often it's just the basics that seem out of reach. However, if you've always wanted kids and it's always been your biggest priority, and there's never been any contravening forces that would make you question that, and you've lucked out and found someone who's completely on board with that, and your income has been stable, and your expenses are manageable, and your parents are nearby and still together, then sure you're choosing to consoom over having kids. reply keiferski 1 hour agorootparentYour last paragraph kind of highlights the point of my previous comment though, which is that the vast majority of people who have children today and who had children in the past had few or none of those things, and were absolutely fine with it. This is a modern hyper optimization of, “I can’t have kids unless they have the absolute perfect life situation.” At the end of the day, it is a cultural “problem” that potential parents are unwilling to have children. If anything, the material costs of entertainment, food, education, etc. are magnitudes lower today than a century ago, and yet a century ago it was normal to have 3-4 children. reply kelnos 37 minutes agorootparentA century ago it was also normal to have two pairs of parents living near you to help with childcare. I don't know how common it is today, but it's certainly much less common than it was a century ago. I've decided not to have kids, but quite a few people I know have been having them, and there's a stark difference in costs between the friends who have family nearby and those who don't. Several new parents I know even decided to move to be near at least one set of parents, at least for the first few years of their kids' lives. I don't really know anyone who has decided to not have kids primarily because of cost, though. But I don't know if the child-free people I know are typical. reply dale_glass 47 minutes agorootparentprev> At the end of the day, it is a cultural “problem” that potential parents are unwilling to have children.

Curiously, the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child was from 1924. Yeah, it's easier to have kids if you care less about their wellbeing, and if one of the ways of dealing with the expense is sending them to work in a factory. reply keiferski 42 minutes agorootparentI'm not sure how to respond to comments like this, because they obviously aren't made in good faith. Potential parents today aren't choosing between \"having kids and sending them to slave away in a factory\" and \"perfect childhood with every toy imaginable and no financial need.\" The contemporary Western world is immensely wealthy on a material and informational basis, orders of magnitude beyond even a half century ago. I don't think people understand this at any level, mostly because they don't know much history. reply The_Colonel 34 minutes agorootparentprevThis is crazy. Kids born today will have the best material, educational, medical wellbeing in the whole human history. reply sangnoir 1 hour agorootparentprevIs daycare \"consumerism\"? Other factors include stagnant wages, collage debts, amd even high medical costs - a vaginal birth with no pain medications and no complications can cost 5-figures (and may include a line-item for a parent holding the baby!). Inflation has made baby products really expensive (did I mention stagnant wages?), and this is before daycare, which can be cost as much as rent in some locales, unless you're willing to subject your child to informal daycares. None of that is consumerism. No one should be surprised that a country with a threadbare social safety-net and inflation outpacing childcare costs experiences a fall in birthrate - this can be explained in market-dymamics terms reply graemep 25 minutes agorootparentThe same thing is happening in all western countries, and some other developed countries too.. Even those with free university level education, free health services, etc. Here in the UK we have the free healthcare (and maternity provision is still good), we do have university fees in most the UK, but the costs are far lower than in the US (fees are an order of magnitude lower than at some US universities, and there are cheap loans to cover fees and living costs). We have government subsidies for childcare. We still have falling birth rates. I actually think daycare is part of the problem - what is the point of having kids if you do not spend lots of time with them? The biggest advance would be more family friendly working hours. i have earned a lot less to spend time with my kids, and i am so happy I did. The best thing that happened to me was to lose my job the day my oldest was born. Otherwise I would have been very well paid (I worked for an investment bank) but have hardly known my kids. reply keiferski 1 hour agorootparentprevPlenty of countries with good social nets have worse birth rates. Plenty of other countries with no social nets have high birth rates. I don’t think it’s particularly related, and as I said, I think it’s more of a cultural problem related to values and expectations. reply ako 2 hours agorootparentprevThat was also concluded by Hans Rosling: the higher the education of people, the fewer kids they have. Best way to address overpopulation is by increasing education worldwide. https://www.teesche.com/bookshelf/hans_rosling_factfulness reply Biologist123 1 hour agorootparentI wonder if Rosling’s conclusions are confounded.

But then wonders what the drivers are. reply afarviral 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, this seems obvious to me. However, out of ethical concerns, it is not obvious that the solution is to stop educating people. Perhaps just reminding would-be parents that if the educated and resilient stop reproducing, they are depriving the world of a thriving and resilient new generation. A clear directive that under-population is a growing concern and a few additional incentives for parents would go a long way too. Taking a philosophical angle, why is it the \"right\" choice to serve our genes, the economy, or to create a younger generation to care for the elderly? It is not unethical to unburden oneself of those obligations today, but you can imagine a future where it is. reply beltsazar 2 hours agorootparentprev> Edit: the replies - y'all are out of touch. If you're in the minority, maybe you're the one who's out of touch? It's not that they can't afford having children—many of those who are less fortunate than them still have children.

Raising kids is hard work. Ideally you have them young and live close to your family so that you have grandparents to help with childcare. But our society tells people to wait as long as possible to have kids, and to prioritize career over other things - so once people do have kids, if they ever do so, then often grandparents are too old or far away to fill that traditional role. So lots of people are stuck paying thousands a month for daycare. Just one of many ways that our system finds innovative ways to extract money out of people for things that used to be free or part of being in a community. reply dukeyukey 48 minutes agorootparent> and live close to your family so that you have grandparents to help with childcare. Issue with this now is how concentrated certain industries are. Here in the UK, if I want to work in software, you need to move to a handful of expensive cities. London, Oxford, Cambridge, maybe Bristol or Manchester. Certainly not the rural farming town I grew up in. So people move away. And now I'm faced with either delaying kids so I can get reasonably set-up in a city where a 500sqft flat costs £300,000 or moving away from all my friends and maybe even further from my family to afford a house. reply bowsamic 1 hour agorootparentprevEvery support system, from the \"family home\" where the grandparents have a bed, to the woman not working and taking care of the kids, has been systematically destroyed. Now everyone is expected to work and live alone/as a couple, and they have basically no physical support for raising a child. reply jimbob45 1 hour agorootparentprevRaising kids is hard work. I would bet this plays a large part - people today respect the difficulty in a way past parents previously did not. Birth rates are certainly declining but I would bet the rates of accidental infant/toddler death are down as well. That said, I personally know parents that are just taunting SIDS with the way they ignore infant sleeping best practices even though they’ve read the books to know better. reply The_Colonel 24 minutes agorootparentSocietal expectation on the care for children grew immensely over the past few generations. When I was a child, parents largely just covered the physical needs and the kids were otherwise left alone to do their own thing. I remember being bored a lot, sitting in a room or roaming the streets. Nowadays there's a widespread expectation that parents should organize activities, drive their kids' education, just be way more involved in their lives. reply auggierose 59 minutes agorootparentprevThat's just the thing, isn't it. You can try to oblige to all best practices and have zero kids in the process, or you can just have the kids and figure it out as you go. No matter the kid mortality rate, the second approach still wins. reply kelnos 22 minutes agorootparentprevI could absolutely afford to have children, but have chosen not to. The main reason is that I just don't feel \"called\" to be a parent. When I think about (and see, from others I know who have kids) the amount of work, and complete shift in lifestyle, it takes to raise a child, I get completely turned off by the idea. If I had a kid, I'm sure I'd love them, and derive joy from them, but I don't believe the trade off is worth it. Maybe I'll end up being wrong about that, but I'd rather grow old and regret not having kids than regret having them. I think people shouldn't have kids unless they are really sure they want to be a parent. Anything less sounds like a big mistake. Anyhow, have you actually talked to your childless peers about this? Hopefully there are at least some with whom you feel comfortable bringing up this kind of topic, with people who will give you a thoughtful, non-judgmental answer. I think you might find that they all have a variety of reasons for not having kids, and money may not be a big factor. reply jwells89 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is where the difference between affordability and safety come in. Obviously someone making that much could afford to have kids, but assuming tech hub (e.g. SF) cost of living, it’ll take a few years of salary like that to accrue enough financial padding to be certain that a chain of unfortunate events won’t put them out on the street once the cost of raising a family is added in. This is why you see a lot of high earners waiting until the last second to have kids, if they do. Financial security like you have while making good money without kids is hard to let go of. reply voidfunc 4 hours agorootparentprevI just don't have any interest in kids. They're expensive and they require a ton of sacrifice. I'd rather travel, golf, do hobbies and generally enjoy my life. The only people that seem to want me to have babies are my parents so they can have grand kids... too which I've told them \"Thank you for having me, but that's not a valid reason for me to sacrifice my life\".

I don't want people who are self-selecting themselves out of the future having any say in what happens for my children. It's fine that you don't want kids, enjoy the golf course I guess. But in general I will discount your opinions to zero on anything else of consequence. reply nyokodo 3 hours agorootparent> I will discount your opinions to zero on anything else of consequence I’d settle for a much higher tax rate for the voluntarily childless to very inadequately offset the lack of contributing to the next generation. Probably the best way to implement this is that the child tax credit should be much bigger. reply card_zero 2 hours agorootparentI'm impressed by the idea that it's even possible to stop people in general from having kids. In 1974 there were 4 billion people, and we were worried about overpopulation, with scare stories in the media on the theme of \"standing room only\". Now we are 8 billion, and worrying about low birth rates, even in China (see the \"lying flat\" trend). So, get back to me when we're down to 4 billion again and I'll consider supporting financial incentives to support future human life, but right now I don't see an existential threat from low birth rates. I do however think that it's really cool that people have the capacity to refrain from having kids when they know that it's a bad idea in their specific circumstances. I like this because it shows the malthusian overpopulation doom-mongers to be wrong, and they were getting annoying. reply remarkEon 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah the child tax credit should be doubled or tripled, that's one option. reply kalaksi 2 hours agorootparentprevThat kind of already happens in countries where government monetarily supports families with children since it's tax money. But the effective difference in taxes isn't probably that large. reply lordnacho 40 minutes agorootparentIt's just peanuts compared to having one less job for a while. Maybe that is what to do, give tax credits on the order of an income. That way you are basically tax free while having young children, but you'll still want a job when they are a little bit older. reply retrac98 3 hours agorootparentprevThis makes no sense. Why shouldn’t someone who’s going to live in a society for several more decades have a say in how it operates? reply remarkEon 2 hours agorootparentIt makes perfect sense.

Why should I listen to someone who only cares about their own gratification? reply kelnos 7 minutes agorootparentWow, that's a pretty extreme interpretation of all this. Like a sibling poster, it reminds me of all the religious people who claim that atheists can't be moral because we don't have a god to guide us. I do have skin in the game, even without kids. On a basic level, I care about the rest of my life, which hopefully will last another 50 years. I care about the planet and about future generations because that's the right thing to do, because short-termism and excessive consumption is a cancer. And even if I won't have kids, I have nieces and nephews, and I have dear friends who have children. I want them to be able to grow up and live in a good, safe, comfortable world. Frankly I find your point of view profoundly condescending and insulting. You don't need to have children to care about the future. GeneralMayhem 2 hours agorootparentprevThis strikes me as not dissimilar to religious people who are terrified of atheists because, without God, they must have no reason not to become mass murderers. There are many people with kids who have revealed the value they place on the sustainability of the environment, democratic society, or the economy through the lifetime of their children, let alone their children's children, to be zero. Why would you assume that the childless are any more selfish, as a group? Why can one not care about the continuance and betterment of humanity without one's own direct descendents being involved? reply lordnacho 47 minutes agorootparentprevI think I would word it differently, but I more or less agree. Skin in the game is important. Particularly with people who are old with no kids, I don't think they are totally cynical, but they do seem to have an incentive to vote society into schemes where they are taken care of by younger people, at no cost to themselves or their descendants. For instance they could decide the government needs to take out a massive 30 year loan to pay for care homes to be built. But I also think that just because you have kids, that doesn't mean you're completely aligned with a longer term future. There's going to be a lot of desperate older people needing help from the few young people who are left, and that goes regardless of whether they made any of those young people. I mean sure, if you have kids you are less likely to be as short-termist as a childless old person. I think it's a major issue that doesn't get talked about enough. People are happy to say \"oh but plenty of old people care about society\" which is true, but there's also plenty of foreigners who care about society, who can't vote. And it ignores the actual problem that we will be facing, which is that there will be fewer working people supporting older, non-working people. We need a system for equitable power sharing between generations. reply retrac98 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat makes you think people without kids only care about their own gratification? Can’t they care for others that aren’t their children?

People who don't have/care for kids don't have long-term skin in the game, therefore their influence on the shape of future society should be downweighed. There is a logic to that. > some guy who's condom broke Yes, this is how a lot of families are made. Unplanned != unwanted != unloved. > or a rapist are more moral than someone who is infertile Again, not about morality. GP's logic isn't about whether one's good or bad, but whether one has skin in the game of continued improvement of society and civilization. But I guess a better way of scoping it is whether or not the person is a parent (EDIT: or in legal terms, caregiver?). Infertile people can become parents too (and that could be an indication of extra special caring about the future generation). And then people can be biological parents, but not actual parents, e.g. if they give their child away. reply auggierose 55 minutes agorootparentBut the definition on \"skin in the game\" varies from person to person. Plenty of people with kids don't consider them as skin in the game. Plenty of people without kids have lots of skin in the game. reply malermeister 49 minutes agorootparentprevI can't care about the future of my nephew? Or screw that, I can't just want to leave the world a better place without any ulterior motives? reply TeMPOraL 23 minutes agorootparentSure you can. The parent was describing a heuristic they apply. If I don't know you, but need to quickly judge whether or not you're likely to care about future over immediate-term, you being a parent is... not the worst proxy I could use. FWIW, I don't exactly agree with the poster on this. I feel that parents are biased towards near-term almost by definition: caring and nurturing children is an immediate job. Whether or not a typical non-parent is likely to be a \"fuck you, got mine\" kind of person, I find that parents tend to become more of a \"fuck you, my kids got theirs\" kind of people. Not out of ill intent - just more of \"concrete needs of my kids today trump abstract speculative needs of their generation a few decades from now\". kelnos 5 minutes agorootparentI think it's a bit more than that. The person upthread goes a bit farther than just whether or not someone cares about the future or not. It sounds like they've basically judged all childless people as hedonists who would gladly burn down the world as long as we get in one last round of golf. Maybe that person doesn't really believe that, but if so, should probably be clearer about their position and not resort to veiled personal attacks.

Those in the middle are stuck because having children is a net negative to the continuation of career advancement, especially women due the unavoidable need for parental leave. The commitmments required to raising children, especially newborns, will disrupt travel plans which is a significant component of the typical middle class lifestyle.

Selfishness implies another party; if the kid doesn’t even exist, what is selfish? reply conductr 4 hours agorootparentI'll speak as someone that waited until almost 40 to have kids and who feels, in hindsight, I was being completely selfish. I prioritized my career, my travel, my sleeping in, my social life, my leisure, etc. As soon as you become a parent, you realize you shorted yourself and your kid shared time on earth together. I also just don't have the energy or physical ability to play like I would have at a younger age. It's not something you can really grapple with or consider the magnitude of as a childless person purposely avoiding/delaying it. I don't think it's necessarily intentionally selfish in the moment, as you're living it, but later sometimes you get to reflect back and see your decisions as what they really where with the clarity of hindsight and you'll understand what you really did. It's a weird thing that happens and I think part of the whole \"wisdom with age\" thing. I think I was just being selfish. All the travel and me stuff I did in my 20s-30s is not really very important, my identity as a parent to the humans I created is my identity now, It's the only part of my identity I really care very much about.

It's alright if you have regrets, but I don't see it as selfish if you never intended to have kids in the first place. reply conductr 3 hours agorootparentWell, this is kind of the camp I was in. I never wanted kids, so I said and thought. I knew my wife was kind of on the fence; so I knew it was a possibility. But I was actually kind of expecting her to either A) just one day tell me she had been thinking and wanted a kid or, B) what I actually hoped at the time, her clock would stop ticking while we were busy doing us and the decision would be made due to that. We had long agreed that if we ever did do it, we'd try but if fertility was ever an issue we wouldn't pursue IVF or adoption; we'd just consider it a sign from the universe and live our lives happily childfree. But then, we (ok she) was diagnosed and overcame a huge medical issue and it had us re-evaluate our thoughts on family/life/everything in the process. Also noteworthy is that I don't project an opinion of selfishness on others; it's what I feel of myself. I can say also, now having a lot of friends that also waited for whatever reason, it's not uncommon in this cohort. It's also very common that people wait then run into fertility issues and the feeling hits harder for them. We've known a ton of people that struggle hard with that, more-so if having kids was already on your must-do list and you just delayed it too long. So to answer your question more directly, I don't think the person you described is selfish. They may however realize they were if they ever decided to actually have kids and perhaps have some regret do to that. reply ekianjo 4 hours agorootparentprevwhich reasons exactly? reply europeanNyan 3 hours agorootparentOff the top of my head: not being able to biologically, thinking that they are not able to provide worthy living conditions for the children, abuse in childhood and being afraid of exhibiting the same behaviour, having sick parents/siblings who need a lot of care leaving no time for children, not wanting to increase the burden on the planet... or just plain having the freedom of choice. reply nostrebored 3 hours agorootparentprevYou’re still completely dependent on other people having and raising children to exist.

People are just too selfish and think of kids as costing lattes and ruining their free time. Believe it or not, kids don't have to be expensive as reports have you believe. They can go to public school, wear hand me downs or walmart clothes, and eat what would have been leftovers. Most coworkers with kids I've spoken with complain about costs of daycare, babysitting, and Montessori schools. We pay for none of those as they aren't necessary. If even one parent works from home, it's a solved problem. If both do not, evaluate the costs. Many times, you actually lose money by both parents working. I have a child and we do fine on one salary. Would love more, but either my aging body or god one has determined that would be decidedly more expensive.

Alternatively you lived in a city reduced to ruins by the war, everything you knew or had is gone and you have no idea when or even if you'll be able to recover. Having a child doesn't involve as much of a concern over whether or not you can give them a better upbringing because things couldn't really get much worse in the first place. Now, on the other hand, if you're talking about post-war, the world was recovering, there were opportunities everywhere, the future was looking more hopeful. You could just have kids and trust that they'd live a more comfortable life than yourself.

And in the 50s the future was looking good in some ways, but people also lived under a visceral fear of nuclear annihilation. These are all just feelings people may or may not have.

Half the “new parent” shit is useless. Changing table?

I reckon the first cost more than $200,000 by age 5. No major medical problems That is certainly not typical. Most of the people having kids where I grew up don't even see that amount of money. They're having kids just fine. reply Spivak 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's not even the schools that have that dynamic first. Lots of daycares are sketchy as hell and they also charge crazy high prices so you can't just pay for better. You have to take time out of your day and go suss them out and dig up inspection reports. reply DavidPeiffer 3 hours agorootparentAvailability is another big issue. You find a daycare that's great for your kid and safe. Then some staff turnover and you're not thrilled with it anymore. In my area, the wait is around 18 months for a slot in a different daycare center. In-home daycare offers a lower price and some better availability, but are often unlicensed. You are best off signing up for a couple waitlists before you plan to have a kid and hope the one you choose works out well. And of course, switching childcare providers is way harder than switching grocery stores. Your kid has feelings, grows attached to the caregivers, and make friends. There's a huge risk making a switch, and you most likely can't undo it if the new provider isn't a good fit. reply echelon 52 minutes agorootparent> In-home daycare offers a lower price and some better availability, but are often unlicensed. This is the problem. You're wanting a first class experience for your kid, and this probably causes you to overlook other viable options that are less expensive. > In my area, the wait is around 18 months for a slot in a different daycare center. Wait lists? There's likely service available, you're just setting a quality threshold. > And of course, switching childcare providers is way harder than switching grocery stores. Your kid has feelings, grows attached to the caregivers, and make friends. We have de-risked our species so much that we now care about children's daycare preferences. Some other commenter mentioned spending $200,000 on their five year old kid. This is not typical. As a species, we used to have multiple kids because we just accepted that some of them would die. We are so far on the other end of the spectrum now that children are being treated as princes and princesses. Kids can be as expensive as you want them to be. People are buying their dogs and cats ridiculous things like treadmills these days, so of course it figures that some parents must be doing even crazier stuff for their human children. This is learned consumer behavior. Children are being over-invested in to a degree that some would-be interested people just aren't even bothering to get started (one of several reasons this is happening). I'm not saying don't love your kids, but it looks like having them has become a perfectionist goal that can't be reached. Accept imperfection and less than perfect. reply zigman1 4 hours agorootparentprevYou know what is also anti-child? Having parents that were completely unprepared to be parents.

That's seemed to have worked just fine throughout recorded history. My adoptive father shared an apartment with a roommate when I was in elementary school. Here I am, just fine, a self-made millionaire today. Our views around coddling children with expensive preschool are so wrong. We're living in an artificial bubble. The thing that kept kids busy and out of trouble back in the day was making them work the farm. My point is that most people make it out of the birthing regime just fine, regardless of the originating circumstances. Outcomes are distributed on some curve, as they always have been. I'm not judging people for having or not having kids. That's their choice. But we need to stop being so negative, and we need to stop blaming the economy for not having kids. --- Edit: I hit the posting limit, but I wanted to respond to some child comments. > [vecinu] That says everything about how you view the world.

Should we credit the cows and the pigs that we eat and assimilate into our proteins? The first oxygenated atmosphere? The sweat shop workers making our smartphones? The first people that died to automobiles that resulted in safety regulations? All these endless shoulders. All of this sets up the gradient landscape we find ourselves in.

What kind of bearing does your existence have over mine or my lived experiences? I'm really sorry that you feel that way that you do. I don't believe in collectivism, because in the limit that's what the universe is. Cold, and dead, and entropic.

    "originBody": "A simple web framework for Java and Kotlin Java Kotlin View documentation Why Javalin? Simple Unlike other Java and Kotlin web frameworks, Javalin has very few concepts that you need to learn. You never extend classes and you rarely implement interfaces. Lightweight Javalin is just a few thousand lines of code on top of Jetty, and its performance is equivalent to raw Jetty code. Due to its size, it's very easy to reason about the source code. Interoperable Other Java and Kotlin web frameworks usually offer one version for each language. Javalin is being made with inter-operability in mind, apps are built the same way in both Java and Kotlin. Flexible Javalin is designed to be simple and blocking, as this is the easiest programming model to reason about. But, if you set a Future as a result, Javalin switches into asynchronous mode. Educational Visit our educators page if you're teaching web programming and looking for a web framework which will get out of your way and let you focus on the core concepts of your curriculum. OpenAPI Many lightweight Java and Kotlin web frameworks don't support OpenAPI, but Javalin does (including Swagger UI and ReDoc). Learn more at the OpenAPI plugin page. Jetty Javalin runs on top of Jetty, one of the most used and stable web-servers on the JVM. You can configure the Jetty server fully, including SSL and HTTP3 and everything else that Jetty offers.

I've found it pretty easy to grok and work with. Seems right now everyone is under Spring's \"boot\", if you'll pardon the pun. reply reactordev 15 hours agoparentMicronaut has a share of the space too. https://micronaut.io/ However, you’re right that Spring Boot has the lions share of the Java ecosystem. reply adamredwoods 15 hours agoparentprevYears ago when I was investigating Spring and Java EE, I was taken aback by how much additional work was involved. Not only do some tutorials only show how to install through Java's dedicated IDE, but also deciding on which application server to use, which adds another layer of technical decisions and slows down the process of \"quickly testing\" frameworks. Javelin breaks free of that. Excellent stuff! reply StevePerkins 14 hours agorootparentIf you were \"deciding which application server to use\", then that WAS \"years ago\" indeed! The paradigm shifted, from applications being deployed to a server such as Weblogic or Websphere, to applications bundling their own HTTP server like Node or Golang. This shift happened around 15 years ago. Modern Java development looks almost nothing like it did back in that era. reply bbkane 12 hours agorootparentDo you have any good Modern Java web dev links you could drop? reply reactordev 15 hours agorootparentprev@SpringBootApplication was all you needed on top of a main class. The biggest issue is somewhere along the Spring -> Pivotal -> VMWare -> Spring hot potato, their tutorials and documentation fell off a cliff.

I hate that most Java development these days has a large component that deals with writing XML. It allowed me to focus on the code I needed to write and not figure out what parts I needed to cobble together. reply matsemann 14 hours agorootparentAre you comparing to legacy java applications? Haven't written xml in soon a decade in spring boot. reply rrrix1 10 hours agorootparentWhat do you define as \"Legacy?\" I groan every time I come across a Maven project, which AFAIK isn't quite yet \"legacy.\" What about dependecy management, testing, building, and all of the other non-java-code bits? Gradle only goes so far in my limited experience. The non-Java parts of Java development are what repeatedly get me to choose Go, Ruby, Python, TypeScript/node.js, etc. The tooling is magnitudes easier to use. Genuinely curious! Thx. (edit: typo) reply vips7L 9 hours agorootparentNot who you are replying to but I would define legacy as any project that is doing spring di and wiring the project together with XML (excluding Pom for maven building), rather than annotations or raw Java code. Or anyone still deploying to an application server. reply jmspring 8 hours agorootparentprevGo to most Spring Boot pages or examples, XML is in your face. \"legacy\"? Modern examples still push the xml injection bs. reply matsemann 0 minutes agorootparentNo, they don't. There is some xml in getting dependencies through maven, perhaps. But that's not really a huge issue. hanszarkov 7 hours agorootparentprevThis isn't factual, Spring and Boot have been 100% annotation configurable for almost a decade. The Spring documentation I read has zero XML. reply kitd 15 hours agoparentprevOne of the good things about it is that using asynchrony is optional. If you don't have to call out anywhere to build the response, processing can all stay in the handler's calling thread. If you do, you can return a future and have the library handle the async for you. One downside is that it is based on Jetty which isn't considered the most performant backend. A lib with a similar API but based on Netty is Jooby [1] which scores well in the Techempower benchmarks.

Undertow seems even faster in my testing. reply silvestrov 15 hours agoparentprevThe cookie support seems lackcluster. I'd prefer good support for real cookies instead of \"stuff JSON into a single cookie\". Also the URL parameter API is clumbersome: Integer myValue = ctx.queryParamAsClass(\"value\", Integer.class).getOrDefault(788) // validate value I would prefer some specialized API like: int myValue = ctx.queryParamAsInt(\"value\", 788); reply matsemann 14 hours agorootparentGiven that it's kotlin, one could easily make an extension function like that yourself and enhance the API to your liking. reply mightyham 13 hours agoprevSpringboot's dependency injection, auto configuration and yaml configuration system is a value proposition that I find hard to beat. I find it's fairly effortless to build almost any kind of backend software, and if I want something \"lightweight\" I probably wouldn't use java in the first place. While that's my pragmatic view, to be less critical, I am glad to see a project that provides a robust and elegant API for building rest services in Java. reply nullzzz 12 hours agoparentThe aforementioned are huge detractors for me to be honest. I find a no-magic, code-only solution like Javalin (and Express etc) far more intuitive. reply dukeyukey 8 hours agorootparentTo be fair Spring Boot can be (and almost exclusively is) code-only nowadays. None of that XML stuff you found in the early days. reply michaelcampbell 7 hours agorootparentI actually preferred the XML config, and I hate XML. Why? It was all in one spot, not spread out among the source files. It could be \"deployed\" alongside the code and not have to recompile/build. This was a bigger deal back then when \"config\" was often outside the official \"installation\" procedures that required 5 layers of OK's to put a new \"compiled version\" of an application in a production system. Not saying that was the right way to do it, but it existed. reply koufatz 12 hours agoparentprevIt's actually not that hard to beat. Quarkus proved that it's way better than Spring Boot in a lot of aspects based on open standards and battle tested frameworks like Vertx. Also on Quarkus you can use in parallel blocking and non-blocking IO and also high level declarative routes with annotations to lower lever vertx routes and handlers. reply vips7L 12 hours agorootparentYou don’t even need a framework to beat it. Pick a DI library: Guice, Avaje Inject, Weld, countless others Pick a configuration library: Avaje Config, Typesafe Config, Microprofile Config, countless others. reply owlstuffing 10 hours agorootparentThe rubegoldbergery around DI is amazing. You don't really need a DI library in many cases. A single Java SPI supplying access to all interface dependencies works extremely well. You provide a default implementation consumers can override using basic SPI mechanics. Done. reply xienze 11 hours agorootparentprevThere’s a lot more to Spring Boot than DI and configuration. reply vips7L 9 hours agorootparentOf course. But OP specifically pointed out configuration and DI as hard to beat. reply owlstuffing 10 hours agoparentprev> I am glad to see a project that provides a robust and elegant API for building rest services in Java. Alternatives for _consuming_ REST services is perhaps an equally interesting proposition, particularly since there are potentially many consumers per service e.g., the manifold JSON project[1]. Other areas where Springboot feels overbearing include JPA/ORM support. In my view this is its greatest weakness, but like the \"no one ever got fired for buying IBM\" cliche, the same can be said today about Springboot. 1. https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/blob/master/man... reply dingi 5 hours agoparentprevI find it interesting to see how would something like Javalin work if coupled with Spring DI. Throw the Spring web stuff out and use Javalin instead. Spring web always felt archaic to configure when you want to go beyond simple CRUD operations like implementing sophisticated RBAC. reply ysleepy 15 hours agoprevNowadays I prefer starting with a microprofile subset consisting of jersey+jetty offering the standard JAX-RS APIs. Is really lightweight at only 6MiBs shaded and grows opportunistically into the microprofile stack of quarkus etc. - you can even integrate the jax-rs bits into spring if you want. Microprofile has a bunch of standards compliant implementations, so you aren't locked into a specific implementation project. I think the option is overlooked because the landscape is complex and this setup doesn't have a marketing name, but it is very stable and polished. You also get IDE support, because JAX-RS is part of microprofile, and formerly part of JavaEE. reply jmspring 17 hours agoprevI used Javalin for a startup I helped with a few years back. I found It much easier and lightweight to turn up REST endpoints compared to Springboot/etc. While it may not be as featureful as Springboot, it could generate swagger specs and had the features I needed at the time. reply cryptos 13 hours agoparentIn my experience the web layer is (or should be) pretty thin, so a framework in this layer shouldn't change too much in the overall application architecture. reply binkHN 17 hours agoprevI glanced at this a while back, but, ultimately, went with Ktor. Reason being, well, I was using Kotlin and wanted something even more simple. reply BossingAround 16 hours agoprevWow, this is a blast from the past for me - I was examining the framework in 2015. Amazing to see it's still well and alive. Back then, I'd simply use some resteasy framework. reply dang 12 hours agoprevRecent and related: Spark – A web micro framework for Java and Kotlin - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39331126 - Feb 2024 (35 comments) reply vbezhenar 15 hours agoprevIf you like lightweight libraries, check out Helidon SE 4.

Worth checking out, IMO. reply kitd 14 hours agoparentNote that Javalin also supports virtual threads. https://javalin.io/documentation#concurrency reply vips7L 11 hours agorootparentSupporting and being built upon them is a bit different. Helidons web server was written from scratch with virtual threads in mind. reply KronisLV 16 hours agoprevPersonally, I rather enjoyed Dropwizard, because it had a bunch of idiomatic Java packages that most developers would have already seen elsewhere, all put together in a way that doesn't seem to have too much boilerplate: https://www.dropwizard.io/en/stable/ https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard reply waynesonfire 15 hours agoparentI'm a fan of dropwizard but couldn't get swagger to work with it. Maybe it's improved since then? reply derefr 15 hours agoprevMy API SaaS company chose Javalin for our API backend to start with, for several reasons: • it is \"just enough\" web framework for our needs, without all the bloat that a framework targeting browsers/serving HTML would have; • it has an annotation-based OpenAPI auto-summarization plugin, to allow us to immediately get some docs and autogenerated SDKs up; • and it explicitly owns the lifecycle for its components — using e.g. an embedded Jetty instance that gets started + configured in code by the framework — where you can inject config into that code, or replace it wholesale. (This is what we were used to in other web frameworks, and is unusual in Java land, where web servers seem to be separate \"background services\" that happen to start up independently in the same JVM, and then auto-discover and runtime-bind to your web service's \"background service\" through XML files the framework generates and the web server probes for. Which is a bit much when you're not running an enterprise-y \"app server\" with tons of different servlets mounted to it that can be hot-upgraded without restarting the server, but instead a single-purpose Java app in a Docker container as a k8s Deployment.) That being said, as our company grew, we eventually ran into the disadvantages: 1. Scanty documentation. The https://javalin.io/documentation page is all you get. Want, say, a list of the HTTPResponse exceptions Javalin offers? Or to know the types — rather than just the behaviors — of the getters and setters on Context? Well, too bad — go read the (Kotlin) source code! (Why no per-module JavaDoc docs? Even the hollowed-out docs that just give constants + methods, that you get by generating docs from a module with no docstrings, would be better than no JavaDoc! IDEs do give you some of the same info as a trivial Javadoc, but JavaDoc docs are a lot more browsable as a reference when you don't know the name of the thing you want, just the type.) 2. Static routes! Javalin routes must be bound to static methods of Java classes. You can't† build an object, pass the object to your Javalin app constructor, and have it bind routes to that object's methods. Which makes constructing any kind of DDD service contexts — and having them be testable, with separate e.g. DB providers in a test context — near-impossible. Javalin and dynamic Dependency Injection — the kind you do in tests — just don't get along. † Or, well, you can do that — in that you can bind each route to a closure which calls the method on the object. But those closures need to be able to bubble arbitrary checked exceptions back to the Javalin exception handler (which the trivial examples in the Javalin docs carefully avoid the need for by only calling pure code.) Which means so you can't use the syntax-sugar'ed kind of functional closure. So each route balloons into 10 lines of instance-subclass boilerplate, and your routes module is no longer a readable + greppable DSL definition of \"what your app reacts to\", but instead a big mess. 3. No support for writing Java Servlet middleware. Javalin uses servlets under the covers, but doesn't expose the servlet \"stack\" for injection. Instead, you have to write Javalin plugins (Which haven't been good for much for most of Javalin's lifetime — though they seem to be pretty flexible now, so this might not be as much of a concern if you're doing a greenfield Javalin project today.) I'm guessing that most devs still just end up just dumping all their middleware-ish concerns (auth, rate-limiting, etc) in app.before + app.after. Which thereby accidentally leaks resources — because some exceptions can cause app.after to not run! (You have to do a little dance with app.after and app.exception calling into common code — essentially \"rewriting the framework to do the thing it should have done\" — to resolve that.) 4. The Javalin devs are slow to add very critical features that tons of people ask for, sometimes leaving outstanding requests on the backburner for years. Until Javalin 6, there was no app.beforeMatched, and therefore, no request-lifecycle callback point for \"after routing has been resolved, but before actually calling the route.\" So, before recently, you couldn't do rate-limiting or auth or etc generically in middleware, while also taking the static route-name of the resolved endpoint — the string that looks like \"/account/:id/binding\" that the Javalin context gives you access to inside your controller code — into account as an input. Instead, to do this, you had to let the route trigger, and then call generic code from inside the controller (see e.g. https://javalin.io/plugins/how-to#creating-a-plugin-with-con..., which seems to show that the Javalin devs still think of this as the idiomatic way to do this.) Even with this particular feature request finally resolved, there are still several outstanding ones. And given the shape of Javalin as a framework, the way to work around these missing features, always ends up involving writing redundant generic code inside your MVC controllers. If you do this enough times — and you follow the natural desire to factor them out — then you end up basically building a framework on top of your framework! (And then, when these new features do finally come along, you're already added all this now-unneeded architecture that's very hard to get rid of.) --- A while ago, we got fed up with the disadvantages — so we're very likely going to be moving to Spring Boot. At some point. (Given the particular shape Javalin forces your code into, though, such a move is a lot of work!) reply breakpete 15 hours agoparentRegarding 2, you can actually bind routes to instance methods: var obj = new SomeObjectWithHandlerMethods(dependency); var app = Javalin.create().get(\"/\", obj::handlerMethod).start(); Edit: For 4, Javalin 6 also has some documentation regarding Servlets here: https://javalin.io/documentation#adding-other-servlets-and-f... reply derefr 15 hours agorootparentStrange — I swear this wasn't the case. I and several other devs tried for a good three weeks to get Javalin to accept such route bindings. This was a year or two ago, though. Maybe the interface type for a handler function was changed in some more recent version of Javalin? reply tip-alt 47 minutes agorootparentIt's been a SAM interface since 2017 and basically hasn't changed at all. reply breakpete 15 hours agorootparentprevNot sure about the older versions of Javalin, but from my experience with v5+ it just uses regular Single Abstract Method conversion for the Handler interface, which has a single method with just one parameter (the Context). reply TeaVMFan 18 hours agoprevThis looks useful for server-side web apps. For using Java/Kotlin in a single-page app, I've been using Flavour successfully for many years. I've written a book about it here: https://frequal.com/Flavour/book.html reply sureglymop 17 hours agoprevI don't like that the logging just happens implicitly? Like, it asks to install slf4j...

Do you run the risk of being constrained if your requirements expand? reply StevePerkins 17 hours agoparentIt's a philosophical thing. The advantages of microframeworks (e.g. Sinatra, Flask, Javelin, etc) are that as your needs expand, you can bolt-on the additional functionality as you see fit, from a \"best of breed\" selection of your favorite libraries. The advantages of batteries-included frameworks (e.g. Rails, Django, Spring, etc) are that your application is easier to find people to work on, and has a greater change of remaining coherent and maintainable for longer. In the real world with microframeworks, some rock star starts a greenfield project, and has a delightful fun time selecting their personal picks of various community libraries to bolt functionality on top of the microframework. Then that original developer moves on 6 months later. The best-case scenario is that half of their pet community libraries are no longer being maintained 12 months after that, and the team has to constantly sink time into migrating pieces of the app to other actively maintained libraries. The worst-case scenerio is that you get the next-generation rock star, who wastes time ripping out pieces for no real reason other than using their own personal pet favorites. In my experience, the microframeworks are ideal for apps where you can be fairly confident that the scope will never expand (e.g. simple Lambda functions). Otherwise, they're popular toys for startups, and nooks and crannies of large enterprises where no one's really providing any oversight over the juniors. reply the-smug-one 17 hours agorootparentIs the main advantage of frameworks then a social thing? You can depend on the future development of the framework as a whole, as opposed to a bunch of smaller libraries, so it doesn't matter if the sum total quality of those smaller libraries is greater than the framework. Does it also have the advantage of not having to remember to import things? Like, does Spring prevent CSRF attacks etc. out of the box, and it's very difficult to accidentally create a vulnerability using it? reply okeuro49 16 hours agorootparentSpring Boot uses a lot of libraries and integrates them for you to make sure they all work together. reply mattgreenrocks 16 hours agorootparentprevBig factor in rise of frameworks is outsourcing the architecture to it. Lots of devs need the prebaked structure. It is honestly helpful in many cases, but can also be a frustrating maze at times to find the hook/extension point you need. reply olavgg 16 hours agorootparentprevYes Spring Boot 2.2+ prevent csfr attacks out of the box. reply michaelcampbell 17 hours agoparentprevSure? I mean any framework will constrain you to what it provides. These frameworks usually include some set of functionalities: - an underlying service to listen for http/https requests (eg: \"web server\") - easily map inputs to code/services (\"routing\"); often also providing helper functionality to extract data from paths, map and convert JSON (etc) to domain objects - some way to inject your data into a return \"view\" (json, html, xml, ???). Might also include reusable view code snippets (eg: \"partials\"), and/or some \"design pattern\" (eg: \"layouts\") system - an ORM or other db-layer abstraction - some background job processing abstraction That's about all you need; the extent to which the framework simplifies doing those things is akin to the amount of constraints. Everything else is gravy. Do note that \"big\" frameworks that provide ALL of that plus more can often be harder to work with since you might be forced to learn more than you need, and it's overwhelming. There's also the concern of modularity... if I don't like their ORM, can I use my own? How hard is it to add functionality not provided, etc. reply andrewoneone 17 hours agorootparentTotally agree. The modularity and the amount of “batteries included” can eventually become a negative. The last thing I want is for someone to reinvent RxJava yet it seems to happen in every one of the more bloated frameworks. “Are you familiar with reactive programming? Oh cool - but are you familiar with mixing RxJava and Spring’s reactor? That’s what we now have and it’s a real treat sometimes.” This is just one sad and possibly poorly outdated example as I haven’t worked with spring in some years now. reply michaelcampbell 17 hours agorootparentI worked in a place using Django, with dozens of additional plugins and enhancements. And my PR's were routinely flagged for writing 3-5 lines of idiomatic python that any python programmer (indeed, any PROGRAMMER) would have understood instead of spending half a day to try and find the \"Django way\" (or worse, the \"whatever 5000 line plugin we installed to save the programmer from having to repeat 2 lines of idiomatic python 10-12 times\") way to do it. Their (IMO insane) adherence to the common, but misunderstood idea of DRY was insanely unproductive. These frameworks become \"languages\" in themselves, and unless you're in it all day every day, it's _harder_ to get things done due to their incredibly large attack surface. reply ahmedfromtunis 12 hours agorootparentCan you give an example of this \"Django way\" code vs pythonic code dichotomy? I'm very curious to see how that may look like. I've been using Django for years now and was never faced with such choice. reply michaelcampbell 7 hours agorootparentIt was over 3 years ago so sadly I can't. If I recall correctly a number of things I was forced to put into some sort of serializer. I'm also trying to remember what the plugin/enhancement was involved; \"Django Rest\", maybe? reply fuzztester 12 hours agorootparentprev>Sure? I mean any framework will constrain you to what it provides.

    "title": "Orbit: A Game-Changing Performance Profiler for C/C++ Developers",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/google/orbit",
    "originBody": "ORBIT Orbit, the Open Runtime Binary Instrumentation Tool is a standalone native application profiler for Windows and Linux. It supports native applications written in languages such as C, C++, Rust, or Go. Its main purpose is to help developers identify the performance bottlenecks of a complex application. Orbit can be also used to visualize the execution flow of such applications. The key differentiator with many existing tools is that no alteration to the target process is necessary. Orbit does not require you to change a single line of code. It doesn't require you to recompile or even relaunch the application you want to profile. Everything is done seamlessly, right when you need it. It requires zero integration time and zero iteration time. Orbit combines sampling and dynamic instrumentation to optimize the profiling workflow. Sampling can quickly identify interesting functions to instrument. Dynamic instrumentation results in exact function entry and exit information which is presented in the form of per-thread hierarchical call graphs. Manual instrumentation markers can be added to the source code and further allows for value-tracking. Scheduling events are also shown to visualize when a thread was running and on what core. Furthermore, Orbit visualizes thread dependencies, showing which thread got blocked or unblocked by which other thread. For AMD GPUs, the submission, scheduling and hardware execution timings of a job is visualized. Additional GPU data, such as Vulkan debug markers can be retrieved using Orbit's Vulkan layer. Memory consumption and page-fault information is visualized as well. An introduction to Orbit's key features can be found in the following YouTube video: Features Dynamic Instrumentation (no code change required) Callstack Sampling Wine/Proton Mixed-Callstack Profiling Thread Scheduling and Dependency Tracing Memory Tracing GPU Driver Tracepoints (AMD only) Vulkan Debug Label and Command Buffer Tracing (AMD only) Manual Instrumentation Source Code and Disassembly View Remote Profiling Debug Symbol Parsing (ELF, DWARF, PE and PDB) Full Serialization of Captured Data Note Orbit's focus has shifted to the Linux version. Windows local profiling is currently only supported partially and major features, such as dynamic instrumentation, are not yet implemented. It is possible however to profile Linux executables from a Windows UI instance. For Windows local profiling, you can still use the released binaries, but please note that they are deprecated and mostly undocumented. Build Please have a look at the first three sections of our development documentation. It describes how to build Orbit and which compilers, platforms, and tools are supported and needed. Workflow Note An extensive documentation of the usage of Orbit can be found in our usage documentation. The following describes the basic workflow of Orbit: Select a process in the list of currently running processes in the connection setup dialog, and click Start Session. The list of loaded modules will appear at the top of the Symbols tab. Orbit tries to automatically retrieve debug information of the modules. See here on how to load symbols for modules Orbit failed to load. For successfully loaded module symbols, the Functions tab will get populated. Select functions you wish to dynamically instrument in the Functions tab by Right-Click and choosing Hook. Start profiling by pressing F5. To stop profiling, press F5 again. You can either zoom time using W and S or Ctrl + the scroll wheel. You can also Ctrl+Right-Click and drag to zoom to a specific time range. To scale the UI, press Ctrl + +/-. Press SPACE to see the last 2 seconds of capture. You can select sections of the per-thread sampling event track to get a sampling report of your selection. Presets Once you have loaded the debug information for your modules and have chosen functions of interest to dynamically instrument, you can save your profiling preset so that you won't have to do this manually again. To save a preset, go to File > Save Preset Feedback Questions and comments are more than welcome: please open an issue.

Google has been investing in perfetto, this is different, but has some redundancy. It would would be nice to know this isn't abandonware. reply OlivierLi 7 hours agoparentUsing some scripts/parsers to take DTrace/perf/Instruments/ETW data and transfer it to perfetto was one of the most exciting moments of my performance engineering career. It’s such a powerful thing compared to every single other workflow I’ve ever used. It just shows contention in a way that so hard to see otherwise. If this tool packages some of that in an easier to use package it’s going to be a great tool for some. reply pzo 49 minutes agoparentprevat least looks like they dropping support for windows \"Orbit's focus has shifted to the Linux version.

Idiocy. reply whizzter 3 hours agorootparentStadia was dead-on-arrival (regardless of any technical merits), the uncertainty, money and amount of work required on games leaves developers skittish about unreliable platforms (or companies). Especially with something as a new techonology like with streaming games where people were more or less rightfully concerned about latency. All their product killings had already gotten someone to register the killedbygoogle.com domain on 2018-09-12 , that's a month before Google Stadia was even in closed beta. People were already joking about when they'd close Stadia when it was released. Adding insult to injury, everyone saw the absolute fuckup with the Terraria developer. You have an indie developer (that iirc was _featured_ in the Stadia promotions) who loses his work Google accounts making it impossible to work and in frustration announces that the game is dead (apparently his account and the game were re-instated but after a month people had lost track and the image damage was done). And yes, Google had some big-name contracts outside of just indies, but viability of a platform is always evaluated by it's entire scope (and iirc EA wasn't on board from day 1). Google has a huge image issue with being humanly unreachable, we accepted with when Google was a cool perky upstart with a do-no-evil creed that hadn't messed up enough yet, but it's far harder to swallow from a big company that we know are only doing it's automated account management to save money (and is so insulated that it takes a _month_ to unfreeze an account of someone that is even supposed to be your partner!). https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/18/22338396/terraria-google-s... reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentprevIdiocy was expecting game developers would blindly jump into GNU/Linux, Vulkan, with a stone age development experience versus what game console devkits and Windows look like. I wasn't surprised given how bad Google Android talks at game conferences tend to be, so they put up with Google's lack of game development bones. Android is only different because game developers don't have a option if they want to cover both top mobile platforms. Android GDK is still a joke versus what Apple puts out, let alone Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. reply fsloth 1 hour agorootparentAndroid development seems to be universally acknowledged as a backwater -experience compared to other platforms. reply tadfisher 4 hours agorootparentprevThey killed the user-facing product because by all accounts it was a flop.

I was under the impression that it is pretty much the state of art in profiling reply Veserv 3 hours agoparentprevDoes tracy support automatic function entry/exit (FEE) traces (i.e. all functions are automatically instrumented with a start/end)? The documentation seems to indicate traces are all manual which is pretty inconvenient. There are very few cases where you even need manual instrumentation if you have FEE data from my experience. reply cmovq 3 hours agoparentprevWhat surprised me about Tracy was just how easy it was to include in a C++ project.

My current favourite is Tracy: https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy reply latenightcoding 7 hours agoparentNot if you are on macOS, the number of available profilers drops after every release. Same with leak detectors, valgrind doesnt work, sanitizers don't work anymore (even if you compile your own clang). reply tempodox 47 minutes agorootparentBoth address sanitizer and UB sanitizer work for me (macOS-13.6, Intel). You have to add a library search path and the appropriate `libclang_rt.*` library to your build. Library search path is `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/clang/1[4-9].[0-9].[0-9]/lib/darwin`. reply interroboink 5 hours agorootparentprevAt least in the specific case of Tracy, you can profile over the network. So, you instrument your OSX application, and it streams its data in realtime to your profiler viewer. Though it's true that more advanced features require OS support (eg: showing how threads get moved amongst CPU cores, and so on). reply 1over137 6 hours agorootparentprevIt took Apple a long time to bring ASan and TSan to macOS, but they work now, for me at least. (MSan still unavailable though). reply saagarjha 6 hours agorootparentprevApple mostly keeps their sanitizers up-to-date? Not that it’s really a profiler, to be honest. reply optymizer 5 hours agorootparentprevI found that you can use the 'leaks' command to replace vlgrind memcheck reply Ono-Sendai 6 hours agorootparentprevSanitizers only sometimes work on Windows too :) reply mmastrac 6 hours agorootparentprevsamply is pretty sweet. It's been my go-to for Deno work for the last year or so. reply forrestthewoods 7 hours agoparentprevTracy and Superluminal. reply Ono-Sendai 7 hours agorootparentSuperluminal is great as well. I currently prefer Tracy because it gives faster profiling feedback. reply Keyframe 7 hours agorootparentSuperluminal is windows (and xbox/playstation) only too, so it's off the board immediately. reply forrestthewoods 4 hours agorootparentSadly there’s no one tool to rule them all. The only choice is to use the best tool for each platform. Superluminal is far and away the best profiler imho. Tracy is a great instrumented profiler. But damn do I love a good sampling profiler. Tracy can sample. But I had serious issues with it on one of my projects I could never get around. reply jonstewart 8 hours agoprev [–] What’s the difference between this and libprofile in GPT? Just earlier in its transition to Google abandonware? reply rvnx 8 hours agoparent [–] According to the presentation video, it is a profiling tool used for Stadia Games ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V-EPBPGZPs ) that can adapt to Unity and Unreal Engine. Which seems to make sense as the original developer has experience developing on video games. The main selling point of the tool is Dynamic instrumentation, which allows you to generate Flame charts without manual code annotation (you pick functions that you are interested into, and the profiler adds a hook to these functions in order to log the entry+exit time). reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
