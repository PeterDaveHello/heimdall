    "hn_content": "The post on Hacker News discusses the limitations of ChatGPT and the challenges of creating truly trustworthy AI. Some commenters note that the issue of randomly generating incorrect output is a problem inherent in existing neural net models and may require a leap forward to solve. Others argue that these models are not designed to produce correct output and that they are valuable as long as they provide plausible output. However, the post highlights the importance of being able to trust AI in order for it to be truly useful. Additionally, some commenters note that self-driving cars face similar challenges to chat AI and that a leap forward may also be required to achieve truly safe autonomous driving.AI Writing tool GPT-4 is more reliable with data input and output. The CEO and CTO of OpenAI have both confirmed having more than ten times the data used to train GPT-3, agreements to collect thirty times more and that collecting 100x more data would not be a problem. ChatGPT was trained on a vast amount of public domain text from the Internet, enabling more hands-on experience for\u00a0thousands or even millions of people to objectively evaluate\u00a0AI-generated\u00a0text. However, significant limitations still exist in terms of AI's ability to perform common sense reasoning about the world and lack of basic sensory inputs like image and sound. Experts believe that AI needs to be paired with human judgment and supervised execution.A discussion on developing AI language models that can conduct conversations includes comments on ChatGPT-3.5's use of politeness and quirkiness. Some commentators highlight that ChatGPT-3.5, or even GPT-4, which use a temperature parameter to encode capriciousness, may not work in all scenarios and may continue to present dichotomies in quality. Additionally, it is suggested that there is no transparency on the training data of ChatGPT, which likely hinders identification and remediation of challenges like bias. Others, however, comment that researchers have made efforts to prevent this and present an inclusive and politically correct platform.OpenAI's ChatGPT may have a liberal political bias, which raises questions about whether it was intentionally introduced by the company or if it occurred naturally due to content biases in training data. There are examples of biased responses in ChatGPT's output when prompted with certain topics, and there are concerns that the model might not be transparent enough for developers to understand how it came up with its responses. OpenAI's RLHF (Risk-Limited Hindsight-Fitting) technology has been introduced to improve ChatGPT's safety and truthfulness, but it remains unclear whether the model's underlying biases have been addressed. It's important for AI models like ChatGPT to continually undergo research and improvement to enhance their performance and align them more closely with user expectations.The article includes a discussion about the limitations of language models and how they follow instructions. The article also highlights examples of how language models may fail to follow specific instructions, such as being too apologetic or not following dietary restrictions. The discussion brings up the importance of understanding the hidden instructions given to the model and how they affect behavior. Additionally, the article mentions the differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and how the latter has improved with more human-like responses. The article also touches on the topic of self-driving cars and how they relate to language models in terms of their reliance on visual/imagery AI versus text-based AI.Rust\u2019s Deref trait allows you to call methods of a type T directly on an Arc<T> struct while maintaining Rust\u2019s borrowing rules. This feature is called \u201cDeref coercions.\u201d While Rust\u2019s Deref coercions can feel a bit magical, they are designed to work with Rust\u2019s other features to maintain safety. GPT-4 is a large language model (LLM) designed to generate dialogue that is consistent with human-like dialogue. However, its training dataset does not include exchanges with people being rude or abusive, so the conversation should look like what it has seen in the training data. LLMs struggle to follow syntactic, lexical, or phonetic constraints, but constrained text generation studio can fix it. ChatGPT is designed to reason about large swaths of data. It has been trained on data with exchanges between humans and can understand and speak multiple languages, including slang and a mix of other languages with English.The post discusses the limitations and advantages of different language models, particularly ChatGPT and GPT-4. ChatGPT is deemed useful for finding libraries but unreliable for information retrieval, while GPT-4 is considered a significant improvement. The article mentions that ChatGPT regurgitates sources and can quote made-up texts. However, ChatGPT's faithful recreation of human common sense can help hold a conversation, receive feedback on written text, and find creative solutions. GPT-4 is referred to as a game-changer and a categorically different tool from ChatGPT. Some users accessed ChatGPT to learn about programming languages, while others asked about the movement of the sun over Japan. The discussion covered technical information about how strings are implemented in Java and clarified some imprecisions about the sun's movement.- Java strings are represented as objects in the String class, and are stored in a character array (char[]).\n- The String class has a variety of useful methods, including compareTo(), startsWith(), endsWith(), and hash code caching.\n- The String pool is used to effectively reuse similar strings and save memory.\n- Substring creates a new backing char array that is shared with the original string.\n- GPT-4 has capabilities beyond simple knowledge retrieval and can be used for analyzing multiple perspectives, comparing and contrasting, and developing solutions. \n- Users should be more specific in their prompts to ChatGPT and other LLMs and should not expect them to know everything about everything. \n- There is continuing interest in chatbots and the capabilities of AI systems.",

In just over 150 pages, Echebur\u00faa summarizes the fundamental aspects of a particularly human and painful phenomenon. \u201cWe have a very high cognitive capacity that can make us experience suffering and disappointments very intensely, and it makes us aware that we can put an end to our lives. People who attempt suicide want to stop suffering, not stop living,\u201d he says. In the book, he presents suicide as a public health problem and explains it so we can better understand it and combat the stigma that has made it difficult to take adequate prevention measures and increased the suffering of survivors.Question: Can suicide be addressed as if it were a disease?Answer. Suicide is not a mental disorder like depression or addiction. In a high percentage\u201470% to 90%\u2014of cases, there is an underlying mental disorder but there are 10% to 20%, who are people who may reach a point where they make an existential calculation, see that their life no longer makes sense, that they do not have a life project, and they feel isolated and experience a certain tiredness of living. These people may be influenced by external factors, such as a financial setback. At a given moment, shame or feeling socially ostracized can also lead them to an impulsive act of desperation, because death is seen as the only way to escape suffering.Q. At the moment, there\u2019s a lot of concern about suicides among young people and adolescents in particular. Has the situation worsened?A. In Spain, most deaths by suicide do not occur in young people. The highest incidence is in adulthood, between 30 and 59 years of age, and a second peak occurs in those over 65 years of age, who may account for approximately 25 to 30% [of the cases]. Teenagers and young adults, between 15 and 30 years of age, may account for about 13%. [Suicide] is much less common than in the elderly, but we are much more sensitive to suicide by a young person. Another important issue is that, in Spain, the number of deaths caused by traffic accidents has decreased dramatically in recent years, and those deaths affected mostly young people. Now, suicide seems much more relevant as [a cause of] unnatural death in this [age] group.Q. There is also more concern about mental disorders other than suicide among teenagers.A. There are other phenomena [that are] linked to suicide but are not suicide, such as self-harm in adolescent girls and suicidal ideation. There are many people who have suicidal ideation that, if not treated properly, can eventually translate into a fatal suicide attempt. In Spain, since the pandemic, there has been a clear increase in the number of people with suicidal ideation and teenagers who self-harm. On the other hand, with respect to the number of deaths by suicide, there hasn\u2019t been enough time for us to be able to draw conclusions. In principle, suicide is relatively stable numerically. The most relevant fact is not the increase, but the fact that the numbers have not decreased, when [deaths] have been reduced in other areas, such as traffic accidents, homicides and femicides. It is also true that there is a much greater sensitivity to this phenomenon now, which is clearly a positive thing, because it can lead us to invest more resources [in stopping it].Q. Why hasn\u2019t the number of deaths by suicide decreased?A. There is a lack of understanding, and suicide prevention programs, which are [just] starting to develop now, have not been done in a meaningful way. The situation is much better than it was five years ago. Suicide prevention programs are included in [Spain\u2019s] National Mental Health Strategy, which has made this problem a priority issue. [Spain\u2019s] autonomous communities also have suicide prevention plans at the school level. We are training the police, firefighters and professionals in [matters related to] this type of behavior. These [initiatives] will likely yield results in the medium term.Psychologist Enrique Echebur\u00faa recently published the book 'Death by Suicide'.JAVIER HERNANDEZ JUANTEGUIQ. Is there anything that could be done to prevent suicide that is not being done yet?A. If we\u2019re talking about adolescents, for example, much more needs to be done. Many teenagers are very sensitive to emotional upheaval, which is experienced far more intensely in adolescence than in adult life; serious disappointments\u2014in romantic relationships, with parents, with friends, school performance, being bullied for being different\u2014can lead them to attempt suicide in a fit of impulsivity. The family and the role of the school play a very important role for teenagers. In the family, parents may not detect the risk of suicide, but they may see that their child has depression, or an anxiety problem, or stops eating or becomes addicted to social media. These are risk factors, and it is a good idea to get those problems checked out, not necessarily [because of] suicide. In the most serious cases, you can also involve the school, or educational psychologists who may work at the school, or a primary care physician to refer [the teenager] to a mental health center. And there are also hotlines that have been set up by the government, the ANAR Foundation, the Hope Hotline, the hotline set up by the Ministry of Health. All of this makes it easier to deal with crisis situations and makes it less likely for a fatal suicide attempt to occur. Then, we must also realize that sometimes suicide occurs impulsively and there is no [unusual] behavior to detect. But\u2026 controlling access to drugs, places like high bridges and access to firearms [can help prevent it].Q. And are there general suicide prevention measures for people of all ages?A. Additional risk factors should be monitored, such as having a family member who died by suicide, having attempted suicide [before], being male, being over 60 years old, living alone or having a chronic or debilitating disease. We should pay attention to these risk factors in order to provide extra medical, psychological and social support. As we have said, it is also important to monitor serious mental disorders, depression, psychosis\u2026alcoholism or an eating disorder.From the educational point of view, both in a family and at school, it is important to create what we call protective factors\u2014[ways] to make these people resilient in the face of disappointments, trials and tribulations or setbacks that they may experience in their lives. [Such strategies are] based on building self-esteem. For example: do not ridicule them if they are not at the head of the class. In general, it is a matter of ensuring that they have emotional stability, that they are taught to solve problems and to manage emotions and stressful situations, to foster social relationships, to share their sorrows and joys with the people around them. All of that is very important protection for a person.Q. Can we improve our knowledge about suicide to better address it?A. There is something that is not usually done\u2026called a \u201cpsychological autopsy.\u201d Essentially, it was created at the request of insurance companies to determine whether a person\u2019s cause of death was an accident or a suicide, because sometimes insurance policies do not cover suicides. Therefore, they were interested in determining the cause of death. Then, they wanted to see which circumstances in each specific case could have led to that person\u2019s loss of life. And this was a study that was carried out with the [help of the deceased person\u2019s] relatives, with the people who had been around that person; [the study took place] a few months after the death, when people were ready to provide information. Thus, we wanted to know more about the variables that lead to suicide to establish better prevention programs. This [study] is not done systematically, because it is very complicated to do so, but it would shed light on how to conduct better prevention campaigns and more specific treatments for different age groups.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA EditionMore informationNavy probe prompted by suicides condemns conditions at shipyard: \u2018We let our people down\u2019AP | WASHINGTONReport finds \u2018worrying\u2019 rise in suicide rates in northwestern SyriaLUC\u00cdA FORASTER GARRIGA | MADRIDAdheres toMore informationIf you are interested in licensing this content, please contact ventacontenidos@prisamedia.comSponsored ContentWhy people are so passionate about Ka\u2019ChavaKACHAVAAmericans Are Replacing AC's with This Tiny Air Cooler (It's Genius)TOP TECH TODAYTwo Texas Banks Paying All Time High Interest Rates (See the List)WALLETGENIUSSponsored ContentSay Goodbye to Pricking Your Finger and Awkward ScanningDOTMALLSDoes This Detergent Sheet Really Clean Better Than Liquid?DETERGENT ALTERNATIVECheap Leaking Basement Wall Fixing In San Antonio.

The article is relevant for people interested in mental health and the challenges faced by patients in the healthcare system.A person discusses their experience dealing with a medical condition and navigating the healthcare system. They express frustration in finding a doctor who can take ownership of their case and provide a definitive diagnosis. The person considers moving back to the UK for better healthcare options. Other commenters suggest finding a new primary care physician, taking notes and being an advocate at appointments, and seeking out medical establishments such as the Mayo Clinic or Cleveland Clinic. The discussion also touches on the topic of addiction and the challenges of overcoming it.The post is a discussion about the difficulty of making friends later in life, and the consequences of social isolation. The commentators express varying opinions, ranging from the importance of \"trying\" to rebuild one's social life, to the limitations that society and one's personal circumstances may impose. Some argue for the value of community and empathy in the path towards redemption. The discussion touches on rehab and addiction, and the potential problems with mandated abstinence programs. The main takeaway is that success in making friends and overcoming personal struggles is not guaranteed, but one cannot succeed if they don't try.A man in the Netherlands, who was an alcoholic, used the country's euthanasia laws to end his life.

Some users believe that euthanasia is a dignified solution, while others find it troubling, as they believe that health resources should be used to encourage life rather than taking a life. Some people connect the man's alcohol addiction with depression, and others suggest that addiction is often a result of pain, trauma, and mental illness. There is also a debate about whether or not alcohol should be classified as a drug.The conversation is about a study that found a quarter of Canadians believe that poverty and homelessness are acceptable reasons for assisted suicide. Some users express skepticism about the source of the study, while others believe that the issue is highly ideological. In the conversation, opinions are shared on topics such as religion, fear of pain, and freedom of choice. Overall, the post doesn't provide any new technological information; it's about news coverage of a controversial study, which prompts a discussion on subjective views and the validity of sources.The post covers a range of comments about people's experiences with mental health struggles, suicide, and society's views towards suicide. Some commenters share personal stories of struggling with suicidal thoughts and experiences with mental illness, while others discuss broader societal issues, such as the legality of assisted suicide, the role of religion in the conversation about suicide, and access to lethal drugs. Despite their differences, many commenters emphasize the importance of recognizing suicide as a real and serious issue and advocating for support, resources, and empathy for those who struggle with mental health.The comment section discusses suicide and depression. Some argue that suffering is part of life, while others point out that external factors can also contribute to mental health issues. Social isolation and loss of community are seen as significant contributors to the growing suicide rate, as well as the inability to appreciate simple pleasures to combat consumerist tendencies. The importance of seeking help for mental health, cultivating social connections, and learning healthy coping mechanisms is emphasized.The post contains various comments discussing the reasons why people commit suicide, including chronic pain, financial obligations, and depression. The importance of mental health resources is also mentioned, with many people struggling to find affordable and available options. The post highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of suicide, rather than assuming a singular cause or solution.Many people who consider suicide do so to escape suffering or feeling like a burden on others. However, there are infinite reasons why people take their lives, including religious, protest, honor, shame, media spectacle, financial ruin, and fads. The idea that suicide can be prevented through treatmant or social welfare programs is a modern secular idea, and it's possible to make a conscious choice to stop living. Suicide rates among those experiencing mental health problems have surged, with many providers no longer taking insurance. Most people kill themselves when they can no longer see an end to their suffering, and while sometimes irrational, there are also cases where it isn't. Shawshank Redemption has a powerful line on this topic: 'Get busy living, or get busy dying.'No meaningful content for a tech news summary.",

    "content": "Writing summaries is more important than reading more booksMay 20One thing I\u2019ve learned over time is to read fewer books but to take the time to write summaries for the good ones. The ROI of spending 2h writing a synopsis is much higher than spending those 2h powering through the next book on your list. Reading is not about page count or speed [1]. What matters is how it changes your thinking and what you take away from it. Optimize for comprehension, not volume.If your goal is to maximize comprehension, you need to ask questions while you read \u2014 questions that you yourself must try to answer in the course of reading. This is something I believe curious people do naturally. Forcing yourself to ask questions and to answer them also makes it easy to write a synopsis: When you\u2019re done, simply write down the most important questions you\u2019ve encountered and how the book has answered them. This is the template I use:In 1-2 sentences, what is the book about as a whole?What are the 3-4 central questions it tries to answer?Summarize the answers in one paragraph each.What are the most important things you have learned personally?While the end product is short and concise, it takes time and focus to write it. Which is of course why it\u2019s effective: It forces you extract and re-formulate the book\u2019s insights in your own words.Not coincidentally, I use a similar framework for writing essays: I structure them around questions I\u2019m trying to answer, typically no more than 3-4. If I can\u2019t formulate those concisely, or if there are more than 3-4, it\u2019s usually not worth posting the piece. Without that clarity, it ends up either rambling or shallow and not offering any coherent insights.Since summarizing leaves you with less time to read, you\u2019ll have to get better at selecting books. I use a combination of two simple techniques for this, topical reading and inspectional reading [2]:Topical Reading \u2014 Each quarter, I select 4-5 topics I care about and want to gain a deeper understanding of. Start wide and get a sense of what the important works are for each topic. Collate a broad list of works.Inspectional Reading \u2014 Use inspectional reading to prune the list for each topic down to max. 2 books. Inspectional reading is simply systematic skimming or pre-reading: Read the summary on the back of the book, and the preface or introduction, study the table of contents to get a general sense of the book\u2019s structure, read the summary statements at the beginning or end of each chapter. This typically takes no more than an hour and can be extremely effective at filtering out works that are not useful or irrelevant to you.It\u2019s surprising how even many of the most prolific readers I know are unaware of the value of inspectional reading. Most readers start on page one of a book and plow through until they\u2019re done or decide to cut their losses \u2014 without ever reading the table of contents or the preface.One great alternative to writing summaries is to talk about the books you\u2019re reading. Explaining the ideas you\u2019re reading about to someone else is one of the best ways to engage with the material, since (a) it forces you to formulate it in your own words, and (b) they might challenge the ideas and get you to examine them more critically.Footnotes[1] Speed reading \u2014 very hyped in tech circles a few years ago \u2014 is largely a scam in my view. Beyond a certain point, there is simply a hard tradeoff between speed and comprehension.[2] Adler & Van Doren, How to read a book (1972)SubscribeSign up to get new posts in your inbox.SubscribeReadingComprehensionWriting",

    "hn_content": "The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the idea of whether summarizing books is instrumental to maximizing reading outcomes. Some argue that summarizing enables better recall, while others contend that reading religiously helps retain the necessary information. Comments point out that personal preferences and habits dictate summarization or active engagement with books, depending on the category of books. Suggestions range from taking notes in margins to rewriting notes from Google reviews to using ruled paper for summary notes. The consensus is that summarizing is not mandatory, but a personal preference and one\u2019s engagement with the book should not feel restricted.Readers of this post discuss methods for taking notes while reading books, including using Post-Its (with some warnings about glue damage), Book Darts, and writing notes in notebooks or on a computer. Some readers appreciate secondhand books with markings from previous readers while others prefer their books to be free of personal jots and notes. The importance of re-reading books for deeper understanding and taking better notes is also discussed. One reader shares a tool they created called Emdash for organizing and summarizing book notes. Despite some disagreement about the best methods for reading and note-taking, readers generally agree that reading is a personal experience and what works for one reader may not work for another.The article explores different ways to retain and process information from books. One person suggests summarizing, remixing, and building a personal index of insights. Another person recommends progressive summarization by starting with extensive highlighting, followed by refining and summarizing in one's own words. Others caution against reducing a book down to a single thesis and emphasize the value of reading for the connections and pathways between ideas. Different tools such as Obsidian and llamaindex are also mentioned to help organize and search for information in one's personal vault. Overall, the article encourages readers to actively engage with the material and find what works best for them.The post includes discussions on using various software tools to enhance learning from reading, and tips to build reflective practices. The author suggests writing summaries as a way to identify and remember important information from books. Some users recommend using offline apps like Obsidian or AI-based apps like Llama to organize notes and summarize books. Others suggest meditation, journaling, or discussing books with friends as methods to reflect and retain information. Some users argue that summarizing is not a proven effective learning technique and may diminish the enjoyment of reading. Overall, the post offers different perspectives on how to approach learning from reading.A conversation on Hacker News emerged about the pros and cons of summarizing books; some agreed that summarizing is an essential way to ensure their comprehension, while others found it to be a reflection of poor retention. Some mentioned that reading books is for recreation, while others suggested that broad knowledge opens up new opportunities. The discussion highlights the different opinions of the readers about the best way to remember and then apply new ideas. Overall, the thread brought out how different people have different learning styles, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution to these matters.",

Having worked on search and search ads for over a decade, we sincerely believed that there was space for a model of search that put user and not advertiser interests first\u2014a private, ads-free experience.Building search engines is hard. It is even harder to do with a tiny team of 50 people who are up against entrenched organizations with endless resources. We overcame these obstacles and built a search stack from the ground up, running a crawl that fetched petabytes of information from the web and used that to power an independent search stack.In early 2022, the upcoming impact of generative AI and LLMs became clear to us. We embarked on an ambitious effort to seamlessly blend LLMs into our search stack. We rallied the Neeva team around the vision to create an answer engine. We are proud of being the first search engine to provide cited, real-time AI answers to a majority of queries early this year.But throughout this journey, we\u2019ve discovered that it is one thing to build a search engine, and an entirely different thing to convince regular users of the need to switch to a better choice. From the unnecessary friction required to change default search settings, to the challenges in helping people understand the difference between a search engine and a browser, acquiring users has been really hard. Contrary to popular belief, convincing users to pay for a better experience was actually a less difficult problem compared to getting them to try a new search engine in the first place.These headwinds, combined with the different economic environment, have made it clear that there is no longer a path towards creating a sustainable business in consumer search. As a result, over the next few weeks, we will be shutting down neeva.com and our consumer search product, and shifting to a new area of focus.If you have a paid subscription to Neeva Premium, you will receive a refund for the unused portion of your subscription. We have more information for you in our FAQ. As part of the shutdown, we are deleting all user data. Apple iOS subscribers, please go to https://reportaproblem.apple.com/ to request your refund as soon as possible.Neeva has a passionate community of customers and users who have supported us over the past few years. They have tried out early previews of our features, given us thoughtful feedback, and given us the love and encouragement that every young team needs. We are truly grateful to our community, and we are truly sorry that we aren\u2019t able to continue to provide the search engine that you want and deserve.What\u2019s next for NeevaOver the past year, we\u2019ve seen the clear, pressing need to use LLMs effectively, inexpensively, safely, and responsibly. Many of the techniques we have pioneered with small models, size reduction, latency reduction, and inexpensive deployment are the elements that enterprises really want, and need, today. We are actively exploring how we can apply our search and LLM expertise in these settings, and we will provide updates on the future of our work and our team in the next few weeks.We want to thank the Neeva team for the time, effort and dedication to build Neeva. It has been an honor and privilege to take on this challenge with all of you and we could not have chosen a better set of friends and colleagues to be on this journey.Related content from NeevaNeeva Partners with Dashlane for a more Secure Online ExperienceNeeva and Botify Partner to Help You Discover Fresh, Relevant ContentIntroducing Neeva Free Basic and Neeva PremiumBringing Transparency to Web3: Neeva.xyz, the Web3 Search EngineInstant Reddit Summaries with Neeva AINeeva launches in Spain to rival Google Search with tracking free, bias free, AI Powered searchSHARE THIS:HomeFeaturesAboutBlogPressCommunityLearnOur ProductsShopTermsPrivacyCookiesBill of RightsDMCANeeva Web CrawlerNeeva.xyzContactCareers\u00a9 2023 Neeva Inc",

    "hn_content": "Neeva announced its shutdown, after a short span in the ad-free search business that received recognition for showing ad-free search is possible. Founder of rival startup Kagi confessed that the space is getting increasingly competitive with a war for search supremacy between Google and Apple, making it difficult to follow the traditional VC model. Kagi reported excellent search results and is dependent on improved distribution/sales to stay competitive despite complaints about increasing prices and the hardship of switching between search engines. Some argue the biggest challenge was producing a compelling product at a low cost to lure in a large market. A potential optimization idea was to cache search results to ease repeated searches.Kagi, a pay-per-search engine, uses AI to rank search results according to the number of trackers and ads on a site. The engine has drawn praise from many users but also criticism from some who believe this fare is too high. While some argue that using AI for searches is more productive when it comes to learning new concepts, others say the AI self-censors excessively and, since users' search queries are linked to their credit cards, the privacy of the service is a concern. Kagi founder Vlad Gindraru has responded to privacy concerns by stating that the engine does not log queries. Meanwhile, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that profitability margins for search engines were \"going to drop forever.\"Neeva, an ad-free search engine, has announced its closure due to the lack of sufficient users and funding. Neeva aimed to provide a superior search experience to Google through its ad-free model, better search results, and privacy focus. Neeva was criticized for not being focused on its core mission and for experimenting with crypto and AI. Users enjoyed Neeva's personalized content and overall quality. However, competitors such as Google with their LLM system, which is increasingly being used in search, reduce the need for a new search engine. Paid search may slowly become more common as users look for alternatives to ad-supported search engines, which typically direct users to unhelpful and low-quality results.Neeva, a search engine founded by ex-Google employees, has reportedly shut down. Neeva struggled to compete with Google due to Google's wide range of services, such as search-based news and Google Books. Neeva also faced challenges in building its own index and convincing users to switch to a new search engine. The company burnt through $77.5M in VC funding over three years and had purchased results from Bing. The future of search may not come from replicating Google's model; instead, hobbyists with access to machine learning algorithms may create domain-specific knowledge to form networks of databases.Neeva, a privacy-focused search engine, is shutting down its consumer-facing product. The company is exploring using its search and large language model (LLMs) expertise in enterprise settings. Many consumers care about privacy but trading it for convenience is more essential. Unlike DuckDuckGo, Neeva built a search engine comparable to Google with a small team. Neeva aimed to solve the problem of ads clogging the search results page despite the fact that the problem doesn't exist. The media bias feature was added, a misdirection, which was expensive to create. The stack overflow integration was terrible with the LLM being slow and inaccurate. Neeva is in discussions to be acquired by Snowflake.Search engine Neeva is shutting down only a year after launching due to a lack of sustainable revenue. The company had received $77.5 million in funding and offered an ad-free, subscription-based search engine. Neeva relied on Microsoft's Bing for image and video searches, but a rise in pricing and rumors of enforceable terms affected the search engine's operations. Neeva attempted to differentiate itself in the market with offerings such as generative AI summaries of articles. The company stated that it would delete all user data upon shutdown. The search engine's short lifespan highlights the difficulty of building a sustainable search engine outside of Google and Bing's dominant duopoly.",

Turns out, it\u2019s very easy to do.You can watch a video of this article here:Adding Memory To ChatGPTChatGPT plugins are surprisingly simple. They are just standard Web APIs - no different from any other API you might write or call. My particular plugin is really basic. It has just two endpoints.One returns a list of lights. The other toggles a light on and off.I\u2019ve set up my little demo with 5 lights:KitchenBedroomDining table lampBathroomLoungeIt\u2019s worth watching the video as it\u2019s pretty cool. We just say to ChatGPT, \u201clet there be light,\u201d and it switches on all the lights connected to my Raspberry Pi.All the lights turn onWhat\u2019s really impressive is that the only thing ChatGPT has to work with are a few hints describing the plugin in free text and the OpenAPI yaml file. From that, it figures out that it needs to first get the list of lights, and then it needs to loop through the lights and toggle them on.ChatGPT Sequence DiagramNow, I say \u201cfigured out\u201d but I\u2019m not going to claim that it\u2019s thinking or reasoning about the world - that would be a big stretch. But I am going to claim that it\u2019s pretty incredible.We can even run through a really simple home automation scenario.I\u2019ve just woken up - it turns on the bedroom lightTime to shower - it turns on the bathroom light and turns off the bedroom lightTime for breakfast - it turns on the kitchen light and turns off the bathroom lightI\u2019m off to work - it turns off all the lightsI\u2019m back from work with takeout - it turns on the dining table lightTime to relax - it turns on the lounge lightTime for bed - it turns on the bedroom lightI then tried something a bit different. I pretended to be another device in the bedroom that could detect sounds and told ChatGPT that I could hear snoring. It then turned off the bedroom light and wished me goodnight.Now obviously, this is a really straightforward demonstration, but to me, the possibilities are quite mind-boggling.I could see large language models being an interesting way to connect a whole bunch of different systems and services together. There are a ton of poorly designed APIs out there, and integrating them is a nightmare.Wouldn\u2019t it be funny if we ended up with computers talking to each other using human language instead of APIs?Brave New WorldOne of the things that I really enjoyed about this project (apart from the fact that it worked!) was that I didn\u2019t have to write much code at all - I was able to get ChatGPT to generate all the code.This is the prompt I used:Write me a Python Flask API to run on a Raspberry Pi and control some lights attached to GPIO pins.I have the following lights:Kitchen: pin 6Bedroom: pin 13Dining table: pin 19Bathroom: pin 26Lounge: pin 5I want the following endpoints:get lights - returns the list of lights along with their current statepost toggle_light - switches a light on or offI asked it to make a Flask API - I used this as I\u2019m most familiar with it so I could check what ChatGPT outputs. As always with these Large Language Models, it\u2019s definitely a case of \u201cTrust, but verify\u201d.I told it that it was running on a Raspberry Pi and that there were lights connected to GPIO pins.And I gave it the list of lights along with the pin numbers.I then gave it a very vague spec for the endpoints I wanted.With that basic spec, I was able to get ChatGPT to generate the code for me. I added on a bunch of bells and whistles afterwards, but the core of the API was generated by ChatGPT.from flask import Flask, request, jsonifyimport RPi.GPIO as GPIOapp = Flask(__name__)# GPIO setupGPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)GPIO.setwarnings(False)# Define your lightslights = {  \"Kitchen\": {\"pin\": 6, \"state\": GPIO.LOW},  \"Bedroom\": {\"pin\": 13, \"state\": GPIO.LOW},  \"Dining table\": {\"pin\": 19, \"state\": GPIO.LOW},  \"Bathroom\": {\"pin\": 26, \"state\": GPIO.LOW},  \"Lounge\": {\"pin\": 5, \"state\": GPIO.LOW},}# Setup pinsfor light in lights.values():  GPIO.setup(light['pin'], GPIO.OUT)  GPIO.output(light['pin'], GPIO.LOW)@app.route('/lights', methods=['GET'])def get_lights():  return jsonify(lights)@app.route('/toggle_light', methods=['POST'])def toggle_light():  data = request.get_json()  light = data.get('light')    if light not in lights:    return {\"error\": \"Light not found\"}, 404  # Toggle light  lights[light]['state'] = GPIO.HIGH if lights[light]['state'] == GPIO.LOW else GPIO.LOW  GPIO.output(lights[light]['pin'], lights[light]['state'])  return {\"success\": f\"{light} toggled\"}, 200if __name__ == \"__main__\":  app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)The other thing that is needed for a ChatGPT plugin is an OpenAPI or Swagger file - these are tedious to write - and it has been pointed out to me that if I\u2019d used FastAPI, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to write one at all. But one of the really nice things you can do with ChatGPT is paste in your Flask code, and it will generate an OpenAPI file for you.I\u2019m just running this plugin locally, I don\u2019t have any plans to publish it as that would require a lot more plumbing. For developing local plugins, you need to have a server running on localhost. Fortunately, we can use the excellent VSCode support for remote development. I\u2019m connecting through to the Pi from my desktop machine, and when I launch the server, VSCode tunnels through to the Raspberry Pi and exposes the server on my local machine.ChatGPT looks at the /.well-known/ai-plugin.json and uses that to get the name, description, logo, and OpenAPI file. That\u2019s all it has to work with to figure out what to do with the API.We can get some insight into how it works under the hood. We can just ask ChatGPT to show us its thinking. If we paste in the OpenAPI yaml file and ask it to explain how to turn lights on and off, we get this:ChatGPT ExplainWe can even get it to generate a sequence diagram for us:ChatGPT Sequence DiagramIt\u2019s pretty amazing.

Other users shared their own prompts and setups for using Chat GPT and discussed the potential for the \"LAN of Things\" concept. Some users raised concerns about connecting home automation to the cloud and suggested offline alternatives such as Home Assistant. There was also discussion about the potential for running LLMs locally on hardware such as a Mac Mini or a custom PCB project.ChatGPT is being used to orchestrate API calls for home automation, but potential quality issues have been discovered where the models make post-rationalized answers. Further development aiming to tackle plugins conflicting and reducing the likelihood of indiscriminately pulling them. AI interfaces based on presence sensors or well-placed light switches are likely the best approach due to the annoyance of having to \"think\" about your lights, but more complex queries could be implemented through LLMs. Home Assistant already has all the necessary integrations, but is lacking the ChatGPT plugin. Building a ChatGPT plugin is easy since it is just an API call, and the current challenge is getting access.

    "content": "homepublicationshobbiesblogCounterintuitive Properties of High Dimensional SpaceOur geometric intuition developed in our three-dimensional world often fails us in higher dimensions. Many properties of even simple objects, such as higher dimensional analogs of cubes and spheres, are very counterintuitive. Below we discuss just a few of these properties in an attempt to convey some of the weirdness of high dimensional space.You may be used to using the word \u201ccircle\u201d in two dimensions and \u201csphere\u201d in three dimensions. However, in higher dimensions we generally just use the word sphere, ord-sphere when the dimension of the sphere is not clear from context. With this terminology, a circle is also called a 1-sphere, for a 1-dimensional sphere. A standard sphere in three dimensions is called a 2-sphere, and so on. This sometimes causes confusion, because ad-sphere is usually thought of as existing in(d+1)-dimensional space. When we sayd-sphere, the value ofdrefers to the dimension of the sphere locally on the object, not the dimension in which it lives. Similarly we\u2019ll often use the word cube for a square, a standard cube, and its higher dimensional analogues.Escaping SpheresConsider a square with side length 1. At each corner of the square place a circle of radius 1/2, so that the circles cover the edges of the square. Then consider the circle centered at the center of the square that is just large enough to touch the circles at the corners of the square. In two dimensions it\u2019s clear that the inner circle is entirely contained in the square.Figure 1: At each corner of the square we place a circle of radius 1/2. The inner circle is just large enough to touch the circles at the corners.We can do the same thing in three dimensions. At each corner of the unit cube place a sphere of radius 1/2, again covering the edges of the cube. The sphere centered at the center of the cube and tangent to spheres at the corners of the cube is shown in red in Figure 2. Again we see that, in three dimensions, the inner sphere is entirely contained in the cube.Figure 2: In three dimensions we place a sphere at the each of the eight corners of a cube.To understand what happens in higher dimensions we need to compute the radius of the inner sphere in terms of the dimension. The radius of the inner sphere is equal to the length of the diagonal of the cube minus the radius of the spheres at the corners. See Figure 3. The latter value is always 1/2, regardless of the dimension. We can compute the length of the diagonal asd((12,12,\u2026,12),(1,1,\u2026,1))=\u2211i=1d(1\u22121/2)2=d/2Thus the radius of the inner sphere isd/2\u22121/2. Notice that the radius of the inner sphere is increasing with the dimension!Figure 3: The size of the radius of the inner sphere is growing as the dimension increases because the distance to the corner increases while the radius of the corner sphere remains constant.In dimensions two and three, the sphere is strictly inside the cube, as we\u2019ve seen in the figures above. However in four dimensions something very interesting happens. The radius of the inner sphere is exactly 1/2, which is just large enough for the inner sphere to touch the sides of the cube! In five dimensions, the radius of the inner sphere is 0.618034, and the sphere starts poking outside of the cube! By ten dimensions, the radius is 1.08114 and the sphere is poking very far outside of the cube!Volume in High DimensionsThe area of a circleA(r)=r2, whereris the radius. Given the equation for the area of a circle, we can compute the volume of a sphere by considering cross sections of the sphere. That is, we intersect the sphere with a plane at some heighthabove the center of the sphere.Figure 4: Intersecting the sphere with a plane gives a circle.The intersection between a sphere and a plane is a circle. If we look at the sphere from a side view, as shown in Figure 5, we see that the radius can be computed using the Pythagorean theorem (a2+b2=c2). The radius of the circle is.Figure 5: A side view of Figure 4. The radius of the circle defined by the intersection can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.Summing up the area of each cross section from the bottom of the sphere to the top of the sphere gives the volumeV(r)=\u222b\u2212rrA(r2\u2212h2)dh=\u222b\u2212rr\u03c0r2\u2212h22dh=43\u03c0r3.Now that we know the volume of the2-sphere, we can compute the volume of the3-sphere in a similar way. The only difference is where before we used the equation for the area of a circle, we instead use the equation for the volume of the2-sphere. The general formula for the volume of ad-sphere is approximately\u03c0d/2(d/2+1)!rd.(Approximately because the denominator should be the Gamma function, but that\u2019s not important for understanding the intuition.)Setr=1and consider the volume of the unitd-sphere asdincreases. The plot of the volume is shown in Figure 6.Figure 6: The volume of the unitd-sphere goes to 0 asdincreases!The volume of the unitd-sphere goes to 0 asdgrows! A high dimensional unit sphere encloses almost no volume! The volume increases from dimensions one to five, but begins decreasing rapidly toward 0 after dimension six.More Accurate PicturesGiven the rather unexpected properties of high dimensional cubes and spheres, I hope that you\u2019ll agree that the following are somewhat more accurate pictorial representations.Figure 7: More accurate pictorial representations of high dimensional cubes (left) and spheres (right).Notice that the corners of the cube are much further away from the center than are the sides. Thed-sphere is drawn so that it contains almost no volume but still has radius 1. This image also suggests the next counterintuitive property of high dimensional spheres.Concentration of MeasureSuppose that you wanted to place a band around the equator of the unit sphere so that, say, 99% of the surface area of the sphere falls within that band. See Figure 8. How large do you think that band would have to be?Figure 8: In two dimensions a the width of a band around the equator must be very large to contain 99% of the perimeter.In two dimensions the width of the band needs to be pretty large, indeed nearly 2, to capture 99% of the perimeter of the unit circle. However as the dimension increases the width of the band needed to capture 99% of the surface area gets smaller. In very high dimensional space nearly all of the surface area of the sphere lies a very small distance away from the equator!Figure 9: As the dimension increases the width of the band necessary to capture 99% of the surface area decreases rapidly. Nearly all of the surface area of a high dimensional sphere lies near the equator.To provide some intuition consider the situation in two dimensions, as shown in Figure 10. For a point on the circle to be close to the equator, itsy-coordinate must be small.Figure 10: Points near the equator have small y coordinate.What happens to the values of the coordinates as the dimensions increases? Figure 11 is a plot of 20000 random points sampled uniformly from ad-sphere. Asdincreases the values become more and more concentrated around 0.Figure 11: As the dimension increases the coordinates become increasingly concentrated around 0.Recall that every point on ad-sphere must satisfy the equationx12+x22+\u2026+xd+12=1. Intuitively asdincreases the number of terms in the sum increases, and each coordinate gets a smaller share of the single unit, on the average.The really weird thing is that any choice of \u201cequator\u201d works! It must, since the sphere is, well, spherically symmetrical. We could have just as easily have chosen any of the options shown in Figure 12.Figure 12: Any choice of equator works equally well!Kissing NumbersConsider a unit circle in the plane, shown in Figure 13 in red. The blue circle is said to kiss the red circle if it just barely touches the red circle. (Leave it to mathematicians to think that barely touching is a desirable property of a kiss.) The kissing number is the maximum number of non-overlapping blue circles that can simultaneously kiss the red circle.Figure 13: The kissing number is six in two dimensions.In two dimensions it\u2019s easy to see that the kissing number is 6. The entire proof is shown in Figure 14. The proof is by contradiction. Assume that more than six non-overlapping blue circles can simultaneously kiss the red circle. We draw the edges from the center of the red circle to the centers of the blue circles, as shown in Figure 14. The angles between these edges must sum to exactly360\u2218. Since there are more than six angles, at least one must be less than60\u2218. The resulting triangle, shown in Figure 14, is an isosceles triangle. The side opposite the angle that is less than60\u2218must be strictly shorter than the other two sides, which are2rin length. Thus the centers of the two circles must be closer than2rand the circles must overlap, which is a contradiction.Figure 14: A proof that the kissing number is six in two dimensions. If more than six blue circles can kiss the red, then one of the angles must be less than 60 degrees. It follows that the two blue circles that form that angle must overlap, which is a contradiction.It is more difficult to see that in three dimensions the kissing number is 12. Indeed this was famously disputed between Isaac Newton, who correctly thought the kissing number was 12, and David Gregory, who thought it was 13. (Never bet against Newton.) Looking at the optimal configuration, it\u2019s easy to see why Gregory thought it might be possible to fit a 13th sphere in the space between the other 12. As the dimension increases there is suddenly even more space between neighboring spheres and the problem becomes even more difficult.Figure 15: The kissing number is 12 in three dimensions.In fact, there are very few dimensions where we know the kissing number exactly. In most dimensions we only have an upper and lower bound on the kissing number, and these bounds can vary by as much as several thousand spheres!Dimension Lower Bound Upper Bound1 2 22 6 63 12 124 24 245 40 446 72 787 126 1348 240 2409 306 36410 500 55411 582 87012 840 135713 1154 206914 1606 318315 2564 486616 4320 735517 5346 1107218 7398 1657219 10668 2481220 17400 3676421 27720 5458422 49896 8234023 93150 12441624 196560 196560As shown in the table, we only know the kissing number exactly in dimensions one through four, eight, and twenty-four. The eight and twenty-four dimensional cases follow from special lattice structures that are known to give optimal packings. In eight dimensions the kissing number is 240, given by theE8lattice. In twenty-four dimensions the kissing number is 196560, given by the Leech lattice. And not a single sphere more.This post accompanies a talk given to high school students through Berkeley Splash.
