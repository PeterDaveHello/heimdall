ANDREW CHAN Source code for this article can be found on my GitHub. Fire is an interesting graphics problem. Past approaches generally faked it. For example, Lord of the Rings [1] used sprites with lots and lots of smoke (the fluid sim was too expensive at the time, even for movies). Real-time applications like video games have pretty much exclusively used non-physical approaches. But in the last 10 years GPUs have made fast fluid simulation easy. Basic fluid dynamics algorithms are straightforward to implement on the GPU [2]. In 2009, ILM used these techniques to model and render fire in Harry Potter [3]. And in 2014, NVIDIA released FlameWorks, a whole system for generating fire and smoke effects for games. This post takes notes on how fire can be simulated on the GPU. It walks through the math behind fluid dynamics, parallel algorithms for modeling fluids, and the extra combustion bits that make fire special. Readers should have a reasonable background in vector calculus and differential equations (know how to take the gradient of a vector). Demos are implemented with WebGL. 1. Fluid Simulation Before we simulate fire, we need to simulate fluid. We assume our fluid is incompressible and inviscid, which will vastly simplify our problem. 1.1 Basic Fluid Dynamics Suppose 𝐷 D is a region in space filled with a fluid. At any point 𝑥 ∈ 𝐷 x∈D and time 𝑡 t, the fluid has velocity 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) u(x,t). Computationally, we can represent the 2D velocity field 𝑢 u with an 𝑁 × 𝑁 N×N grid, where the equally spaced grid points give the value of the velocity field at that point in space. Ex: A 16 × ×16 grid representing 𝑢 = ( 𝑦 , − 𝑥 ) u=(y,−x) What will happen if we put a drop of dye in the fluid? Let’s define a scalar field 𝜓 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) ψ(x,t) as the density of the dye at any point in space and time. The transport of quantities like 𝜓 ψ within a fluid by the fluid’s velocity is called advection. Given some fluid’s velocity field and an initial density field of our dye, we’d like to see how the dye’s density everywhere evolves over time by simulating its advection through the fluid. A Naive Method for Advection One idea 1 to compute the advection is to take each grid point, move forward the direction and distance that would be traveled by a particle at the grid point’s velocity and the simulation timestep Δ 𝑡 Δt, and update the grid point nearest to where the particle lands: 𝜓 ( 𝑥 + 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) , 𝑡 + Δ 𝑡 ) = 𝜓 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) ψ(x+u(x,t),t+Δt)=ψ(x,t) But this is tricky to parallelize, since 2 grid points can end up in the same target point after forward evaluation. And in practice, the target point will fall between grid points, meaning it has to be interpolated into the surrounding grid points. Finally, this process is unstable for time steps above some number, causing 𝜓 ψ to blow up. The Advection Partial Differential Equations This whole time we’ve been solving a partial differential equation! If we’re going to derive a stable method for advection, we’ll need to first get an explicit expression for this PDE. Let’s start from first principles. Consider a fixed region of space 𝑊 W (that is, 𝑊 W does not vary with time). The total mass of dye within 𝑊 W is ∫ 𝑊 𝜓 𝑑 𝑉 ∫WψdV. Over time, the change in mass is: 𝑑 𝑑 𝑡 ∫ 𝑊 𝜓 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) 𝑑 𝑉 = ∫ 𝑊 ∂ ∂ 𝑡 𝜓 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) 𝑑 𝑉 dtd∫Wψ(x,t)dV=∫W∂t∂ψ(x,t)dV Now, letting 𝑆 S denote the surface of 𝑊 W and 𝑛 n the outward normal vector defined along the surface, we can examine the mass flow rate through the surface of 𝑊 W. In particular, observe that the volume flow rate - the volume of fluid that flows through per second - across 𝑆 S per unit area is 𝑢 ⋅ 𝑛 u⋅n and the mass flow rate per unit area is 𝜓 𝑢 ⋅ 𝑛 ψu⋅n. This gives us the law of conservation of mass in integral form: 𝑑 𝑑 𝑡 ∫ 𝑊 𝜓 𝑑 𝑉 = − ∫ 𝑆 𝜓 𝑢 ⋅ 𝑛 𝑑 𝐴 dtd∫WψdV=−∫Sψu⋅ndA Can we get rid of the integrals and say something similar for points? By divergence theorem, the above is equivalent to ∫ 𝑊 [ ∂ 𝜓 ∂ 𝑡 + ∇ ⋅ ( 𝜓 𝑢 ) ] 𝑑 𝑉 = 0 ∫W[∂t∂ψ+∇⋅(ψu)]dV=0 Then for a unit subregion 𝑊 = 𝑑 𝑉 W=dV, we can say that ∂ 𝜓 ∂ 𝑡 + ∇ ⋅ ( 𝜓 𝑢 ) = 0 ∂t∂ψ+∇⋅(ψu)=0 This gives us an explicit PDE that we need to solve for 𝜓 ψ! Hmm... we could stop here, but we might be able to simplify this more. Specifically, it looks like we could isolate out a term ∇ ⋅ 𝑢 ∇⋅u that goes to zero because of incompressibility. ∂ 𝜓 ∂ 𝑡 = − ∇ ⋅ ( 𝜓 𝑢 ) = − ( ∂ ∂ 𝑥 𝜓 𝑢 + ∂ ∂ 𝑦 𝜓 𝑣 ) = − ( ∂ 𝜓 ∂ 𝑥 𝑢 + ∂ 𝑢 ∂ 𝑥 𝜓 + ∂ 𝜓 ∂ 𝑦 𝑣 + ∂ 𝑣 ∂ 𝑦 𝜓 ) = − ( 𝜓 ∇ ⋅ 𝑢 + 𝑢 ⋅ ∇ 𝜓 ) = − 𝑢 ⋅ ∇ 𝜓 ∂t∂ψ=−∇⋅(ψu)=−(∂x∂ψu+∂y∂ψv)=−(∂x∂ψu+∂x∂uψ+∂y∂ψv+∂y∂vψ)=−(ψ∇⋅u+u⋅∇ψ)=−u⋅∇ψApplying our incompressibility constraint ∇ ⋅ 𝑢 = 0 ∇⋅u=0 at the end yields a scalar PDE, the first of our incompressible flow advection equations: (1) ∂ 𝜓 ∂ 𝑡 = advection ( 𝑢 , 𝜓 ) = − 𝑢 ⋅ ∇ 𝜓 ∂t∂ψ=advection(u,ψ)=−u⋅∇ψ(1) (2) ∂ 𝑣 ∂ 𝑡 = advection ( 𝑢 , 𝑣 ) = − 𝑢 ⋅ ∇ 𝑣 ∂t∂v=advection(u,v)=−u⋅∇v(2) Eq. 2 for advecting a vector field 𝑣 v through our velocity field can be derived similarly to the scalar advection equation. A Stable Method for Advection Let’s look closely at eqn. (1): ∂ 𝜓 ∂ 𝑡 = − 𝑢 ⋅ ∇ 𝜓 ∂t∂ψ=−u⋅∇ψ Notice that the right-hand term is a directional derivative in the − 𝑢 −u direction. This gives us a wonderful new method for advecting 𝜓 ψ by an incompressible fluid - starting at a grid point 𝑥 x, trace the fluid velocity backwards, replacing the value at our original point by the value that we land on (if we land between points, we can interpolate): 𝜓 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 + Δ 𝑡 ) = 𝜓 ( 𝑥 − 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) , 𝑡 ) ψ(x,t+Δt)=ψ(x−u(x,t),t) In GPU pseudocode: global Vec2Field u; global FloatField density; global float dt; // Run for each point in our scalar grid that we want to update float advectPoint(vec2 x) { vec2 coord = x - dt * getVec2At(u, x); return getFloatAt(density, coord); } This method is called Semi-Lagrangian advection and was invented in 1999 by Jos Stam [4]. Like Euler, it’s first-order accurate, but has exactly the additional properties we need: It’s extremely easy to parallelize because each grid point only gets updated once per iteration. It’s unconditionally stable. Why? Observe that for any grid point, the maximum value it can get updated to is the maximum value of all the grid points. For a fixed velocity field fulfilling the incompressibility constraint, it works great. Click and hold Click anywhere above to drop some dye in the flow 1.2 The Navier-Stokes Equations So far we’ve found a model that describes how scalar properties of a fluid evolve over time, assuming the flow is fixed. What about the fluid flow itself - how does the velocity field 𝑢 u affect itself over time? The Navier-Stokes equations 2 3 for incompressible flow define how the velocity at any point in a fluid evolves over time: ∂ 𝑢 ∂ 𝑡 = − 𝑢 ⋅ ∇ 𝑢 ⎵ self-advection + 𝜇 2 ∇ 𝑢 ⎵ diffusion − ∇ 𝑝 ⎵ pressure + F ⎵ ext. forces ∂t∂u=self-advection−u⋅∇u+diffusionμ2∇u−pressure∇p+ext. forcesF where ∀ 𝑡 , ∇ ⋅ 𝑢 = 0 where ∀t , ∇⋅u=0 Here, the constant 𝜇 μ is the fluid’s viscosity and 𝐹 F are external forces. But we assumed earlier that our fluid was inviscid, so 𝜇 = 0 μ=0, and we can just ignore external forces for now. So we’re left with two terms - self-advection and pressure. (3) ∂ 𝑢 ∂ 𝑡 = − 𝑢 ⋅ ∇ 𝑢 ⎵ self-advection − ∇ 𝑝 ⎵ pressure ∂t∂u=self-advection−u⋅∇u−pressure∇p(3) where ∀ 𝑡 , ∇ ⋅ 𝑢 = 0 where ∀t , ∇⋅u=0 If at every timestep we numerically compute these terms and add them, we can simulate our fluid! In pseudocode: let u = createVectorGrid(); let density = createScalarGrid(); let p = createScalarGrid(); while (true) { // Solve for the next velocity field. u = advect(u, u); p = computePressure(...); u = u - gradient(p); // Advect dye through the new velocity field. density = advect(u, density); } Let’s take a closer look at each of these. Self-Advection From our incompressible advection equations, we can see that the self-advection term is the advection of the fluid’s velocity field 𝑢 u through itself: (4) advection ( 𝑢 , 𝑢 ) = − 𝑢 ⋅ ∇ 𝑢 advection(u,u)=−u⋅∇u(4) Where do the other terms come from? Well, advecting 𝑢 u through itself yields a new velocity field 𝑢 ′ u′ (computable via the Semi-Lagrangian backtracing algorithm from above): 𝑢 ′ = 𝑢 − 𝑢 ⋅ ∇ 𝑢 u′=u−u⋅∇u Pressure We don’t know if this new velocity field follows the incompressibility constraint (e.g. has zero divergence). So the pressure term 𝑝 p needs to correct this somehow: ∇ ⋅ ( 𝑢 ′ − ∇ 𝑝 ) = 0 ∇⋅(u′−∇p)=0 We rearrange this to get (5) ∇ 2 𝑝 = ∇ ⋅ 𝑢 ′ ∇2p=∇⋅u′(5) which is a type of equation known as a Poisson equation, where the left-hand side is the Laplacian of an unknown scalar field and the right-hand side is a known scalar. Solving this Poisson equation is really the slowest computational step in fluid simulation, for reasons we will see shortly. Solving for Pressure So how do we solve this particular PDE for 𝑝 p? Well, we know the value of our candidate velocity field 𝑢 ′ u′ at all of our grid points, so we can approximately compute the right-hand side of the Poisson equation by applying a discrete version 4 of the divergence everywhere: ∇ ⋅ 𝑢 ′ ≈ 𝑢 𝑖 + 1 , 𝑗 − 𝑢 𝑖 − 1 , 𝑗 2 + 𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑗 + 1 − 𝑣 𝑖 , 𝑗 − 1 2 ∇⋅u′≈2ui+1,j−ui−1,j+2vi,j+1−vi,j−1where 𝑢 ′ = ( 𝑢 , 𝑣 ) u′=(u,v) in 2 dimensions. Then we can use a discrete version of the Laplacian ∇ 2 𝑝 ≈ 𝑝 𝑖 + 1 , 𝑗 + 𝑝 𝑖 − 1 , 𝑗 + 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 + 1 + 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 − 1 − 4 𝑝 𝑖 , 𝑗 ∇2p≈pi+1,j+pi−1,j+pi,j+1+pi,j−1−4pi,jto transform the whole equation into a linear equation with five unknowns. But really, we are solving the Poisson equation (5) over all of space at once, so for an 𝑁 × 𝑁 N×N grid, we end up with a system of 𝑁 2 N2 linear equations with exactly 𝑁 2 N2 unknowns! So we end up with the familiar old equation 𝐴 𝑥 = 𝑏 Ax=b where 𝐴 A is a matrix applying the Laplacian operator to the whole grid and 𝑏 b is a vector containing the velocity field’s divergence at all grid points. There are many off-the-shelf algorithms for solving linear systems exactly. Unfortunately for us, even the fastest algorithms scale superlinearly with our grid size. Solving for Pressure... Efficiently If we’re going to make a real-time simulation, we need to go fast. Can we leverage the GPU? Well, it’s not really possible to achieve an exact solution to the linear system efficiently, but we should note that the linear system is already an approximation to the Poisson equation. And it is possible to achieve arbitrarily accurate approximations with iterative methods - which begin with an estimate and improve solution accuracy every iteration - so we can just pick an iterative algorithm and run it until we have something that’s “good enough”. One particularly simple and easy-to-implement iterative algorithm for solving linear equations is the Jacobi method. We start with the very first equation in the system: 𝐴 11 𝑥 1 + 𝐴 12 𝑥 2 + . . . + 𝐴 1 𝑛 𝑥 𝑛 = 𝑏 1 A11x1+A12x2+...+A1nxn=b1At the 𝑘 kth iteration, given some guess 𝑥 𝑘 xk for the solution 𝑥 x, we have some error. We can use this error to update our guess for 𝑥 1 x1 as follows: 𝑥 1 𝑘 + 1 = 𝑏 1 − 𝐴 12 𝑥 2 𝑘 − . . . − 𝐴 1 𝑛 𝑥 𝑛 𝑘 𝐴 11 x1k+1=A11b1−A12x2k−...−A1nxnkIn Jacobi, our guesses for all elements of 𝑥 x are executed in parallel, giving a perfect match for implementation on the GPU. In pseudocode: global FloatField divergence; global FloatField pressure; global float texelSize; // Run for each point in our pressure grid that we want to update float iterateJacobi(vec2 x) { float div = getFloatAt(divergence, x); float L = getFloatAt(pressure, x + vec2(-texelSize, 0.)); float R = getFloatAt(pressure, x + vec2(texelSize, 0.)); float T = getFloatAt(pressure, x + vec2(0., texelSize)); float B = getFloatAt(pressure, x + vec2(0., -texelSize)); return (div - L - R - T - B) / -4.; } It’s worth noting that other, faster-converging solvers can also be implemented on the GPU, like the Conjugate Gradient method and the Multigrid method. But depending on the fluid and application, pressure accuracy may not be as important as advection accuracy or ease of implementation. For smoke and fire, changes in fluid volume aren’t as apparent as they are for fluids like water [5], and high-quality advection tends to matter more[6]. Summary: Simulating Navier Stokes The math behind Navier-Stokes can be a little bit dense, but at a high-level, simulating a fluid by solving the equations comes down to a few key update procedures on a grid per timestep. For our dye problem, here’s our simulation might look: let u = createVectorGrid(); let density = createScalarGrid(); let div = createScalarGrid(); let p = createScalarGrid(); while (true) { // Solve for the next velocity field. u = advect(u, u); // Enforce incompressibility with pressure projection. div = divergence(u); for (let i = 0; i 0 is a parameter controlling the amount of small scale detail added back to the flow. Even low confinement levels (around 0-15) can make a huge difference, especially for simulations using Semi-Lagrangian advection schemes, and higher confinement levels can create highly stylized, billowing flows. Click and hold Click and drag to drop some dye in the turbulent simulation above On the GPU, we can compute curl and confinement like so: global Vec2Field u; global float texelSize; // Run to get curl for each point in grid float computeCurl(vec2 x) { float L = getVec2At(u, x + vec2(-texelSize, 0.)).y; float R = getVec2At(u, x + vec2(texelSize, 0.)).y; float T = getVec2At(u, x + vec2(0., texelSize)).x; float B = getVec2At(u, x + vec2(0., -texelSize)).x; return (R - L) - (T - B); } global Vec2Field curl; global float confinement; // Run to get confinement force for each point in grid vec2 confinementForce(vec2 x) { float L = getFloatAt(curl, x + vec2(-texelSize, 0.)); float R = getFloatAt(curl, x + vec2(texelSize, 0.)); float T = getFloatAt(curl, x + vec2(0., texelSize)); float B = getFloatAt(curl, x + vec2(0., -texelSize)); float C = getFloatAt(curl, x); vec2 N = vec2(abs(T) - abs(B), abs(R) - abs(L)); N = N / length(N); return confinement * C; } The full simulation with turbulence: let u = createVectorGrid(); let density = createScalarGrid(); let div = createScalarGrid(); let p = createScalarGrid(); let curl = createVectorGrid(); while (true) { // Solve for the next velocity field. u = advect(u, u); // Use vorticity confinement to amplify turbulence of velocity field. curl = computeCurl(u); u = u + confinementForce(curl, CONFINEMENT); // Enforce incompressibility with pressure projection. div = divergence(u); for (let i = 0; i 0 representing the temperature of the fluid everywhere. At every timestep, temperature is added to the system by the fuel, which burns at a given burn temperature: 𝑇 ′ = max ( 𝑇 , 𝜌 ∗ 𝑇 burn ) T′=max(T,ρ∗Tburn) Of course, temperature isn’t static - heat diffuses from hot to cold areas, and with fluids in particular, large-scale movements of molecules transport heat. The combination of these 2 processes defines heat convection, and conveniently, we already have a mathematical model for how it works - advection! Simulation-wise, we advect our temperature field along our velocity field. Since any reacting molecules are also moved by the fluid, we should advect fuel as well. The heat itself also affects the movement of the fluid - we’ll see how to handle this shortly. Furthermore, hot molecules radiate off temperature as light6 according to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, in a quintic equation [9]: 𝑇 ′ = 𝑇 − 𝜎 cool ( 𝑇 𝑇 max ) 4 ∗ Δ 𝑡 T′=T−σcool(TmaxT)4∗Δt Here, 𝜎 cool σcool is the cooling rate parameter. For a physically correct simulation, we would set it to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, but for a graphical simulation, it’s nice for the artist to be able to control the rate of cooling. To complete our combustion model, note that our fuel is always burning (we can imagine it as the density of ionized gas particles that give off thermal energy and return to a lower energy state), so every timestep we dissipate it by some given burn rate 𝛾 𝑓 𝑢 𝑒 𝑙 γfuel: 𝜌 ′ = 𝜌 ( 1 − 𝛾 𝑓 𝑢 𝑒 𝑙 ) Δ 𝑡 ρ′=ρ(1−γfuel)Δt 2.2 Thermal Buoyancy So far, our temperature field doesn’t do anything to our fluid flow. But it should - hot pockets of air should expand and rise, and cooler pockets should fall. We can model this with a thermal buoyancy force. Since we’re assuming incompressibility, we won’t actually handle air expansion, but the fluid flow should experience an upward force depending on temperature: 𝑢 ′ = 𝑢 + ( 𝛽 𝑇 Δ 𝑡 ) 𝑗 u′=u+(βTΔt)j Here, 𝛽 β is a given positive buoyancy constant, and 𝑗 j is the upward unit vector. Adding a combustion model and thermal buoyancy force gives us a fantastic simulator for a decidedly “fire-like” fluid - with the right values of buoyancy and cooling, we can get bulky, billowing plumes of material. Not exactly flames, but very similar to smoke. Tap and drag in the simulation below to inject some combusting fuel. The displayed pixels represent density of smoke particles, which dissipate at a constant rate instead of being used up during combustion, but are still advected by the fluid simulation. Click and hold Click and drag to add smoke above The simulation code builds off the basic fluid routines: let u = createVectorGrid(); let density = createScalarGrid(); let div = createScalarGrid(); let p = createScalarGrid(); let curl = createVectorGrid(); let fuel = createScalarGrid(); let temp = createScalarGrid(); while (true) { // Solve for the next velocity field. u = advect(u, u); // Combustion step. temp = combust(temp, fuel); // Use vorticity confinement to amplify turbulence of velocity field. curl = computeCurl(u); u = u + confineVorticity(curl, CONFINEMENT); // Add thermal buoyancy. u = u + buoyancy(temp); // Enforce incompressibility with pressure projection. div = divergence(u); for (let i = 0; i < JACOBI_ITERATIONS; i++) { p = updatePressure(p, div); } u = u - gradient(p); // Advect dye through the new velocity field. density = advect(u, density); } 2.3 Fire Rendering Fire is a participating medium, meaning it emits light through blackbody radiation7. This is what gives fire its orange and red colors; rendering our combusting fuel simulation using the correct formula is then all we need to go from smoke to fire! The temperature-to-color spectrum as described by Planck’s law Planck’s Law describes the spectral density of light radiated by a black body at a given temperature 𝑇 T: 𝑀 ( 𝜆 , 𝑇 ) = 𝑐 1 𝜆 5 1 exp ⁡ 𝑐 2 𝜆 𝑇 − 1 M(λ,T)=λ5c1expλTc2−11where 𝑐 1 = 2 𝜋 ℎ 𝑐 2 𝑐 2 = ℎ 𝑐 𝑘 c1=2πhc2c2=khcand ℎ h, 𝑐 c, and 𝑘 k are Planck’s constant, the speed of light, and Boltzmann’s constant, respectively. After implementing blackbody rendering using fragment shaders, we have a complete fire simulation! Click and hold Click and drag to add fire above That’s it for these notes! There is of course much more to fluid and fire simulation not covered here, like different (e.g. non-grid-based) techniques for solving the same problem of simulation within a fixed volume, different problems to solve involving varying domains or dynamic obstacles, enhancements to rendering like more accurate blackbody radiation, light scattering, or post-processing effects. Helpful introductions to these topics can be found in references below. Footnotes As seen below, our scalar field can be expressed as a differential equation. This idea is using Euler’s method to solve it. For a detailed derivation, see Chapter 1.3 of Chorin and Marsden (1993). Famous for the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem, one of the Clay Institute’s seven Millenium Prize problems in math. We are using a finite difference where the independent variable is the grid index. I suggest Dynamic Obstacles in GPU Gems 3 Chapter 30.2 [5] for details on adding this to our grid simulation. There are also non grid-based methods, but those are outside scope here. This is called blackbody radiation, and we’ll return to it when rendering the fire color. The soot particles present in most fire radiate like ideal blackbodies. Besides emitting its own blackbody radiation, fire also scatters light that passes through it. For more, see 5.1 in Nguyen et al. 2002 [9].

It feels similar to how I would imagine it feels to be a well-informed illusionist - the fun isn’t spoiled for me when seeing how the sausage is made - I just appreciate it on more levels. reply jameshart 5 hours agorootparentMy favorite example of the lie-concealed-within-the-lie is the ‘Half-Life Alyx Bottles’ thing.Like, watch this video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9XWxsJKpYYIThis is a whole story about how the liquids in the bottles ‘isn’t really there’ and how it’s not a ‘real physics simulation’ - all just completely ignoring that none of this is real.There is a sense in which the bottles in half-life Alyx are ‘fake’ - that they sort of have a magic painting on the outside of them that makes them look like they’re full of liquid and that they’re transparent. But there’s also a sense in which the bottles are real and the world outside them is fake.

There&#x27;s no diffraction, no interference patterns. You can&#x27;t simulate the double-slit experiment in a game engine, unless you explicitly program it.Our universe has a surprising amount of detail. We can&#x27;t even simulate the simplest molecular interactions fully. Even a collision of two hydrogen atoms is too hard - time resolution and space resolution is insanely high, if not infinite. reply Sharlin 1 hour agorootparentAnd what’s more, it simulates a very primitive idea of matter! All geometry is mathematically precise, still made of flat triangles that only approximate curved surfaces, every edge and corner is infinitely sharp, and everything related to materials and interaction with light (diffuse shading, specular highlights, surface roughness, bumpiness, transparency&#x2F;translucency, snd so on) are still the simplest possible models that five a somewhat plausible look, raytraced or not. reply ReactiveJelly 7 hours agorootparentprevEven the ray tracing &#x2F; path tracing is half-fake these days cause it&#x27;s faster to upscale and interpolate frames with neural nets. But yeah in theory you can simulate light realistically reply dexwiz 6 hours agorootparentIt’s still a model at the end of the day. Material properties like roughness are approximated with numerical values instead of being physical features.Also light is REALLY complicated when you get close to a surface. A light simulation that properly handles refraction, diffraction, elastic and inelastic scattering, and anisotropic material properties would be very difficult to build and run. It’s much easier to use material values found from experimental results. reply dahart 2 hours agorootparentIf I understood Feynman’s QED at all, light gets quite simple once you get close enough to the surface. ;) Isn’t the idea was that everything’s a mirror?

Bridson’s very cool paper makes curl noise much more controllable by adding the ability to insert and design boundary conditions, in order words, you can “paint” the noise field and put objects into the noise field and have particles advect around them. Mine and Joe’s version was a turbulence field based on simply taking the curl of a noise field because curl has the property of being incompressible. Thought about it after watching some effects breakdown on X-men’s Nightcrawler teleport effect and they talked about using a fluid simulation IIRC to get the nice subtleties that incompressible “divergence-free” flows give you. BTW I don’t remember exactly how they calculated their turbulence, I have a memory of it being more complicated than curl noise, but maybe they came up with the idea, or maybe it predates X-men too; it’s a very simple idea based on known math, fun and effective for fake fluid simulation.We liked to call it “curly noise” when we first did it, and I used it on some shots and shared it with other effects animators at DreamWorks at the time. Actually the very first name we used was “curl of noise” because the implementation was literally curl(noise(x)), but curly noise sounded better&#x2F;cuter. Curly noise is neat because it’s static and analytic, so you can do a fluid-like looking animation sequence with every frame independently. You don’t need to simulate frame 99 in order to render frame 100, you can send all your frames to the farm to render independently. On the other hand, one thing that’s funny about curly noise is that it’s way more expensive to evaluate at a point in space than a voxel grid fluid update step, at least when using Perlin noise which is what I started with. (Curly noise was cheaper than using PDI’s (Nick Foster’s) production fluid solver at the time, but I think the Stam semi-Lagrangian advection thing started making it’s way around and generally changed things soon after that.)BTW gaseous giganticus looks really neat!

GPU&#x27;s are so powerful now that you can do physics, fancy render passes, fluid sims, \"Game AI\" unit pathing, and more, at 100+ FPS.Long answer: You have a \"frame budget\" which is the amount of time between rendering the super fast \"slide show\" of frames at 60+ FPS. This gives you between 5 and 30 ms to do a bunch of computation to get the results you need to compute state and render the next frame.That could be moving units around a map, calculating fire physics, blitting terrain textures, rendering verts with materials. In many game engines, you will see a GPU doing dozens of these separate computations per frame.GPU&#x27;s are basically just a secondary computer attached to your main computer. You give it a bunch of jobs to do every frame and it outputs the results. You combine results into something that looks like a game.> Can this stuff run on an iGPU while the dGPU is doing more rendering-related tasks?Almost no one is using the iGPU for anything.

It&#x27;s completely ignored because it&#x27;s usually completely useless compared to your main discrete GPU.Modern iGPUs are actually quite powerful is my understanding. I think the reason no one does this is that the software model isn’t actually there&#x2F;standardized&#x2F;able to work cross vendor since the iGPU and the discrete card are going to be different vendors typically. There’s also little motivation to do this because not everyone has an iGPU which dilutes the economy of scale of using it.It would be a neat idea to try to run lighter weight things on the iGPU to free up rendering time on the dGPU and make frame rates more consistent, but the incentives aren’t there. reply softfalcon 13 hours agorootparentI agree the incentives aren&#x27;t there. Also agree that it is possible to use the integrated GPU for light tasks, but only light tasks.In the high performance scenarios where there is all three (discrete GPU, integrated GPU, and CPU) and we try and use the integrated GPU alongside the CPU, it often causes thermal throttling on the shared die between iGPU and CPU.This slows the CPU down from executing well, keeping up with state changes, and sending needed data to the keep the discrete GPU utilized. In short, don&#x27;t warm up the CPU, we want it to stay cool, if that means not doing iGPU stuff, don&#x27;t do it.When we have multiple discrete GPU&#x27;s available (render farm), this on-die thermal bottleneck goes away and there are many render pipelines that are made to handle hundreds, even thousands of simultaneous GPU&#x27;s working on a shared problem set of diverse tasks, similar to trying to utilize both iGPU and dGPU on the same machine but bigger.Whether or not to use the iGPU is less about scheduling and more about thermal throttling. reply vlovich123 6 hours agorootparentThat’s probably a better point as to why it’s not invested in although most games are not CPU bound so thermal throttling wouldn’t apply then as much. I think it’s multiple factors combined.The render pipelines you refer to are all offline non-realtime rendering though for movies&#x2F;animation&#x2F;etc right?

Many games suffer in performance due to folks not knowing how to use the GPU properly.Because of this, nVidia&#x2F;AMD invest heavily in making general purpose compute easier and easier on the GPU. The successes they have had in doing this over the last decade are nothing less than staggering.Ultimately, the way it&#x27;s looking, GPU&#x27;s are trying to become good at everything the CPU does and then some. We already have modern cloud server architectures that are 90% GPU and 10% CPU as a complete SoC.Eventually, the CPU may cease to exist entirely as its fundamental design becomes obsolete. This is usually called a GPGPU in modern server infrastructure. reply vlovich123 13 hours agorootparentI’m pretty sure CPUs destroy GPUs at sequential programming and most programs are written in a sequential style. Not sure where the 90&#x2F;10 claim comes from but there’s plenty of cloud servers with no GPU installed whatsoever and 0 servers without a CPU. reply softfalcon 13 hours agorootparentYup, and until we get a truly general purpose compute GPU that can handle both styles of instruction with automated multi-threading and state management, this will continue.What I&#x27;ve seen shows me that nVidia is working very hard to eliminate this gap though. General purpose computing on the GPU has never been easier, and it gets better every year.In my opinion, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before we can run anything we want on the GPU and realize various speed gains.As for where the 90&#x2F;10 comes from, it&#x27;s from the emerging architectures for advanced AI&#x2F;graphics compute like the DGX H100 [0].[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nvidia.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;data-center&#x2F;dgx-h100&#x2F; reply vlovich123 8 hours agorootparentAI is different. Those servers are set up to run AI jobs & nothing else. That’s still a small fraction of overall cloud machines at the moment. Even if in volume they overtake, that’s just because of the huge surge in demand for AI * the compute requirements associated with it eclipsing the compute requirements for “traditional” cloud compute that is used to keep businesses running. I don’t think you’ll see GPUs running things like databases or the Linux kernel. GPUs may even come with embedded ARM CPUs to run the kernel & only run AI tasks as part of the package as a cost reduction, but I think that’ll take a very long time because you have to figure out how to do cotenancy. It’ll depend on if the CPU remains a huge unnecessary cost for AI servers. I doubt that GPUs will get much better at sequential tasks because it’s an essential programming tradeoff (e.g. it’s the same reason you don’t see everything written in SIMD as SIMD is much closer to GPU-style programming than the more general sequential style) reply kqr 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is somewhat reassuring.

GamersNexus has done a bunch of videos on the topic. reply softfalcon 13 hours agorootparentYou are not wrong that there are many games that are bottle-necked on lower end CPUs.I would argue that for many CPU bound games, they could find better ways to utilize the GPU for computation and it is likely they just didn&#x27;t have the knowledge, time, or budget to do so.It&#x27;s easier to write CPU code, every programmer can do it, so it&#x27;s the most often reached for tool.Also, at high frame rates, the bottleneck is frequently the CPU due to it not feeding the GPU fast enough, so you lose frames.

The die heats up, CPU thermal throttles, CPU stops efficiently feeding data to the GPU at max speed, GPU slows down from under utilization.In high performance scenarios, the integrated GPU is often a waste of thermal budget. reply MaxBarraclough 12 hours agorootparentDoesn&#x27;t this assume inadequate cooling? A quick google indicates AMD&#x27;s X3D CPUs begin throttling around 89°C, and that it&#x27;s not overly challenging to keep them below 80 even under intense CPU load, although that&#x27;s presumably without any activity on the integrated GPU.Assuming cooling really is inadequate for running both the CPU cores and the integrated GPU: for GPU-friendly workloads (i.e. no GPU-unfriendly preprocessing operations for the CPU) it would surely make more sense to use the integrated GPU rather than spend the thermal budget having the CPU cores do that work. reply softfalcon 11 hours agorootparentWhat the specs say they&#x27;ll do and what they actually do are often very different realities in my experience.I&#x27;ve seen thermal throttling happening at 60°C because overall, the chip is cool, but one core is maxing or two cores are maxing. Which is common in game dev with your primary thread feeding a GPU with command buffer queues and another scheduling the main game loop.Even when water cooled or the high end air cooling on my server blades, I see that long term, the system just hits a trade-off point of ~60-70°C and ~85% max CPU clock even when the cooling system is industry grade, loud as hell, and has an HVAC unit backing it. Probably part of why scale out is so popular to distribute load.When I give real work to any iGPU&#x27;s on these systems, I see the temps bump 5-10°C and clocks on the CPU cores drop a bit. Could be drivers, could be temp curves, I would think these fancy cooling systems I&#x27;m running are performing well though. shrug replydexwiz 14 hours agoparentprevYou don&#x27;t have to be gaming to use a GPU.

Lots of people say Houdini is more like an IDE than a 3D modelling program, and I agree in many ways. Rather than using the visual tools like in, say, blender, it&#x27;s almost entirely based on creating a network of nodes, and modifying attributes and parameters. You can do most stuff in Python more cleanly than others like 3ds Max, though it won&#x27;t compile, so the performance is bad in big sims.

    "originBody": "NEWS REVIEWS SHOP CARS FORUM USA / GLOBAL Home Volkswagen News Volkswagen Will Bring Back Physical Buttons In New Cars Down with touch screen controls. Dec 18, 2023 at 2:30pm ET By: Rob Stumpf Volkswagen is still intent on marching its entire lineup of vehicles toward electrification in many of its markets. With that modernization of vehicle powertrains also comes more contemporary interiors; that means meshing design languages with current industry trends like minimalism, which involves ditching physical interior buttons with touch screen controls. Get Fully Charged Criticism for lack of real buttons has convinced VW to backtrack. VW will insert real buttons back into its cars after facing heavy criticism for its lack of buttons and complex infotainment operations. Unfortunately for VW, that hasn't exactly been well received by consumers. Owners have pushed back against the German automaker moving controls to the large tablet-like infotainment touch screen on the dashboard and haptic-based steering wheel buttons, finally forcing the automaker to reverse its decision on going buttonless—and that all starts with the new ID.2all concept. Volkswagen has been trying to fix its interiors for a few years now. Under former CEO Herbert Diess, the German automaker decided to follow in Tesla's footsteps and centralize a vast majority of its controls to the infotainment screen. It also removed the physical buttons from its steering wheels and replaced them with touch-sensitive capacitive buttons instead. This move, according to VW, \"frustrated customers who shouldn't be frustrated.\" The automaker has since reverted its since on the steering wheel buttons and is looking to now claw back its reputation for something that its current CEO, Thomas Schäfer, says \"did a lot of damage\" to the brand. That change all starts with the Volkswagen ID 2. Recently, VW's interior designer, Darius Watola, spoke to Autocar on the ID.2 concept's take on the company's design language for future vehicle interiors. Watola confirmed that the concept showed a new approach for all models across the VW brand which was revamped due to customer feedback. A row of physical, backlit buttons now sits directly below the touch screen on the ID.2 concept. The buttons provide customers with easy access to commonly used HVAC controls, which—while it doesn't address every control in the car—is a step in the right direction. The car will also get a manual volume button and a large center knob (a la BMW iDrive) which provides complementary controls for other aspects of the vehicle. The controls also clearly lean on the importance of feel, even featuring metal knurling so occupants can easily feel them without taking their eyes off of the road. \"Once you have it, don't touch it again,\" said Volkswagen CEO Thomas Schäfer in an interview with Autocar earlier this year. \"Bloody leave it. Don't confuse our customers every time a new model comes out and something is completely different. Optimize it. Bring into the future. But don't change buttons from here to there, to there and here.\" It's no secret that consumers have pushed back on automakers who simply slapped an iPad on the dashboard in place of physical controls. Heck, Volkswagen isn't the first automaker to change its stance back to the old-school physical button approach, either. Let's be real—if Volkswagen is really trying to regain its relevancy in markets like the United States (even if this change was geared at the European market), it has to take customer feedback seriously. And it looks like the Germans are starting to do exactly that.

Real estate is a practical limitation and so forces trade-offs.The big difference with a phone&#x2F;tablet is that you&#x27;re looking at the screen when using it. That&#x27;s fundamental to the interaction experience. Cars are _completely_ different: a driver should be looking at *the road*.Touchscreens as the main control interface for cars were a stupifying dumb idea right from the start. It&#x27;s as if the alphageeks burst through the design studio doors, shunted the ergnonomicists aside, and proclaimed anything physical was neanderthal and out of date. Behold, the emperor has new clothes! \"We can do all this in SOFTWARE, and it&#x27;s adaptable, we can use clever colours, and look if you just tap this menu three times and slide along here, YOU CAN BOOST THE BASS IN THE RIGHT REAR SPEAKER!

A standardized API and connector, and you could have a choice of aftermarket UI -- screens, buttons, knobs, whatever. You could get used to it and bring it with you for rentals or to your new car. reply alkonaut 20 hours agoprevThe design in the pic looks reasonable. Big screen for nav, setup, rarely used functions. Then a set buttons with a knob for volume (or other rotary control when in setup mode on the screen) and buttons around it to provide just the minimum functions you need while driving such as defrosters and climate control.You really don&#x27;t need a lot of physical buttons for a car UX to be safe. And each button shouldn&#x27;t need a separate cable. That button pad can be the exact sam N buttons for every model, every trim, and regardless of which side the steering wheel is on. The design with \"flying\" screens in front of the dashboard feels modern but it&#x27;s of course a cost saving, which can be copied for the button pads. And use a single cable to the button console. I can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a massive production headache or cost if it&#x27;s built that way.It&#x27;s not 1989 you don&#x27;t need 2 wires per button and 9 buttons for favorite radio stations. reply hdjY28 20 hours agoparentAh, the sweet spot between a cockpit and a calculator.

And yeah, a universal button pad is like the Swiss Army knife of car controls – versatile, yet uncomplicated. Let&#x27;s keep the touchscreens for Candy Crush and leave driving to the buttons. reply pmontra 20 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m tech savvy but I take physical buttons over touchscreen all the times. I switch radio channels with a wheel on a stick on the steering wheel, change volume with two buttons there. I don&#x27;t dare using the touchpad for anything complex while driving.Then there is the thing I never understood: we can&#x27;t use a phone while driving but we can use the touchscreen of the car, which is basically the same thing. Actually I understand why we can&#x27;t (or we don&#x27;t want to) piss off car makers and all their money, but yet where is the logic in that from the point of view of safety? reply jansan 18 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m tech savvy but I take physical buttons over touchscreen all the times.Are you sure? I am all in favor of physical buttons where you need quick access, for example steering wheel and climate control. But touch screens are quite awesome to simplify access to more complicated settings.

Why not have that? reply fishywang 18 hours agoparentprevThey should just copy Mazda&#x27;s design, a screen that&#x27;s not touch enabled and do not need to be put within arm&#x27;s reach (so it can be put further away, and thus closer to driver&#x27;s point of view when driving, that driver just need to glance slightly to the side to see the screen).Then physical buttons&#x2F;controls for common things (volume, wiper, etc.), and a general knob for navigating things on the screen. reply jsight 19 hours agoparentprevAgreed, the VW approach here looks pretty good. It might even have fewer physical controls than the id.4? reply jollyllama 19 hours agoparentprevFrom what I understand, even ICE cars have more wiring than ever. reply tinco 19 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s a reference to something Elon Musk recently said about the 48 volt system in the Cybertruck. Apparently switching to 48v allows them to use ethernet in the car and save 77% on wiring.I&#x27;m not sure why 48V specifically makes this feasible, though it definitely makes it more efficient (and lighter). I watched a video on it a couple weeks ago and it made sense to me then, now I&#x27;m not sure why you couldn&#x27;t make a 12V network. Maybe it&#x27;s just more expensive.Apparently the Cybertruck is the only or one of the very few cars that have done this. reply djaychela 14 hours agorootparent48v and the ethernet are not totally related, you could have a 48v car with the same wiring as before (just thinner wires which is the big saving for 48v). Ethernet allows even more saving on wire as you don&#x27;t need point to point wiring for many specific features, you can just put a node which connects to the network and does the function you need. Old school wiring looms had a lot of point to point wiring on them. My suspicion is that future ones will be really simple as they will need only power and comms, with all the complexity offloaded to the network devices, as it were. reply bluGill 19 hours agorootparentprev48V isn&#x27;t what enables Ethernet, it does however make it more useful. 48V enables high power things to be scattered around the car - voltage loss from the front to the back of a car at 12V is an issue, and cars spend a lot of money on large wires to work around that.High power things scattered around the car often can take advantage of Ethernet. things that cannot get a lot of power can get by on lower bandwidth data buses. reply bbarn 18 hours agorootparentThe 12V loss is something that really sunk in working on older cars. You wouldn&#x27;t think a cable that read 0 on the ohmeter could still not sufficiently carry power, but it happens. Starter systems especially - My old van I remember wouldn&#x27;t start once and all I had to do was clean the terminals on the battery with a wire brush. reply hajile 19 hours agorootparentprevPoE (power over ethernet) spec specifies 48 volts, so if you want to use off-the-shelf stuff, you need to use 48 volts. reply karolist 19 hours agorootparentprevBMW started using fiber optic cables in their cars in 2003 (with the introduction of 5 series E60) for CAN comms between modules, the reason was that in case of side crash the repair costs were super high to reconnect a baseball bat width worth of copper routed front to back. It&#x27;s not new. reply jollyllama 19 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the explainer, the 1989 comment threw me off. reply Maxion 19 hours agorootparentprev48V is a common POE standard.

I have a Taos, so I paid less for a better experience than a GTI or ID4 driver. reply jamincan 20 hours agoparentI just bought a Taos this past July and the general familiarity of the interior controls (pretty much all buttons) coming from a Mk7 Golf was a big factor in going with it. reply javier_e06 20 hours agoprevThe dashboard test: Arrive from a long flight at night at the airport, get a car rental, attempt to operate the buttons to enter the gps address of the hotel and turn on the headlights on before exiting the parking lot.

Especially basic climate and media controls have no business in cascaded touchscreen menus and these things probably have caused countless accidents. reply metafunctor 20 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been driving a new Tesla for the past months, and the on-screen climate and media controls actually don&#x27;t bother me much at all. Granted, it&#x27;s not actually a cascaded menu, so maybe I&#x27;m not really responding to your argument at all. Which car does have climate controls hidden in a cascaded menu, and not available more easily?In a Tesla, these things are in a predictable place physically and the controls respond quite nicely. I can use the scroll buttons and other buttons on the yoke to control these and various other things without taking my eyes off the traffic. There&#x27;s even good voice control for things like navigation (“take me home”).However, I&#x27;ve encountered some challenges with the blinker controls, particularly when the yoke isn&#x27;t upright. I&#x27;ve gotten more accustomed to their placement and can usually find the right spot instinctively, but occasionally, they either don&#x27;t respond or I press the wrong area. It&#x27;s a minor but noticeable annoyance.

Much like physical dials. I would slightly prefer physical dials, but not something I would need to adjust during drives almost ever, so I don’t see a problem here. reply amluto 17 hours agorootparentI don’t know about recent ones, but in old ones you need to long press the wheel to get a menu to select what it controls, then select a mode, then adjust the temp.And the media controls are a mess that changes periodically with updates. reply hef19898 19 hours agorootparentprevJaguar does that, at least in the latest XE (which stole the screens and such from the iPace if I am not mistaken):- climate control, driving modes, gearbox etc... are all physical buttons.

That is not a good time to take your eyes off the road, except maybe if you&#x27;re Elon Musk.Also, on the one Tesla I&#x27;ve driven i couldn&#x27;t understand how the turn stalk (it still had a physical turn stalk, I believe Musk has apologized for not removing that one physical control from the car) worked.

Why not just allow this small added feature which you don’t have to use?That’s a great general question that can be asked in many places that software dwells. My answer and thinking is therefore general as well. It’s a trap. What would the great Stallman say about touchscreens in the cockpit? He would be correct too.

In the case of the newer Plaid S and X they automatically shift into reverse for you when needed, without any need to use the touch screen at all.I&#x27;m not sure when you would use neutral but I suppose in a service situation, something pretty unusual and again on the vast majority of Teslas, whether you count by the number of models or the number of individual shipped cars, that&#x27;s also done with a physical stalk so the touch screen is really a non-issue here. Yes, shifting into neutral is done with the physical stalk. As is reverse and drive.But perception matters. I think Tesla should do a better job educating the public about their cars, because people form all sorts of opinions and then it&#x27;s hard to even have a conversation because the baseline knowledge about what is going on has to be totally reset. Even people who drive a Tesla once come away mistakenly thinking it has no buttons (!!), which is so far from the truth it&#x27;s hard to fathom what phenomenon we are witnessing here. reply danielvaughn 11 hours agorootparentEven if it has some physical buttons, just take a look at the interior of a Tesla. It doesn&#x27;t have nearly enough. I drove it for about 6 hours (it was a rental). And I distinctly remember being aggravated by the lack of physical controls. If they want to change their perception, maybe have more than just a touch screen in the middle of their dashboard. reply natch 10 hours agorootparentThey don’t care about their perception.

It offers a tangible, physical sense of control. Not sure what Tesla did with the Model S, but it almost feels like a kart car in this sense. The steering responds immediately, and I can “feel” the road.

But as someone who drove a Toyota pickup around with completely manual steering, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s only really bad at low speeds, where it&#x27;s a bit of an arm workout. reply bluGill 19 hours agorootparentThere are many ways to do steering. Until the 1950s nobody had power steering and didn&#x27;t miss it.

This makes it more intuitive and also more safe to control frequently-modified functionality while keeping eyes on the road.I believe this is an essential safety issue, and it’s infuriating that companies with billions of dollars in resources and, presumably, lots of engineers and designers and usability experts with concerns that are probably ignored.

There are two components to not having to take your eyes off the road: first, you need to be able to find the controls. And second, you need to know exactly what the knob that you find will do when you change it.A dynamic tactile touch screen solves the problem of finding the controls, but if the knob that you find could be the volume or the temperature depending on the mode the UI is in, you&#x27;re still likely to look down to check which one it is.Edit: And even some clever solution like giving different shapes to different modes doesn&#x27;t help a ton, because that still uses more brain cycles and time than \"reach for where I know the volume knob is and turn it left\". You&#x27;d have to reach out and feel the control, and if it&#x27;s the wrong one then reach for the mode switcher and then find the correct control.

We, as in contemporary humans, continue to devalue our attention&#x2F;focus in regards to our technology.

This is a ridiculous idea. reply dax_ 19 hours agoparentprevI agree that there should be physical buttons, however in most of these cars you can use voice input for adjusting AC as well.

Talking is far more distracting to me than pushing a physical button. It actually takes more brain power to talk than to navigate a screen interface, but the screen interface is still worse because I have to take my eyes off the road, but talking is a close second. If I&#x27;m in a high-interaction driving environment (ie not an express way with low traffic), I will literally, unconsciously slow down if you ask me a complex question.

That&#x27;s a ridiculous amount over regulation. reply Joker_vD 19 hours agorootparentYeah, and you aren&#x27;t allowed to drink while driving either. The oppression! reply boringg 19 hours agorootparentI have to assume you were trying to make a joke but have made the mistake of confusing drinking alcohol that impacts your mind with eating food that is a fuel for your body.It was a valiant (&#x2F;S) effort! reply Joker_vD 18 hours agorootparentYou know, it&#x27;s amazing how wildly different expectations people from different places have. Really highlights the completely arbitrary&#x2F;social nature of most of our customs. One person thinks \"why would you even consider eating while driving, this is so insane on so many levels I don&#x27;t even know where to start enumerating them\" while another thinks \"of course I should be allowed to eat while driving, that&#x27;s one of the most natural things\".A couple of days ago there was an article on HN about the littering behaviour and causes of it. As some commenters noticed, the main reason is simply that people do whatever the hell they feel like doing, without much consideration. Driving and suddenly feel hungry? Eat something right now. There is a wrapper paper in one of your hands now and it&#x27;s inconvenient to hold it while eating and driving? Throw it out of the window. Etc.And yes, I&#x27;ve seen debaters on the Internet arguing for allowing DUI, for non-requirement of seat belts, for allowing smoking in public places etc, basically for anything that mildly inconveniences a person for a vague personal and&#x2F;or public benefit. And on HN too, about a year or so ago?P.S. About \"eating food that is a fuel for your body\" — there&#x27;s a fancy term \"postprandial somnolence\" for that feeling of drowsiness after a meal. Definitely something you&#x27;d like to experience while driving (&#x2F;S). reply boringg 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m guessing you live in a place where you don&#x27;t actually travel that far or has significant mass transit options available to you. Most likely a country in the EU (aka very small distances). You should come visit North America and try and understand how different rural North America is compared to anywhere the EU.I would argue that the customs and expectations from different places arise from the different needs in those communities and&#x2F;or the level of regulation that is tolerated from the people. Switzerland has a lot of winding mountain roads - so likely need two hands on the wheel at all times whereas North America has a lot of flat straight roads where it is quite reasonable to drive with one hand on the wheel for short periods of time. Also Tesla auto-pilot helps out.Additionally I suspect that you argue so strongly in favor of no eating in your car makes me think that you live in a state with very strong control of your population and it is well tolerated by the population - with assumed upside benefits as a result. replylondons_explore 19 hours agoparentprevMight be worth blocking all controls, touchscreen or not, while the car is in motion.If you need to turn on the defroster, pull over, turn on the defroster, and pull away again. reply amonavis 19 hours agorootparentI can think of many scenarios in which this can be actually dangerous.

At a previous job we moved all our less expensive products to capacitive touch buttons and resistive touch screens because it&#x27;s tremendously cheaper than physical buttons.Cap touch buttons or physical buttons both require a circuit board, so that costs the same, but cap touch buttons just need one big sheet of material with some screen printing placed over the circuit board. Physical clicky buttons require each button to be designed, manufactured, screen printed, and the clicky action to be tuned for feel and durability, none of which is cheap. Physical buttons may not all be exactly the same size and shape due to design considerations, so that&#x27;s injection mold tooling variations, additional supply chain part numbers to manage, and additional ways that manufacturing can screw up assembly. Physical buttons can jam, get stuck, or fall out, so engineering time needs to be spent ensuring this won&#x27;t happen 10 years from now, too. reply coldpie 19 hours agorootparent> At a previous job we moved all our less expensive products to capacitive touch buttons and resistive touch screens because it&#x27;s tremendously cheaper than physical buttons.I hate whoever was responsible this decision.

You still need wires for power, you can’t be swapping batteries in car accessories as you can in your home. If you are already running wires for power, running 1-2 more for data is not that problematic, you are already running the harness. In addition, you don’t want the latency and unreliability of wireless solutions in a car. It might be ok in your home, but not in a pretty rough environment such as your car. It would also be much more expensive both hardware and software wise, not even mentioning the potential bugs and such. reply Vespasian 20 hours agorootparentExactly.

    "originBody": "./techtipsy About Posts About Posts My cat water fountain comes with a spicy USB power adapter 2023-12-19 — 3 min read #random #ramblings It turns out that you can’t trust any USB type A power adapter to be within spec. I have a Catit Flower Fountain for my two adorable cats. The idea of a water fountain for cats may sound odd, but having one really helps with cats staying hydrated and that alone avoids all sorts of health issues. At one point I wanted to see if I could create a sort of a DIY UPS for the water fountain. It would be quite bad if I was at work and a power outage results in cats not being able to drink water (they don’t really care for normal water bowls after getting the fountain). I had some battery banks available for testing, and I noticed that the pump for the water fountain is powered over a USB type A cable. Should be easy, right? Apparently not. I tried multiple different power banks between the water fountain and the USB power adapter that came with it, and all of them would work for a bit and turn off after some time. I didn’t think much of it back then, but I did notice that two of the power banks I used started glitching out during normal use elsewhere. Months later, I attached an IKEA power strip to the side of my work desk to make charging various things easier. It also has two USB type A ports and the water fountain was near the desk temporarily, so I plugged it in there. It worked, but I noticed that the water fountain was quieter now, the “hum” that it makes was almost gone. That made me curious, so I used the original adapter again and the “hum” was there again. I took a look at the original power adapter specs to see if there’s a difference in the amount of current that these two different USB power sources provide. What I discovered instead was that the power adapter that comes with the fountain outputs a solid 7.5V. I measured the voltage with my multimeter as well, and it reports 7.71V. USB type A ports typically provide about 5V, with a maximum of 5.25V from my observations in the real world. Yikes. 7.5V over USB type A is probably not safe with other devices, especially since a normal person only sees a USB port on the adapter and thinks that it is perfectly safe to use it to charge their phone or other devices. Yes, properly implemented USB type C ports can negotiate all sorts of voltages, but this is not one of them. Probably explains why my power banks are acting odd now and glitching out. This is why I have trust issues. 2023-12-19 update By popular demand, here are the two adorable cats. Tux and Põssa. Põssa can be roughly translated to \"Piggy\" in English.

You always need to check the voltage rating before randomly plugging stuff in if it isn&#x27;t from a big manufacturer.For example, the handwarmers I&#x27;m using right now are USB-A at 12 volts, but have a dial to adjust the voltage up and down between 0 volts and 12 volts to adjust the temperature (I think it&#x27;s actually PWM on the 12v power lines, but haven&#x27;t actually checked).5.5V or 6V is also common because it lets you use thin cheap wires which remove about a volt and still can fast charge phones (which tend to be picky and will drop back to 500mA charging if the voltage droops).Big manufacturers also use non-5V over USB sometimes, but you need to send a special message to enable higher voltages, so it&#x27;s safe to plug them into anything. Still troublesome if you&#x27;re using a USB Y-splitter or multi-headeded cable. reply rahimnathwani 20 hours agoparentWhere in Asia?

But if you plugged the AC adapter in to the DC modem it would make a noise like you curled the modem up into a ball and let the magic smoke out. reply npteljes 16 hours agorootparentBarrel plugs are not better technically, but it would be better to use them with random voltages because people don&#x27;t assume that they conform to a standard. With barrel plugs, the customer expectation is that every device has its own charger, and that&#x27;s that. With USB, the assumption is that they are all compatible. reply moffkalast 16 hours agorootparentWith barrel plugs the likelyhood that one of your devices will have one that fits into another is basically zero too. reply lolc 12 hours agorootparentI keep power supplies around when the device they were supposed to power goes out of service.

On cities which use 127V as the standard voltage (some cities use 220V), you can get 220V by using a pair of phases instead of a phase and the neutral, and it&#x27;s common to find a few standard-looking sockets which are 220V instead of 127V. They might be colored red, they might have a yellow sticker saying \"220V\" next to it, or they might be completely unmarked. If your device is 127V only, or it has a manual 127V&#x2F;220V switch which is on the 127V position, and you plug it into one of these 220V sockets, it will be damaged.(The standard we use for consumer AC power plugs and sockets, NBR 14136, does not make a distinction between voltages; the same plugs and sockets are used for both 127V and 220V.) reply stephen_g 18 hours agorootparentThat sounds incredibly error prone and actually quite dangerous! At least a lot of AC to DC converters are universal voltage and frequency, but not all appliances!In Australia we have only one voltage that will ever come out of a single phase socket, but the standards took the opposite approach with current ratings - the sockets are cleverly designed in terms of their current capacity so (assuming it’s been installed correctly) you can’t make mistakes without illegal and dangerous modifications. In the standard socket, you can have 10 amp, 15 amp or 20 amp, and they all have different sized pins. For the 15 amp plug and socket, the ground pin is larger, so a 15 amp plug cannot fit into a 10 amp socket. A 20 amp plug has all three pins larger, so it doesn’t fit in a 10 amp or 15 amp socket. But a 10 amp plug can still fit and sit snugly in a 15 or 20 amp socket, and a 15 amp can still fit into a 20 amp socket with no problems. It’s pretty clever.For bigger stuff, or anything three-phase, you then have big industrial circular ones, which I think have a similar system to not let you plug a higher current device into a socket that can’t supply enough current. I believe there are also three phase plugs and sockets both with neutral and without neutral, and if the plug has a neutral pin it doesn’t fit into a socket that doesn’t supply neutral. reply terom 18 hours agorootparent> But a 10 amp plug can still fit and sit snugly in a 15 or 20 amp socket, and a 15 amp can still fit into a 20 amp socket with no problems.

The larger fuse sized for the 20A socket will not protect the smaller conductors in the cable sized for the 10A plug, they can get overloaded.The three-phase &#x2F; industrial CEE plugs and sockets used in the EU are sized for 16A&#x2F;32A&#x2F;63A&#x2F;125A. It&#x27;s perfectly legal and safe to make a passive adapter that lets you plug a 32A appliance or distribution box into a 16A socket, you just can&#x27;t load it higher than the 16A fuses on the socket. Going the other way around (16A plug into a 32A socket) you MUST have a circuit breaker in between to provide the required overload protection. reply Tyrannosaur 17 hours agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t make sense though. The fuses aren&#x27;t to protect the load; they are to protect the circuit. It&#x27;s up to whatever device you are plugging in to not draw more current than it can handle.If I have a 3 Watt doohickey, I don&#x27;t go looking around to find a 0.025A socket, I plug it in to my 15A wall socket and everything works great. reply terom 17 hours agorootparentYeah, the risks mainly come with extension cords, like plugging a bunch of 10A appliances into a single 20A outlet via a 10A rated extension cord with multiple 10A outlets.Appliances themselves with their own input fuses and captive cables are less risky, although some kind of internal wiring short could still get all melty.It&#x27;s true that sizing the plugs that way does prevent you from plugging a 20A appliance into a 10A extension cord, which makes sense. reply bdavbdav 17 hours agorootparentprevEach individual socket isn’t fused though. The entire circuit is. The fuse(breaker) is going to be significantly bigger than any of those amperages.The breaker is there to protect the wiring in the building, nothing more. It’s spec’d to the gauge of the cable in the wall typically. reply HalcyonCowboy 17 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not dangerous in practice. Reading through NEC in the US, there&#x27;s plenty of leeway for mixing ampacity ratings on circuits, within certain limits. For example, it&#x27;s fine to have 10x 15A duplex on a 20A circuit. It results in less wiring, and allows for logical grouping of circuits. Electrical code starts from the the most common causes of electrical failures, and tries to design down from there. The ampacity ratings on devices and various components of the circuit are designed to reject the common causes of failure, and conductor failure at the device isn&#x27;t one of them (appliance manufacturers are more likely to get their devices certified, so if there&#x27;s a failure in the appliance, some other part of the appliance&#x27;s electrical system will fail before the conductors do).So the ampacity of the connector (duplex and plug) is meant to reject certain combinations (plugging a 30amp appliance into a 15amp duplex&#x2F;circuit). It&#x27;s obviously very easy to get around that by just wiring things together wrong (18AWG wire on a 30Amp circuit), but by design, a 30amp appliance with the proper plug cannot be plugged into a 15amp outlet.Of course, this is informed by the electrical code in my home country, so I understand that other places and people have different experiences, but electrical accidents have been on a steady downward trend since the 80&#x27;s, so the NFPA NEC has to be doing at least some things right. reply terom 16 hours agorootparentIt is indeed very regional, e.g. the UK has its own thing going on with ring mains and fused plugs.Over in my 230V corner of the EU, CEE 7&#x2F;3 sockets are pretty much the only thing I&#x27;m aware of for new wiring, with the unearthed CEE 7&#x2F;1 sockets still present in older installations. Both are rated for 16A, with either 10A&#x2F;1.5mm² or 16A&#x2F;2.5mm² branch circuits from the distribution board. It would be unheard of to wire those up with any higher ampacity at risk of overloading the sockets - although recent experience with e.g. EVs has shown that they&#x27;re not actually suitable for sustained loads at 16A, given e.g. wear and tear on the sockets.Unearthed appliances do commonly have CEE 7&#x2F;16 plugs rated for 2.5A, particularly things like wall warts or USB chargers, which does fit into a CEE 7&#x2F;3 socket.I recall seeing CEE 7&#x2F;16 (2.5A europlug) sockets, although those may have been imports from elsewhere in the EU. I suppose those would have the same issues if wired up to the same distribution circuits. But extension cables for those are rarer, the only ones I&#x27;ve ever seen are CEE 7&#x2F;7 plug (16A) -> CEE 7&#x2F;16 sockets (2.5A).For residential&#x2F;commercial loads over 16A &#x2F; 3.2kW, it&#x27;s all CEE &#x2F; IEC 60309 connectors, and those are treated like distribution circuits with overload protection sized appropriately for the connectors&#x2F;cables. reply unwind 17 hours agorootparentprevIs \"ampacity\" really a better word than \"current\"? And the unit symbol is just \"A\", like \"30 A\".I realize I&#x27;m nitty but this is a technical-minded forum after all. reply jcrawfordor 17 hours agorootparent\"ampacity\" means \"capacity in amperes\" or more literally \"ampere capacity.\" You could say current capacity too but it takes longer. Ampacity is the language used in the electrical code.\"amp\" also seems to be more common to write than \"A\" for electricians. Remember that the SI standardization of unit abbreviations is actually a pretty modern thing, so lots of fields existed before unit abbreviations were standardized and continue to use existing practices. reply unwind 13 hours agorootparentAh I did not get that meaning, then obviously it&#x27;s a perfectly cromulent word.

If you glance at my comment again, you&#x27;ll see my usage devolve from A to amp halfway through, my brain can&#x27;t help but write what it sounds like to me.Yes though, ampacity is the correct word (for my home country). \"Current\" is an instantaneous measurement of current flow.

It has 10A and 20A variants, and the only difference is that 20A has slightly larger pins, so it won&#x27;t fit into a 10A socket. (And the international standard it was based on, IEC 60906-1, has only a 16A variant with an intermediate pin size, so the 10A plug would fit into its socket and its plug would fit into the 20A socket.) Annoyingly, that&#x27;s the only difference, making it quite hard to tell just by looking whether it&#x27;s a 10A or 20A plug&#x2F;socket; you have to try and see if it fits. reply ianburrell 9 hours agorootparentprevBrazil should use outlets to indicate the voltage.

If things go out of tolerance there is a defined period of time where it must recover or the inverter is required to trip out. There are also hard safety limits that cannot be exceeded whatsoever. I am not aware of any conditions that would result in overvoltage.In CA as of (IIRC) 2021 these systems must be hooked up to some kind of online monitoring so the utility can temporarily command them to exceed tolerances. If the grid is going unstable due to load the last thing you want is everyone&#x27;s PV system tripping off making the supply situation worse. So the utility can inform the system to exceed the normally tight tolerances by a larger deviation. They can also command PVs systems to shut off but there are strict limits on how often and how long they can do that and it must be driven by grid stability needs. reply baq 2 hours agorootparentYes, absolutely, same here.The problem is varistors blow out before the safety measures work.

The outlets in my house routinely deviate from the standard 230V, with the lowest I have seen at 170V and highest at about 260V. I have not had any appliance malfunction.Edit: I am not advising anyone to deliberately do stupid things, simply mentioning that from my experience the builtin margin is fairly large. reply lxgr 20 hours agorootparentYou (or your landlord) should probably hire an electrician to get that checked out – especially the higher voltage might be indicative of some scarier failure modes.A voltage drop of 25% could also mean you have semi-broken wiring somewhere, which can cause fires or shock hazards on faulty appliances. reply cesarb 20 hours agorootparentMy first guess would be something like a broken neutral wire, making the neutral voltage depend on the imbalance of the load between the AC phases. From the little I understand about it, you could have up to the phase to phase voltage between the broken neutral and one of the phases, with the voltage dynamically changing as devices are turned on or off. It&#x27;s very confusing (since everything expects the neutral to be referenced to the earth, which is constant 0V by definition), and can burn up devices. reply MadnessASAP 18 hours agorootparentThat definitely reads like somebody removed&#x2F;forgot the neutral bond.You&#x27;re understanding is correct, if neutral is allowed to float it&#x27;s voltage will depend on ratio of the load on the 2 phases.It also creates a variety of hazardous conditions and opportunities to make spicy metal.You can play with it here courtesy of Paul Falstad and Iain Sharp: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;yq4lukm6 reply nicolaslem 20 hours agorootparentprevI did but unfortunately it quickly turned into all parties involved blaming each other (it&#x27;s your utility, it&#x27;s your installation...) and it got nowhere. For the past year it&#x27;s been much more stable than before so I don&#x27;t worry too much about it. reply ajb 18 hours agorootparentI would not assume that this fault is not dangerous TBH. May well be a good idea to hassle them some more. If you&#x27;re renting, you don&#x27;t need to care who is at fault - your landlord needs to sort it. If you own, you may need a 3rd party electrician to settle the argument. reply amluto 18 hours agorootparentprevSee above about a broken neutral. A broken neutral is bad. One could easily load a system or even just have wetter soil so that the voltages are well balanced for a while despite the neutral being open, but that doesn’t make it less bad. reply smallpipe 19 hours agorootparentprevMake sure you have good insurance and multiple loud smoke detectors... reply ajb 18 hours agorootparentInsurance won&#x27;t cover if you knew there was a fault and didn&#x27;t fix it! reply repiret 18 hours agorootparentDo you have a citation for that? reply ajb 17 hours agorootparentSure. This is the relevant clause in my current home insurance policy:\"You must take steps to maintain the Home in a good state of repair and take all reasonable precautions to avoid loss, damage or injury and to safeguard all property insured from loss or damage.\"These things are pretty standard - I would be very surprised if there isn&#x27;t a similar clause in all of them.Which implies that, if you fail to do so, they don&#x27;t have to pay up.The wording in your policy may be different. What are \"reasonable steps\" will depend on legal precedent. It may, for example, take into account that you&#x27;re not an expert, and will probably include some reasonable time to get stuff fixed. But certainly it provides them the opportunity to deny a claim.Obligatory disclaimer: I am not a lawyer or insurance expert, get your own advice if you need it. reply repiret 3 hours agorootparentIt seems plausible that not addressing the electrical anomaly described by nicolaslem could be called a failure to maintain the home under your policy.For completeness, the relevant section from my policy is \"We will not pay for any loss to the property...as a result of...Neglect, meaning neglect of the insured to use all reasonable means to save and preserve the property at and after the time of a loss, or when property is endangered\". But in the same context, it says \"However, we will pay for any resulting loss from ... defect, weakness, inadequacy, fault, or unsoundness in ... design, specifications, workmanship, repair, construction, renovation, remodeling, grading or compaction; [or] maintenance.\"It would be shaped by the legal precedent in interpreting these sorts of clauses, and perhaps also the whims of a jury. It still seems unlikely to me that either of our policies would end up excluding the electrical anomaly, and moreover I&#x27;ve yet to ever hear a verifiyable account of someone whose homeowners insurance claim was denied after an electrical problem in their house led to a loss. reply astura 12 hours agorootparentprevNobody can provide you with a citation because the specifics will be the wording that&#x27;s in your individual policy.But, generally, policies require you to maintain the property. replydylan604 19 hours agorootparentprevDips and spikes are routine in electrical power delivery. In my experience, dips are much more likely to be the culprit of damaging equipment than spikes. People are used to protection from spikes with surge protectors, but the only thing that protects from dips is a UPS. I use a small UPS as part of my entertainment equipment. Not because I want to watch TV during an outage, but to keep from damaging the equipment with the power dips. reply lxgr 19 hours agorootparentHow would a power dip damage an appliance? reply cesarb 18 hours agorootparent> How would a power dip damage an appliance?For AC motors, the lower voltage might mean they do not have enough power to turn, so all the power they consume becomes heat in the motor windings (and since they&#x27;re not turning, there&#x27;s less cooling).For electronic power supplies, they might either pull more current to maintain the same output (again leading to more heating), might output a lower voltage (and DC-DC converters which consume that voltage might in turn draw more current, again leading to more heating), or they might even misbehave and output an oscillating voltage; they might also detect the power dip and shut down, only to power up again moments later, repeatedly.A device in an idle stand-by mode is probably the best case, since it&#x27;s using little power from a supply sized for a much bigger load.I disagree with the sibling comment that the only protection from voltage dips is a UPS or similar; a simpler protection is an undervoltage relay with a timer, to convert the voltage dip into a power outage (and also prevent the power from being restored too quickly). reply dylan604 18 hours agorootparent* The only protection available as a consumer add-on.Sure, if the manufacturer wants to increase the cost on the BOM for their PSUs, they can use additional components to survive dips, but who does that on disposable electronic equipment? Hell, even \"expensive\" TVs don&#x27;t. I quote expensive since you can now get 65\" 4K TVs cheaper than a mobile phone, but that&#x27;s a tangent. So if you are wanting to protect your electronic equipment with another device readily available that is just plug an play ease of use with no knowledge of electronics, what do you suggest? reply cesarb 17 hours agorootparentI have a friend who did that; he put one of these relays on the apartment&#x27;s power panel, so the whole apartment was protected against voltage dips or too short outages. It might not be a common consumer item, but it&#x27;s a readily available device, AFAIK commonly used to protect industrial motors. reply dylan604 16 hours agorootparentcommon industrial does not come close to common consumers.adding something to the power panel is not something a consumer can do. how is this even being confused? reply ajb 18 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not power dip, it&#x27;s voltage dip. An appliance will often draw the same power at the lower voltage, so increase current, which can cause overheating and damage. reply dylan604 16 hours agorootparentTypically in these dip situations, you can hear the PSUs being very unhappy about the situation. A cringe inducing high pitched squeal can be heard from any PSU that&#x27;s doing work as they try to continue doing their job while in this undervolt condition. reply dylan604 18 hours agorootparentprevIf it&#x27;s turned off or it is on and not being used, probably not much. But more and more equipment no longer has an off mode and is more of an idle stand-by mode, so current is still always being used by part of the system.The point is that in electricity delivery, it is normal to have deviations in the voltage as acceptable. Most power supplies have tolerances that can handle these deviations. A dip is something outside of the deviations that most people don&#x27;t consider as they are only focused on spikes and only use surge suppression devices. Since the only protection from dips is a more expensive battery solution, most people do not bother outside of computer related usages. reply lxgr 18 hours agorootparentAh, so e.g. something like a device flipping between “powered” and “not powered” states, which then wears out some part that doesn’t expect that state change to happen so often? reply dylan604 14 hours agorootparentno, not quite. a dip is some lower than the accepted deviations from the expected value. if you have an accepted range of +&#x2F;-10%, but the dip causes the voltage to drop 15%, that&#x27;s a dip. some places define an outage as being less than 5% of expected value. so somewhere before outage, you have a severe undervolt situation where the equipment struggles. the longer the dip lasts, the worse things can get.one of the shops that I worked at suffered a catastrophic situation when a nearby construction crew cut one phase of the 3-phase power coming into our facility. the poor transformer died, and took out the some of the more delicate PSUs attached to some very expensive equipment. we were down for weeks recovering from that. replybayindirh 20 hours agorootparentprevMost of them are either 110-240V appliances, or lose performance when it goes around 170, and you may not notice.260V is in +&#x2F;- 10% threshold and is possibly falls within \"engineered in tolerance\" range, but will probably shorten the life of many appliances if supplied constantly. reply ajb 18 hours agorootparentprevLots of devices have switched mode power supplies that will still output the same voltage. Last time I had a brownout the only thing that stopped working was the washing machine, and I thought that was broken.Paradoxically, it may be the lower voltages that are more dangerous, because it will result in a higher current draw from all the devices.Mains voltage has a nontrivial allowed range (in fact in Europe they increased it slightly so that devices would work across countries with slightly different original standards) but this is well out of spec. reply etimberg 20 hours agorootparentprevAre you measuring RMS voltage or just the instantaneous voltage?An RMS voltage of 230V corresponds with a peak voltage of ~325V so reading of 260V could theoretically happen. reply nicolaslem 20 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s the reading from my UPS, I believe it&#x27;s RMS since it reads 234 V currently. reply mike50 19 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not how it works.

I just assume there is a negotiation where the charger says &#x27;I can supply these voltages, and perhaps at these max amps, and the device choses one or none of them depending on it&#x27;s needs. reply rollcat 12 hours agorootparent> I think these usb-c pd (and other) issues were corrected in the oled switches and the docks that come with them but the fixes might not have been total.I have the OLED model, and the accompanying dock refuses every single non-Nintendo charger I&#x27;ve tried.

    "title": "Improving MySQL: Analyzing Replication Schemes, Storage Engines, and Isolation Levels",
    "originLink": "https://jepsen.io/analyses/mysql-8.0.34",
    "originBody": "1 Background MySQL needs little introduction. Over the last 28 years it has become one of the most widely deployed SQL databases. MySQL is primarily used for online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads, but is also deployed as a part of OLAP and queuing systems. MySQL was designed as a single-server database, but has been extended with various multi-node replication schemes, including several flavors of binlog replication, group replication, NDB cluster, and third-party plugins like Galera Cluster & Percona XtraDB Cluster. Previous Jepsen work discussed Percona XtraDB Cluster and Galera Cluster. In this analysis we focus on single-server MySQL, but we also evaluated clusters with a single writeable primary and read-only secondaries using binlog replication. MySQL also supports multiple storage engines which have different safety properties. We focus on the default: InnoDB. Throughout this text, we use “MySQL” to mean “MySQL using the InnoDB storage engine.” 1.1 ANSI SQL Isolation is Bad, Actually In order to discuss the nuances of SQL isolation levels, we must first explain some history. In 1977 Gray, Lorie, Putzolu, and Traiger published Granularity of Locks and Degrees of Consistency in a Shared Data Base, which introduced four increasingly safe degrees of transaction consistency. In 1973 IBM developed System R, one of the first relational databases, and shortly thereafter introduced SQL as a query language for it. System R’s success spawned a slew of relational databases using SQL, many with distinct flavors of concurrency control. Starting in 1986 ANSI released1 a series of standards codifying SQL behavior. The third revision of the standard, SQL-92, defined the semantics of concurrent transactions through four transaction isolation levels, again with increasing degrees of safety. As with Gray et al., these isolation levels were related to the behavior of increasingly conservative locking regimes. However, to allow databases which used non-locking concurrency control, ANSI phrased their levels in terms of three possible phenomena which should not occur. As the standard puts it, “the following phenomena are possible:”2 P1 (“Dirty Read”) SQL-transaction T1 modifies a row. SQL-transaction T2 then reads that row before T1 performs a COMMIT. If T1 then performs a ROLLBACK, T2 will have read a row that was never committed and that may thus be considered to have never existed. P2 (“Non-Repeatable Read”) SQL-transaction T1 reads a row. SQL-transaction T2 then modifies or deletes that row and performs a COMMIT. If T1 then attempts to reread the row, it may receive the modified value or discover that the row has been deleted. P3 (“Phantom”) SQL-transaction T1 reads the set of rows N that satisfy some . SQL-transaction T2 then executes SQL-statements that generate one or more rows that satisfy theused by SQL-transaction T1. If SQL-transaction T1 then repeats the initial read with the same , it obtains a different collection of rows. ANSI SQL defines four isolation levels in terms of these anomalies. It begins by stating that transactions which execute at the Serializable isolation level must be equivalent to some serial execution, i.e., one in which that set of transactions executed one after the other. Then it says “the isolation levels are different with respect to phenomena P1, P2, and P3.” The standard provides the following table which “specifies the phenomena that are possible and not possible for a given isolation level”: Level P1 P2 P3 Read Uncommitted Possible Possible Possible Read Committed Not Possible Possible Possible Repeatable Read Not Possible Not Possible Possible Serializable Not Possible Not Possible Not Possible In 1995 Berenson, Bernstein, Gray,3 Melton, and the O’Neils published A Critique of ANSI SQL Isolation Levels, which laid out critical flaws in these definitions. “The three ANSI phenomena are ambiguous. Even their broadest interpretations do not exclude anomalous behavior.” For example, P1 says something bad might happen if T1 were to abort, but doesn’t actually say whether it aborts or not. Some people interpreted the standard to require T1 aborts. This would make it legal under read committed for transactions to read as-yet-uncommitted state from other transactions (so long as they went on to commit). T1 could write x = 1, T2 could write y = 2, and T1 and T2 could both see each other’s effects. This kind of circular information flow seems bad, but whether the standard allows it is a matter of interpretation. Similar ambiguities exist for P2 and P3. Even interpreted broadly, preventing P1, P2, and P3 does not ensure Serializability. The standard omits a critical phenomenon P0 (“dirty write”), in which transaction T1 writes some row, transaction T2 overwrites T1’s write, and T1 commits. This is clearly undesirable, but legal under ANSI Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, and Repeatable Read. Furthermore, ANSI SQL P3 only prohibits inserts affecting a predicate, but not updates or deletes. In 1999, Atul Adya built on Berenson et al.’s critique and developed formal and implementation-independent definitions of various transaction isolation levels, including those in ANSI SQL.4 As he notes: The ANSI definitions are imprecise because they allow at least two interpretations; furthermore, the anomaly interpretation is definitely incorrect. The preventative interpretation [meaning Berenson et al.’s interpretation which added P0, expanded P3, and so on] is correct in the sense that it rules out undesirable (i.e., non-serializable) histories. However, this interpretation is overly restrictive since it also rules out correct behavior that does not lead to inconsistencies and can occur in a real system. Thus, any system that allows such histories is disallowed by this interpretation, e.g., databases based on optimistic mechanisms. Adya first defines a dependency graph between transactions. There are three main types of dependencies, which we summarize informally: Write-Write Transaction T1 writes some version x1 of object x, which transaction T2 overwrites by installing the next version of x: x2. Write-Read Transaction T1 writes version x1, which transaction T2 reads. Read-Write Transaction T1 reads version x1, which transaction T2 overwrites by installing the next version of x: x2. Adya then defines portable isolation levels PL-1, PL-2, PL-2.99, and PL-3, which capture what the ANSI SQL standard (arguably) intended. Each level rules out progressively broader kinds of cycles in the transaction dependency graph: PL-1 (“Read Uncommitted”) Prohibits G0 (“write cycle”): a cycle of write-write dependencies. This is analogous to Berenson’s P0 (“dirty write”). PL-2 (“Read Committed”) Prohibits G0 and G1. G1 consists of three anomalies: G1a (“aborted read”), G1b (“intermediate read”)5, and G1c (“cyclic information flow”): a cycle of write-write or write-read dependencies. This captures the essence of the preventative interpretation of P1. PL-2.99 (“Repeatable Read”) Prohibits G0, G1, and G2-item: a cycle involving write-write, write-read, or read-write edges without predicates. This captures the essence of ANSI SQL Repeatable Read, which is distinguished from Serializable only by predicate safety. PL-3 (“Serializable”) Prohibits G0, G1, and G2: a cycle involving write-write, write-read, or read-write edges (with or without predicates). This guarantees equivalence to a serial execution. Adya’s dependency graph-based isolation levels resolved the ambiguities of the ANSI definitions, and remains the most widely-used formalism for characterizing transaction histories and anomalies. Jepsen generally uses Adya’s formalism. Although the database community has known for decades that ANSI SQL’s isolation level definitions are broken, the standard’s language remained unchanged. The same ambiguous, incomplete definitions are still present in the 2023 revision of the standard. 1.2 Repeatable Read ANSI SQL’s isolation levels are bad, but some levels have caused more problems than others. The fact that different database vendors provide isolation levels with the same names is useful only if the semantics of a particular level are consistent across vendors. And for three of the isolation levels, this is usually true. Most databases we’ve evaluated do ensure at least PL-1 for read uncommitted, PL-2 for Read Committed, and PL-3 for Serializable.6 However, there is less agreement on the semantics of Repeatable Read. Adya’s PL-2.99 definition of Repeatable Read is quite strict, ruling out all dependency cycles except those involving predicate edges. The ANSI definition, while ambiguous, appears similarly strict: it prohibits all listed anomalies except “phantoms,” which depend on predicate reads. This is not surprising when we consider the roots of the isolation levels in locking regimes: the original Repeatable Read was the isolation level you got when you followed strict two-phase locking (holding read and write locks until the end of the transaction) but did not enforce predicate locking. For some reason DB vendors have chosen different definitions of Repeatable Read than Adya and the ANSI standard, and almost no vendors provide the same guarantees at Repeatable Read. In fact, Microsoft SQL Server is the only database that we have tested for which Repeatable Read appears to correspond to PL-2.99 and the ANSI definition. In Postgres, Repeatable Read means Snapshot Isolation, a level that is neither stronger nor weaker than PL-2.99.7 With this diversity of implementations in mind, we turn to the question at hand: what does MySQL do? 1.3 MySQL Isolation The transaction isolation levels documentation for MySQL indicates that MySQL with InnoDB “offers all four transaction isolation levels described by the SQL:1992 standard”: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable. The documentation goes on to explain how MySQL achieves these isolation levels. At MySQL Read Uncommitted, transactions should behave “like Read Committed,” except for allowing dirty read: an anomaly where a read observes “data that was updated by another transaction but not yet committed.” At MySQL Read Committed, every individual consistent read reads from a fresh snapshot of committed state. A “consistent read” is the default behavior for reads (e.g. SELECT * FROM problems) and is the focus of this report. There are also stronger reads (e.g. SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) which explicitly request locks, and weaker reads (e.g. SELECT ... SKIP LOCKED) which skip some of the default locks. MySQL Repeatable Read, the default isolation level, ensures safety through a snapshot mechanism: Consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot established by the first read. This means that if you issue several plain (nonlocking) SELECT statements within the same transaction, these SELECT statements are consistent also with respect to each other. MySQL’s consistent read documentation further emphasizes that reads should operate on a snapshot of the database taken by the first read in a transaction. If the transaction isolation level is REPEATABLE READ (the default level), all consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot established by the first such read in that transaction…. Suppose that you are running in the default REPEATABLE READ isolation level. When you issue a consistent read (that is, an ordinary SELECT statement), InnoDB gives your transaction a timepoint according to which your query sees the database. If another transaction deletes a row and commits after your timepoint was assigned, you do not see the row as having been deleted. Inserts and updates are treated similarly. The documentation for Serializable isolation says Serializable is “like REPEATABLE READ, but InnoDB implicitly converts all plain SELECT statements to SELECT ... FOR SHARE if autocommit is disabled.” There ends the isolation level documentation. However, if one digs deeper into the consistent read documentation, there is a curious note on the semantics of Repeatable Read: The snapshot of the database state applies to SELECT statements within a transaction, not necessarily to DML statements. If you insert or modify some rows and then commit that transaction, a DELETE or UPDATE statement issued from another concurrent REPEATABLE READ transaction could affect those just-committed rows, even though the session could not query them. If a transaction does update or delete rows committed by a different transaction, those changes do become visible to the current transaction. This is confusing: the ANSI SQL standard and MySQL’s own reference manual both consider SELECT to be a DML statement, but this note seems to think they’re different. It appears that writes made by a Repeatable Read transaction can affect rows that the transaction could not read. But what does it mean for a different transaction’s updates to become visible to the current transaction? How does that align with MySQL’s claim that multiple reads in a Repeatable Read transaction “read the snapshot established by the first read”? What happened to the timepoint assigned by the first read? This calls for a test. 2 Test Design We designed a small test suite for MySQL using the Jepsen testing library at version 0.3.4. We used the mysql-connector-j JDBC adapter as our client. We tested MySQL 8.0.34, and MariaDB 10.11.3 on Debian Bookworm. Our tests ran against a single MySQL node as well as binlog-replicated clusters with one or two read-only followers, without failover. We also ran our test suite against a hosted MySQL service: AWS’s RDS Cluster, using the “Multi-AZ DB Cluster” profile. This is the recommended default for production workloads, and offers a binlog-replicated deployment of MySQL 8.0.34 where secondary nodes support read queries. Our tests included basic fault injection for process pauses, crashes, and network partitions, as well as the loss of un-fsynced writes to disk. However, almost every finding we discuss in this work occurred in healthy, single-node MySQL instances. 2.1 List Append Our main workload used Elle’s list-append checker for transactional isolation. In a nutshell, Elle infers Adya’s write-write, write-read, and read-write dependencies between transactions, then looks for cycles in the resulting dependency graph. Each cycle it finds demonstrates that a particular set of isolation levels do not hold. At a high level the append workload performs randomly generated transactions comprising reads and appends of unique integer elements to a collection of lists identified by primary key. As in our previous tests of SQL databases, we encoded these lists as a text field of comma-separated values, one per row, and used SQL CONCAT to append elements.8 We split these rows across multiple tables with a structure like create table \"txn0\" ( id int not null primary key, val text ); Over the last few years we’ve made several improvements to Elle which allow it to detect more anomalies.9 When some appended elements are never read in a list-append test, Elle now infers ww and rw dependencies, placing them after the last value seen in the longest successful read. We now detect P4 (lost update) anomalies explicitly, even when version orders are uninferable. Elle also searches for cycles involving multiple nonadjacent read-write anti-dependencies which also include real-time and process edges. This lets us detect more subtle violations of both strong and strong session Snapshot Isolation. 2.2 Non-Repeatable Read When Elle identified internal consistency violations at Repeatable Read, we designed a workload specifically to stress MySQL’s Repeatable Read semantics, which works as follows. We create a simple table of people identified by primary key, and populate it with a single row: create table people ( id int not null, name text not null, gender text not null, primary key (id)) ); insert into people (id, name, gender) values (0, \"moss\", \"enby\"); We then perform a series of write transactions which update only the row’s name. Concurrently, a second series of transactions each read the row’s name, update its gender field, and read the name again. Violations of Repeatable Read manifest as the row’s name changing between the two reads. We also perform deletions and re-insertions of row 0, in case they behave differently than plain updates. 2.3 Monotonic Atomic View We also designed a second targeted workload to illustrate violations of Monotonic Atomic View. This workload creates a single table with two rows: create table mav ( id int not null, `value` int not null, noop int not null, primary key (id) ); insert into mav (id, `value`, noop) values (0, 0, 0); insert into mav (id, `value`, noop) values (1, 0, 0); We perform a mix of write and read transactions. Each write increments the value of row 0, then increments row 1. Reads select the value of row 0, set the noop field of row 1 to a random value, then read the values of 1 and 0. Under Monotonic Atomic View, these reads should be monotonically increasing. For example, once a reader observes value 2, it should thereafter see every row’s value as 2 or higher. 2.4 LazyFS In 2022 Jepsen commissioned the University of Porto’s INESC TEC to develop LazyFS: a FUSE filesystem for simulating the loss of un-fsynced writes. LazyFS maintains an in-memory page cache of data which has been written but not fsynced, flushing it to underlying storage only as the cache fills or fsync calls are made. A test harness can ask LazyFS to discard its cache at any time, simulating what might happen during a power failure. João Pedro Rodrigues Azevedo’s dissertation discusses this work in detail, including several database bugs. LazyFS has been integrated with Jepsen for a little over a year, but this is the first public Jepsen report including it. We tested MySQL by killing the MySQL process, asking LazyFS to drop uncommitted writes, then restarting the process. 3 Results 3.1 G2-item at Repeatable Read Adya’s Repeatable Read (PL-2.99) prohibits G2-item: a cycle of write-write, write-read, and read-write dependency edges, where those edges do not involve predicates. However, MySQL’s Repeatable Read routinely allows G2-item, even on a single healthy node. Kleppmann reported this behavior in 2014 and it still occurs today. Take for example this list-append test, which exhibited 214 cycles in just 40 seconds. Here is one of those cycles comprising two transactions, neither of which saw each other’s effects. In this diagram the top transaction read key 141 and saw the value [1 2], then appended 1 to key 140. The bottom transaction appended 3 to key 141, read key 141 and observed the value [1 2 3], then read key 140 and found it did not exist. The top transaction must have executed before the bottom transaction, since it failed to observe the bottom transaction’s append of 3. But the bottom transaction must have executed before the top transaction, since it read key 140 before any append! This cycle involves purely reads and updates by primary key, and is therefore G2-item.10 Transactions which fail to see each other’s effects could violate important invariants. Consider two independent electricians, each adding a new 20 amp circuit to a breaker panel. Each might visit the site to check11 that the total load on each circuit (including the one they intend to add) would not exceed the 100 amp capacity of the panel, then return a few days later to add the circuit. Under MySQL’s Repeatable Read, both could see a load of 70 amps, add a 20 amp circuit, and create a total load of 110 amps—exceeding the safe load of the panel.12 While this behavior is prohibited by PL-2.99 Repeatable Read, it could be interpreted as legal under ANSI SQL Repeatable Read. The standard’s definition of P2 (non-Repeatable Read) only discusses a transaction which reads the same row twice and observes some other transaction’s effects. Since these transactions never read a row twice, they do not exhibit P2! This is one of many ways in which the standard fails to capture anomalous behavior. 3.2 G-single at Repeatable Read The example of G2-item we presented above involved a pair of transactions linked by adjacent read-write edges: in short, neither observed the other’s effects. However, MySQL Repeatable Read also exhibits G-single (a.k.a. read skew): cycles composed of write-write, write-read, and read-write edges, but where read-write edges are never adjacent to one another. Kleppmann reported this behavior in 2014, and we can confirm it still occurs in MySQL 8.0.34. Like G2-item, G-single cycles involving only item dependencies are prohibited under PL-2.99 Repeatable Read. Take, for example, this sixty-second append test of a single MySQL node without any faults. At roughly 140 transactions per second it exhibited 244 instances of G-single (plus 305 more instances of G2-item). Since the append test uses no predicate operations, all of these are violations of Repeatable Read. Here is one of those cycles: The top transaction here appended 9 to key 363, then 5 to key 377. The bottom transaction failed to observe the append to 377, but also managed to append 10 to key 363 after the top transaction. We know this because a later read observed key 363’s value as [5 6 4 7 8 9 10]. This violates both Repeatable Read (which rules out any cycle of item edges) and Snapshot Isolation (which rules out G-single in general). In short: one transaction can both fail to observe but also overwrite another. More complex cycles involving write-read edges also occur. In this case the dependency edges involved different keys, which suggests an interesting question: what would happen if two transactions conflicted on a single key? 3.3 Lost Update at Repeatable Read Phenomenon P4 (lost update) is a special case of G-single in which exactly two transactions are linked by a write-write and read-write cycle on a single key. In other words: two transactions read the same version of some key, and both go on to update it. This is expressly prohibited by Snapshot Isolation and PL-2.99 Repeatable Read. However, Kleppmann showed in 2014 that MySQL Repeatable Read allowed lost update, and we can confirm that it still occurs routinely, even on a single node without faults. Here is a second cycle from the same test run: Both of these transactions read key 636, found it missing, and went on to write what they thought would be the first element. This is an obvious instance of lost update: at most one of these transactions should have been able to commit.13 We also have less obvious examples: This cluster involves two G-single cycles. The smaller, comprising just the bottom two transactions, has no read of key 1167 before the middle transaction’s write: it is not a classic instance of lost update. However, its read of key 1167 = [1] implies that the state of that key prior to its append of 1 must have been empty, which looks “lost-update-esque.” Moreover, the top transaction also read the unborn version of key 1167 before appending 4 to it. That, together with the bottom transaction, must be lost update. A later read [:r 1167 [1 3 4]] suggests the following sequence of events. All three transactions must have started before 1167 existed. The middle transaction appended 1 and read [1] back. Then the bottom transaction appended 3, and finally the top transaction appended 4. All three transactions eventually committed. These instances of lost update were caught by Elle’s cycle detection system, since they were involved in G-single. However, Elle’s cycle detection relies on inferring the order of writes to a given key, which we can (mostly) do only if some read observes them. We have recently extended Elle to detect instances of lost update which are invisible to the cycle detector. In these tests, we search for two or more committed transactions which read the same version of some key k, then all write k. Regardless of whether we see their effects or not, the mere fact that both committed implies lost update. For example: {:key 892, :value nil, :txns [{:process 6, :type :ok, :f :txn, :value [[:r 892 nil] [:r 891 nil] [:append 892 1] [:r 892 [2 5 4 1]]], :index 14806, :time 49518094450} {:process 18, :type :ok, :f :txn, :value [[:r 892 nil] [:append 892 8] [:r 891 [2 3]] [:append 891 9]], :index 14842, :time 49636093552}]} Both of these committed transactions read the unborn (nil) version of key 892 and wrote to it. Out of 9,048 successful transactions in this test, our new checker found 446 distinct transactions involved in 198 instances of lost update. Only 47 of those instances appeared in some cycle. In short: MySQL Repeatable Read transactions cannot safely read a value and then write it. The standard ORM pattern where a program starts a transaction, loads an object into memory, manipulates it, saves it back to the database, then commits, may find that MySQL silently discards those committed changes. Although PL-2.99 Repeatable Read is supposed to make this pattern safe, MySQL Repeatable Read does not. MySQL users must instead perform their own explicit locking. An attentive reader may have noticed the above example is more alarming than first meets the eye. The first transaction read the empty state of key 892, appended a single value, then read a version of key 892 including three additional values. Where did those come from? 3.4 Non-Repeatable Read at Repeatable Read MySQL Repeatable Read exhibits internal consistency anomalies: consistency violations whose effects are visible within a single transaction. These occur even on a single healthy MySQL node. In that same test run, 126 of 9,048 committed transactions exhibited internal consistency errors. For example: {:op {:process 12, :type :ok, :f :txn, :value [[:r 1185 nil] [:append 1185 6] [:append 1182 8] [:r 1185 [3 4 2 6]]], :index 19874, :time 65980191472}, :mop [:r 1185 [3 4 2 6]], :expected [6]} This transaction read the unborn (nil) state of key 1185, and decided to append 6 to it. It then read key 1185 and observed [3 4 2 6]. Three elements appeared out of thin air. Or consider: {:op {:process 19, :type :ok, :f :txn, :value [[:append 1099 10] [:r 1096 [1 2 3]] [:append 1096 7] [:r 1096 [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]]], :index 18404, :time 61061580955}, :mop [:r 1096 [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]], :expected [1 2 3 7]} This transaction read key 1096 and obtained the list [1 2 3]. It appended 7, then read the key again, and found three additional values (4, 5, and 6) inserted in its place. This is forbidden under PL-2.99 Repeatable Read: there must be a read-write dependency from this transaction to some other, and a write-read (or similar) dependency chain leading back. It is forbidden under ANSI Repeatable Read: the transaction performed two reads of the same object and saw different states resulting from a different transaction! The point of Repeatable Read—both for ANSI and Adya—is that once a transaction observes some value, it can count on that value being stable for the remainder of the transaction. MySQL does the opposite: a write is an invitation for another transaction to sneak in and clobber the state you just read. This behavior allows incredible transactions like the following, recorded during a repeatable-read workload: set transaction isolation level Repeatable Read; start transaction; select name from people where id = 0; --> \"pebble\" update people set gender = \"femme\" where id = 0; select name from people where id = 0; --> \"moss\" commit; This transaction read a person’s name, set their gender, and read their name again. Despite executing at Repeatable Read, their name spontaneously changed from “pebble” to “moss”. Violations of internal consistency are forbidden under Read Atomic, Causal Consistency, Parallel Snapshot Isolation, Prefix Consistency, Snapshot Isolation, and Serializability. It also seems clear that this transaction satisfies ANSI SQL’s informal definition of a “non-repeatable read.” It violates MySQL’s isolation levels documentation, which claims that “consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot established by the first read.” It contradicts MySQL’s consistent read documentation, which specifically states that InnoDB assigns a timepoint on a transaction’s first read, and the effects of concurrent transactions should not appear in subsequent reads. If we add other transactions which insert or delete the row, we can observe rows popping into existence in the middle of a Repeatable Read transaction: start transaction; select name from people where id = 0 --> nil update people set gender = \"butch\" where id = 0; select name from people where id = 0; --> \"moss\" commit; However, we have not yet observed a row vanishing due to a concurrent delete. Perhaps this is because the update statement updates no rows, leaving the snapshot intact. Whatever the reason, the consistent read documentation’s claim that deletes, inserts, and updates “are treated similarly” appears incorrect: deletes seem to work differently from inserts and updates. 3.5 Non-Monotonic View Kleppmann’s Hermitage lists MySQL Repeatable Read as monotonic atomic view. Per Bailis et al, Monotonic Atomic View ensures that once a transaction T2 observes an effect of transaction T1, T2 observes all effects of T1. Even if MySQL Repeatable Read fetches a fresh snapshot on each write, it might still provide Monotonic Atomic View if the snapshots are monotone. This is how Postgres read committed works. This is not the case in MySQL. In healthy single-node deployments, MySQL routinely violates Monotonic Atomic View at Repeatable Read. Recall that our Monotonic Atomic View workload has two rows whose values are initially 0. Writer transactions increment the value of row 0, then row 1: both rows’ values should appear to advance in lockstep. However, the first read transaction from this monotonic-atomic-view test observed: start transaction; select value from mav where id = 0; --> 0 update mav set noop = 73 where id = 1; select value from mav where id = 1; --> 1 select value from mav where id = 0; --> 0 commit; This read transaction saw the state of row 0 prior to the first write transaction. Then it saw the writer’s increment of row 1. Under monotonic atomic view, it should have gone on to observe all of the writer’s effects—including the increment of row 0. However, when it selected row 0 it saw the old value, not the new one. This is a non-monotonic read! MySQL’s consistent read documentation talks about snapshots extensively, but this behavior doesn’t look like a snapshot at all. Snapshot systems usually provide a consistent, point-in-time view of the database state. They are usually atomic: either all of a transaction’s effects are included, or none are. Even if MySQL had somehow obtained a non-atomic snapshot from the middle of the write transaction, it must have seen the increment of row 0 before the increment of row 1. This is not the case: this read transaction observed the increment of row 1 but not row 0. In what sense can this possibly be considered a snapshot? 3.6 Fractured Read-Like Anomalies with RDS Serializable A common strategy for improving both the availability and throughput of a production MySQL database is to deploy one or more read replicas. These replicas continually apply binlogs that are shipped to them by the read/write primary instance, accept connections, and permit read-only transactions to run. Some cloud vendors (e.g. Amazon RDS) configure one or two read replicas as a part of their default production deployment profile. We found that AWS RDS MySQL routinely violated Serializability at Serializable isolation, even in healthy clusters. Consider this append test which ran on an RDS MySQL cluster with the default recommended production profile. It exhibited several G2-item and G-single anomalies, like the following: The top transaction appended 3 to key 2215, and that write was visible to the middle transaction. The middle transaction appended 8 to key 2219, which was visible to the bottom transaction. However, the bottom transaction missed the top transaction’s write! All G-single anomalies we found involved at least three transactions linked by at least two write-read edges. Exactly what kind of anomaly is this, and how severe is it? It is clearly an instance of G-single, since it has exactly one read-write edge. It is also G2-item, since it does not involve predicates. This implies RDS MySQL’s “Serializable” isolation violates Snapshot Isolation, Repeatable Read, and Serializability. However, G-single is a broad class of anomalies, and this appears unlike the other instances of G-single we’ve discussed so far. It is not lost update: no transaction reads then writes the same key. Unlike our previous example of G-single which involved a write-write edge, this anomaly has only write-read and read-write edges. It somewhat resembles fractured read, in which a transaction reads only a subset of another transaction’s writes. However, this anomaly involves a reader T3 which observes a writer T2’s effects, but does not observe an earlier T1 which was visible to T2. It is in some sense a “transitive” fractured read. Regarding severity, we observe first that any instance of G-single, when running all transactions at the Serializable isolation level, is significant. The received wisdom in the MySQL community is to avoid using Serializable unless absolutely necessary. The MySQL manual discourages users from using Serializable at all, stating: SERIALIZABLE enforces even stricter rules than REPEATABLE READ, and is used mainly in specialized situations, such as with XA transactions and for troubleshooting issues with concurrency and deadlocks. Given this guidance, we would expect users to run transactions at this strongest isolation level only when they know they need a high degree of safety, and are willing to pay the performance cost of extra synchronization in order to rule out anomalies. Graver still, fractured read-like anomalies (as instances of G2-item) are forbidden by Repeatable Read. They should occur only at Read Committed and below. That they arise at “Serializable” is troubling. We suspect this behavior is due in part to RDS’s choice of default parameters for production clusters. Among the large variety of configuration parameters that govern the behavior of read replicas is one whose very name should make us uneasy: replica_preserve_commit_order.14 For multithreaded replicas (replicas on which replica_parallel_workers is set to a value greater than 0), setting replica_preserve_commit_order=ON ensures that transactions are executed and committed on the replica in the same order as they appear in the replica’s relay log. This prevents gaps in the sequence of transactions that have been executed from the replica’s relay log, and preserves the same transaction history on the replica as on the source (with the limitations listed below). Serializable systems are supposed to guarantee transactions execute in (what appears to be) a total order. Failing to preserve that order on a replica seems like it would be a bad thing, even if it permitted more parallelism in applying the log entries. The documentation goes on to say that while this parameter used to be disabled by default, MySQL version 8.0.27 and higher default to replica_preserve_commit_order=ON. However, RDS’s default parameters still choose replica_preserve_commit_order=OFF. If we apply this setting to our local test clusters, we observe similar instances of G-single and G2-item. № Summary Event Required Fixed in 1 G2-item at Repeatable Read None Unresolved 2 G-single at Repeatable Read None Unresolved 3 Lost update at Repeatable Read None Unresolved 4 Non-Repeatable read at Repeatable Read None Unresolved 5 Non-monotonic view at Repeatable Read None Unresolved 6 Fractured read-like anomalies at Serializable (in RDS) None Unresolved 4 Discussion First, the good news. In our testing, MySQL 8.0.34’s Read Uncommitted, read committed, and Serializable isolation levels appeared to satisfy PL-1 read uncommitted, PL-2 Read Committed, and PL-3 Serializable, respectively. This held both for single nodes and small clusters with read-only replicas using binlog replication, and through process pauses, crashes, and network partitions. Our LazyFS fault injection scheme did not discover problems with MySQL’s default settings. With innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit at the default setting of 1, process crashes followed by the loss of un-fsynced data did not result in the loss of committed transactions. When we adjusted that setting to 0, MySQL fsynced only once every n seconds and we observe data loss. The bad news: MySQL’s “Repeatable Read” does not satisfy PL-2.99 Repeatable Read: it exhibits G2-item anomalies including write skew. It does not satisfy Snapshot Isolation: it exhibits G-single, including read skew and lost update. Lost update rules out cursor stability. Reads in MySQL “Repeatable Read” are not repeatable, even under the ambiguous definitions of the ANSI SQL standard. Its transactions violate internal consistency, which rules out Read Atomic, Causal, Consistent View, Prefix, and Parallel snapshot isolation. Kleppmann’s 2014 Hermitage suggested MySQL Repeatable Read might be Monotonic Atomic View, but this cannot be true: we found monotonicity violations. Some authors characterize MySQL Repeatable Read as Snapshot Isolation. For example, Kleppmann’s Designing Data-Intensive Applications says “PostgreSQL and MySQL call their Snapshot Isolation level Repeatable Read”.15 Formalizations of Snapshot Isolation vary, but most make it appear as if all of a transaction’s reads occurred at the transaction start time (plus local changes). This is not true in MySQL: when a write occurs, multiple reads of a key may reveal newer versions of that key resulting from other transactions’ writes. Moreover, Snapshot Isolated systems generally appear as if all of a transaction’s writes occur atomically. MySQL allows a transaction to read some, but not all, of another transaction’s writes. This is inconsistent with every version of Snapshot Isolation we are familiar with. It isn’t clear what MySQL Repeatable Read actually is. It allows histories which violate Monotonic Atomic View and cursor stability; we know it cannot be equal to or stronger than those models. We have not observed G0 (dirty writes), G1a (aborted reads), G1b (intermediate reads), or G1c (cyclic infomation flow); it appears at least as strong as Read Committed. The repeatability of some reads means it is actually stronger than Read Committed. In this graph of consistency models an arrow from A to B means that B is strictly stronger than A. By this we mean the histories permitted by B are a strict subset of those permitted by A: a system which provides B provides A as well. It seems likely that MySQL Repeatable Read is incomparable to Monotonic Atomic View: it allows violations of Monotonic Atomic View, but also rules out some non-repeatable reads that Monotonic Atomic View allows. Likewise, it is incomparable to Repeatable Read: MySQL Repeatable Read appears to prohibit certain phantoms which are legal under both ANSI and PL-2.99 Repeatable Read. However, we are unsure exactly which other models are strictly stronger than MySQL Repeatable Read. Is every prefix-consistent history legal under MySQL Repeatable Read? Or are they too incomparable? Because MySQL Repeatable Read’s behavior is so unusual, and because we lack a formal definition of its properties, we are unsure where to draw additional arrows in the diagram above. As always, we caution that Jepsen takes an experimental approach to safety verification: we can prove the presence of bugs, but not their absence. While we make extensive efforts to find problems, we cannot prove correctness. 4.1 Does the MySQL Community Know? The behavior of MySQL Repeatable Read appears poorly understood in the MySQL community. Several authors believe Repeatable Read should prevent lost update. However, several others acknowledge it actually does not, and advise (for example) explicit locking tactics. Similarly, many internet sources state (incorrectly) that MySQL repeatable reads are repeatable. This is understandable: MySQL and MariaDB’s own documentation makes this claim. Those claims are contradicted by a single sentence in a note buried in the MySQL consistent reads documentation. Other blog posts and articles acknowledge (some indirectly) that MySQL Repeatable Read actually allows non-repeatable reads. Cabral and Murphy’s 2009 MySQL Administrator’s Bible states that MySQL “supports the four standard isolation levels,” and emphasizes at length that Repeatable Read prevents a transaction from observing another transaction’s concurrent writes: Using the REPEATABLE READ isolation level, all reads within a transaction show the same data values, even if a second transaction has committed a data change while the first transaction was still running. If a transaction starts, reads a row, waits 60 seconds, and reads the same row again, both data reads will be the same—even if in those 60 seconds another transaction has changed and committed data. The first transaction has the same data when it repeats the read…. REPEATABLE READ may not seem like a good idea—after all, if the data changes, shouldn’t a transaction be aware of that? The problem is that a transaction may take different actions based on the values of the data. Data values changing within a transaction may lead to unexpected consequences. Cabral and Murphy repeat that Repeatable Read “allows a transaction to see the same data for values it has already read regardless of whether or not the data has been changed.” In their section on multi-version concurrency control, they emphasize the independence of transaction snapshots: If a second transaction starts, it “checks out” its own copy of the data. If the first transaction makes changes and commits, the second transaction will not see the data. The second transaction can only work with the data it has. There is no way to update the data that the second transaction sees, though the second transaction could issue a ROLLBACK and start the transaction again to see the new data. This is also wrong: writing a row modifies the transaction’s local copy of the data. Grippa & Kuzmichev’s 2021 Learning MySQL states that MySQL supports all of the SQL:1992 standard isolation levels. They too claim: With the REPEATABLE READ isolation level, there are thus no dirty reads and or non-repeatable reads. Each transaction reads the snapshot established by the first read. However, the section on Serializable isolation actually demonstrates (perhaps inadvertently) that MySQL’s Repeatable Read allows both lost update, a change in read snapshot, and a resulting internal consistency violation! It then shows that Serializable prevents those anomalies. It doesn’t name the anomalies, instead opting to say that “this doesn’t make sense”, but the behavior is visible to a careful reader. It’s not clear if the authors realize the example contradicts their earlier claims about non-repeatable reads and snapshot integrity. 4.2 Recommendations The core problem is that MySQL claims to implement Repeatable Read but actually provides something much weaker. We see two avenues to resolve this problem. The first is to keep MySQL’s behavior as it is, and to clearly document the consistency model “Repeatable Read” actually provides. There is precedent in other databases: PostgreSQL’s Repeatable Read is actually Snapshot Isolation, and exhibits behaviors which violate PL-2.99 Repeatable Read. However, PostgreSQL’s documentation eventually mentions that their Repeatable Read implementation is actually Snapshot Isolation. MySQL could similarly document that their “Repeatable Read” means “Read Committed, plus some sort of guarantees that hold until the transaction writes something, at which point mysteries occur.” A precise characterization of those mysteries would be most welcome. The second option is to treat these behaviors as bugs and fix them. Jepsen would be delighted if MySQL and other vendors were to commit to providing PL-2.99 Repeatable Read. However, even satisfying the incomplete, ambiguous ANSI definition of Repeatable Read would be an improvement over current affairs. In the meantime, MySQL users who require PL-2.99 or ANSI Repeatable Read should be cautious of MySQL Repeatable Read. Reads may not be repeatable, or even reflect a snapshot of committed state. The common ORM pattern in which a transaction reads an object into memory, modifies it, then writes it back within a transaction, may cause committed updates to be silently lost. Users requiring Repeatable Read semantics should use MySQL’s Serializable isolation instead. Alternatively, they can selectively strengthen reads performed at READ COMMITTED using locking techniques like SELECT ... FOR UPDATE. 4.3 RDS AWS RDS MySQL cluster exhibits read skew and G2-item at its “Serializable” isolation level. Users who rely on Serializability should set slave_preserve_commit_order to ON in their RDS parameter groups. Jepsen suggests that AWS either change the default, or clearly explain the allowed violations of Serializability in the known limitations documentation for RDS MySQL. 4.4 Future Work MySQL’s binlog replication appears fragile. We observed a number of mysterious scenarios in which replication halted in our local Jepsen tests. We also found that a few minutes of testing could completely break AWS RDS’s MySQL replication: even a simple CREATE DATABASE would succeed on the primary and fail to appear on the secondaries. We waited an hour without observing recovery. MySQL’s default settings are known to be unsafe in replicated systems. We made no attempt to promote nodes from secondaries to primaries, or to explore exciting topologies like ring or star replication. Future work might explore these behaviors. We have begun research into more general-purpose predicate tests, but this work is still early. Once ready, we’d like to evaluate MySQL predicate safety and see if it differs from primary-key operations. 4.5 A Plea to Standards Bodies Twenty-eight years after Berenson et al. demonstrated that ANSI SQL’s isolation levels are ambiguous and incomplete, seven revisions of the ANSI & ISO standards have left its definitions unchanged.16 P0 is still legal at every level up to Repeatable Read. We still don’t know whether circular information flow is legal at Read Committed. P3 still doesn’t mention deletes. Internal behavior remains unspecified. The research community has moved on to new formalisms. Many are based on Adya’s 1999 thesis, which struggled to capture “what the SQL standard actually meant.” If you happen to sit on the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 32 Data Management and Interchange committee, please imagine the soft chords of a heart-tugging piano lament have begun to play. A montage of transactional anomalies appears on your screen. Internal anomalies. Lost updates. Dirty writes. Jepsen is looking into the camera, holding a database. Hi. This is Jepsen. Will you be an angel for a helpless database? Every day major databases exhibit anomalous behavior which ISO/IEC 9075-2 fails to characterize. For just a few pages of formalism, you can give vendors and users a clear, meaningful, and portable definition of isolation levels. It’s been almost three decades. Act now. Jepsen wishes to thank INESC TEC and in particular João Azevedo, Ricardo Macedo, João Tiago Paulo, José Pereira, and Maria Ramos, for building LazyFS. Our thanks also to Justin Conklin, who contributed ASM advice and code for a significant performance improvement in Jepsen’s underlying analysis library. Irene Kannyo provided invaluable editorial support. This work was performed independently by Jepsen without compensation, in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy. Ever sticklers for precision, ANSI reminds readers that while ANSI approves, copyrights, and publishes standards, “there are no ANSI standards, only standards developed by ANSI-approved committees, many operating in accordance with the ANSI Essential Requirements (American National Standards).” In this work, “the ANSI SQL standard” refers to ANSI X3.135, also known as ISO/IEC 9075. ANSI X3.135 (not an ANSI standard) was originally produced by the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC)’s ANSI Database Technical Committee (ANSI X3H2). ISO 9075, a technically identical standard, was published a few months later. Today ISO/IEC 9075 is developed by the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee (JTC) 1 for Information Technology, and INCITS (an ANSI-accredited standards developing organization and the successor to ANSI X3), adopts it for use as an American National Standard.↩︎ The relevant portion of the SQL standard costs over two hundred dollars, making it inaccessible to casual readers. Precise phrasing is critical for this work, so we reproduce its definitions verbatim.↩︎ Yes, that Jim Gray, of System R fame!↩︎ Readers looking for a shorter version should try Adya’s ICDE paper with Barbara Liskov and Patrick O’Neil.↩︎ We omit a detailed explanation of the non-cyclic anomalies, as well as a discussion of aborted and committed transactions, internal and external reads/writes, version orders, etc., for brevity.↩︎ Vendors rarely come out and say they intend to provide the Adya levels, but in practice their implementations either prevent (e.g.) G0 at Read Committed, or, when informed of the behavior, correct it. There are exceptions. For instance, RedPanda considers G0 legal at “Read Committed,” and Oracle’s “Serializable” is actually Snapshot Isolation. Many databases provide higher isolation than is required under Adya’s formalism. For instance, PostgreSQL appears to provide Monotonic Atomic View at read committed.↩︎ Because write skew can occur in Snapshot Isolation but not PL-2.99, and phantoms can occur in PL-2.99 but some are prevented by Snapshot Isolation, neither is strictly stronger than the other. For more details, see Berenson et al., which explains that while A3 (the strict interpretation of phantoms) is prohibited by Snapshot Isolation, it sometimes permits P3 (the broad interpretation).↩︎ There has been some confusion about whether Elle’s list-append workload requires a custom datatype not supported by SQL databases. We are happy to share that the SQL standard has included both string and array concatenation since 1999, and that these datatypes and operators are broadly supported by vendors. Elle also includes a workload for plain read-write registers.↩︎ Some authors have claimed some or all of Elle’s checkers are unsound. To the best of our knowledge Elle is sound: every anomaly it finds is “real.” As our paper discussed, Elle is not complete: it may fail to detect some anomalies. This work makes Elle more complete.↩︎ Write skew (A5B) as presented by Berenson et al requires both transactions read before writing. This particular anomaly is write-skew-esque: the two transactions have overlapping read sets and disjoint write sets causing each to fail to observe the other’s effects. However, one transaction happened to read after writing, rather than before.↩︎ Breaker panels have a fixed number of slots, some of which may be left free. Adding a circuit involves installing a circuit breaker in a free slot. In this model of G2-item, the electricians check each slot on the breaker panel by performing a series of primary-key reads. If they used a predicate read, this would be G2.↩︎ This scenario happened to one of your authors. Thankfully the panel limit was not exceeded.↩︎ Some readers might contend that while this meets the formal definition of “lost update,” the updates themselves aren’t so much “lost” as simply “stacked on top of each other in potential violation of constraints.” Consider, however, that if these update operations were blind writes instead of list appends, the resulting state would be indistinguishable from a history in which one of the writes simply never happened. This is the reason P4 is called “lost update.”↩︎ The RDS parameter group for configuring MySQL uses an older name for this setting: slave_preserve_commit_order. MySQL is in the process of adopting more inclusive language, and Jepsen uses the newer “replica” term wherever possible.↩︎ Kleppman goes on to note in a later section that MySQL/InnoDB fails to prevent lost update, and that this fails to meet “some authors” definitions of Snapshot Isolation.↩︎ From the late 1980s through 1995 NIST performed conformance testing to evaluate whether databases correctly implemented the SQL standard. One wonders how they would evaluate transaction safety today.↩︎",

Even if implementations were perfect. Even when it works correctly in the Database, it is still very tricky to reason about when dealing with complex queries.I think two isolation levels that make sense are either:* read committed* serializableYou either go all the way to have a serializable setup, where there are no surprises. OR, you go in read committed direction where it is obvious that if you want have a consistent view of the data within a transaction, you have to lock the rows before you start reading them.Read committed is very similar to just regular multi-threaded code and its memory management, so most engineers can get a decent intuitive sense for it.Serializable is so strict that it is pretty hard to make very unexpected mistakes.Anything in-between is a no man&#x27;s land. And anything less consistent than Read Committed is no longer really a database. reply rockwotj 6 hours agoparentI honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen people reason about read committed well, especially as an application grows it becomes very difficult to understand all the cases in which locks are grabbed&#x2F;data is accessed. (I feel that way about multi-threaded code and locks too, but that&#x27;s for another time).So I really only see serializable to be the only sane isolation model (for r&#x2F;w transactions), and snapshot isolation is a good model for readonly transactions (basically you get a frozen in time snapshot of the database to work with). This also happens to be the only modes in which Spanner gives you: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;spanner&#x2F;docs&#x2F;transactions reply jasonwatkinspdx 8 hours agoparentprevRead only snapshot queries are very useful in practical systems. reply tzone 7 hours agorootparentHere is my issue with this. We are assuming you need to read a \"consistent snapshot\" in some type of real time application. Because if it isn&#x27;t real time, you can always have those snapshot type of querying on \"replicas\", since that is a lot easier to implement correctly without sacrificing performance.So assuming you are looking at reading \"consistent snapshot\" in the context of a real time transaction. If the data that you want to read as a \"consistent snapshot\" is small, locking + reading is good enough in most cases.If the data to read is too large (i.e. query takes long time to execute, and pulls a lot of data), you are going to have ton of scaling issues if you are depending on something like \"repeatable read\". Long running transactions, long running queries, etc are bane of all the database scaling and performance.So you really want to avoid that anyways, you would almost always be much better of changing your application logic to make sure you can have much shorter, time bounded transactions and queries and setup better application level consistency scheme. Otherwise you will at some point hit scaling&#x2F;performance problems and they will be an absolute nightmare to fix. reply jasonwatkinspdx 7 hours agorootparentUnder MVCC this does not require locks which is a non trivial overhead savings for use cases that can tolerate slightly stale data, but want that data to be internally consistent, ie no read skew (and write skew is irrelevant in read only queries). This combination of strict serializable + read only snapshots is quite common with recently developed databases. reply klysm 8 hours agoparentprevBut you wouldn’t need to lock them if repeatable read actually worked reply tzone 7 hours agorootparentThat is sort of my point. I think \"repeatable read\" is a fools gold. You think you wont need to do locking, but it is too easy to make incorrect assumptions about what guarantees \"repeatable read\" provides and you can make very subtle mistakes which leads to rare, extremely hard to diagnose correctness issues.Repeatable read type of setups also make it much easier to accidentally create much longer running transactions, and long running transactions&#x2F;too many concurrent open transactions&#x2F;etc can create really unexpected, very hard to resolve performance issues in the long run for any database. reply PeterZaitsev 56 minutes agoprevWhat would be helpful is not just comparison to theoretical definition to isolation modes but rather comparison to other popular relational databases - PostgreSQL, MS SQL, Oracle ?

FOR UPDATE\" seems to be the answer to all these issues right? Lock the rows you&#x27;re going to be updating and suddenly everything works as advertised. reply bcrosby95 8 hours agoparentIn general, stuff that locks rows tends to \"snap\" values into existence regardless of repeatable read.If you want to update a record based upon data in another record, you should do a locking read on that something else and maybe the record you&#x27;re updating. If you run an sql query to update a record based upon some other record using a single query, MySQL will lock both for you anyways.If you need to update something based upon multiple something elses, in my experience that&#x27;s very deadlock prone. Instead you should lock some kinda locking record, then do a repeatable read on the data you want, then do an update.The point in time of the repeatable read isn&#x27;t established until you perform a consistent read. Select... for update isn&#x27;t a consistent read. So it works perfectly fine in the face of concurrency while not locking dozens or hundreds of rows using a normal SQL update. reply xxpor 8 hours agoparentprevIf you want performance to completely tank, sure. reply hipadev23 8 hours agorootparentAfaik, it only locks the row(s) in question.

We used the mysql-connector-j JDBC adapter as our client. We tested MySQL 8.0.34, and MariaDB 10.11.3 on Debian Bookworm. Our tests ran against a single MySQL node as well as binlog-replicated clusters with one or two read-only followers, without failover. We also ran our test suite against a hosted MySQL service: AWS’s RDS Cluster, using the “Multi-AZ DB Cluster” profile. This is the recommended default for production workloads, and offers a binlog-replicated deployment of MySQL 8.0.34 where secondary nodes support read queries.Most concerning to me is how practically none of these had anything to do with “distributed computing”.

They expect transactions to \"just work,\" i.e. to appear to have occurred in some total order, which is the definition of serializability [2].

It&#x27;s good that the option is available, but the headaches that you can get yourself if you don&#x27;t know exactly what you are doing are real. Good luck debugging these types of Heisenbugs. You&#x27;ll need it. reply continuational 17 hours agoparentprevAs soon as you let users edit data, you can&#x27;t really benefit from serializable transactions.Partly because you don&#x27;t really want arbitrary long transactions that span however long the user wants to be editing for.Partly because it&#x27;s rather rude to roll back all the users edits with a \"deadlock detected, please reload the form and fill it out again\". reply aphyr 17 hours agorootparentI, uh, do want to point out that the alternative here is not \"everything is OK\". If you don&#x27;t abort when, say, two users update the same row concurrently, then you might cause (e.g.) silent data loss for one of them. Or you might end up with a record in an illegal state--say, one with two different fields that should never be in their particular states together. You have to look at your transaction structure, intended application invariants, and measured frequency of concurrency to figure out if using a relaxed isolation level is actually safe or not. reply mavelikara 17 hours agorootparentprevIME in this model, the middleware-DB transaction were set to be serializable, but the web-user-edits were done under an optimistic concurrency model, using versions or timestamps. You’d run into edit conflicts, which for many applications is a reasonable compromise.The DB transactions would need to be kept open for user edits only if one were using a pessimistic model.Am I thinking about this correctly? reply bcrosby95 16 hours agorootparentMost systems I&#x27;ve worked on would just let users completely overwrite eachother and would neither hold open a transaction nor use versioning. For those that didn&#x27;t behave this way, I think versioning is the sanest option (as long as requirements permit it). reply bob1029 17 hours agoparentprevSerializable by default doesn&#x27;t seem feasible when you really dive into the concept.\"Serializable\" is a system property that describes how two or more transactions will take effect. In this context, I would define \"transaction\" as a business activity with a clear beginning, middle & end and exhibiting specific, predictable data dependencies. Without any knowledge of the transaction type(s) and their semantics per the business domain, it would be impossible to make assumptions about logical ordering of anything.SQLite is the closest thing to what you are asking for. All writes are serialized by default, but this is probably not what you really want. We can ensure multiple concurrent connections don&#x27;t corrupt the data files, but we aren&#x27;t achieving anything in business terms with this. reply dastbe 16 hours agorootparenttransaction in the way everyone else here is using it is referring to the primitive provided by the database which gives certain guarantees (depending on isolation level) wrt reads and writes.Even in the context of \"transaction\" the business activity, they are an extremely useful tool for building up exactly the kind of sequencing and dependency guarantees you refer to. reply beltsazar 16 hours agorootparentprev> Serializable by default doesn&#x27;t seem feasible when you really dive into the concept.I was expecting you&#x27;d argue for a weaker isolation level than serializable, but then you said:> Without any knowledge of the transaction type(s) and their semantics per the business domain, it would be impossible to make assumptions about logical ordering of anything.Serializable isolation level only guarantees some total order of transactions, and yes, it doesn&#x27;t guarantee that the order will be exactly what you want (e.g. first come, first serve).

If you&#x27;re low write but read heavy, you won&#x27;t see huge differences in performance between RR and Serializable, so it can make sense to shift exclusively to that. The last benchmark here shows some of that with Postgres if you&#x27;re looking for numbers (not an exhaustive test by any stretch): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lchsk.com&#x2F;benchmarking-concurrent-operations-in-post...SQLite is single writer, so transaction isolation is easy, writes are linear by their very nature.Cockroach does some really funky stuff, but its serialization guarantees are only within certain conditions. Traditionally it has also had low write throughput compared to other systems, mainly due to its distributed nature. Jepsen touches on that here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jepsen.io&#x2F;analyses&#x2F;cockroachdb-beta-20160829 though things have vastly improved since then.To your earlier point, it may not even matter depending on the workload, or if you&#x27;re aware of your database limitations.

I&#x27;m in industry for 20+ years and as far as I remember MySQL was always the worst and most popular RDBMS at any given moment. reply dissident_coder 18 hours agoparentFirst, MySQL is the \"devil you know\". If you&#x27;ve spent a decade working exclusively with MySQL quirks, you&#x27;re just gonna be more comfortable with it regardless of quality.MySQL also tends to be faster for read-heavy workloads and simple queries.Also replication is easier to setup with MySQL in my (outdated) experience, even though it&#x27;s gotten better with Postgres recently and I haven&#x27;t really been able to compare them myself since I&#x27;m just using Amazon RDS Postgres these days and haven&#x27;t had the need to setup master-master replication (which is the pain point in postgres, and was pretty straightfoward with mysql the last time I worked with it). Setting up read-replicas with postgres is still ezpz.Postgres specific features tend to be much better than MySQL ones, Postgresql JSON(b) support blows MySQL out of the water. And as far as I can remember MySQL still doesn&#x27;t support partial&#x2F;expression indexes, which is a deal breaker for me. Especially in my json heavy workloads where being able to index specific json paths is critical for performance. If you don&#x27;t need that kind of stuff, you might be fine - but I would hate to hit a wall in my application where I want to reach for it and it&#x27;s not there.MySQL used to be the only game in town, so it was the \"default\" choice - but IMO postgres has surpassed it. reply darrenf 18 hours agorootparent> And as far as I can remember MySQL still doesn&#x27;t support partial&#x2F;expression indexes, which is a deal breaker for me.

But that likely won&#x27;t work for dealing with the partial index case where you&#x27;re only wanting to keep the ones that aren&#x27;t null in the index to reduce the size (and speed up null&#x2F;not null checks). reply evanelias 17 hours agorootparentMySQL supports indexing expressions directly, which is effectively the same as indexing an invisible virtual column: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.mysql.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;refman&#x2F;8.0&#x2F;en&#x2F;create-index.html#cr...MySQL supports \"multi-valued indexes\" over JSON data, which offer a non-obvious solution for partial indexes, since \"index records are not added for empty arrays\": https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.mysql.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;refman&#x2F;8.0&#x2F;en&#x2F;create-index.html#cr...MariaDB doesn&#x27;t support any of this directly yet though: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.skeema.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;10&#x2F;mysql-vs-mariadb-schem... reply gog 19 hours agoparentprevWe use it, we know it and can troubleshoot it if needed, it satisfies our needs and it works.

Web developers who learned it were mostly using Rails which has fallen somewhat out of favour. YMMV obviously, but I can understand it&#x27;s decline as Python has concretely taken over the working space and devops tools like Chef&#x2F;Puppet are not en-vogue any longer as Go and Kubernetes&#x2F;CNCF stuff took the lions share.Equally: javascript (node, really) is less favourable to many JS devs than Typescript. If you aggregate TS and JS then you&#x27;ll see that the ecosystem is growing but many people who are JS folks have switched to TS.I&#x27;m taken aback by what you seem to suggest though; Would you seriously claim that most new projects ARE using PHP?I would happily argue that point with any data you supply, it&#x27;s completely contrary to my experience and understanding of things and I have a pretty wide and disparate social circle in tech companies. reply stephenr 13 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m taken aback by what you seem to suggest though; Would you seriously claim that most new projects ARE using PHP?No. I didn&#x27;t say that, and we need to clarify what you meant originally to make sense here.When you say \"most people wouldn&#x27;t start a project in php\", there are two ways to interpret \"most\" in that sentence: \"the majority of\" (ie 50%+) or \"nearly all of\" (ie a much higher percentage). Both are accepted definitions for \"most\".I assumed you meant the latter: ie \"nearly everyone would not start a project in php\", which is what I disagree with, because the former makes little sense in context.If you did in fact mean \"a majority of people would not start a project in php\" then of course I agree because that sentence can be substituted to mention any programming language in existence and still be true, because none are ever so dominant over all others in terms of popularity, that more than half of all new projects are written in said language. reply dijit 13 hours agorootparentit&#x27;s a little bit hair splitty, but I see what you might be trying to get at.What I tried to convey is that PHP is not enjoying the development heyday it once had, and the numbers of people choosing PHP for a new project today (even among people who learned development with PHP) is decreasing. It&#x27;s not popular.let&#x27;s try to leave it as: \"I believe PHP to be in decline for new projects as a share of total new projects divided by the total number of developers who are starting new projects\". reply johnmaguire 14 hours agorootparentprevRuby has had a huge decline in the past ten years, IMO.Also, note that TypeScript is tracked separately from Javascript, which is likely part of its decline. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if JS backends are ultimately declining as well (perhaps Go and Python are taking its place?) replyBognar 6 hours agorootparentprevHaving worked at GitHub, we used MySQL because we&#x27;ve always used MySQL. It works because the business depends on making it continue to work, and switching off at this point is a multi-year effort. Herculean efforts have gone into scaling MySQL, and that is not without its own issues (outages, maintenance cost, etc.).Isolation level consistency is not a problem I heard anyone talk about, but that&#x27;s probably because most devs interact with the database via Active Record which is not exactly known for its transactionality guarantees (and is, of course, a source of yet another set of problems). reply stephenr 14 hours agorootparentprev> a native UUID type so I don&#x27;t have to write functions that convert 16bit binary to textual representation and back when examining the data manually on the serverMySQL 8 adds the `BIN_TO_UUID()` function (and the inverse, UUID_TO_BIN), and supports the quasi-standard bit swapping trick to handle time-based UUID&#x27;s in indexed columns. reply turtles3 10 hours agoparentprevThis is a great question, and if the choice is between mysql and postgres, I would like to make the case that despite the current popular momentum behind postgres, mysql is a better default. Please note I&#x27;m not saying mysql is better, but in the absence of any other criteria, I would suggest stating with mysql.I have a few reasons for this view, but they mostly revolve around operational complexity. From a developer&#x27;s point of view postgres is fantastic. Far saner SQL dialect, tons of great features. When it comes to operations though, that&#x27;s where mysql has the edge, and ops is half of using a database - it&#x27;s an important facet for a business to consider.As other commenters have mentioned, postgres requires careful tuning of the autovacuum process, otherwise it can&#x27;t keep up as the workload grows.Postgres has a far more advanced query planner, but it comes at the cost of potentially blowing up your app at 3am, and it gives you no tools to patch in a quick fix while you address the root cause. This frankly ignores the reality of operating a business. Sometimes you need a quick fix, even if that might lead to users developing bad habits. Yes there is the pg_hint_plan extension, but that still only helps you later after the problem had happened. You can&#x27;t pin a query plan. To me the ideal situation would be for postgres to continue to use the old query plan, but emit some structured log to tell you it thinks it&#x27;s now suboptimal. But I digress.Thirdly, postgres has no way to have an index clustered table. This lets you trade a small cost on write for greater page locality when reading related rows. Postgres let&#x27;s you do this as a one time operation that takes the table offline for the duration, which isn&#x27;t sufficient if you need it.Fourthly, mysql is still easier to upgrade. You will need to upgrade your database at some point. Mysql has great support for upgrade in place, as well as using replication to build a new db. Mysql replication has always been logical replication, which has tradeoffs of course, but what it buys you is the ability to replicate across different versions. Pg&#x27;s logical replication still has a bunch of sharp edges.Ok this rant is long enough already, but I do want to emphasise that this isn&#x27;t hating on postgres. I know it&#x27;s controversial to be recommending mysql over postgres, but I do think the ops concerns win out.Ps the orioledb project is fantastic and I hope it one day becomes the default for postgres. reply wbl 6 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t working in the first place an ops concern? reply otabdeveloper4 1 hour agoparentprev> Is it really superior in anything?Yes, its replication support out of the box is decades ahead of Postgres.(Mongodb has an even better replication story than Myqsl, but Mongo isn&#x27;t a real database.) reply WJW 19 hours agoparentprev- It works well enough.- It scales up fine for 99+% of companies, and for the ones that need to scale beyond that there are battle tested solutions like Vitess.- It is what people know already so they don&#x27;t have to learn anything new.Same reason why people still make new websites in PHP I guess. It&#x27;s not fancy but it works fine and won&#x27;t bring any unwelcome surprises. reply willvarfar 19 hours agoparentprevNot up to date, but a decade ago MySQL supported pluggable storage engines and so had had some good non-default choices. It was possible to fit really big databases onto small boxes using tokudb, for example.This doesn&#x27;t explain why it was so popular for starting new small projects, but people were also choosing mongodb at that time too, so ymmv :)Nowadays postgres has grown a lot of features but I believe it is still behind on built-in compression?Added: this old blog post of mine is still getting traffic 10 years later; probably still valid https:&#x2F;&#x2F;williame.github.io&#x2F;post&#x2F;25080396258.html reply viraptor 13 hours agoparentprevOthers mentioned a few reasons already, but compared to postgres (because typically that&#x27;s the other option) I&#x27;ll add index selection. Even with the available plugins and stats and everything, I don&#x27;t want to in an emergency situation spend time trying to indirectly convince postgres that it should use a different index. \"A query takes 20x the time and you can&#x27;t force it back immediately\" is a really bad failure mode. reply Topgamer7 18 hours agoparentprevMySQL has some aggregation performance over postgres. Having done a recent migration of an application two things that come to mind are:- its case insensitive by default, which can make filtering simpler, without having to deal with a duplicate column where all values are lower&#x2F;upper cased. - MySQL implements loose index scan and index skip scan, which improves performance of a number of join aggregation operations (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.postgresql.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Loose_indexscan) reply dpratt 18 hours agorootparentnext [–]its case insensitive by defaultThis is obviously up for debate, but subjectively I find this to be an absolutely terrible design decision. reply hu3 13 hours agorootparentI agree it&#x27;s debatable. And not intuitive at first.With that said, in all my years and thousands of tables across multiple jobs, I have yet to see a single case where I had to change a table to be case sensitive. So I guess for me it is a sensible default. reply Keyframe 19 hours agoparentprevOnce upon a time it was easi-ish to scale out, and was simple to use and fast. There was Percona as well. These days, who knows? Might still be true. reply adontz 16 hours agoparentprevJust want to add, that comparing to postgresql is a very modern view. There were other databases, not popular today, but quite popular back in the day. To name a few: DB2, InterBase, Firebird, Paradox, Access, SQL Server Compact. MySQL was a really shitty database in early 2000s, still THE most popular. reply endorphine 18 hours agoparentprevAs opposed to what? Postgres? Isn&#x27;t InnoDB most performant for read-heavy apps? reply dijit 15 hours agorootparentMyISAM is actually considerably faster (than InnoDB) for read heavy apps.InnoDB is comparatively slow, but you get much better transactionality (IE; something that is much closer to ACID compliance). Row level locking is faster for inserts than table level locking, but table level locking is faster for reads than row level locking.Regardless: Both storage engines do not scale with core count as effectively as postgres due to some deadlocking on update that I have witnessed with MySQL. (not that Postgresql is the only alternative btw). reply menaerus 1 hour agorootparentMyISAM is not a transactional storage engine even to begin with, so saying that you get \"much better transactionality with InnoDB\" or \"MyISAM is actually considerably faster\" is either wrong or at best comparing apples to oranges.> Both storage engines do not scale with core count as effectively as postgres due to some deadlocking on update that I have witnessed with MySQL.Strange take since a deadlock is rather an exceptional event you want never to occur so deadlocking, in algorithm design, wouldn&#x27;t be considered a reason one would say that the implementation does not \"scale with the core count\". Whether or not the algorithm scales with the core count is for many other different reasons but not deadlocks.Considering the \"scale with the core count\" design problem, Postgres process-per-connection architecture makes it a much less viable option than, say, MySQL so this is wrong as well. reply dijit 46 minutes agorootparentWell, I’ve literally observed it (circa 2016 and design has not significantly changed with this in that time) and confirmed my finding with percona.deadlock was the wrong terminology to use, apologies, I keep writing from my phone as I am travelling at the moment: I meant lock contention, specifically in memory. A deadlock would be a hard stop but what I observed was a bottleneck on memory bandwidth past a certain number of cores (24) with update heavy workloads.So, appreciate your points but I don&#x27;t think I am wrong in the core thesis of my statements. x :) reply VintageCool 6 hours agorootparentprevThere is no excuse to be using MyISAM instead of InnoDB in 2023. It was a scarcely forgivable mistake in 2013.The read performance advantages of MyISAM are solved better by using SSDs instead of HDDs.MyISAM will cost you dearly when performing actions like \"trying to create a new replica of an existing database\". reply lmm 9 hours agoparentprev> Why would anyone start a new project with MySQL?

I&#x27;m not that experienced with Postgresql, but my understanding is that until recently you had to vacuum it every once in a while. Besides, it&#x27;s also using some kind of threading model that most people handle by putting a proxy in front of Postgres to keep connections open.Also, Mysql has had native replication for a very long time, including Galera which does two-step commit in a multimaster cluster.

    "originLink": "https://simonschreibt.de/gat/dont-starve-diablo-parallax-7/",
    "originBody": "Hey, Simon is making a game!! :) Wishlist & Play Demo on Steam A Game Art Trick Don’t starve, Diablo – Parallax 7 Russian Version by john In the 1990s, games started to move from 2D to 3D and if an alien would have landed on earth back then, it surely would have thought that nobody needs these low-res polygon-models without any filtering. Then it would destroy the earth. Later his mother would teach him what made humans special: Even during the 2D-Era they had enormous willpower to render 3D – even if it wasn’t yet possible! It started with implementing a parallax effect (depending on the “distance” some elements move faster than others). This parallax effect blew people away back in 1982: Game: Moon Patrol Source: manatsea It’s really interesting that a bunch of (differently) moving “planes” have such a strong effect. But it’s a bit flat, right? A perspective camera above the ground would be cool but isn’t possible without “real” 3D? Well, let’s have a look through a time machine to the SNES-Era: Game: Moon Patrol Source: Bluekirby22 This looks 3D but it’s not! It is SNES tech and is called “Mode 7“. To render it, Nintendo manipulated textures (trading height for depth) with some coder magic. Here’s someone who knows the recipe (he talks about the Gameboy Advance but as far as i know it’s true for the SNES either): “The GBA doesn’t have any real 3D hardware capabilities, but you can fake it by cleverly manipulating the scaling and translation REG_BGxX-REG_BGxPD for every scanline.” -Cearn By the way: even today some people are crazy about the Mode 7 and use it for some projects with the RPG Maker. Impressive! Nowadays we could render every asset in “real” 3D to give them volume but there are examples where this is just not needed. In fact, it’s sometimes even better to do it old-schoolish: Source: Don’t Starve All the bushes, trees and enemies in Don’t Starve are flat. And i think it looks awesome! For me, Diablo 2 (2D ARPG from year 2000) was the first game which brought the “Moon Patrol”-parallax effect and something like the “Mode 7”-floor-rendering together. Let’s look at the game with standard settings. Pure 2D. No perspective. No parallax effects: Source: Diablo 2 But the game had a “Perspective Mode”. Let’s turn it on! Pay attention, how the pales don’t cover the same floor-pixels all the time: Source: Diablo 2 It looks like in Don’t Starve, but remember: Diablo 2 is a 2D game! There’s no official information about this mode. All what you read now, was only possible by using the awesome tools/documentation by Tom Amigo and Paul Siramy – special thanks to Paul, which answered all my questions and supported me a lot! It might seem, that Blizzards coders only move the sprites somehow but if you compare the game with perspective mode on and off while standing still, it gets better visible, that they actually “tilt” everything towards the horizon. Source: Diablo 2 This gets even better visible when i add a beautiful checker pattern to the floor textures: Source: Diablo 2 I mean, think of it: every asset has to be transformed somehow, to look perspectively without any gaps at the sprite-borders. This is even more impressive if you see of how much sprites the scene consists (a lot chances for gaps…): Source: Diablo 2 Source: Diablo 2 And game-tech can’t be complicated enough! So please consider that Blizzard subdivides the sprites into 32x32px parts. This seems to be an optimization to only load necessary parts of an image. Additionally it becomes handy when the transformation is happening. Here you see how an ingame sprite is subdivided: Source: DT1 format by Paul Siramy For every 32px I painted a line on the pale-texture to show a faked wireframe. The result was more interesting than i expected! Like the vertical lines indicate, the sprite got a “real” vanishing point deep in the ground (which you would expect when it comes to perspective): Source: Diablo 2 However, I don’t know why the lower edge of the sprite is bent that way. For the perspective it wouldn’t be necessary (below is a 3Ds Max scene to show that the horizontal lines are straight if the camera isn’t rotated around its front axis): Anyway, Blizzards wizards will know why they do that. It may be worth noting, that this deformation is depended on the “angle” you’re looking at the sprite (or the position of the player/camera). Here you can see how the lower edge is straightened up: Source: Diablo 2 For those who are interested in seeing the deformation on a checker pattern, here’s a screenshot: Source: Diablo 2 If you think that all this is interesting enough, than be amazed by reading more. Paul writes that Sprites can have an orientation value. Depending on this value the sprites are deformed differently (yeah…more complexity)! Here’s an example of some wall which have directions defined like (Left Wall, Upper Wall, Lower-Left corner, etc.) Source: DT1 format by Paul Siramy Let me demonstrate what (i assume) has to be done. On the next picture you can see a standard ISO view. Below that, there are the steps which i had to make to “fit” the sprites to a “perspective” ground. I had to re-position, re-scale and deform twice to fit them to the floor-grid. As you see, this sprite-transformation (as i imagine it) is kind of complicated. Let’s have a look how it actually was made in the game: Source: Diablo 2 This sprite is oriented in a different way than the example i mentioned before. And as you see, the deformation is very different! No bending of the upper/lower edges but instead it looks like the edges “point” to a vanishing point to the left. Again an example how it looks in 3Ds Max: It’s seems that the game exaggerates the deformation to avoid any gaps between the sprites and i think it’s very successful with that because every sprite of the fence fits perfectly. Pay attention how the edge-orientation (upper edges, lower edges) changes depending on their position: Source: Diablo 2 How important the sprite-orientation values is, shows the next example. If i just tell the game that this isn’t a “right” but a “left” oriented wall, it’s gap-time: Source: Diablo 2 This mode was only activatable with D3D in fullscreen (Diablo 2 also supported Glide and Software Rendering) what made me trying to get my hands on old DirectX-Documentation to get more information. But i wasn’t successful. So…here ends our trip and i hope you are amazed as I am by this crazy example of the will to make 2D look more 3D. The lack of official information or statements of the government (search your government website for “Diablo 2 perspective mode” … you’ll find nothing!) leads me to one inevitable conclusion: All this is alien technology!

A 3D graphics card was required to enable Diablo 2’s Perspective Mode. (Lord of Destruction expansion shown.) A solution occurred to him late one morning. Like the original game, Diablo IIunfolds on a grid, with one major difference. Each diamond-shaped tile is composed of several smaller diamond tiles that allow for some overlap. This meant that objects such as player-characters, monsters, treasure chests, and items can occupy the same squares on a grid by standing in smaller squares within each larger square, an impossibility in the first Diablo. A more granular layout facilitated Dave’s pseudo-3D solution, which he called Perspective Mode. His idea was to take the texture stored in every miniature tile and rotate it just a smidge, so that it wasn’t quite orthogonal, as players moved around the screen. The game passed those textures to the video card, which painted them onto two polygons and then stretched them vertically and horizontally so that they appeared larger or smaller depending on the player-character’s position. Trees and buildings, for example, seemed larger or smaller as players moved closer or further away, and scrolled by at a different speed than other objects in the foreground and background, creating a parallax effect. Objects shimmered slightly, the result of bilinear filtering, a process baked into graphics cards that smooths out textures when objects are rendered larger or smaller than their native resolutions. Everything, from characters and items to structures such as the cabins and towers in Act I, expanded and shrank in Perspective Mode, an option only available to users running 3D cards that the game supported. “It was doing real, 3D math, and making this grid scale slightly, stretch slightly,” Dave explained. “It gave a real sense of depth to the world.” In an impressively short span of time, Perspective Mode was finished and rolled into the latest build of the game. “There were a bunch of things I had to do to make sure walls lined up properly, and the lighting, but I think I wrote that fairly quickly,” Dave continued. “I think it only took me a week or two to get it working. People loved the way it looked, and it really was awesome, but the artists weren’t super happy they had to go back and chop up things and render them differently. We did feel it was worth it in the end, and added a lot to the game.” Source: How StarCraft and Shower Epiphanies Influenced Diablo 2’s Design 12 Replies Want more?

It is SNES tech and is called “Mode 7“. To render it, Nintendo manipulated textures (trading height for depth) with some coder magic.Mode 7 essentially is a primitive 3D accelerator, it renders a single textured plane with various transforms. I think in principle it&#x27;s just as \"real 3D\" as a modern GPU, it&#x27;s just very very limited and less accurate. reply RedNifre 6 hours agoparentNo, it&#x27;s not: Mode 7 can only zoom, translate and rotate the layer in 2D. For example, the Bowser fight in Super Mario World is a typical use of mode 7: Bowser moves around, sometimes rotates and between rounds flies around in \"3D\" by zooming in and out.The cool 3D hack comes from co-processors in the cartridge: Games like Super Mario Kart use extra chips than can quickly compute new mode 7 parameters per scanline: If you change the zoom and translation of mode 7 on every line (but keep the rotation the same), you can get the typical tilted 3D look by having the upper lines zoomed out (smaller) and the lower lines zoomed in more (bigger).This \"change the zoom on each scanline\" trick is very different from what modern GPUs do and not an arbitrary transform, e.g. with the scanline trick you can only rotate the plane around the horizontal axis, but not around the vertical one. reply coopierez 54 minutes agorootparentYou don&#x27;t need a co-processor for that. Final Fantasies IV-VI all used the 3D mode 7 effect for the overworld, making the effect more exaggerated when the player enters an airship. It&#x27;s fairly trivial and inexpensive to use HDMA to adjust the (pre-calculated) parameters for each scanline.Super Mario Kart needed the co-processor for determining things like how to draw the karts depending on their position and distance from the player. Pilotwings used the same co-processor for similar things (essentially, tracking objects and perspective in 3D space). reply daxelrod 4 hours agorootparentprevGreat explanation.F-Zero managed to do the “change zoom on each scanline” trick without a coprocessor in the cartridge, didn’t it? reply elpocko 9 hours agoparentprevA really fixed pipeline. reply ethbr1 9 hours agorootparentGotta save those transistors somewhere!

For the perspective it wouldn’t be necessary (below is a 3Ds Max scene to show that the horizontal lines are straight if the camera isn’t rotated around its front axis):I think (think!) this is necessary to simulate a vanishing point \"below\" the ground for vertically-oriented sprites. If the three pikes rotate out at the top, the bottom has to rotate a bit with it. A skew transform wouldn&#x27;t look right.The 3dmax scene didn&#x27;t show much of it b&#x2F;c it was straight-on with the viewport and with square textures a skew looks ok.In the moving example, the three stakes would indeed spread out w.r.t. the eye position in real-ish life as you got closer. The 3dmax render does not illustrate this well. reply kzrdude 12 hours agoprevIt sounds like the dev was very satisfied with parallax, but I don&#x27;t recall ever using it.

So aren&#x27;t they fundamentally \"not real\" 3d in the same qualitative way? reply dexwiz 8 hours agoparentNot really. Modern 3D games have an arbitrarily placed camera and use linear algebra to flatten everything from 3d into 2d clip space and then rasterize. Games like D2 use sprites and offsets to give the illusion of 3d, they don’t have a 3d coordinate system to begin with. In games like this movement is usually constrained to 2 axes.Also a key different is pre-rendered sprites. In games like Roller Coaster Tycoon or Diablo, models were made on expensive dedicated computers and then rendered into sprite sheets. Objects may look 3d but were usually shipped as flat assets. Some modern pixel art games will do stuff like ship a normal map with the sprite so you can do dynamic lightning on a 2d sprite.Modern games that use parallax could easily be just rendering flat objects in 3d scenes, but 20 years ago graphics pipelines were way different so you had to be clever if you wanted 3d effects. reply TacticalCoder 7 hours agoprevNot only did I play Diablo 2 (TFA is about Diablo 2, not about Diablo) a huge lot but...

    "originBody": "Technology Nobody Knows What’s Happening Online Anymore Why you’ve probably never heard of the most popular Netflix show in the world By Charlie Warzel Illustration by The Atlantic; Source: Getty. December 18, 2023 Share Saved StoriesSave You are currently logged on to the largest version of the internet that has ever existed. By clicking and scrolling, you’re one of the 5 billion–plus people contributing to an unfathomable array of networked information—quintillions of bytes produced each day. The sprawl has become disorienting. Some of my peers in the media have written about how the internet has started to feel “placeless” and more ephemeral, even like it is “evaporating.” Perhaps this is because, as my colleague Ian Bogost has argued, “the age of social media is ending,” and there is no clear replacement. Or maybe artificial intelligence is flooding the internet with synthetic information and killing the old web. Behind these theories is the same general perception: Understanding what is actually happening online has become harder than ever. The internet destroyed any idea of a monoculture long ago, but new complications cloud the online ecosystem today: TikTok’s opaque “For You” recommendation system, the ascension of paywalls that limit access to websites such as this one, the collapse of Twitter—now X—under Elon Musk, the waning relevance of news across most social-media sites. The broad effect is an online experience that feels unique to every individual, depending on their ideologies and browsing habits. The very idea of popularity is up for debate: Is that trend really viral? Did everyone see that post, or is it just my little corner of the internet? More than before, it feels like we’re holding a fun-house mirror up to the internet and struggling to make sense of the distorted picture. Read: The great social media-news collapse “There’s a real lack of understanding of what’s going on across platforms,” Ryan Broderick, who writes the newsletter Garbage Day, told me. For the past six months, Broderick has been partnering with NewsWhip and other online-analytics companies and independently building intelligence reports, tracking the most popular content and personalities across sites such as Facebook, X, Reddit, TikTok, Twitch, and YouTube. In the 2010s, he said, a curious person was better equipped to take the temperature of the web: “The stuff going viral on Facebook was of a different flavor and demographic than, say, YouTube or Twitter, but it felt easier to look at it all, shuffle the decks together, and say, There’s the internet.” Sometime between mid-2021 and early 2022, Broderick noticed that information was moving differently. News stories blew up in corners of the internet and died out, completely bypassing his feeds, and fake “viral” trends popped up with increasing frequency, despite little evidence that anyone was participating in them. Consider TikTok for a second—arguably the most vibrant platform on the internet. Try to imagine which posts might have been most popular on the site this year. Perhaps a dispatch from the Middle East or incendiary commentary on the mass bombings in Gaza? Or maybe something lighter, like a Gen Z dance trend or gossip about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce? Well, no: According to TikTok’s year-end report, the most popular videos in the U.S.—clips racking up as many as half a billion views each—aren’t topical at all. They include makeup tutorials, food ASMR, a woman showing off a huge house cat, and a guy spray-painting his ceiling to look like Iron Man. As a Verge headline noted earlier this month, “TikTok’s biggest hits are videos you’ve probably never seen.” Other platforms have the same issue: Facebook’s most recent “Widely Viewed Content Report” is full of vapid, pixelated, mostly repackaged memes and videos getting tens of millions of views. The dynamic extends beyond social media too. Just last week, Netflix unexpectedly released an unusually comprehensive “engagement report” revealing audience-consumption numbers for most of the TV shows and movies in its library—more than 18,000 titles in all. The attempt at transparency caused confusion among some viewers: Netflix’s single most popular anything from January and June 2023 was a recent thriller series called The Night Agent, which was streamed for 812 million hours globally. “I stay pretty plugged in with media, especially TV shows - legit have never heard of what’s apparently the most watched scripted show in the world,” one person posted on Threads. This confusion is a feature of a fragmented internet, which can give the impression that two opposing phenomena are happening simultaneously: Popular content is being consumed at an astounding scale, yet popularity and even celebrity feel miniaturized, siloed. We live in a world where it’s easier than ever to be blissfully unaware of things that other people are consuming. It’s also easier than ever to assign outsize importance to information or trends that may feel popular but are actually contained. Last month, a claim began to circulate online that TikTok was awash in viral videos of users reading from and praising Osama bin Laden’s 2002 “Letter to America.” The trend was quickly cited by journalists as a worrying indicator of rising anti-Semitism. But a quick analysis of the platform offered more nuance. Although some videos did exist, The Washington Post found that the “Letter to America” hashtag was on only 274 of them during the two-day period in question. The videos received 1.8 million views—far, far fewer than videos hashtagged with travel, skincare, and anime in another 24-hour stretch, according to examples named by the Post. What followed was a messy postmortem, one that I fear might foreshadow the way 2024-election stories will play out: Internet-savvy reporters tried to offer important correctives to the notion that the letter had gone viral. But others rightly noted that the videos, at least one of which had more than 10,000 likes, were still troubling, even if they were not viral by TikTok standards. Politicians seized on the news to further their own long-standing grievances, namely that TikTok, which they fear is controlled by the Chinese government, is influencing and even radicalizing younger American users. TikTok did not respond to my request for comment. As interested parties debated whether the trend was real, the coverage drew greater attention to the videos, causing them to go far more viral on secondary platforms; a video compilation of the TikToks has been viewed more than 41 million times on X. Should this cycle repeat in the same way next year, the 2024 presidential campaign will be an especially punishing affair: It will be the TikTok Shadowboxing Election, where virality becomes a meaningless descriptor that nevertheless justifies any number of conflicts. After the “Letter to America” controversy, I reached out to Brandon Silverman, the founder of CrowdTangle, a platform that tracks the most popular posts across Facebook (which acquired it in 2016). Silverman quit Facebook in 2021, and he now says that big technology platforms are making it harder to verify trends and trace where they came from. Unlike Twitter before Musk, X is a black box, he told me, and TikTok only gives access to its research interface to academic researchers by application. “We’re mostly arguing over data that we don’t have” and “chasing our own tails around the internet,” Silverman said. CrowdTangle itself paused new user sign-ups last year, arguably a major turning point in this entire conversation: Researchers and transparency groups argued that Meta defanged CrowdTangle’s team as part of an internal reorganization, and reporters have speculated that the transparency tool caused too many headaches for Meta executives when it became clear that conspiracy theories, election-denial content, and far-right influencers were popular across the social network. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson told me that paid CrowdTangle accounts are still active and that, last month, the company rolled out a new series of tools to “provide access to near real-time public content from Pages, Posts, Groups and Events” on Facebook, as well as from professional accounts on Instagram. Popularity and virality aren’t the only metrics to determine what’s important, but without an understanding of what is happening online, we’re much more likely to let others take advantage of us or to waste precious time thinking about, debunking, and debating issues and controversies that are actually insignificant or have little impact on the world around us. Likewise, politicians can take trends out of context to fit their own political agenda. Last month on the Senate floor, Senator Marsha Blackburn cited “the appalling popularity” of the bin Laden letter on TikTok. “This didn’t happen on its own,” Blackburn argued. “You had TikTok pushing along on this.” Some high-profile Democrats, including New York Governor Kathy Hochul, similarly called out TikTok. When we waste our time chasing shadows, Silverman argued, “we miss the more important issues that actually do deserve our time and attention and tell us something truly meaningful about platforms, ourselves, or the world.” Not that a more centralized social-media experience was perfect. “What I saw at CrowdTangle is that, more often than not, it was actually just a few influential accounts that made something ‘go viral,’” Silverman told me. He argued that, because the platform audiences were less fragmented, a few large accounts dictated virality way more often than an army of small ones did. Broderick agreed, noting that, especially on networks such as Twitter, media organizations could identify and amplify trends, thereby increasing their reach—a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy. “One reason why there’s so much consternation is that if you can’t see what’s going on, you can’t rig the game anymore,” he said. A shift away from a knowable internet might feel like a return to something smaller and purer. An internet with no discernable monoculture may feel, especially to those who’ve been continuously plugged into trending topics and viral culture, like a relief. But this new era of the internet is also one that entrenches tech giants and any forthcoming emergent platforms as the sole gatekeepers when it comes to tracking the way that information travels. We already know them to be unreliable narrators and poor stewards, but on a fragmented internet, where recommendation algorithms beat out the older follower model, we rely on these corporations to give us a sense of scale. This might sound overdramatic, but without an innate sense of what other people are doing, we might be losing a way to measure and evaluate ourselves. We’re left shadowboxing one another and arguing in the dark about problems, the size of which we can’t identify.",

None of my customers ever asked me how I was going to do it, or how hard I worked at it. They did not give a damn. They only cared about was the lawn mowed.

How do you choose which content to watch and how does that process exclude algorithmic curation? reply notjoemama 6 hours agorootparentI don’t think it’s a matter of choosing content that is served up by algorithm but by finding the content that the algorithm omits. I find I then have to listen for what are truth statements, for verifiable truth statements, and sift out the emotional language. In fact, the more emotional the tone, the more intention I attribute to the engineering of it being shown to me. This has resulted in me looking at and reading what I think is garbage sometimes, but I typically find some nugget of truth in it that helps me reason about why someone would think that way. Kind of erases the left versus right thing in politics. reply Eisenstein 2 hours agorootparentHow do you know when you found that truth nugget?Why do you think content that is excluded from the algorithm is more legitimate?How do you know it was excluded?What do you think about the notion that many&#x2F;most people who claim they are neither left nor right end up demonstrating that they are actually pretty right-wing? reply WalterBright 4 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve read many books by activists, and by serious historians. After a while, you notice that the style of writing is different. The activist writers use noticeably more emotional language, draw sweeping conclusions based on flimsy evidence, have fewer cites, and no counterexamples are ever mentioned.For a couple activist products, Showtime recently ran a miniseries documentary on Reagan, and HBO one on Kennedy. The 6 hour Reagan documentary was about everything that was wrong about Reagan (it even criticized Reagan for recovering rapidly from the assassination attempt), and Reagan did nothing right. The Kennedy documentary was the other way, Kennedy was a god among men and never put a foot wrong. reply Eisenstein 2 hours agorootparentDo you think that is because the producers had some kind of agenda, or were they pandering to modern sentiments on those figures, or were they illustrating their own biases, or something else? reply WalterBright 1 hour agorootparentProbably all of the above, but that&#x27;s just speculation. What&#x27;s pretty certain is the relentless one-sided approach was no accident. reply autoexec 4 hours agorootparentprevOne thing I try to do is increase the amount of content I view because I explicitly requested it instead of what was being suggested to me. \"Pull\" instead of \"Push\". I don&#x27;t ever log into youtube. I also have their related&#x2F;recommended videos disabled, and I never see their homepage&#x2F;trending stuff. They&#x27;ll still put whatever random stuff they want you see in search results (usually pretty far down at least) and ultimately an algorithm determines what kinds of videos are included in any set of search results, but I do think it helps both to avoid being fed most of what they&#x27;re pushing on people and (to some extent) limit the amount of time spent just mindlessly viewing youtube.Same with streaming services, I&#x27;ll skip over whatever their major ads are pushing at me (for example, the large banners at the top of the screen when you sign in, the \"featured\" category, etc.) and I won&#x27;t be satisfied with whatever they decide to show you (repeatedly) in whatever random categories the algorithm presents to me that day. I use the search function a lot there too, often just entering \"random\" strings of 3-4 characters and seeing what comes back as I keep scrolling down.Like with youtube, you can tell that when they&#x27;re pushing something hard enough they&#x27;ll just insert that stuff into the results of any search you enter, but I&#x27;m often surprised to find a lot of things I want to see that the streaming service had never shown me before that way. I&#x27;m disappointed that HBO Max decided to abandon their simple A-Z listing of everything they had in order to encourage people to depend only on their algorithm.The more I can eliminate or avoid things being pushed at me and decide for myself what content to consume the more variety I see, but at a certain level you&#x27;re always left with whatever people are willing to show&#x2F;sell you which is frustrating. Exploration and recommendations from actual humans are more fun anyway.For news and other topics I want information on I try to look at stuff from multiple sources and perspectives to avoid the filter bubble problem and to get an idea of what people who&#x27;d disagree with me are thinking or understanding about a topic. I find that when I&#x27;m reading content from people&#x2F;perspectives I strongly disagree with I automatically read what they&#x27;re saying very critically and that practice carries over so that I can&#x27;t help but do it even when I&#x27;m reading things from people&#x2F;sources I personally trust generally. Terrible arguments, bad facts, and attempts to mislead are pretty common everywhere and this does make me a lot less confident in what I \"know\", but that&#x27;s probably a good thing. reply WalterBright 4 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m disappointed that HBO Max decided to abandon their simple A-Z listing of everything they had in order to encourage people to depend only on their algorithm.I wish Netflix&#x2F;Comcast&#x2F;Prime had a ribbon called \"randomly selected\" that was like shuffle play on my stereo, and have it change daily. replyAerbil313 4 hours agorootparentprevThe bonds between people are diminishing while the bonds between people and the institutions &#x2F; technology is strengthening.

You launch on Spotify and YouTube, monetization is already there or just a click away.Another factor seems to be the survivorship bias. The ones that stick around are the ones with enough monetization to pay out and continue working with consistency.It does seem like creators generally have more control though, if they don&#x27;t sign away rights for an infusion of capital.

It&#x27;s much easier now for a meme to go viral (for good or for bad) because everyone on the Internet is potentially connected to everyone else. You didn&#x27;t know how many kids were actually listening to that loud radio station in the past, any more than you know how many people are actually listening to what&#x27;s trending on Spotify.

While it&#x27;s still the case that no 16-year-olds are going to want to hang out with us, their language and activities and perspectives don&#x27;t feel as foreign as Boomers purported to feel about, well, everything. Because unlike previous generations, who fetishized leaving behind childish things and creating stark barriers between kid world and adult world, many of us have continued to do what we like as we&#x27;ve grown older. And it turns out, the reason kids like to do things like play video games or obsess over anime or take drugs is because these things are fun. And because we&#x27;re still \"in the game\", so to speak, we don&#x27;t balk and criticize and feign outrage like previous generations. That leaves a tremendous amount of space for connections, because we all play games and have niche interests and like our weird TV shows, even if the specifics vary greatly (and more than ever before).I recently bought my nephew a box of Pokémon cards. I don&#x27;t play Pokémon, I have no interest in it and frankly it seems kind of dumb. But I would never say that because all I wanted at age 12 were boxes of comic book cards and Magic the Gathering cards. Equally dumb, at least! So I &#x27;get&#x27; it, unlike my mother who, though sometimes obliging, thought all of these hobbies were incomprehensible nonsense.This doesn&#x27;t seem to be a passing phenomenon. Once you&#x27;ve established a perspective that respects and expects change, there&#x27;s no law of nature that will magically revert that. That doesn&#x27;t mean it will be frictionless. And it does require some conscious effort to keep up. I have TikTok on my phone. I rarely use it, but I&#x27;m familiar with it and it&#x27;s not foreign to me. I see it as my task to refuse to let changes in technology or culture become foreign to me. And that task seems vastly easier today compared to the pre-internet era of scarce information, overwhelming monoculture and insular, defensive subcultures. reply chrisweekly 5 hours agorootparent\"it&#x27;s still the case that no 16-year-olds are going to want to hang out with us\"That&#x27;s a broad brush you&#x27;re painting with, amigo.

His generalization is correct, your counter isn&#x27;t evidence against it.Part of the reason for the generational gap isn&#x27;t just because of different culture. But it&#x27;s also because where kids and adults are all day. Adults are at work, kids are at school. So the social connections, hierarchy and the dynamics are all completely different universes.A lot of kids don&#x27;t give a shit about grades because often that&#x27;s not part of the social hierarchy at school. Money isn&#x27;t even that huge either. It&#x27;s when they get out of school all the rules change. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s always this younger generational gap between teens and adults but less of a gap between say 20s and 30s. reply nradov 5 hours agorootparentprevAre video games actually fun?

I&#x27;ve been an avid gamer in one form or another since the late 1980&#x27;s and a game design trend that&#x27;s really been put on steroids in the last 10-20 years is designers getting a lot more sophisticated about creating feedback loops that drive you to put in that one more hour (or ten more dollars) for that incremental hit of dopamine. There is a type of game that is very specifically engineered to get you to play as much as possible for increasingly incremental rewards. World of Warcraft was my own first exposure to this philosophy of game design and they had me hook, line and sinker.On the other hand you have games which are designed almost like an art piece or a one-and-done thing where you experience what the designer intended and then you&#x27;re done. For instance it&#x27;s an old game but take Battle Chess for instance, you buy it, you play it for like an hour and it&#x27;s chess with extra cool animation and art. Great, now when you want to play chess, you crack open Battle Chess, and when you don&#x27;t want to play chess anymore you close it. A lot of indie games and adventure games still have this philosophy where it&#x27;s more about delivering a high quality good experience that is finite, not stretching everything out to infinity. reply akoboldfrying 4 hours agorootparentprev>I had an epiphany and realized that it was more like working an unpaid part-time jobI&#x27;ve had the reverse epiphany: That if I view aspects of my real life that seem difficult to make progress on as being more like a computer game, I can increase my motivation to tackle them. reply dehrmann 4 hours agorootparentprevI also had this realization.

Something offended some sensitivities, though it was a benign as an unexpected break up. My previous friend made a great effort to convince others of how immoral and cruel our other friend was, and some people kind of bought into the drama I guess.It was a matter of reputation assassination based around some collective sense of what’s proper and what’s not. The path from reality to the conceived reasons for the cancellation was long, grey, and blurry, but they pushed hard on it.One very common thread was how often I would think “wow, I could so easily get put in the same bucket. We all could. None of us are much better, we all make mistakes like this”. It seems true then and it’s true now. I say the wrong things sometimes. I’m accidentally insensitive. I don’t know as much as I could in order to navigate some social situations better.What caused the dissolving of the friendship eventually was when I asked my friend why I’m any different from the person he was targeting. His response was totally irrational, unkind, and seemed almost pathological. I realized I had a very unhealthy friend who was harming my other friends and social circle. And that eventually I could be his target, too. I just had to upset him in such a way that I would be dead to him. What a precarious and unsettling way to be friends.Anyway, all that is to say it seems familiar going back most of my life now.

I once complimented a long-time, left-leaning Opinion writer over a column criticising Democrats in Congress for doing something stupid.

It had not occurred to him how this would stigmatise certain colleagues, or what it would say to the world about the Times’s own bias.

Not perfect, but they are up against Cable news & some of the corporate sponsored YouTube channels...which seem so...fake. reply listenallyall 11 hours agorootparentprevHow is throttling the New York Times on X anti-free speech? NYT is its own media platform, among the most powerful in the world, why should it expect a separate outlet to promote it? Further, as a powerful media outlet, the Times itself \"throttles\" all kinds of voices and opinions with which its editorial board and majority of its employees and readers don&#x27;t agree. reply jkubicek 10 hours agorootparentTwitter can ban and throttle whoever it wants, they own the platform.What&#x27;s __silly__ about the NYTimes being throttled on Twitter is how Musk champions his platform as a bastion of \"free speech\", while silencing those he disagrees with (NYTimes) or can&#x27;t be bothered to defend (enemies of authoritarian governments).What __concerning__ is how many people claim to believe that Musk is actually a free-speech champion. Are they just trolling the rest of us, or do they actually believe it? Either one is worrisome. reply listenallyall 1 hour agorootparentBut every NYTimes tweet is, essentially, a free advertisement. It doesn&#x27;t post a simple comment or opinion (their writers do, sometimes), but every post from the official New York Times account is a brief summary of, and link to, a story on its own platform (most of which are inaccessible to non-paying subscribers). Yes - this is also true of almost every other media platform that tweets - but that makes this an argument about advertising content, not \"speech.\" reply svachalek 9 hours agorootparentprevMost people define \"free\" speech as speech they agree with. Simple as that. reply senderista 8 hours agorootparentJust like they \"tolerate\" only opinions they agree with. (Which makes no sense: tolerance implies disagreement.) reply digging 11 hours agorootparentprevThe narrative that Musk is \"opening\" Twitter is false. The game has not changed, he just swapped out some of the rules for ones he personally likes better. For example, deadnaming trans people is now protected speech, but calling a cis person \"cis\" is punishable. I do not care what your opinion on trans people is - this is a double standard and is not \"free speech absolutism\". He also banned an account that was posting public data about his personal jets. He is afraid of absolute free speech (which is reasonable - most people are). reply listenallyall 58 minutes agorootparentThat&#x27;s an entirely different, unrelated argument. I asked about the New York Times, which is just as powerful and influential (probably moreso) as Twitter. NYT content is not free for Twitter users to read -- why should it be able to use Twitter for free to essentially mine for subscribers? reply ClumsyPilot 6 hours agorootparentprevNYT does not claim to be a platform for everyone&#x27;s free speech, and their editorial board is held to account for the shit they publish.

That election was about the common people finally getting one over on the elites, and the elites freaked the fuck out about it.Some people get it. From before the 2016 election: (so, so prophetic in why the Rust Belt broke for Trump)and after:The New York Times pointed out after Trump&#x27;s election stunned the press that >Whatever the election result, you’re going to hear a lot from news executives about how they need to send their reporters out into the heart of the country, to better understand its citizenry.>But that will miss something fundamental. Flyover country isn’t a place, it’s a state of mind — it’s in parts of Long Island and Queens, much of Staten Island, certain neighborhoods of Miami or even Chicago. And, yes, it largely — but hardly exclusively — pertains to working-class white people.In other words, it isn&#x27;t just a question of The New York Times (and the TV networks, and pretty much all of the rest of mass media) completely ignoring the rubes out in rural Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin (which all, strangely enough, unexpectedly voted for Trump), but their ignoring the residents of their own city, just across one bridge. reply smeagull 9 hours agorootparentprevOkay, let&#x27;s go visit X to see how alive it is.Oh, a login screen.Yeah they&#x27;re dead. reply the_doctah 16 hours agoparentprev\"Death of Twitter\" why are people so deluded and so eager for Twitter to fail?

It&#x27;s only \"censorship\" when the government demands it. Engaging in voluntary moderation is not censorship in a meaningful sense. It is, in fact, an aspect of freedom of speech that people should not be compelled to engage in speech that they don&#x27;t want to engage in. reply the_doctah 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t agree with your definition of censorship. A government doesn&#x27;t have to be involved to qualify. Moderation is a subset of censorship. reply JohnFen 12 hours agorootparentStrictly speaking, you&#x27;re correct -- but it also highlights that not all censorship is wrong or bad. It can very easily be a valid exercise of free speech rights.Twitter (or any social media) moderating people&#x27;s posts isn&#x27;t wrong, for instance. Nobody&#x27;s rights are being infringed when they do this. You might disagree with their moderation policies, but that&#x27;s a different thing altogether.Legally speaking in the US, it&#x27;s only censorship when the government is doing it. reply briantakita 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s government censorship when the government is involved with funding the companies doing the censoring or when the FBI \"nudges\" companies to suppress stories. Having spooks in executive positions doesn&#x27;t help the optics either.

Say a site people still use to talk to&#x2F;keep in touch with friends sometimes like IG&#x2F;FB decides a user is \"toxic\" and either shadowbans them, or starts hiding their posts from friends.

Pre-social media&#x2F;pre-Internet I was not clueless about whether my communications with my \"friends\" were being received because almost every channel I had available to me was synchronous and there was much less noise.Now, social media presents a broadcast interface and many people assume that their posts are being displayed to their friends. This is not actually the case. When your friends don&#x27;t respond, you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because your friends have stopped caring about you, they&#x27;re just not interested in what you said, or some algorithm decided to hide you from them---and most people probably do not seriously consider the latter most of the time.Whether we need intermediaries or not is one question, but whether we need feedback in our communication is settled: we do, and we leave it to the whims of algorithms optimized for engagement to our peril. reply JakeAl 16 hours agorootparentprevOn this note, the invention of the printing press led to The Reformation with the first printing of the Bible, which up until that point had been duplicated by monks by hand, and The Word controlled and interpreted by the Church, who wielded their power like modern governments and institutions deciding what is or is not mis- or disinformation. reply specialist 8 hours agorootparentprevAkhenaten was 99.9% memory holed.Socrates was canceled for wrongthink.Even today, books teaching witchcraft and other pagan lore are banned from children&#x27;s libraries. reply dogcomplex 11 hours agorootparentprevYep and the solution then is the same as it is now - democratizing the means of production and communication, insulating it from the influences of capital and profit.

Bottom line Lufthansa pilots can’t do visual approaches at night This incident happened on Monday, October 16, 2023, and involves Lufthansa flight LH458 from Munich (MUC) to San Francisco (SFO). The flight was operated by a six-year-old Airbus A350-900 with the registration code D-AIXC. VASAviation did a great job creating a video that has both a visualization of the flight path, plus the audio between the Lufthansa pilots and the air traffic controller. This incident revolves around how Lufthansa reportedly has a company policy whereby pilots can’t do visual approaches at night, but rather require instrument landing system (ILS) approaches. I wasn’t aware of this restriction, and I’m not sure if it only applies on certain flights (like long hauls), or what. I assume the intent is that this is an extra operational safety layer. Why does it matter that Lufthansa doesn’t allow visual approaches? Well, air traffic controllers have to space planes out a bit more for instrument approaches rather than visual approaches, especially at airports like SFO, where parallel landings are performed. When visual approaches are allowed, controllers can tell pilots to maintain visual separation from other aircraft, so they don’t have to leave as much of a buffer as with an instrument landing (where it’s entirely on the controllers to provide proper spacing). And that brings us to the issue here… Here’s what happens between the Lufthansa pilots and the approach controllers: The controller clears the Lufthansa jet to make a visual approach, and the Lufthansa pilot advises “due to company procedures, we are unable visual approach at nighttime” The controller then advises that “if that’s the case, then it will be extended delays” The Lufthansa pilot responds “if that’s the case, that’s the case,” at which point the controller puts the Lufthansa jet into an extended holding pattern After some time, the Lufthansa pilot advises “if we are not set up for base soon, we will have to declare fuel emergency and that would really **** up your sequence” (I can’t tell if he says s*ck or f*ck) At this point the controller asks “what is your divert field?” suggesting that rather than letting the Lufthansa jet declare a fuel emergency at SFO, the plane will just have to fly to its diversion point The Lufthansa pilot says “it would be Oakland,” to which the controller responds “you need vectors to Oakland?” The Lufthansa pilot responds “no, but I just don’t understand why everybody is taking… my company forbids visual separation at night, so what is the problem here?” The controller responds “I can’t have this conversation with you, you either divert to Oakland or you can continue to hold, it’s up to you” The Lufthansa pilot responds “okay, you promised me 10 minutes, that ran out four minutes ago, so how many more minutes?” The controller responds “conversation is over,” and then says “what are your intentions, you want to divert or you want to continue with the delay?” When the controller advises that it will be an additional 10-15 minute delay, the Lufthansa pilot requests to divert to Oakland Play Unfortunately this turned into quite the messy delay for Lufthansa: The flight was initially supposed to leave Munich at 4:20PM, but only departed at 6:30PM The flight was supposed to arrive in San Francisco at 7PM, but ended up landing in Oakland at 9:43PM, after a 12hr13min flight Then at 11:30PM the plane departed Oakland for San Francisco, where it landed at 11:55PM Who was in the wrong here? Usually in these interactions between pilots and air traffic controllers, there’s one party that’s clearly acting out of line. In this case, the Lufthansa pilots are doing nothing wrong. They’re following company procedures, and there’s no flexibility when it comes to that. It’s a pretty black and white matter. I am curious how the pilots announced this diversion to passengers. “Ja, so unfortunately even though the weather is nice in San Francisco, we will be diverting to Oakland because of a specific company procedure that only we follow, when all other planes are landing just fine?” The rest of this is totally beyond my area of expertise, but I’d be curious to know what any OMAAT readers who are pilots or air traffic controllers think. A few thoughts and questions: Are there any other airlines that require instrument landings at night? And is this Lufthansa policy specific to long haul flights where fatigue could be more of an issue, or all flights? If this is Lufthansa’s company policy, you’d think that this wouldn’t be the first time that this has come up at SFO, and that this is something that air traffic controllers would have dealt with before To the credit of air traffic controllers, they may have very well had a consistent traffic flow, and allowing in an instrument approach could have messed up the spacing a bit, and could have caused problems for other planes At the same time, it seems like the air traffic controllers aren’t exactly trying to go above and beyond to accommodate the Lufthansa jet, and even seem to have quite an attitude with the Lufthansa pilots, and almost get joy out of their diversion; at least that’s the tone that I sense A Lufthansa Airbus A350 had to divert to Oakland Bottom line A San Francisco-bound Lufthansa Airbus A350 had to divert to Oakland, due to a company policy whereby Lufthansa pilots apparently can’t make visual approaches at night. Air traffic controllers were unwilling or unable to help the Lufthansa pilots, and that caused a bit of a spat between the two parties. This is an interesting situation, and it seemed like the circumstances were the perfect storm for this to happen, given that SFO often has parallel approaches and is consistently busy, so there’s not much room for extra spacing. What do you make of this Lufthansa situation?

Normally during side by operations in visual conditions both aircraft that will be landing 750ft apart must see each other and maintain visual separation. They’ve done this for years on the finals without many issues. Interpretation came down from the FAA that they couldn’t clear an aircraft for an ILS approach and require them to maintain visual separation with the aircraft next to or in front of them. Standard sep is required. long story short this means that the controllers need to build a standard separation hole on final and can’t pair them up on final. When their being fed a 56 rate from Oakland center with the assumption that everyone withh be paired up, making a hole once final can take a bit of time. In this case is was during a relatively busy inbound push during VMC conditions. The atis is advertising charted visual flight procedure. There are only a few (If any now) carriers that are required to shoot an ILS at night regardless of the advertised approaches and flight conditions. The controllers were issued guidelines that if it’s busy and an aircraft is unable to comply with the approaches advertised on the atis or maintain visual separation that its better to hold them until there is adequate space on final as it’s more unsafe to start vectoring 30/40 different aircraft to build the required hole for the 1 aircraft who’s company has a lame rule. Several companies have updated their policies to either allows visual approaches at night and or fly the ILS but accept a visual approach and visual separation. ATC would do this same thing to any aircraft that couldn’t comply with a visual approach during the inbound rush, it has nothing to do with Lufthansa being foreign. Although the foreign carriers were majority of crews that were unable visual approaches. During IMC conditions ATC is utilizing 7110.308 procedures to stagger aircraft on the ILS 1 mile apart without having to get and maintain visual separation. This has nothing to do with SOIA as they don’t use that anymore. 8 RetiredATLATC Diamond November 11, 2023, 8:29 am Controller needs a few days on the beach to contemplate his life choices.

Not a small deal, airport would be closed for a while, possibly other diversions. 2. Accept the delay till min fuel, and then divert as happened. And seeing as they were able to get into SFO from OAK shortly thereafter, obviously it would have been possible for ATC to accommodate them. ATC had 3 options: 1 Create an opening in the sequence for an ILS approach for Lufthansa. Would require an empty spot or 2 on the parallel runway, and an extra mile or 2 in front of Lufthansa on the ILS. Maybe 5 minutes delay for the aircraft behind Lufthansa? 2 Tell Lufthansa unable to comply with ILS request and clear them to Oakland immediately. 3 Jerk Lufthansa around for half an hour before they had to divert, and then let them in later anyway. It's always possible I'm reading this wrong. But IMO ATC was absolutely not doing what they are supposed to do.

Approach sequences these approaches miles beforehand, so there can be a chain of 10-20 aircraft all sequenced to land before responsibility is even transferred to SFO&#x27;s tower. The incident happened during a particularly busy landing time at SFO, so there was indeed a massive chain of aircraft coming in to land.Lufthansa was the only aircraft asking for ILS. Because ILS needs greater separation, that would require breaking the chain of approaches, sequencing a single ILS approach, then resuming. The chain of landings already sequenced takes priority, so Lufthansa would have to wait 30+ minutes for a gap to appear. By the time that gap appeared, Lufthansa had just decided to divert to Oakland. If Lufthansa had arrived a bit earlier or a bit later, they would have been sequenced just fine.ATC could have been a bit more accommodating in rerouting their divert to SFO as soon as the a gap appeared, but Lufthansa was also the only airline requesting ILS, and they&#x27;re already dealing with sequencing 20+ aircraft during a busy time. It&#x27;s not clear who&#x27;s in the wrong here; just an unintended consequence from many well-intentioned decisions. reply ak217 11 hours agoparentI think the FAA leadership is ultimately in the wrong for allowing their area of responsibility to deteriorate to the point where a controller and a pilot were put in this situation.They have a controller shortage that they are not doing enough to fix, and they have a troublesome airport with limited capacity to accommodate traffic, that they are being too bureaucratic about fixing. The controllers at SFO have used a number of tools to address the handicap, but the FAA recently put a lid on that by forbidding side-by-side IFR&#x2F;VFR approaches while also failing to authorize custom precision landing procedures like SOIA.The request for ILS is entirely reasonable in this context, and the decision to hold the flight out of the sequence is also reasonable in the context, but to hold the flight with no updates for half an hour is not reasonable and to require it to divert is not reasonable either. The FAA should be held responsible for planning things better than this. reply ralph84 10 hours agorootparentNo, Lufthansa should not be dispatching flights to arrive at SFO at the busiest time of night if their pilots aren’t prepared to do the approaches everyone else is doing.

My read of it is that Lufthansa&#x27;s enforcing a minimal standard of safety—one that&#x27;s higher than both other airliners&#x27; and the ATC&#x27;s. They&#x27;re not incapable of doing visual landings at night; rather, they have a policy banning it in non-emergency situations. It (naively) seems reasonable to me not to budge on this kind of thing. (Unless the inflexibility creates new forms of safety issues, in which case I have no idea).Also, I&#x27;m mindful there was a recent near-disaster at SFO with exactly the issue this Lufthansa policy mitigates: a non-ILS landing attempt at night, which attempted the wrong runway due to confusion over visual markers,https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_Canada_Flight_759https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14741605 (\"SFO near miss might have triggered ‘greatest aviation disaster in history’\", 414 comments)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18071966 (\"Abstract of the NTSB Report on Air Canada flight 759&#x27;s taxiway overflight at SFO\", 127 comments) reply addicted 30 minutes agorootparentThe person you’re commenting to is missing the context you’ve provided, which is the U.S. has seen an incredible number of near misses this past year.The ATC situation in the U.S. is dire.

I find the article a little unclear if that&#x27;s a general recommendation even if all the aids are functional for a visual approach. reply CaliforniaKarl 13 hours agoparentprevOne useful part of that video is how they play clips of ATC telling flights to “join the localizer”.SFO has two published visual approaches (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airnav.com&#x2F;airport&#x2F;KSFO, scroll to the bottom): Both visual approaches have pilots fly to intercept their runway’s localizer, the part of the ILS equipment that provides lateral positioning, relative to the localizer’s centerline (which is generally coincident to the corresponding runway’s centerline).So, by flying the published visual approach and remaining “on the localizer”, you have separation from the planes on the parallel runway. What’s missing is careful monitoring and separation, and that’s what Lufthansa wanted.It’s worth noting that SFO does have a Simultaneous Offser Instrument Approach procedure: See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tc.faa.gov&#x2F;its&#x2F;worldpac&#x2F;techrpt&#x2F;afs420-84-1.pdf (detail) or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flysfo.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;PRM_SOIA_version_...

That is completely unacceptable. reply CaliforniaKarl 13 hours agorootparentIf you mean “traffic pattern” (from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faa.gov&#x2F;air_traffic&#x2F;publications&#x2F;media&#x2F;pcg_10-12...), that is also something you would do visually, which I don’t think Lufthansa would accept.As for not being able to give an accurate estimate, that is not for the on-the-radio approach controller to calculate, given their view of the airspace. The video posted by parent shows how long the inbound flows were (at least on the east side); approach wouldn’t have seen that.The coordination necessary to get an accurate estimate should’ve involved managers, which might be affected by the current shortage (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;1211838624&#x2F;air-traffic-contro...). reply michael_j_x 13 hours agorootparentI meant for the ATC to provide a descent estimate of when Lufthansa should be expected to enter the AERODROME TRAFFIC CIRCUIT (since you want tolink the FAA glossary) in order to land (they had them on a hold pattern for 35+ minutes). This is independent of whether the approach is IFR or VFR. A TOWER controller has all the information necessary to calculate that estimate, and should be expected to do so, the same way a stock trader is expected to calculate PnL of their positions on the fly given the current stock price. reply jcrawfordor 12 hours agorootparentMost of the queue would have been with approach, not tower. The aircraft sequenced to land were split across at least two controllers, tower and approach, and possibly more than one approach controller depending on how SFO splits them up. I would expect approach to be able to provide a reasonable estimate but it seems like in this case the estimate was found to be four minutes off, which seems totally within the bounds of a reasonable estimate from an approach controller.The traffic pattern (US term) isn&#x27;t really a factor here either way, airliners flying visual still usually use charted routes (like the instrument procedures) or radar vectors rather than the pattern. Remember that the pattern is only about one mile out from the field.

What if an aircraft needs to do a go-around, do they suddenly face 45m of delay or immediately need to divert, because The Sequence is immutable?No, they’d move things around a bit. SFO decided that this plane wasn’t going to land there as soon as they asked for ILS, instead of doing their job and making a gap. reply KennyBlanken 12 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;re leaving out that they had a filed flight plan which for an international flight means controllers had many hours of notice as to when the flight was scheduled to arrive and that they would be looking for an ILS approach and it was the responsibility of approach controllers to have a spot in the pattern for them.They arrived in the area on time, and controllers had not allocated it a spot, which is why the pilot sounds a bit peeved when told there isn&#x27;t a spot. When he asks for one and they tell him that they can&#x27;t give an estimate, that&#x27;s the second strike.Strike three was telling him to fuck off (\"what&#x27;s your alternate, sir?\")Controllers pulled a power play to bully him for wanting an ILS approach that reduces airport traffic capacity (larger separation distances) and in the process created a risk compounding another risk (a fatigued long-distance flight crew.) This is how crashes happen. All because the airport and airlines want to shove more flights through the airport to make more money.The sad thing is that they&#x27;ll get away with it because we have a massive shortage of controllers right now (because they&#x27;re underpaid and overworked. Thanks, Reagan.) reply jcrawfordor 11 hours agorootparentThe flight plan factors into flow timing, which is used to manage capacity, but there&#x27;s no reservation of a landing time. Flight plan timings aren&#x27;t accurate enough for that to be feasible when you have landings at close to one a minute.The flow timing rate used for approaches to SFO during visual conditions is based on visual approaches, so this particular aircraft didn&#x27;t fall into the expectations used for that planning mechanism. Even then it&#x27;s not a forward looking plan, just a rate limit on arrivals that causes departure clearances to be delayed. I&#x27;m not even sure if it works for international flights. reply toast0 10 hours agorootparentprevAre controllers expected to manage the details of the take off and landing queues and also expected to be be looking quite a bit upstream to see what&#x27;s coming up and check the details of the flight and company policies?I suspect the controller assumed this flight would use visual separation, like everyone else, when it entered the landing queue; and the pilot expected to use ILS, like everywhere else given the conditions, when it entered the landing queue. The difference in expectations became apparent only when clearance was given, at which point there&#x27;s not enough flexibility to accommodate an ILS landing, and it&#x27;s hard to guess when there will be a place to slot it in. Diverting to Oakland and repositioning later is a reasonable, if not optimal outcome.My guess is, if either side had mentioned their expectations when the flight entered approach control, and it had been cleared up then, it would have been quite possible to get an ILS landing on the first go round.

Perhaps they intended to squeeze Lufthansa in when they told them to wait, and maybe they forgot and didn&#x27;t, and then when pressed they got irritated, that&#x27;s how overworked people typically would react; but still it was their call.Perhaps this flight is never late so they never encountered this situation before. We can&#x27;t expect everything to go smoothly all the time, so we don&#x27;t necessarily need policy changes because of what happened, simply adjust what expectations we should have.

The main difference in this case is separation requirements that ATC must provide. Specifically, under IFR rules ATC mus provide 3 miles &#x2F; 500 feet altitude separation minimum. For visual approaches, the separation is responsibility of the pilots and this enables parallel runway landings at SFO with much shorter intervals (there is a version of parallel landings with instrument approaches at SFO but it discontinued during Covid and not resumed since AFAIK).2&#x2F; The approach sequence is established long long long before arrival to the airport. The ATC controllers (approach and center) coordinate arrivals and create sequencing hundreds of miles from a large airport like SFO. The last minute Lufthansa request for an instrument approach would have forced dozens of planes to go into hold or fly vectors which creates a lot of work for everyone.3&#x2F; SFO tower is NOT responsible for approaches and was not dealing with holding Lufthansa. This is responsibility of NorCal approach4&#x2F; My personal take is that Lufthansa should have advised ATC that they need instrument approach much earlier (as soon as they got ATIS which would be 50-100 miles from airport). That would have enabled ATC to create a gap for them. Last minute request is a surprise nobody needs. The Lufthansa attitude afterwards is unacceptable. They were asking for preferential treatment (get us in and screw a couple dozen of other airplanes). They also should have communicated to ATC that they have 30 mins of fuel for hold and that would informed NorCal about time limits they are working with. Lastly, threatening ATC with a fuel emergency.... not nice, not nice at all. From my personal experience with ATC is that they are very accommodating but they don&#x27;t like surprises. Tell them what you want early and controllers usually find ways to make it work by the time you get there. Have a last minute request? If ATC is not busy they will help you. If ATC is busy -- go to the back of the line. Which is exactly what happened here. reply ww520 9 hours agoparentYes. I got the feeling that the pilot was playing the cry-wolf game with the threat of declaring fuel emergency. ATC then responded with, ok, divert. It’s a case of FAFO. reply kqr 48 minutes agorootparentI can definitely see it both ways. When I imagine myself as a pilot who has been on spacing&#x2F;holding vectors for 30+ minutes with repeated delays and no sign of even trying to slot me in, I may very well also have fallen for the temptation of informing ATC of the upcoming fuel issue in a sarcastic way. Still unprofessional, of course, but in a different context the exact same words could be taken as a lighthearted reminder rather than a threat. (And for all my stereotypes about Germans, it may very well have been a failed attempt at humour in a strained situation.)But yeah, from that point on ATC did seem very professional to me. reply binary132 8 hours agorootparentprev100% reply turquoisevar 3 hours agoparentprevThe article and the video embedded within leave out a lot of context.The Norcal controller was extremely unprofessional. Their behavior is a great example of the US controller attitude™ US ATC is so infamous for. No idea why this unprofessionalism is so prevalent in the US; I can only presume it has to do with being overworked and understaffed, with perhaps a pinch of god complex.This was handled by Norcal, but SFO has an infamous controller whose poor behavior can be found all over the internet and the nearby smaller SQL controller who thought he was enough of a hot shit that he could lecture a designated examiner after the latter stepped in when the controller was acting like an unprofessional asshole on the radio.A lot of this asshole behavior is targeted at international pilots, but enough of it is targeted at US pilots that I know of pilots who throw retirement parties for certain asshole controllers without inviting the retiree.Anyways, let&#x27;s focus on this particular incident.For starters, SFO is a huge mess in every sense of the word. The design of the airport is just plain stupid, primarily the distance between the parallel runways that cause severe limitations when the weather isn&#x27;t perfect.Then there&#x27;s the matter that SFO is just not suitable for the amount of traffic it gets, coupled with overworked controllers who rather kick the responsibility over to the pilots, leading to the visual approach and visual seperation preference by SFO.Secondly, the notion that this is something new and novel that SFO has never heard of and can&#x27;t do, or as the article puts it: \"when all other planes are landing just fine\", is just BS.This flight from Munich comes in every night at SFO with the same IMC flight plan and the same path, so SFO&#x2F;Norcal should be familiar with this, especially since it&#x27;s their home base and Lufthansa is a regular customer.Not only that, but many European airlines have the same regulations on visual separation at night as do other international airlines. The reason this is SOP with so many airlines is for a couple of reasons.1) You cannot maintain visual separation at night based on lights only, there is no depth perception, and by the time you realize something&#x27;s fucked, you&#x27;re too late. TCAS isn&#x27;t accurate enough for aircraft separation and explicitly states this in the manual.2) The incident history in the US related to taking visuals at night supports the idea that this should not be allowed. The FDX170 incident in Tulsa comes to mind, or the ACA759 incident that nearly clipped a tail at SFO, no less.3) The FAA advised against letting international airlines take visuals at night.4) METAR had SCT and BKN cloud below 1500ftOn top of all that, PAL104 had received ILS just moments before without even asking for it (because it was in their flight plan).So there&#x27;s no need to act like this is some kind of extremely weird thing that blindsighted Norcal&#x2F;SFO.Thirdly, ultimately, the captain makes the determination of what they need, and the controller is supposed to provide that to the best of their ability. Had the controller taken the flight plan into account and had their experience with Lufthansa&#x27;s daily flights, then none of this would&#x27;ve happened, and nobody would&#x27;ve had to be delayed. Nevertheless, the controller could&#x27;ve still granted ILS without much issue, it would&#x27;ve caused about 5 minutes of delay for the next flight.That said, it&#x27;s also not unreasonable to delay Lufthansa if the controller doesn&#x27;t want to go through that effort. That&#x27;s the only reasonable thing the controller did.What isn&#x27;t reasonable is to hold Lufthansa for 30 minutes without any information or contact, then tack on another 10 minutes two more times.And what especially isn&#x27;t reasonable is to force them to divert to Oakland and say things like \"this conversation is over\" because your ego is bruised.The Norcal controller was way out of line and with what passes for SOP in the US we&#x27;re gonna have our own Tenerife disaster soon enough. reply InCityDreams 9 hours agoparentprev>Last minute request is a surprise nobody needs.Can&#x2F; should be applied to so many on-the-ground situations, too. reply YeBanKo 14 hours agoprevMaybe the reason why Lufthansa does not allow visual approach at SFO at night, could be after the Air Canada near miss.> The NTSB determined the probable cause was the Air Canada flight crew&#x27;s confusion of the runway with the parallel taxiway, with contributing causes including the crew&#x27;s failure to use the instrument landing system (ILS), as well as pilot fatigue.FAA changed the rules for SFO and made visual approaches forbidden at night \"when an adjacent parallel runway is closed\" [2].

In the AA case you refer to, the pilot was concerned about the high crosswind on the runway ATC wanted him to land on, so he declared an emergency so he could land on a safer runway. Crosswind landings are dicey at the best of times, and I suspect that if the AA pilot didn&#x27;t get any repercussions it was because in that situation his action was considered a reasonable judgment call.

That amount of fuel is called the “minimum fuel”. If you get down to your minimum fuel and you aren’t actually landing at your destination yet, then you radio the controllers and tell them that you’re at minimum fuel and are diverting to your alternate. It is only time to declare an emergency if you get down to your final reserve, by which time you should already be at your alternate airport.Also, you can’t really use the straight–line distance between airports to figure out how much extra fuel to bring, because you never end up flying that line. For one thing, you have to approach the airport from the correct direction so that you line up with a runway and so that you’re headed into the wind. For another, you have to get down from the altitude you were holding at to ground level. Between the two you need to go not towards the airport, but towards a spot far enough away from the airport that you can fly a gentle slope down towards the runway. You might even end up flying completely around the airport while descending before actually turning in and lining up with the approach runway. reply diebeforei485 7 hours agorootparentprevYou can&#x27;t do it that quickly.

Absent some mechanical problem with the engines, or a fuel leak, declaring a fuel emergency would mean that the pilots waited too long at their destination airport before thinking about diverting. You’re supposed to simply divert _before_ you would need to declare an emergency, rather than declare an emergency simply in order to skip ahead in line.There was no risk of a crash in this circumstance, because the plane still had plenty of fuel to divert to their alternate and land before going into their final reserve. reply jcalvinowens 8 hours agoparentprev> This is tough for me to wrap my head around.It&#x27;s pretty easy to explain: the controller took the pilot at his word, and immediately offered the fastest and safest option to get them on the ground, which was to land at Oakland.

Any two would be a satisfactory outcome, and it sounds like the pilot could in fact have picked any two (well, it sounds like Lufthansa policy prohibited just getting in the VFR queue). Nobody was ever in danger and the worst case scenario was that the plane lands at Oakland, which was always a possibility from the moment they took off. If landing at Oakland is such a disaster Lufthansa could have canceled the flight once it became clear that they were running 3 hours late, had missed their originally planned slot, and would be landing at night. reply vkou 11 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s like calling a year in advance for a dinner reservation and showing up and having to wait 45 minutes for your table \"because it&#x27;s a really busy night.\"It&#x27;s more like showing up two weeks late to your dinner reservation, on a Valentine&#x27;s Day Friday night rush, and being upset that you don&#x27;t have an accurate ETA to get seated. reply alistairSH 10 hours agoparentprevI think that Lufthansa asking for special treatment is the asshole moveLufthansa’s rules shouldn’t have been a surprise to anybody here.

But...We don&#x27;t know what the approach into SFO looked like that night, but you can bet it was busy. VASAviation videos are often highly misleading in this regard. Most of the talk on the ATC frequency is cut (sometimes explicitly, sometimes not) leaving just that relevant to the videos content, the time is compressed and they only plot a few of the planes involved, making the airspace look clear.My understanding is that SFO often has two closely spaced parallel runways taking arrivals. The visual approach is preferred because then the pilots on parallel approaches keep visual separation from each other, allowing more frequent landings. An ILS approach requires more space between planes (because ATC remains responsible for separation). Hence, the Lufthansa had to wait for a gap big enough to fit that ILS approach in, or the whole stack of planes lined up for the approach would have to be juggled - how feasible that would be I don&#x27;t know. reply antonjs 11 hours agoparentVASAviation has a video on this incident with commentary from a NorCal controller, showing the (large amount of) inbound traffic.

Declaring ILS in some generic sense is \"safer\", but specifically it means that the controllers cannot clear them to land in a degraded ILS environment, where perhaps some beacons are offline.The SFO preference is not just something that the airport or the controller decided - it&#x27;s also good for the airlines and the flying public. More planes land faster. The planes took off with the expectation that they would be able to land at a certain rate; otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t schedule them to arrive so frequently.The problem with \"Everybody Knows\" is that you really don&#x27;t. The controller may assume that Lufthansa means \"hey are all the beacons on?\" when they say \"IFR landing\". Lufthansa may assume that IFR clearance means that the ILS equipment is operational, but that they can still fit into the VFR sequence.In this case, those assumptions probably would have worked out Ok. But if \"Everybody Knows\" is part of your work culture and you work on life critical systems, than someone will eventually die, as you can see from the history of investigations into air transport incidents.If you feel like someone is saying or implying \"Everybody Knows\" in a safety critical or life critical system, that is bad culture.

While it indicates the aircraft should be handled without delay, it’s also not going to fall out of the sky immediately either.A fuel emergency would never be severe enough that they would be forced to land at SFO in this situation. In fact, if they were truly forced to land the pilots would lose their jobs because they left it way too late. Oakland was always a reasonable option.Finally, fuel emergencies are not actually a standard call. It is a thing that is adhered to in the industry as courtesy.

    "title": "DIY Bed Sensors: Enhancing Smart Home Automations with Pressure Mats",
    "originLink": "https://www.homeautomationguy.io/blog/making-my-own-bed-sensor",
    "originBody": "Making my own Bed Sensor 1 Sep Written By Alan Byrne I recently created some “bed sensors” for my smart home that detect if one of us, or both of us, is in bed. I use a couple of pressure mats that detect when weight is applied to them, and stuck then under our mattress at around hip level and these tell my Home Assistant home automation platform if someone is lying on top of that part of the bed. I originally thought that these would be more of a gimmick, than actually useful, but this turned out to be totally wrong! These now form an integral part of my smart home and I use them to not only trigger certain automations, but also prevent other automations from running if someone is in bed. For example, I don’t want the ceiling lights coming on in the bedroom if someone is in bed having a sleep! This article shows you two ways I went about making one of these bed sensors. If you want to see the full end to end build process, check out my video about it! Equipment Needed The first thing you’ll need is a pressure mat, or pressure sensor. I used one I sourced from Amazon, and it costs less than $25. You can also buy them from here, and they're much cheaper. These are pretty basic things, and are essentially just pressure switches - if weight is applied to the mat, it completes the circuit. Make sure you get one with these exposed wires, so you can wire it up to the rest of the sensor. You will need to identify which of the wires you need use in your sensor. Two of these wires loop together to make contact when you press down on the pad, and the other two… well I have NFI what they do. Using a multimeter on continuity mode you can hold the wires to the two probes and press down on the mat. If you’ve got the right wires the meter should beep indicating that contact has been made when you press down. These are the wires you need to use, so make a note of them with some tape or something. BEEEEEP! As I mentioned, there are two ways you can make these sensors. Using an Aqara Leak Sensor The first way is the easiest and uses a Zigbee Aqara Leak Sensor. You can buy these in a lot of places, and they conveniently have two removable terminals on the back that you can attach the wires from the pressure mat to. Using ESPHome You can also create a bed sensor using an ESP Device, and ESPHome. ESP Devices are small Bluetooth and WiFi enabled microcomputers, and when you combine them with the ESPHome software platform you can create almost any type of smart home sensor you want. I figured that this project was the perfect way for me to get started with, and learn more about, ESPHome. If you want to take this route, you’ll need to buy an ESP Device. I recommend these ESP32s, and to make life easier I suggest getting these green companion development boards which let you screw cables into terminals for testing and prototyping - so you don’t need to bother with all that soldering. The Build - Easy Mode All you really need to do is attach the two wires you identified previously to the terminals on the back of the Leak Sensor. You can use a small Allen Key to remove the terminals and then just shove the wires underneath and tighten them up. Now pair the leak sensors with your favourite smart home platform, like the Aqara Hub, HomeKit, or Home Assistant using ZHA or Zigbee2MQTT. When you now press down on the pad, you should see that smart home platform tell you that a leak has been detected! You could use this sensor in your automations right now, triggering any automation when the sensor goes from dry to wet… but do you really want your bed sensor telling you that you’ve leaked into the bed? No, probably not. In Home Assistant you can go to the settings of that entity, and change the Show As part from Moisture to Occupancy. Now, Home Assistant will report Clear or Detected, instead of Dry and Wet when you press down on the pressure mat And you’re done, you now have your very own pressure sensor that you can put under your mattress, under a sofa, wherever you want to know if something, or someone, has been placed on top of it! The Build - ESPHome A bed sensor is a very simple binary sensor, it’s either ON (Someone is in bed) or OFF (No-one is in the bed). For me, this was the perfect project to use to learn more about ESP devices and ESPHome. The concept is pretty much the same: When pressure is applied to the mat, it closes the connection and completes the circuit, so we can use ESPHome to detect that and tell Home Assistant. Wire it up To get started, we screw the same two wires from the pressure mat to the ESP Device. One of the wires needs to connect to the Ground terminal (GND), and the other to one of the GPIO Pins. I’ve chosen GPIO13, because it happens to be the one that’s next to the GND terminal on my device. ESP32 Pin Guide from ElectronicsHub.org Install the ESPHome firmware Once you’ve wired up the device, plug it into a PC using a USB data cable. The key term there is DATA CABLE. So many times I’ve plugged them into my PC using a generic USB charging cable that has no data wires inside it, and then I pull my hair out wondering why it won’t connect. Then open up https://web.esphome.io and click the connect button. Click on the device in the list, and click connect. If you get a message saying that no compatible devices could be found then click Cancel, and follow the troubleshooting steps. Most likely you will need to install the drivers for the ESP devices, and there are links in the pop up message for your operating system. Once you’ve checked the drivers and cable, you can click Connect again and hopefully the devices is found. Connect to it and then you can press Prepare for First Use, which will install the default ESPHome firmware onto it. Once it is installed, connect it to your Wifi network and you’re ready for the next step. Connect ESPHome to Home Assistant Now pop over to Home Assistant and go to the Add Ons section. Here you’ll need to install the ESPHome Add On, which acts as the control center for all your ESPHome devices. If you aren’t using Home Assistant Operating System, you can install the ESPHome control center using Docker. The ESPHome website has all the instructions you need. Once you’ve installed it, go to the ESPHome Add On web interface and hopefully you see the new ESPDevice auto discovered. Click the Adopt button, give the device a name, and click Install. This will make it yours and install the default configuration on it for your Home Assistant. You can now start programming the device by adding some configuration to it! Configuring the ESPHome device as a bed sensor You can now click Edit on that device’s card, which should bring up the default configuration for it. Scroll to the bottom of the configuration, and add the following lines under the captive_portal: area. binary_sensor: - platform: gpio pin: number: 13 inverted: true mode: input: true pullup: true name: Bed Occupancy Sensor device_class: occupancy filters: - delayed_on: 5s - delayed_off: 30s This creates a new binary sensor using the Pin 13 GPIO port. If you used a different pin for yours, then you will need to change this value here. The inverted, input and pullup attributes tell ESPHome that you are using a switch that is ON when closed. I’m not 100% familiar with the specifics of this as I’m still learning, but it is all documented right here on the ESPHome documentation page. The name attribute should be pretty obvious, it’s the name that you have given your sensor and what will be listed in Home Assistant. The device class tells Home Assistant that this is an occupancy sensor. You can make contact sensors, motion sensors, leak sensors, any number of things really. Finally, the filters helped me make these sensors more accurate and useful. The delayed_on attribute means that the sensor won’t trigger as ON until pressure has been applied to the mat for at least 5 seconds. The delayed_off attribute means that the sensor won’t be triggered as OFF until someone has gotten out of bed for at least 30 seconds. Without these values I saw the sensor flip flopping between on and off all night as I rolled around in the bed asleep, and adding the values made it much more consistent and accurate. Now click Save and Install in the top right of that screen to push these new sensor changes to the ESP device over the Wifi. Once it’s done you should see in the logs screen that the sensor is online and ready. If we now push down on the mat for more than 5 seconds, you should see the binary sensor flipping to ON in the logs. When you then lift off the sensor for more than 30 seconds, the logs should reflect this by telling you the sensor is OFF. This sensor should also now have been autodiscovered in your integrations section, and if you add it to Home Assistant you should see these same states update in that entity when you press down and release the pad for the required time. Congratulations! You’ve built an ESPHome Bed Sensor! The best part about using these ESP devices is that you can now connect a second pressure sensor to the same GND port, and the other wire to GPIO port 12, and create a two zone bed sensor - one for each side of the bed. Just go to the ESPHome control panel, edit the config of that device, and copy and paste the configuration from the first sensor and paste it below. You’ll need to give them both unique names, and modify the config to make sure you’re using the correct pins, but everything else should be the same. Save and re-install this configuration and you should see two bed sensors entities inside that ESPDevice in Home Assistant. Combining two bed sensors into one In my house I’m using two pads connected into the same ESP device to create two independent bed sensors in Home Assistant. My partner and I have our own sides of the bed that we sleep on each night, and I combine these two bed sensors into two more sensors for use in my automations. This same theory can be used if you create two independent bed sensors out of two Aqara leak detectors. One sensor is called Main Bed Occupied and the other is Both in Bed. The Main Bed Occupied sensor tells Home Assistant if SOMEONE is in bed. I use this in certain automations, for example as a condition in my Automated Lights automation to make sure that the ceiling lights don’t turn on when someone is having a sleep. This is a Home Assistant binary sensor group helper that has both my bed sensors as group members. I then make sure that the All Entities toggle at the bottom is OFF. This will make the sensor turn ON if any ONE of the bed sensors turns to ON. The Both in Bed sensor is turned on when both bed sensors are triggered. This is usually because we’ve both gone to bed in the evening. I use this sensor to automatically turn on Night Mode for our house, which powers down all my smart plugs, sonos devices, our work desks, the TV cabinet, and it arms our home alarm into Night mode This is also a Home Assistant Group sensor, and is almost identical to the previous one - with one exception - the All Entities Toggle is set to ON. This means that ALL the bed sensors need to be triggered to on before the helper group gets set to ON. Alan Byrne",

A watchdog-like backup system? And another backup for that :) I get that it&#x27;s unlikely to happen, but still.. Like:- some sensor triggers lights on via impuls relay (that&#x27;s what I have to happen in my home), HA stops functioning, lights remain on. How to make sure instead they&#x27;re turned off? I get that not using impuls relays but relays which need to be driven high constantly might be one step in the right direction, but that would still assume whatever line the relay is driven with is pulled low when HA stops functioning. - you setup HA to instruct your home battery to charge during off-peak hours, HA stops functioning during off-peak, battery is left in &#x27;charge as much as you want&#x27; state. Unless battery has functionality to tell it &#x27;charge max x hours&#x27; it will try to keep charging, whereas it would be nicer if it wouldn&#x27;t - same for heating: leave for vacation, tell HA to put heating in low power mode but to start heating the house again in normal mode 3 days before I&#x27;m back (because that&#x27;s roughly the amount of time needed with low temp heating to get everything warm again). HA stops, I come home to a cold house. reply LCoder 14 hours agoprevI spent years in a previous job developing acute care pressure pads like these utilizing pressure-sensitive conductive ink. The simple open&#x2F;closed circuit pads shown here work well above the mattress but (depending on your mattress weight and bed frame structure) can provide false positives when placed below. We had fun stories with our first home testers where many people (me included) planted our elbows and lifted when we turned during the night. This movement was enough of a weight lift over the pad to cause the first iteration of our sensors to trigger. The ability to adjust your bed&#x27;s unoccupied zero point using an analog measurement, deciding how much weight should be added (or removed) to determine a state change, and over how much time the movement occurred makes a big difference in reliability.Near the end of my grandmother&#x27;s life, she was living with my parents and a fall risk. I did this same ESPHome implementation to HomeAssistant to provide us with alerts when she got up on her own in the middle of the night, and it helped my mother sleep much better.Side note: those other two wires the author says they \"have NFI what they do\" are most likely wired into the pad as a permanently connected loop. Most monitoring equipment will look for a closed circuit on those wires to detect that a sensor pad is connected correctly and the sensor wire hasn&#x27;t been broken (ripped, torn, cut, etc). reply mattmaroon 14 hours agoprevDamn, why did I never think to use a leak sensor? I’ve been goofing around with building some unusual devices and messing with relays and io pins and arduino and completely missed this obvious solution.It’s literally a device designed to do exactly what I sometimes need (start an action if a circuit closes) and I just never thought about it even though I know how leak sensors work and that there are ones available.

Or I guess maybe they do both.I am curious why the leak detector is bigger if it’s a simpler device. Basically the same thing but without the reed switch right? Maybe just to make room for more battery since you actually care how big the door sensor is. reply shellfishgene 42 minutes agorootparentDoor&#x2F;window sensors usually send a signal on state change from closed to open or the other way around.I think a leak sensor is more complicated because it needs to detect a somewhat lowered resistance between the contacts, as opposed to the door sensors that will get a fully closed&#x2F;opened reed switch on activation. Detecting lower resistance with some threshold in a battery powered device that needs to sleep most of the time is probably more complicated. I would guess waking up on a pin state change is built into most microcontrollers, while measuring resistance to make it wake up requires additional components? reply minimalist 14 hours agoprevAndreas Spiess&#x27; recent video [0] covered some milimetre-wave radar chips whose application includes presence detection at a distance (including if the bed is occupied).Does anyone know of any bed automatable bed heating&#x2F;cooling solution (DIY or otherwise) that can work offline of with Home Assistant?

Track re-exports and cross-package references and allow crossref links to go into other packages. If package A uses rxjs, then links to the rxjs types should go to the canonical definitions in the rxjs package. (figuring out the canonical declaration can be tricky because it&#x27;s not always the original declaration though)2. Organizing by type isn&#x27;t always a great introduction or way to navigate a package. On the Lit project at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lit.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api we re-organized the API docs by categories and the most important API surfaces. There aren&#x27;t standard jsdocs for this, but a few straightforward things like @category could be used to offer an alternate top-level nav for a package. Also consider supporting the @packageDocumentation tag from tsdoc.3. Consider showing files other than the README. Relative links to things like CONTRIBUTING.md currently break. Alternatively interpret all relative links as pointing to github.com or npmjs.com. It&#x27;d be great to have a way to link from the README into API docs to guide readers. The community doesn&#x27;t have a great convention for this unfortunately. reply pastelsky 13 hours agorootparent> 1. Track re-exports and cross-package references This should already be tracked — play around with the member visibility widget on the sidebar for e.g. For convenience, I&#x27;ve inlined the types from re-exports, but might be a good idea to indicate they were re-exported.Pointing to the canonical source can also limit the usefulness in a few cases (e.g. d3 is just a bunch of re-exports), and users may not care about internal package organization.> 2. consider supporting the @packageDocumentation tag Organizing by @category and @packageDocumentation should already be supported. e.g. See the functions in — https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tsdocs.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;lodash-es&#x2F;4.17.21&#x2F;index.html> 3.

    "originBody": "(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window) Link Copied Security Comcast says hackers stole data of close to 36 million Xfinity customers Carly Page@carlypage_ / 12:45 PM UTC•December 19, 2023 Comment Image Credits: Comcast Comcast has confirmed that hackers exploiting a critical-rated security vulnerability accessed the sensitive information of almost 36 million Xfinity customers. This vulnerability, known as “CitrixBleed,” is found in Citrix networking devices often used by big corporations and has been under mass-exploitation by hackers since late August. Citrix made patches available in early October, but many organizations did not patch in time. Hackers have used the CitrixBleed vulnerability to hack into big-name victims, including aerospace giant Boeing, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and international law firm Allen & Overy. Xfinity, Comcast’s cable television and internet division, became the latest CitrixBleed victim, the company confirmed in a notice to customers on Monday. The U.S. telecom giant said that hackers exploiting the CitrixBleed vulnerability had access to its internal systems between October 16 and October 19, but that the company did not detect the “malicious activity” until October 25. By November 16, Xfinity determined that “information was likely acquired” by the hackers, and in December, the company concluded that this included customer data, including usernames and “hashed” passwords, which are scrambled and stored in a way that makes them unreadable to humans. It’s not immediately clear how the passwords were scrambled or using which algorithm, as some weaker hashing algorithms can be cracked. The company says for an unspecified number of customers, hackers may have also accessed names, contact information, dates of birth, the last four digits of Social Security numbers and their secret questions and answers. Comcast notes that “our data analysis is continuing, and we will provide additional notices as appropriate,” suggesting additional types of data may also have been accessed. The notice doesn’t say how many Xfinity customers have been impacted, and Comcast spokesperson Joel Shadle declined to say when asked by TechCrunch. In a filing with Maine’s attorney general, Comcast confirmed that almost 35.8 million customers are affected by the breach. Comcast’s latest earnings report shows the company has more than 32 million broadband customers, suggesting this breach has impacted most, if not all Xfinity customers. It’s not yet known whether Xfinity received a ransom demand, how the incident has impacted the company’s operators or whether the incident has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as required by the regulator’s new data breach reporting rules. Comcast’s spokesperson would not say. “We are not aware of any customer data being leaked anywhere, nor of any attacks on our customers,” said Shadle in an email to TechCrunch. Xfinity says it is requiring that customers reset their passwords and recommends the use of two-factor or multi-factor authentication — which the company doesn’t require by default — for all customer accounts.

Starlink just can&#x27;t meaningfully compete with these speeds. Most people in US cities will have two options, cable and either bonded VDSL2 or fiber from the telco. Both will be faster and usually cheaper than Starlink.The main competitor in most cases, after the cable company and the telephone company, is LTE. Also faster and cheaper than Starlink in a suburban area, but in dense areas the speeds really suffer.

Because there is a tracker on the door that tracks how many open&#x2F;closes linked to the conversion rate. The conversion rate was considered more important than properly authenticating accounts. Im pretty sure Comcast knows about this and does nothing. Needless to say, when I made my concerns known I was terminated same day for \"not being a good fit\". reply meepmorp 15 hours agoparentAt one point in the early 2000s, Comcast&#x27;s internal network wasn&#x27;t internal.

But the page where you need to use it for password recovery handles 1500 bits, and the form in their app only handles 500.So you cannot get it to work in the app no matter what, and can only use it on the recovery page if you somehow figure out that only 1000 bits are on the server and truncate to that yourself.2. Some places use the same security questions when you phone support. The support person asks you one of the security questions and can read the answer from the database. They compare that to what you tell them over the phone.You probably don&#x27;t want to go through that with a random 4096 bit string. reply JohnFen 12 hours agorootparent> Some places use the same security questions when you phone support.Fascinating. This is something I never encountered, so it never occurred to me that this might be done. reply willcipriano 12 hours agorootparentYeah, easy way to own the security conscious is call customer service and \"authenticate yourself\" by \"answering\" that you made the security response a bunch of random letters and numbers beacuse you were in a hurry and was confused about the assignment. replyrenewiltord 16 hours agorootparentprevThey&#x27;re just recovery codes by a different name and with a built-in hint. I could reset the password of half of my friends from what I know. For a random person, I could probably just use something like this https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastbackgroundcheck.com&#x2F;people&#x2F;gavin-newsom&#x2F;san-... and get almost all the way there.As a user, if you want guessable recovery codes, that&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s all in the threat model. The password for this account is very guessable. It used to be 000000. I don&#x27;t care about any possible threat to it. reply eli 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think most users care much one way or the other. But they do sometimes lose their credentials and need a password reset and if the reset flow assumes you&#x27;ll be able to answer those questions anyway, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time. reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparentIn general, you don&#x27;t want a forgotten password to be a \"sucks to be you\" situation or even a come to a physical office with two forms of ID situation. reply washadjeffmad 15 hours agoparentprevI usually recommend disregarding the questions and filling in a common response for every field (with the current date or the name of the company or service, for instance), and writing it down.No one except hackers or certain federal agencies would be able to compare the results of security questions across independent identity management systems. reply bri3d 15 hours agoparentprev> Periodic reminder that these are just passwords too. They should be treated as such by users (generate random responses) and devs (hash and salt them).Unfortunately this is not how almost any business treats them; they are frequently used as challenge&#x2F;response authentication over the phone, so using a random response or hashing and salting them doesn&#x27;t work.Authenticating a user over the phone is a major unsolved problem IMO, and responsible for a huge swath of modern account takeover issues. reply happytiger 16 hours agoprev0wn3d.Includes security questions and last four of social security for tens of millions.Couldn’t happen to a nicer company either.Boilerplate response from them:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.xfinity.com&#x2F;assets&#x2F;dotcom&#x2F;learn&#x2F;Notice%20To%2... reply crazybLanKeT 15 hours agoparentanother reason to never answer those security questions with actual info. reply AdamJacobMuller 14 hours agorootparentThe primary reason being when you have to answer the questions over the phone.\"What is your mother&#x27;s maiden name?\"\"bidah6shee8Dahkouju\"\"Wait, what, that is correct how ?\"Every time I hear their confusion and shock, I get a bit more depressed that more people aren&#x27;t doing this. reply amlozano 13 hours agorootparentProtip, use something like a https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diceware.rempe.us&#x2F;#eff password with 6 words.They never seem to mind when you just say \"litmus secrecy ruckus nest reason send\", they don&#x27;t even skip a beat. reply mdaniel 12 hours agorootparentI enjoy pointing out that 1Password has a dedicated section for generating \"security answers\" using this same method (they allow \"horse battery staple\" style with variable number of words, although a minimum of 3) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.1password.com&#x2F;generate-security-questions&#x2F;Like all good Bitwarden things, feel free to spit^W vote for a similar feature request https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.bitwarden.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;security-questions-track-a... reply whatevaa 11 hours agorootparentBitwarden has passphrase generation which can achieve similar thing. reply mdaniel 10 hours agorootparentYeah, I knew the Bitwarden army would show up.

Same with any property held directly. This is why you have a holding company own the properties, and keep your name off the public records for the holding company.Utilities might still be in your name, however, as not everyone knows how to obtain those under aliases or remembers to have their staff do it for them. They often want credit checks on a normal person for non-commercial service plans, or for residential addresses.App location histories, mobile service location histories, Uber trip logs, food delivery order history, all of these are potential vectors for leakage, too.There’s a big gap between “wealthy enough to be able to pay for some measure of privacy&#x2F;safety for one’s family” and “wealthy enough to warrant spending salaries for three shifts of armed guards 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365”. reply betaby 9 hours agoparentprevAll property tax bills are public in Montreal for example.

    "originLink": "https://floppy.cafe/",
    "originBody": "Bit Banging a 3.5\" Floppy Drive Welcome to the floppy cafe! These pages are the lost and sacred texts you've been looking for if you happen to be writing a driver for a 3.5\" floppy. To learn these mysteries, I bit-banged a floppy drive using a teensy4.0 and managed to write a full driver for it. My project code is hosted here on github in case you'd like to learn more. Continue reading for an extremely detailed overview of the project and all my findings on this adventure. Although the information is largely common for any floppy drive, floppy.cafe is dedicated specifically to 3.5\" media. Table of Contents How do Floppy Disks Work Wiring Guide Sending Commands Synchronization Barrier Sector Metadata Track Metadata Further Reading How do Floppy Disks Work? This website has a good overview and some nice pictures. Fundamentally, your floppy houses a magnetized disk that spins at about 300rpm. For 3.5\" media, that disk contains 80 tracks. Each track has 18 sectors. Each sector has 512 bytes of user-space data (and some more bytes used for metadata). Most \"modern\" floppies are double-sided, so you can multiply all that by 2 in order to find the total amount of usable space per disk. 1,474,560 bytes in all. Fun fact! floppy disks actually contain a lot more surface area than 1.44mb. By my calculation, you'll get closer to 1.70mb but a lot of that extra space is earmarked for synchronization barriers and sector / track metadata. Wiring Guide Here's the cool thing about floppy drives: they have no communication protocol! It's just a bunch of gpio pins. For most of them, pulling the pin HIGH means it is in the \"disabled\" or \"off\" state. Pulling a pin LOW will activate it. You can read about the very detailed specifications for the SAMSUNG-SFD321B floppy drive. The top row of pins are the functions, the bottom row of pins are all LOGIC GROUND. Logic. Did you get that? LOGIC! Not motor ground. I had them wired up wrong for weeks and wondered why nothing worked. And, yes, there's like a million ground pins but you only need 1 to get it working. An important note! the logic-level pins are rated for 5v, however, you can use 3v3 in a pinch! Why is that? All these data pins are open drain and should be hooked up to a pull-up resistor. That means the only way these floppy drives communciate back is by sinking the voltage. So 3v3, 5v, it doesn't matter. The floppy drive will happily pull it down. Protip! Some of the bottom row of pins are not connected internally! So if you are plugging in just 1 ground wire and it's not working, chances are the ground pin you selected is disconnected. Try another one. You'll notice the power section only needs two wires. 5v+ and another ground. For your sanity, I suggest using a separate power bus than whatever your microcontroller is on. Please do not connect the 5v+ to an arduino or a GPIO! It can draw upwards of 1A during really feisty operations and it will fry your microcontroller! Sending Commands There are a number of commands and proceedures you will need to implement in order to assume control of the floppy drive. In general, commands are issued by pulling a given pin LOW. A word of warning: I've read online the Arduino internal pull-ups aren't great. They'll work for most of these pins except the data line. You may want to add a 4.5k pull-up to the DATA line instead of relying on the built-in pull-ups. Alright! Let's explore each function you have access to. Index The floppy drive doesn't really know where you are at any given time. You can suss this out with various mechanisms, and one of those mechanisms is the INDEX pin. The index pin is the first usable pin on the top row (pin 8). When this pin is LOW, the disk has made one complete revolution and is currently at the start of the data stream. In my driver, I would often look for HIGH to LOW transitions and use this to increment an error counter. If I can't complete some task after 10 revolutions or so, I consider the drive in a bad state. Drive Select There are a few different drive select pins (often for drive 0, 1, and 2) but the main one we're interested in is PIN 12 also known as DRIVE SELECT 1. The other ones are reserved for controlling multiple floppy drives at once. This function is used to enable the floppy drive. Pulling it LOW will provide you access to all the other I/O functions except MOTOR ON. That one is agnostic of drive select. Motor On As the name suggests, this pin is dedicated to controlling the motor. To enable the motor, pull this pin LOW and then wait 500ms. It's good practice to monitor the INDEX line as well for a HIGH to LOW transition, indicating that the spindle has made a complete revolution. Direction Select This pin controls the direction that the track stepper motor pin will move in, when you pulse the STEP pin. Pulling this pin LOW will orient the track stepper motor to move towards the center of the magnetic disk (increasing the track number). Pulling this pin HIGH will orient the track stepper to move towards the outside of the magnetic disk (decreasing the track number). Step There are 80 tracks on your average 3.5\" floppy drive. You can select a given track by pulsing the STEP pin and combining it with the direction select pin. Pulsing this pin will charge and actuate a stepper motor. As such, there are some specific timing requirements. I like to pull it LOW for 3ms and then pull it HIGH for an additional 3ms and leave it in the high state until the next pulse. The documentation states it can be low for as short as 0.15us but that didn't work for me consistently across other drives. Write Data If you want to know a lot more about this pin, head on over to the MFM ENCODING page for a primer on how to use it. From a technical perspective, pulsing this pin will reverse the flux direction on the magnetized disk. In general, you will hold the pin LOW for about 0.15us to 1.1us and then bring it back to a HIGH state. How long it remains in the high state determines the encoded value according to the MFM rules. Write Gate Pusling the write data pin will do nothing if the gate is closed. To begin writing data, you must pull this pin LOW and keep it low during your write operation. You cannot read and write at the same time. Fun fact! While I was developing my driver, I ruined many entire tracks by leaving this open for too long. If you aren't careful, it'll wreck the sector metadata and synchronization barriers and totally destroy your floppy disk. Reformatting the disk should restore balance to the force, so this won't be a total loss. Track 00 The floppy drive controls this pin, and when it gets pulled LOW that means the read/write head is positioned on the first track (track 0). Write Protect When a write-protected media is insertted, this pin will be pulled LOW by the floppy drive and the data on the disk is protected from mis-erasing. When the pin is HIGH the floppy drive can be written. This only seems to work if the drive select pin has been pulled low. Read Data A HIGH to LOW transition on this line indicates the flux direction has changed on the underlying magnetic disk. Once you encouter this transition, count all the clock cyles between the leading edge of the LOW signal to the trailing edge of the HIGH signal. Side Select These 3.5\" floppy disks have 2 sides. Pulling this pin HIGH selects the lower side (side 0). Pulling this pin LOW selects the upper side (side 1). Ready/Disk Change I never got this to work, but the spec says it will either tell you if the drive is in a ready state or not. When the floppy drive pulls this pin LOW, the drive is ready for operation. Otherwise, the pin will be left in a HIGH state. Synchronization Barriers Between each track is a synchronization barrier. This barrier is surprisingly easy to find because it is just 12 0x0 bytes followed by 3 0xA1 bytes. In terms of pulses, it amounts to to 96 short pulses followed by the sequence of pulses MLMLMSLMLMSLMLM. You may have trouble reading all 96 pulses because of timing. A common practice is to seek for at least 80 pulses instead. This will give you a bit more resilience. Sector Metadata Each sector is comprised of some metadata to describe it. The metadata is formatted like so: 12 bytes of 0x0 3 bytes of 0xA1 One byte of 0xFE One byte to indicate the track number One byte to indicate the side (or head) One byte to indicate thes sector number One byte to indicate the sector size 2 bytes of CRC (cyclic redundancy code) computed from the sector metadata 22 bytes of 0x4E 12 bytes of 0x0 3 bytes of 0xA1 1 byte of either 0xFA or 0xFB 512 bytes of user data 2 bytes of CRC computed from the user data Unspecified amount of 0x4E bytes filling in the remaining space between sectors Upon careful inspection, we can see there are actually two synchronization barriers. One to find the sector metadata, and another to find the userspace data. The only difference is the byte that follows. For sectors, the immediate byte after the barrier is 0xFE. For userspace data, it's either 0xFA or 0xFB. This is how we can determine which kind of barrier we've run into. Track Metadata Each track also has its own set of metadata which is formatted like so: 80 bytes of 0x4E 12 bytes of 0x00 3 bytes of 0xC3 One byte of 0xFC 50 bytes of 0x4E Further Reading Here is a comprehensive list of additional resources: SFD321B-070103.pdf Floppy Disk Formats Floppy Drive PinOut MFM Reader (github) Floppy Driver RS (github) Adafruit Floppy Reader (github) Arduino FDC Next, let's check out MFM ENCODING to learn more about how data is stored.",

On real hardware you&#x27;d have to be even more unlucky to have the CRC match -- which also isn&#x27;t checked in this implementation. Using this as-is on real floppies could result in reading corrupt data. It would be possible to construct a floppy that would read correctly on real hardware and sometimes mis-read data with the current SW implementation.The problem is that the 0xA1 bytes on the disk are special. The 0xA1 bytes are MFM encoded with a missing clock pulse -- making them \"0xA1 syncs\" that don&#x27;t match an 0xA1 data byte.This is what I think dragontamer is alluding to in another thread -- you cannot properly decode the header unless you also recognize the missing clock pulse. So it is important to do the clock recovery in order to notice this.The special encoding is also present for 5.25 and early hard drives using MFM encodings. reply wolpoli 15 hours agoprev> Fun fact! floppy disks actually contain a lot more surface area than 1.44mb. By my calculation, you&#x27;ll get closer to 1.70mb but a lot of that extra space is earmarked for synchronization barriers and sector &#x2F; track metadata.This explains the 2M utility that allowed storing about 1.8mb on a floppy disk. It was fun playing with it. reply retrac 14 hours agoparentI think this is a case where a picture is worth a thousand words. This excellent article \"Visualizing Commodore 1541 Disk Contents\" [1] by Michael Steil about the Commodore 64 disk format, includes visualizations of the magnetic flux as stored on disk.This bit is particularly relevant: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pagetable.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;visualize_1541&#x2F;sector.png See the solid bit at the end of the sector, just before the next header? You could squeeze a few more bytes in there, but if the drive motor is just slightly too fast, it&#x27;ll overwrite the next sector. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a gap, tolerance for timing variation.Most floppy drive technologies wrote blindly, guessing where they were on the disk based on timing estimates since the controller last saw a sector header. This is also why disks needed to be \"formatted\". Not just in the sense of writing the file system data structures, but writing out all the sector headers. This had to be done all at once with the same drive, due to those small timing variations.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pagetable.com&#x2F;?p=1070 reply brk 14 hours agorootparentI recall it was also not unheard of to have floppy drives that could be incompatible with each other. A drive that was a tad slow might format a disk that would work for itself, and other drive, but that disk might not work in a drive that was a tad too fast (and vice-versa). This wasn&#x27;t common, just frequently enough to occur so occasionally as to always be baffling, particularly in an office with lots of PCs.Then there were things like Spiradisc (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spiradisc), which created incompatibilities by design. reply jacquesm 13 hours agorootparentThis happened with tape drives too.

This is because RAM was more expensive back then, thus holding an entire track in memory would have an associated cost.A major factor - I&#x27;d argue even more significant than cost of memory - was that the IBM PC used an off-the-shelf floppy disk controller chip (NEC uPDC765A), which was hardwired to support the industry-standard IBM floppy track format (which had evolved from IBM&#x27;s 3740 mainframe data entry system, introduced in 1973), and didn&#x27;t support the Amiga&#x27;s custom track format. Whereas, the Amiga could do this because it didn&#x27;t actually have a floppy disk controller-the functionality of controlling floppy disks was in part contained in their custom ASICs, and in part implemented in software by the CPU. Unlike the Amiga, the original IBM PC eschewed proprietary ASICs in favour of off-the-shelf chips, in order to minimise time-to-market. reply snvzz 2 hours agorootparentTrue, they use these pre-existing standard controllers. But these standard controllers and the track format were indeed designed in that way due to the ram limitation.Ironically, it is possible to read arbitrary formats with the debug read track operation. Yet, it needs to find one triple sync word somewhere in the track; a controller limitation.Unfortunately, the Amiga standard track format didn&#x27;t account for that, and uses the same sync word (the 4489 one) but double.It could have been designed to use a different sync word, and include a triple 4489 at the track start, but they didn&#x27;t think about it at the time.Some tricks bit-banging the controller allow for writing arbitrary tracks.It is also possible to read arbitrary tracks, if there&#x27;s two floppy drives and a standard ibm pc formatted disk is present in the other one, by switching the drive after the controller has started reading. reply skissane 9 minutes agorootparent> But these standard controllers and the track format were indeed designed in that way due to the ram limitation.The track format was designed that way in the early 1970s. RAM was likely one reason for it, but another was that the 3740 used sector gaps as record boundaries; it was commonly configured so each 128 byte disk sector held a single 80-column punch card worth of data. 3740 format floppies support deleting sectors (by using a different sync word in the sector header) so you could delete database records. PC floppy controllers supported deleted sectors too, even though almost no software used them (some copy protection schemes did, but duplicating deleted sectors isn’t hard once you know they exist.) Part of the motivation for 128 byte sectors was likely the fact that it was the smallest power of 2 that could fit a whole punch card.Also, a whole 3740 track was 3338 bytes (26 sectors of 128 bytes), which was a lot of RAM in 1973; in 1981, a whole PC floppy track was 4096 bytes. 4KB was a lot less expensive in 1981 than in 1973, so by then it would have been less of a motivating factor than when the track format was initially defined. reply JNRowe 7 hours agorootparentprevThanks to the pluggable device layer, you could push that to 984kB or 1968kB with diskspare¹.

When you say \"transition\" are you talking about an individual transistor moving from on to off or vice versa? reply theamk 12 hours agorootparent\"transition\" is signal changing, from high to low or from low to high.As described in the page, there are multiple signals changing when operating floppy (\"track 0\", \"write gate\", \"data\", etc..). Of them the fastest one is \"data\", so that&#x27;s what I am going to focus on.The 2nd page of writeup [0] says: A short transition (S) will nominally have 2us between bits, and represents 0b10 A medium transition (M) will nominally have 3us between bits, and represents 0b100 A long transition (L) will nominally have 4us between bits, and represents 0b1000So we are looking at 3, 4 or 5 microseconds between bits. To get this in CPU cycles, you multiply this by clock frequency - google can help you with units, searching for \"2 microseconds * 600 megahertz\" [1] shows the answer, 1200, right away. I&#x27;ve rounded this down to 1000, as there are two transitions per pulse and it is all very approximate anyway.And then you use your embedded knowledge to assign meaning to the number: the CPU is ARM, so 1 instruction&#x2F;cycle is a good approximation (it could be more due to dual-issue or less due to jumps). So you have like 1000 instructions. Each function call in language like C or C++ might be a 5-20 instructions overhead, and you probably want to read that pin at least 10 times to detect both transitions. The tightest loop is also going to be a dozen instructions or less (read gpio, mask, compare, maybe jump out, increase, compare timeout, loop)So.. you can do it in C&#x2F;C++ easily if your main loop involves no function calls (and you have no interrupts). If you use functions to read, your timing is going to be tight and those functions are better be super-optimized, you will be asking your compiler for a lot. Higher level languages like lua&#x2F;micropython are out of the question (at least for that loop). And as I learned from reading this, rust is also out of the question, although I wonder if there are some unsafe primitives which do not do any checking.(and yes, there are transistors changing in the background all the time throughout the process, but I really don&#x27;t care much about them, they are on too low of the abstraction level)[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;floppy.cafe&#x2F;mfm.html[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=2+microseconds+*+600+megaher... reply dragontamer 12 hours agorootparent> And then you use your embedded knowledge to assign meaning to the number: the CPU is ARM, so 1 instruction&#x2F;cycle is a good approximation (it could be more due to dual-issue or less due to jumps).

The tightest loop is also going to be a dozen instructions or less (read gpio, mask, compare, maybe jump out, increase, compare timeout, loop)Nit: That&#x27;s definitely the wrong approach though IMO.So you want to accomplish two things:1. Clock recovery -- Figuring out the timing of a signal2. Decoding -- Figuring out what that signal meansThese are two separate steps and should be done separately, be it in code or hardware. Though advanced protocols combine both into a single step, the older protocols (UART &#x2F; Floppy &#x2F; etc. etc.) had these two concepts separated into two different steps.You won&#x27;t have 2us between bits: but instead 2.01us or 1.99us between bits, etc. etc. Clock-recovery mechanisms means that even in the face of worst-case timing differences, your code remains resilient.Decoding is the step you&#x27;ve done here, but it should be done after clock-recovery.-------------Traditional clock recovery methods are phase-locked-loops (in hardware), or various XOR-loops (in software) to try and figure out the timing of the clock from the 0-1 and 1-0 transitions.----The traditional UART (ex: 9600 baud or 115200 baud) is ~16-ticks per bit. (IE: a 9600 baud UART needs to look at the signal 153600 times per second. A 115200 baud UART needs to look at the signal 1843200 times per second). The 16-times per bit helps you \"center your aim\" for the transition. You then typically aim at the center-3 timeslots (ex: count number 7, 8, and 9) for when to send and&#x2F;or read the signal.--------That being said, your analysis for \"how many instructions you have per timeslice to read the data\" is correct. I just feel like adding that the clock-recovery portion needs to be definitely addressed. reply dfox 11 hours agorootparentThe idea there is that if you measure the timing between transitions precisely enough you do not have to do a real clock recovery. The FDD motors seem to be precise and stable enough (after some spin-up time) that this approach works and IIRC even many HW FDCs do something similar internally. But at the same time the low-level format is clearly designed to make some kind of PLL-based clock recovery scheme possible.After all that is what the FM in MFM implies. There is an obvious parallel with the simplest approach to demodulating FSK (or for that matter DTMF) in digital domain, which works by counting&#x2F;timing zero transitions of the signal.The UART receivers are similar in that there is no clock recovery, with the assumption that the clock is stable enough that any kind of frequency error or drift will be insignificant for the relatively short (usually 10bit) frame. The oversampling is there to align the sample point with middle of the symbol and the majority voting from multiple samples serves to average out effects of spiky noise that may be superimposed on the signal. reply dragontamer 11 hours agorootparentPretty much all UART receivers I know of perform either 16x or 8x sampling to figure out where the start and end of bit-transitions are located. This is the clock-recovery mechanism.You need to discover the edges of the clock, and make sure you read _AWAY_ from those edges. The bits are not well defined on the clock edges. Even with a 100% accurate clock, if you&#x27;re reading on the edges you&#x27;ll be very unreliable.UARTs aim to read on the \"center\" of bits. (If there are 16x reads per bit, then the \"center\" is on reads 7, 8, and 9). You&#x27;ll want to stay away from reading on timeslot#1 or timeslot#16. reply dfox 8 hours agorootparentFor UART this is only about sampling away from the edges. The UART waveform does not have any feature that is usable for clock recovery, the only thing in there is that the start bit (ie. Mark) delineates the start of the frame, how many of the same bits there are is part of the payload. And the stop bit is there so that there is always a transition at the leading edge of the frame. You can do baud rate autodetection, but that is different concept than clock recovery and mostly doable in pure software (well, it is doable by Mk. 1 Eyeball, as the wrong baudrate produces somewhat obvious results).Obviously there is a bit of history and the whole system was originally implemented electro-mechanically, which is the reason for things like two or more stopbits (it creates time for the mechanism to settle to the reset state) or even the concept of NUL character. replyEvanAnderson 11 hours agoprevThe other side of this coin is emulating a floppy drive in software: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keirf&#x2F;flashfloppy reply vardump 12 hours agoprevWould be pretty cool to get this working on a bit-banging monster, like RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico).Just a few bucks and sports a 12 Mbit&#x2F;s USB interface (and wifi for pico-w). reply zozbot234 12 hours agoparentTake a look at the Greaseweazle https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keirf&#x2F;greaseweazle to see what a really high-end solution in this space looks like.

I absolutely recommend both for homogeneous collections of disks.Most of the effort was in entering the text of the labels manually or restarting and switching between capture formats when a Mac or IBM disk cropped up. FluxEngine uses the expected format to decide whether the track most recently read contains errors; and if so, re-read the track 3-5 times, quintupling overall read-times.All that&#x27;s needed now is a floppy handling robot, a macro for recording the physical disk and label descriptions, and maybe a container format for all the capture products; thumbnails, cover art, metadata, flux images; that emulators and disk utilities can read, and that the community can re-distribute easily. reply zozbot234 3 hours agorootparentNice, you should consider uploading these dumps to the Internet Archive so that they can be preserved for the foreseeable future. (Of course, that is unless they&#x27;re strictly private data that was never made available, even unofficially.) reply actionfromafar 8 hours agoprevCould one generate magnetic flux with software and a coil, so that a physical floppy drive believed it read a floppy disk, but it wasn&#x27;t a real disk, but just a coil (or 80 tiny coils, on for each track) ??? reply kalleboo 7 hours agoparentYes, this was a thing back in the day to read flash memory cards in a floppy drive (this product used a single head and special drivers since it needed to support disks bigger than 1.4 MB) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;FlashPath reply gwbas1c 12 hours agoprev> To enable the motor, pull this pin LOW and then wait 500ms.No wonder floppies were sooo daaarn sloooooow. reply mras0 12 hours agoparentOnce the drive is spinning that doesn&#x27;t matter though. Floppies are slow by modern standards mostly because you only get a new (decoded) bit around every 2nd (or for DD drives 4th) microsecond, and the drive takes some time stepping to the next cylinder (track). reply snvzz 10 hours agoparentprevThey felt so fast (Amiga).Relative to the datasette (C64) I was used to. reply jacquesm 13 hours agoprevThe Teensy is an incredibly powerful platform for its size. I never cease to be amazed at what people manage to get out of them. reply maaarghk 14 hours agoprevCould be useful &#x2F; fun to make a USB floppy drive which supports non standard layouts like Commodore and AKAI. reply EvanAnderson 13 hours agoparentA couple of examples:- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;decromancer.ca&#x2F;greaseweazle&#x2F;- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbmstuff.com&#x2F;index.php?route=product&#x2F;product&pro...I think it&#x27;d be interesting to connect a high sensitivity &#x2F; resolution sampling probe directly to the analog output of the drive heads. You could do software-defined signal processing to potentially recover damaged data. These USB-based tools are getting the signal after being amplified in the analog domain and processed by the drive&#x27;s electronics. reply dusted 14 hours agoprevside select.. so.. that basically flips between upper or lower read&#x2F;write heads..That wire though..It seems they could have gotten twice the speed by having two read and two write pins, one one additional pin. reply zaxomi 13 hours agoparentThe first floppy from 1967 only had one side. Adding one signal to select side was an easy solution to increase the capacity without to much modification of the controller. Adding the capability to read from both heads at the same time would require much more modifications, and more memory. reply FullyFunctional 12 hours agorootparentUndeniably true; so much of computing hardware (and software) looks archaic and bizarre because it&#x27;s the process of a long chain of backwards compatible changes (don&#x27;t get me started on ATAPI).But that aside, like dusted I too wonder just _how_ hard it would have been for a company like, say Apple, to demand the extra circuit. Might not have been worth it for just 2X speedup.Now I want to build a 10X floppy RAID ... reply MBCook 10 hours agorootparentEveryone had that extra circuit in the floppy controller, it was just somewhere else.Ask for it to be integrated and now you go from being able to buy drive from almost anyone to only one vendor.It is odd it never improved and stayed as simple as it was until the end of floppies. The power of history I guess. reply MBCook 10 hours agoparentprevYeah, but then you need twice the CPU cycles to encode&#x2F;decode it. And that may have been the limiting factor when first introduced.After that it’s all backwards compatibility. No one wants a new interface.I remember the first time I saw a floppy pin out, I was dumbfounded. I expected it to be far more complex like IDE. I didn’t realize the term “floppy controller” would be so literal.Of course in retrospect it makes sense. IDE = Integrated Drive Electronics. I assume the hard disks that came before worked more like the floppy and their controllers did more work too.I guess no one cared enough to enhance the poor floppy drive until we got to things like LS-120 that I assume flat out couldn’t use the old interface and never took off anyway. reply kalleboo 6 hours agorootparent> I assume the hard disks that came before worked more like the floppy and their controllers did more work too.You nailed it. The first hard disk interfaces for IBM PCs were basically identical to the floppy disk controller just faster&#x2F;bigger.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ST506&#x2F;ST412The ST506 interface between the controller and drive was derived from the Shugart Associates SA1000 interface,[5] which was in turn based upon the floppy disk drive interface,[6] thereby making disk controller design relatively easyBut as they started wanting to make disk reads faster and faster, the drive part had to get smarter and smarterThe ST412 disk drive, among other improvements, added buffered seek capability to the interface. In this mode, the controller can send STEP pulses to the drive as fast as it can receive them, without having to wait for the mechanism to settle. An onboard microprocessor in the drive then moves the mechanism to the desired track as fast as possibleAt that point the drive is starting to getting smart enough that you might as well integrate the whole controller on there.The original versions of IDE&#x2F;ATA were basically just an extension of ISA, and the first \"IDE cards\" were just a bridge to the ISA slot they went in.You also had \"hard cards\" where the hard disk itself was integrated onto the ISA card... https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hardcard reply quijoteuniv 12 hours agoprevI love fun with flags! reply sked64 14 hours agoprev [–] super cool very retro replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "About Community Contribute GitHub Wiki Blog Donate Introducing Fedora Asahi Remix The most polished Linux® for Apple Silicon Macs. Install from macOS curl https://alx.shsh Fedora Linux 39 + Apple Silicon = Fedora Asahi Remix Fedora Asahi Remix is the result of a close multi-year collaboration between the Asahi Linux project and the Fedora Project. We’ve worked hard in order to bring you a fully integrated distro, cooperating closely to get improvements and bug fixes to users as quickly as possible. All of our Asahi platform-specific packages are in upstream Fedora and fully supported in Fedora Linux 39. With Fedora’s excellent 64-bit ARM support and mature development process, you can expect a solid and high-quality experience without any unwanted surprises. Fedora Asahi Remix is based on Fedora Linux 39, the latest Fedora Linux release with the newest software versions across the board. All M1 and M2 series MacBook, Mac Mini, Mac Studio, and iMac devices are supported. Fedora Asahi Remix ❤ KDE Plasma We are proud to offer KDE Plasma as our flagship desktop environment. With leading edge Wayland support and a highly customizable experience plus wide support for Apple hardware features, KDE Plasma is a joy to use on Apple Silicon. Want to use Night Color to keep your screen from disrupting your sleep cycle? No worries, it just works. Tweak your trackpad settings for a more comfortable experience? Everything’s right there in System Settings. Are things on screen too big or too small? Just adjust the display scale to your heart’s content, even in 5% increments. We’ve worked with the KDE project to bring you bug fixes and improvements to improve platform support, and we’ve also built a custom Calamares-based initial setup wizard so you can be up and running in no time with minimal fuss. Fedora Linux 39 comes with KDE Plasma 5.27, with the latest patches and improvements. But that’s not all: Stay tuned for the upcoming Fedora Linux 40, which will bring us KDE Plasma 6 with even more improvements. Rather use GNOME? No worries, we’ve got you covered with GNOME 45. Or, if you prefer to roll your own desktop configuration or want to set up a headless server, our Server and Minimal images will let you set things up exactly the way you want to. 100% Wayland Experience Whether you’re a KDE enthusiast or a GNOME lover, Fedora Asahi Remix comes right out of the box with a 100% Wayland environment, bringing you the newest desktop and display server technologies, which are a perfect match for Apple hardware. You’ll get a buttery smooth desktop, with absolutely no tearing or glitching, just like on macOS. Experience seamless HiDPI support in our KDE Plasma builds, even across multiple displays with different display scales. And with upcoming improvements in the Wayland ecosystem, we’ll be able to support new technologies such as HDR and display notches, as well as proper display calibration. Have some X11 apps to run? No worries, XWayland is available and fully supported as a bridge for legacy applications. OpenGL, deprecated? Not here Fedora Asahi Remix ships with non-conformant OpenGL 3.3 support including GPU-accelerated geometry shaders and transform feedback, as well as the world’s first and only certified conformant OpenGL ES 3.1 implementation for Apple Silicon. We support open graphics standards and test against official and industry-standard test suites, which means you can be confident that your apps and games will run correctly and render as they’re intended to. And we’re not stopping there, with OpenGL 4.x and Vulkan support in the works. We aim to unlock the full potential of Apple Silicon graphics, well beyond what is possible by layering on top of vendor-proprietary APIs like Metal. The best Linux laptop audio you’ve ever heard Over the past two years, we’ve worked hard to pioneer the world’s first fully integrated DSP solution for the desktop Linux ecosystem. Just install Fedora Asahi Remix and enjoy high-quality audio right out of the box, no setup needed. We’ve worked together with the PipeWire and WirePlumber projects to add support for fully automatic and transparent DSP configuration, and then individually measured and calibrated 8+ different machine models, designing a customized DSP filter configuration for each one. With our in-house Bankstown bass boost technology and our own pioneering open source Smart Amp implementation to safely provide full loudness and dynamic range, the result is the best audio you’ve ever heard on a Linux laptop. And we’ve even optimized the scheduling and power consumption of the DSP processing, so you’ll get excellent battery life while playing back audio.

I can&#x27;t wait until Vulkan support is ready; it&#x27;ll be cool to see what Apple&#x27;s hardware can achieve when it&#x27;s no longer restricted by Metal and macOS. reply jjtheblunt 17 hours agoparentI am misunderstanding your comment.How is Apple hardware in any way constrained by highly optimized versions of a graphics hardware library specifically for that hardware and an operating system optimized also for the hardware? reply Hazematman 17 hours agorootparentI think the implication is that the hardware is being constrained by what software is able to run on it. That there is a wealth more of Vulkan applications that a user would want to run, and they are currently unable to do that, since MoltenVK cannot support everything a Vulkan application may need. reply jjtheblunt 17 hours agorootparentI understand and that would make sense. Personally, I absolutely loath the font rendering on macOS, and I just installed the Asahi Linux a year or so ago myself because the fonts are much easier on my eyes, or my ability to control the font settings that is. reply paines 31 minutes agoprevSo they ditched the Arch based distro to Fedora in favor off?!?!?

Wonder if virtualising macOS would potentially work?Mainly wondering because macOS has a limit of 2 running VMs, which is ludicrously low given the power of the hardware.We (sqlitebrowser.org) have an apple silicon mac mini running build server tasks, but it&#x27;s only lightly used due to this limit.

The only mac that doesn&#x27;t have audio right now are the M1 imacs, due to their speakers working differently than the laptops.
