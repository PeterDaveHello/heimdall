    "commentBody": "Google Chrome has a special hidden API accesible only from *.google.com (twitter.com/lcasdev)437 points by develatio 2 hours agohidepastfavorite181 comments mike_hearn 48 minutes agoThe name hangout_services suggests this is some old tech debty hack intended to make developing Google Hangouts easier by giving that team a direct stream of telemetry. For those who have forgotten, Hangouts was the first app that did video calling in the browser using what became WebRTC. If you look at what this module is doing it's exposing stuff like CPU/GPU/RAM usage/hardware details back to the app that it wouldn't normally have. My guess is that Google will react to this Twitter thread by simply deleting it. Hangouts has been a dead product for a while; if their server side code still uses it they can surely remove it as presumably the Chrome team monitor WebRTC performance themselves in a multi-site way now, given the much wider usage. reply lucacasonato 40 minutes agoparentNo, this is used by Google Meet right now. Open the \"Troubleshooting\" panel in meet.google.com in Chrome, and you'll see live system wide CPU usage reporting :) reply cxr 30 minutes agorootparentIn principle, that's something that could be allowed without giving access \"to\" Google/the site owner, and thus on could be allowed for _any_ website. Designing and implementing it is a fun technical problem, so it's a wonder why it wasn't, considering the motivations of a typical programmer (and those at Google especially). reply mike_hearn 39 minutes agorootparentprevRight, Meet is derived from the Hangouts codebase, I still think they'll probably just delete it. Meet is a stable product, how valuable is this special privilege now? reply refulgentis 11 minutes agorootparentThis is interesting to me because you have all the right facts and are reasoning well with them. But, we end up at: \"Yeah you're right it wasn't killed, just a rebrand, so they'll probably just delete the code for it\" I worked at Google, and I can guarantee ya people don't go back and change names in old code for the latest rebrand done for eyewash 4 layers above me. Not out of laziness, either, it just has 0 value and is risky. Also, video conference perf was/is a pretty big deal (c.f. variety of sibling comments pointing out where it is used, from gSuite admin to client app). It is great on ye olde dev machine but it's very, very hard on $300 WintelChromebook thrown at line-level employees FWIW, they shouldn't have hacked this in, I do not support it. And I bet they'll just delete it anyway because it shouldn't have been there in the first place. Some line-level employee slapped it in because, in the wise words of Ian Hickson: \"Decisions went from being made for the benefit of users, to the benefit of Google, to the benefit of whoever was making the decision.\" reply lupire 4 minutes agorootparentGoogle videoconferencing runs astronomically better on a $300 Chromebook than on a $2500 Intel Mac. reply badgersnake 32 minutes agorootparentprevIt works perfectly well in Firefox without it, so I guess not much. reply ehPReth 29 minutes agorootparentprevunsure how it's reported back now, but I believe (it's been a while since i've dug in there) it's also exposed as a metric for Google Workspace administrators to monitor client perf during said calls as well (but yeah it would just be easier to yoink it) reply Tiberium 1 hour agoprevI think the submission is a bit wrong in editing the title from the original. I understood it like this: Chrome has a built-in extension that uses public Chrome APIs that are easily available to other Chrome extensions. The issue described is that this extension shares this information to Google's own domains when they're communicating with the extension, while other websites can't do this. There's no \"special hidden API\". reply Cyphus 1 hour agoparent\"special\" in the sense that unlike other extensions which are user-installed, this one is built into Chrome. \"hidden\" in the sense that when I go to chrome://extensions it is not listed. And as you already mentioned, it's a Chrome API. reply simonw 57 minutes agoparentprevPaste this into a Chrome DevTools console on a Google site - sure looks like a special API to me: chrome.runtime.sendMessage( 'nkeimhogjdpnpccoofpliimaahmaaome', { method: 'cpu.getInfo' }, response => { console.log('CPU Info:', JSON.stringify(response, null, 2)); } ); reply Jcampuzano2 51 minutes agorootparentFor what its worth, I'm on Brave (chromium based) and this also works there, so it appears to not necessarily be only Chrome but potentially any chromium browser where they haven't specifically blocked/disabled this reply replete 34 minutes agorootparentprevThis does not work (as expected) on `ungoogled-chromium`. reply rundev 49 minutes agorootparentprev> Paste this into a Chrome DevTools console I just learned that Chrome's sandbox has a huge hole in it for Google sites, and you want me to paste code into DevTools for said sites?

They're already running arbitrary code on your machine. reply lnxg33k1 38 minutes agorootparentPeople are running it because they think Google is trustworthy, so telling about abuses might be useful in order to erode that trust and let people know they shouldn't run anything from that company reply silverwind 1 hour agoparentprevA \"built-in extension\" is still part of the browser unless it can be disabled. reply danans 1 hour agoparentprevThere is potentially an innocuous and straightforward explanation for this. Imagine the browser comes with some functionality implemented as a google.com-signed web app (as opposed to compiled/linked C++ as a lot of the older Chrome UI). It would be silly if that PWA-implemented browser code would need permission to access the system information, since it is part of the browser's functionality itself. Another use case for a private API (that has long existed) is integration of the Chrome browser with Google-specific websites that provide core functionality, like the Chrome Web store, to allow for installation/removal of extensions from a web page. reply ranger_danger 52 minutes agorootparentAny time things like this are needed, I think it should ask the user for permission first. reply danans 43 minutes agorootparentMy examples are of core browser functionality, just implemented with a different tool chain (a web app instead of C++). Should the user be asked for permission for C++ to send an IPC to another C++ component? Should the Chrome Web store ask for permission to install extensions in Chrome? Down-thread I see that this is being used for Google Meet functionality, for which I agree it should ask for the user's permission. reply runarberg 38 minutes agorootparentprevI think it is a mistake to give a company like Google the benefit of the doubt. Consumer protection is a lot like security, we should theorize the worst case scenario, and assume the company is willing to work against consumer interest if it serves their own interests. If there exists a mundane and reasonable explanation for this, that doesn’t matter if there also exists a potential to exploit it in a way that harms consumers’ interests. reply parhamn 1 hour agoparentprevSame thing with more steps? reply lwansbrough 1 hour agoparentprevThis is functionally equivalent. reply madeofpalk 1 hour agoprevI'm not sure what these APIs are exactly and why they're there, but Firefox also does something similar. It has special APIs available only to Mozilla and/or Firefox domains, for things like installing extensions, or helping with first-run experience. A blog post about it was shared here on Hacker newsI think the explanation is quite mundane > There’ll be plots of various stats, including CPU utilization. I think meet will also helpfully suggest closing tabs if your machine is overloaded This is not mundane at all, it's a perfect example of giving your product an unfair competitive advantage. If Meet users are told why their meeting isn't working correctly but Zoom, Teams and Slack, Meet users are going to have a better experience that Zoom, Teams or Slack has no way of replicating. No wonder every other meeting provider pushes you aggressively into using their desktop app, Google Meet's desktop app is just Chrome! reply hot_gril 29 minutes agorootparentAt least other video conferencing tools don't lag like Meet, so users don't need to debug ;) I think this has to do with all of them using H.264 while Meet uses VP8/9. reply trealira 48 minutes agorootparentprev> If Meet users are told why their meeting isn't working correctly but Zoom, Teams and Slack, Meet users are going to have a better experience that Zoom, Teams or Slack has no way of replicating. I had to re-read this a few times; did you accidentally omit a word? > If Meet users are told why their meeting isn't working correctly but Zoom, Teams and Slack aren't, Meet users are going to have a better experience that Zoom, Teams or Slack has no way of replicating. I fully agree with you, though; it's anticompetitive for them to use Chrome to give their other products an advantage. reply john-n 1 hour agoparentprevI believe this is the point, rather than being mundane. Other video conference tools are not able to offer this debugging option - which you have pointed out is useful. reply tantalor 1 hour agorootparentThe user could easily install an extension that provides the same debugging capability. Most users don't care, so they won't need it. reply elicksaur 50 minutes agorootparentDefaults are powerful. reply not2b 11 minutes agoparentprevYou have a competitor, Zoom. They have an in-browser version. Can they use this API for troubleshooting performance issues? No? The European regulators might be interested in that. Perhaps this is one reason why Meet performs well in the browser and Zoom doesn't, meaning Zoom users use the native app if they want reasonable performance (particularly with many people in the meeting). reply 3D30497420 1 hour agoparentprevAre features like this available to other websites outside of Google? Say, could Zoom also add a feature like this? reply SirMaster 1 hour agorootparentIf Zoom makes a chrome extension, then yes. reply lwansbrough 59 minutes agorootparentWill the Zoom extension also be installed by default? reply ikiris 45 minutes agorootparentDo you want every person in the world to run a line to your house, or do you want to have 1, and use that service to talk to them? reply lucacasonato 29 minutes agorootparentExcept that is not what Google is doing. They have exclusive access to the one line that is preinstalled for all houses. Only they can use it. And if you want a different provider, you can't use that same line. You have to pay for the installation of a line from that provider with your own cash. reply octopoc 51 minutes agorootparentprevThat is incorrect. Zoom would have to modify the browser source code to enable the API on their domain. reply hot_gril 29 minutes agorootparentprevBeside the point, but I don't think Chrome extensions have access to those hardware details. reply RIMR 1 hour agorootparentprevA level playing field for competition? This is Google we're talking about. reply oldkinglog 20 minutes agoparentprevMonopoly leveraging is illegal, not mundane. reply vundercind 53 minutes agoparentprevOh wow. This explanation was the first I read of what this actually does (yeah, yeah, I didn’t read the linked article first) and that’s a lot worse than I expected. reply tamimio 35 minutes agoparentprevAnd they do the same thing with YouTube by slowing down the initial load in other browsers. Google is evil, and this is the least of it. reply lucacasonato 31 minutes agoparentprevI agree it is very useful! This is also how I discovered this in the first place. But that is not at all my point. The point is that google.com web properties have access to an API and a browser capability that is not available to it's competitors. Google only allows reading CPU info for itself. The reason the data is not available for everyone, is because it would be a huge tracking vector. Same reason we don't allow webpages to read the device hostname, or username, or Chrome profile name. Google exposes this to google.com because it trusts itself. That poses this antitrust issue though. reply jhdifdhsak 1 hour agoparentprevif we are guessing I would drawn my guess from the hyper controlled access to android play services, which do much more than what you are guessing. my guess would also include some nifty debug info from FLoC ;) reply RIMR 1 hour agoparentprevVery cool that Google built an anticompetitive browser that offers such useful features only to themselves. Very cool of you as a Google employee to say the quiet part out loud for us. reply danielmarkbruce 2 minutes agorootparentAre customers better off or worse off? reply danielmarkbruce 1 hour agoparentprevIt's hilarious how people jump to the most sensational explanation for things like this, when in almost every case the reason is mundane. In the VR team at google back in 2016, we spent soooo much time making sure we deleted any data that could in any way be imagined to be related to tracking, not because we tracked anything personal, but because it could be perceived the wrong way by people with sensational viewpoints. \"yes, but if you have those random 27 pieces of information, and correlate it using x advanced method, you can track what some random dude is doing!\" reply ascorbic 1 hour agorootparentThis isn't a mundane explanation though: this is exactly the example Luca gives in the original thread. It's anti-competitive, because it's functionality only available to Google Meet. Google is using its browser monopoly to advantage its other products. reply danielmarkbruce 3 minutes agorootparentThey are just trying to make their products better. Anti competitive behavior is generally perceived to be about doing things that put the company in question in a better position without improving the product. Ask yourself the question - are customers better or worse off because of this? reply rurp 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, crazy to think that Google of all companies would track people in unexpected ways :eyeroll:. Your post is evidence that the scrutiny Google gets is actually helping matters. Companies, especially powerful ones, should default to not tracking personal data any more than necessary. I'm glad to hear that at least one department took that seriously. reply danielmarkbruce 7 minutes agorootparentI worked in a few different parts of google - not only did they take it seriously, it was insane how hard people worked to not even make it possibly interpreted to be tracking. For the vast majority of products, tracking people isn't useful. People's imaginations run far ahead of reality. reply Pesthuf 15 minutes agoprevSafari also has some Apple specific features, like being able to show a special dialog for logging into other websites with your Apple account that works differently from passkeys or password autofill, or the redirect based flow they make other browsers go through.

There's another thread for this post pointing out you would also need to inject a malicious root cert for https traffic, which is correct, but not impossible (and given some bad/lazy practices I've seen places do when they sign their own certs for internal infrastructure, not a far stretch) reply jonas21 47 minutes agorootparentIf they can do that, they can spoof or proxy any website and collect your passwords, auth cookies, and anything else sent over the network. At that point, who cares if they can also see how much CPU you're using? reply drpossum 7 minutes agorootparentI've unlearned over my years that trying to come up with what malicious actors can do under what scenarios and conditions isn't worth the effort, because they are many, know more than me, have different goals than me, and I am one. There's endless permutations of environments and additional weakness or scenarios or a particular sensitivity of information that you don't or can't consider that make some attack really painful. For this case, maybe CPU usage or aggregate changes in CPU usage tips off an attacker on what someone is ramping up internally that can be used for espionage or even timing attacks. What I have learned in place of that is plug holes to minimize attack vectors. therein 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's not necessarily true. reply pharrington 1 hour agorootparentprevis your local network google.com ? reply shreddit 1 hour agorootparentI can tell my pc what ca to trust, so yes i can make it to… reply mimon 34 minutes agorootparentSo if you can just trick someone into trusting a bogus root CA, take control of their DNS resolution, and get them to open an attacker controlled domain in Chrome then you can...

I always wondered how they do that. reply mmsc 1 hour agoprevAnd? Google uses Chrome to retrieve data about the user. Every Chromium-based browser has 'hidden' APIs only accessible on certain domains. That's how the custom (read: closed source) extensions work. \"Component extensions\" are used to interact with them normally: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/extens... See https://blogs.opera.com/security/2021/09/8000-bug-bounty-hig... and https://blogs.opera.com/security/2021/09/bug-bounty-guest-po... for examples of when there are vulnerabilities in those extensions, and how they can be abused for remote code execution. Any whitelisted domains for these APIs cannot be written to using user-installed extensions, in order for a malicious extension to not be able to inject a script and execute the special API. At Opera, we previously tried attacking the underlying implementation about how these 'hidden' APIs are accessible. Although we found a lot of Opera-specific issues, the Chromium logic seems sound and a \"bypass\" for other websites accessing the API is unlikely. It also seems that the developer here was just a bit overzealous in allowing this API to be accessed from all google.com subdomains. reply jhdifdhsak 1 hour agoparenttechnically correct. google chrome should forever be called \"Tainted Chromium\" to use the same nomenclature as the Linux Kernel when you load blobs. reply ethanppl 1 hour agoprevI wonder how Chromium, Brave or Edge handle this? reply newzisforsukas 1 hour agoparentIts in the chromium repo: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chr... https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chr... reply newzisforsukas 1 hour agorootparentYou also could probably block this with a policy file.

I have no idea what this is trying to say. Can anyone make sense of it? reply Loic 1 hour agoparentIf correct, once you access a `.google.com` website, the browser makes available through javascript an API allowing the querying of a lot of information about all the open tabs (if open, for example, your banking website) and can send the collected information to the \"mother ship\". If true, as usually, a lot of people have a Google tab open, you can easily deduct what it means. This is definitely something to be investigated, for the moment, we only have a tweet. reply josephcsible 1 hour agoparentprevhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chr... That API is baked into Google Chrome. It's hardcoded to only let google.com use it. reply jeffbee 1 hour agorootparentI don't think that is an accurate description. The APIs are available in Chrome to anyone: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/s... The allowlisting going on here is that normally when you install an extension in Chrome it asks you to confirm the access to those APIs on the sites where the extension wants to run, but this one comes pre-confirmed from the factory. A quick GitHub search finds ~1000 manifest files that list system.cpu, possibly because that API is also in the boilerplate example chrome extension manifest. reply josephcsible 1 hour agorootparentThat's still just as unfair, though. Google always has access to that information because their extension is preinstalled and you can't disable it, but other websites have no access to that information unless you go out of your way to install a third-party extension to do so. reply jeffbee 1 hour agorootparentOK. That's a point of view. I just thought it should be accurately described. I think the idea that you will download a web browser from Google and then it won't be able to figure out what model of CPU it is running on is a bit weird, when you think it through. There are lots of features of Chrome that are only \"available to Google\" for example it will only download updates from Google, unless you've modified its source code. reply IshKebab 1 hour agorootparentprevI mean... You downloaded the browser from Google.

Rye uses uv under the hood, so as we improve uv, Rye gets better too. E.g., we recently added support for \"universal\" resolution in uv, so you can generate a locked requirements.txt file with a single resolution that works on all platforms and operating systems (as opposed to _just_ the system you're running on). And Rye supports it too in the latest release. [1] https://github.com/astral-sh/uv --- I work on Rye and uv, if you have any questions :) reply smnrchrds 14 hours agoparentDoes Rye/UV with universal resolution work properly with PyTorch, or does it suffer from the same issue as Poetry? https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/6409 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39257501 reply catwell 11 hours agorootparentIt works properly with PyTorch. For what it's worth at $DAYJOB we switched from Poetry to Rye starting from version 0.15 (even before it supported uv) for that reason initially. reply smnrchrds 4 hours agorootparentThat is encouraging to hear. I am curious specifically about the universal resolution feature that has been newly added. Poetry's issue is that it cannot properly resolve PyTorch's more complicated situation. I imagine Rye before this change would have used pip under the hood, so it would have worked as well as pip. I hope this still holds with the new under-the-hood changes. reply arthur-st 10 hours agoparentprevAny ongoing work/plans to follow for cross-platform lock files? This is one concern that would prevent the team I'm on from moving. We do ML work, so I'll use a pytorch-based project for my example. The desired state is that all dependencies are in pyproject.toml, e.g., from which you can generate a set of lockfiles from an AArch64 Mac or an AMD64 Windows workstation for the following platform configurations: 1. Mac with default (MPS) pytorch 2. Windows with CUDA pytorch 3. AArch64 Linux with CPU pytorch 4. AMD64 Linux with CPU pytorch 5. AMD64 Linux with CUDA pytorch P.S. Big thanks for making Ruff, we're huge fans of linting and formatting both. reply LarsDu88 55 minutes agorootparentPoetry does cross platform lockfiles, but the absence of cross platform lockfiles is one of the reasons why uv benchmarks significantly faster (on top of using Rust for the resolve) reply arthur-st 7 hours agorootparentprevI guess I'll add that this is mostly possible using a Docker-based workflow, but the hope is that one day we could get something more lightweight. reply HelloNurse 6 hours agorootparentRequiring Docker implies that a packaging tool is too simplistic to do its job. reply arthur-st 6 hours agorootparentWell, that's my question - I'm not familiar with Rye/uv, and I'm curious to know if it can substantively simplify the workflows that I'm aware of. I simply clarified to pre-empt a potential comment about Docker. reply Terretta 7 hours agoparentprevYou have a lot of firms that care about predictable and performant building that are shifting to you, and one of the things that comes up is SBOM generation for ingestion into tools like guac. https://guac.sh/ https://pypi.org/project/sbom4python/ https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-python Your recently added ability to unpin dependencies so devs are more encouraged to stay compatible as they dev, then generate a correct explicit requirements.txt for reproducibility, makes both vuln management and the SBOM step a far easier thing than poetry etc. Thank you! For similar reasons, we use https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/why/ and appreciate that it plays nicely with `uv`. reply VagabundoP 12 hours agoparentprevGreat work. I've switched to using Rye now as I used to have to occasionally setup a new computer to work on a project and it was always a complete pain (pyenv+venv+pip). Now its: * Install Rye, * Pull from Github, * Type rye sync reply pen2l 12 hours agoparentprevGiven that you guys are in charge of both uv and rye, why keep two alive at the same time? Why not just kill rye now to avoid fragmentation, and confusion that comes with the burden of having to choose between the two? reply the_mitsuhiko 11 hours agorootparentUV doesn’t do all these things yet. The end goal is that UV can fully replace Rye and a neat migration will be provided so that one can move over. Since Rye already uses uv behind the scenes there won’t be a lot of incompatibilities to deal with so the migration should be trivial. reply semi-extrinsic 6 hours agorootparentI love Rye, especially with UV, and we are rolling it out where I work. Question: are there any plans to add sandboxing support to Rye or UV? I realize it is a big ask and that it might not be possible on all platforms. My dream scenario is that I can define a section in pyproject.toml that goes like [sandbox] allowed_urls = [...] allowed_dirs = [\".\",...] and then \"rye run\" wraps the executed code in a sandbox which forbids the code to access anything outside those two whitelists. This would make me sleep so much better at night, as it solves 99% of my supply chain attack fears. And it's lightweight enough from the user side that it will actually be used. reply the_mitsuhiko 5 hours agorootparentNo plans. That said, independently I have been thinking about this quite a bit since Deno has demonstrated that there is interest in stuff like that. Unfortunately to make that work in Python would require significant changes to Python itself. reply semi-extrinsic 3 hours agorootparentWhat I'm thinking about would technically be language independent, just a wrapper that is interposed between Rye and the Python interpreter to apply something like a seccomp filter to the Python interpreter (and all code that it calls). The wrapper could equally well be used on a piece of C code or whatever. But I'm sure you have a far better understanding than me of whether something like that is feasible :) reply rangerelf 2 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds like a job for \"firejail\", at least in linux. Implementing that as part of python would be a major undertaking, and I wouldn't necessarily trust it, I'd prefer an external tool implement the sandbox. reply VWWHFSfQ 5 hours agorootparentprevIs there a technology in existence that would facilitate this from userspace and wouldn't require elevated kernel privileges to set caps? reply semi-extrinsic 5 hours agorootparentFrom my cursory googling, I believe seccomp on Linux is one way to achieve this. See e.g. Cloudflare's \"sandbox\" wrapper: https://github.com/cloudflare/sandbox FWICT, it's not possible to achieve something like this reliably on Windows natively, but maybe in WSL it could work. On Mac, there is the similar libsecinit aka App Sandbox which also can be spawned from a userspace process, I think? Of course in every case the program spawning the sandbox has to be outside the sandbox. But having to trust Rye or UV is much better than having to trust thousands of \"RandomDevsNichePythonPackage\". reply rfoo 11 hours agorootparentprevIIUC, uv is a replacement for pip (?), and rye is for pyenv+poetry. reply baggiponte 11 hours agorootparentIn the end, uv will be the pyenv + poetry replacement, and supersede rye. reply Joeboy 11 hours agorootparentSo which should I use for a new project, as of July 2024? reply sali0 10 hours agorootparentRye is perfectly fine to use as of now. It uses uv under the hood anyway, but has some niceties of its own. reply remram 1 hour agorootparentFor example? reply kzrdude 4 hours agorootparentprevI would use Uv - if you can handle that it's a moving target right now. (uv python, uv lock, uv sync and so on, and in pyproject tool.uv.sources). All preview features that replace similar Rye features with a more robust implementation. reply PufPufPuf 10 hours agorootparentprevPoetry. reply VagabundoP 8 hours agorootparentprevI would. reply timothylaurent 2 hours agoparentprevI assume this \"Universal\" resolution is enabled by adding the \"--universal\" cli argument? It doesn't look like this is currently documented but I found some hints in the release notes. reply germandiago 8 hours agoparentprevHow does it compare to Pipenv and Poetry? I had some problems every time I used Poetry. I wanted to like it but it hanged or took forever and similar things often. reply VagabundoP 8 hours agorootparentSo dep resolution is fast with uv. Setting up a new project is: rye init && rye sync Adding a dep is: rye add flask && rye sync You can pin your python version in the pyproject.toml Migrating from an established project is a little hard than it should be. Importing the requirements.txt into the pyproject.toml is not a good idea as uv gets itself in a twist with all the low-level dependencies that exist in the requirements.txt. I've never tried it with a poetry made pyproject.toml, report back if you try it. On the whole its a good experience, fast and straight forward. reply andybak 3 hours agorootparent> Importing the requirements.txt into the pyproject.toml is not a good idea as uv gets itself in a twist with all the low-level dependencies that exist in the requirements.txt. Can you explain? I wonder if you mean \"requirements.txt generated via pip freeze\" rather than \"a human curated requirements.txt\" reply VagabundoP 3 hours agorootparentYeah you're right. If you just keep the requirements.txt \"high level\" then you should be okay. Just my experience with uv hanging for ages with a pip freeze made requirements file. reply vaylian 13 hours agoparentprev> I work on Rye and uv, if you have any questions :) How do you pronounce \"uv\"? reply crucialfelix 12 hours agorootparentRhymes with bruv. London pronunciation reply batisteo 12 hours agorootparentNo idea how a londonian prononces bruv. How about IPA? reply welpo 12 hours agorootparent/bɹʌv/ reply satvikpendem 8 hours agorootparentprevLike the American pronunciation of \"of\". reply zanie 4 hours agorootparentprevWe say \"you - vee\" :) reply fire_lake 14 hours agoparentprevHow can you generate a universal lock file when some packages will query the running system in arbitrary ways during resolution? reply jvolkman 14 hours agorootparentMost packages don't do that. You can get really far by assuming that all of a package's wheels have the same set of dependencies (maybe using environment markers), and that its sdist always returns the same list of dependencies (also maybe using environment markers). No, it's not perfect, but it's also what Poetry and PDM do as far as I know. reply charliermarsh 13 hours agorootparentYeah that's right -- we make the assumption that all distributions for a given package will yield the same dependencies, similar to Poetry, PDM, and other tools. This is not strictly required by the standards, but it's very rare for it to be violated. reply hobofan 10 hours agorootparentIt's rare, but in my experience it can still be very impactful and hindering adoption. E.g. that practice seems to be quite prevalent in a few high-profile pytorch packages, which caused our team a lot of pain when trying to enable reproducible cross-platform builds 1-2 years ago reply fire_lake 9 hours agorootparentIndeed. I gave up on this and just build in Docker. reply crabbone 3 hours agoparentprevI like how you ignore the \"best practices\" for packaging created by PyPA (i.e project.toml and friends) and just do requirements.txt cowboy stuff. Don't get me wrong, both are hilariously bad, but I like to see more chaos in Python infrastructure. You pushing against PyPA (rightfully) delegitimizes them. reply ipsum2 14 hours agoparentprevWhat's the relationship between uv and uvloop? reply Leynos 13 hours agorootparentNone. \"UV\" was chosen because it is short and available. reply boffinAudio 9 hours agorootparentHow is it available if libuv? reply ziml77 1 hour agorootparentThey probably mean that it didn't conflict with other common executables. I guess it could be a problem if libuv ever includes an executable called uv, though I can't imagine how it would make sense for libuv to have an executable component like that. reply Apreche 16 hours agoprevThe thing that put me off of Rye is that it strongly encourages you to use non-standard Python builds. From their philosophy page: https://rye.astral.sh/philosophy/ > No Python Binary Distributions: CPython builds from python.org are completely inadequate. On some platforms you only get an .msi installer, on some you literally only get tarballs. The various Python distributions that became popular over the years are diverging greatly and cause all kinds of nonsense downstream. This is why this Project uses the indygreg standalone builds. I hope that with time someone will start distributing well maintained and reliable Python builds to replace the mess we are dealing with today. And here is info about those particular indygreg builds. https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/ It is, however, possible to choose a different Python. https://rye.astral.sh/guide/toolchains/ I've never really experienced the problem they are describing. Any official Python build I've gotten from python.org has worked. Every normal old Python I've gotten from my distribution's package manager has worked. Every Python included with an official Docker container image has worked. I'm sure their special builds will also work just fine, but their non-standardness gives me pause. There's even a list of behavior quirks. Why are we adding quirks to something that has no problems? And the fact that the rye philosophy seems so intent on using them, turns me off from it compared to the alternatives that sensibly default to using the Python you already have available on your OS. reply oconnor663 16 hours agoparentI'm just guessing, but I imagine the scenario goes like this: 1. Work at a company that runs some ancient version of CentOS or something. 2. The system package manager doesn't have anything newer than Python 3.6. 3. Official binaries from python.org print an inscrutable error about the glibc version when you try to run them. 4. Building Python from source requires some new system dependencies, takes forever, and then produces an even less scrutable error about a missing header file. 5. Googling that error leads to a ./configure flag that works around the issue, which upstream GCC fixed in 2017. 6. Success? If you haven't seen that error #3 before, or dealt with \"manylinux\" build environments, you've dodged an entire world of pain. The same goes for scripting installs on Windows, and for the part of that page that's talking about \"limiting the CPU instructions that can be used\" :') reply staticautomatic 13 hours agorootparentThe scenario might also go something like this: 1.

On my desktop wiki, the most important section about Python is the one that contains the incantations required to compile SSL, setting myriad of variables and using pyenv to build a newer (3.10/3.11/3.12) Python. reply swells34 13 hours agorootparentI've run into #3 quite often in embedded Linux projects, especially when dealing with the Jetson ecosystem where upgrading to a modern Python is a nightmare due to all the specialized hardware. Glad to see I'm not the only one who runs into this. reply flurie 14 hours agoparentprevPython building, packaging and deployment has two extreme states: the king's highway and the hall of a thousand knives. If the portable Python suggestions do not make sense to you, then consider yourself lucky, because you have managed to stick to the highway. reply ttyprintk 4 hours agorootparentBest of the thousand knives I think is `shiv`. Produces one big artifact which self-installs without colliding with other runtimes on the system. reply metadat 15 hours agoparentprevI regularly download the python source code, compile it with standard prod optimizations, then install to /use/local/python${version}. This works extremely consistently since python 3.7 (released in 2018). In my experience, these commands are so stable and consistent they could be automated away. What might the author's issue or underlying protest be? reply rtpg 13 hours agorootparentI've also compiled python from source a good amount, and it usually works... until some thing where I realize some standard lib wasn't compiled because I was missing an optional dependency. But some lib assumes that it was always included cuz the standard distro is. I think it's easy to compile Python, but it's easy to end up just having to go re-compile it for some random component that was not compiled in the \"standard\" fashion. If you have a good test suite this stuff shows up quite loudly though. At one point the core issue is more collaborators wanting to not have to compile things themselves. (And to \"automating away\" as a comment... indygreg's releases _are_ this! Someone has done the work for us all) reply Hamuko 12 hours agorootparent>And to \"automating away\" as a comment... indygreg's releases _are_ this! They most definitely are not. There's a world of difference between downloading a portable Python build and building one on your own machine, and C extensions can give you a world of trouble when they start referencing paths that are not on your machine, but rather were on the CI machine that built your static build. The FAQ even has a big section that boils down to \"There's a bunch of paths included in these builds that will not make sense to consumers and we don't have a way to fix it.\" reply VagabundoP 12 hours agorootparentprevlol readline I'm looking at you. reply Hamuko 13 hours agorootparentprevDoesn't pyenv basically do that automating away? I don't think I've ever had issues compiling Python using pyenv. reply the_mitsuhiko 11 hours agorootparentThere is also a world of windows out there. Compiling Python from scratch is not a ton of fun there. Rye wants to have a very consistent experience for everybody. reply robertlagrant 9 hours agorootparentOne of the key benefits of Python is it's very easy to motivate for getting a Mac or Linux laptop from IT when you use it :) reply krageon 7 hours agorootparentPython is a nightmare to use on those platforms as well. It's one of my favourite languages, but I have (until now I guess) started avoiding it like the plague for anything important or distributable because of the actual hell that is dealing with it in production. reply robertlagrant 7 hours agorootparentWhat actual hell in production have you experienced? I'm curious! reply metadat 13 hours agorootparentprevNo idea what that is, the standard distribution is so easy to work with I don't need anything else. reply rat87 12 hours agorootparentprevI've had a ton of issues with pyenv and using pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv/poetry that were fixed by moving to rye reply IshKebab 12 hours agorootparentprevWell an obvious issue is that you have to do that! Also I think a big issue is the inconsistency between platforms. For example the official Python installed doesn't include python3.exe (frankly because the devs are idiots), but the one from the Microsoft app store does! If you stay on one platform you wouldn't see those issues. reply selcuka 14 hours agoparentprev> No Python Binary Distributions: CPython builds from python.org are completely inadequate. On some platforms you only get an .msi installer, on some you literally only get tarballs.

They also cannot be placed in any location other than the dedicated framework location which often causes issues for people who do not expect specific versions to be installed. Quite often installing the macOS builds of Python breaks other tools that expect a different version to be there. I’m glad regular Python versions work for you, and you can register them with Rye. That’s very intentionally supported. The goal of rye is to reach higher. It wants to see how close we can get to an experience you can get from node or Rust. That includes getting access to Python itself. I have been programming Python since 2.2 and have helped countless of people over the years with their Python challenges. From mentoring to tutoring to just helping on IRC and other places. So many times people had a completely broken Python installation or ran into compilation errors. Even pyenv ships patches to make Python compile cleanly in some cases. The indygreg builds have issues, no doubt about it. In an ideal world the PSF would distribute portable Python builds for all platforms. reply yellowapple 15 hours agoparentprevI do like that Rye's Python builds apparently use libedit instead of readline.

It makes the whole venv/Python-version/packaging process actually pleasant, and it’s invisible to someone used to Python-official usage (pyproject.toml et al). And it makes Python feel like Cargo, which is a great thing to work with too. reply leontrolski 12 hours agoparentIf like me, you've ignored poetry and friends and stuck with pip-tools (congrats!), uv (used by rye internally) is a drop in replacement. IMHO pip-tools was always the far nicer design than poetry, pipenv etc as it was orthogonal to both pip and virtualenv (both of which have been baked into Python for many years now). I would argue Rye is the iterative, standards compliant approach winning out. Beyond the speedups from Rust, it's nice to have some opinionated takes on where to put virtualenvs (.venv) and how to install different Python versions. It sounds small, but since wheels fixed numpy installs, sane defaults for these and a baked in pip-tools is basically all that was missing.

I hate doing this, but the solution is to reduce the search space for poetry to find a compatible version. Verbosely install with poetry (-vvv) and note the package it gets stuck on. Find the currently installed version from the lock file and specify it as the minimum in your pyproject.toml file.

Rye also manages your python version by downloading a version and with a less finicky setup the pipenvs/pipenv virtualenv shell scripts(which take longer and are less reliable because they compile python from source instead of downloading it). As someone who has had to deal with his teams python setup. Installing poetry and pipenv and compiling Python automatically on every users machine is a lot more finicky in practice. Plus poetry wasn't just much slower sometimes locking took many minutes to finish appearing to lock up. There's also rye install/rye tool install works like pipx, install tools in a silo-ed virtualenv with a run file in the rye dir you've already added to $PATH (it also has parameters to pass in extra parameters such as installing db packages for slaacodegen, and optionally exposing their executables on your path). It bundles other tools from astral ie ruff which is the new hotness for python linting /auto formatting/import sorting that's also fast/written in rust. I feel with rye/uv/ruff astral is finally making progress towards a fast useful all in one python package Manager/tool like cargo.

The recommendation nowadays is to use Mamba (iirc), but in my experience (a few years old now) it's been unstable and unable to find package solves which worked on my system / our cluster. I've settled on just using Poetry for most things, and then using pip in a venv to install the pyproject.toml file from Poetry either in a Dockerfile or directly on a cluster. That's worked fairly well so far, even with torch/cuda (and the mess of CUDA versioning) and from macOS to Linux. I think uv/rye is a good next step, Poetry can be a bit slow as well at times. reply thrdbndndn 12 hours agorootparentIt IS slow, no argument there, but I never find the speed of a package management tool too important. Maybe it's different for other ecosystem such as node etc., but when I'm doing research in ML I config my project mostly just once and do the bulk work (install cuda pytorch etc.), later it's mostly just activate and occasionally add some util packages via pip.

And use it just to create python envs, and sync dependencies. Honestly, the biggest time-saver for me has been Rye automatically fetching python binaries that work everywhere, and setting up clean venvs. - https://rye.astral.sh/guide/virtual/ reply benrutter 10 hours agoparentprevRye is a python only thing, and if you're using python without any external dependencies, it probably doesn't have that much benefit (although it does make having different python versions for different projects a lot cleaner if you need that). I think that it has a huuuuge benefit for applications as well as libraries. Rye generates lock files, which are really handy for pinning down versions of something running in production so that it'll behave predictably. reply wodenokoto 7 hours agorootparentI am using external dependencies I’m just usually not packaging my project. reply ttyprintk 4 hours agoparentprevSome OSes need shims to easily call scripts on the command line.

Whatever it does, it sidesteps almost all the other footguns I have encountered with local pythons. on the other hand, I've found Go to be meaningfully superior for many things, and Rust to be meaningfully superior for many other things, and Scala excellent for the JVM and I simply can't actually recommend other languages for professional greenfield work outside of exceptionally niche cases. reply MaximilianEmel 12 hours agoprevWhy should I use this over Miniconda? reply riwsky 13 hours agoprev“There should be one, and preferably only one, obvious way to do it—xor it’s packaging” reply _ZeD_ 12 hours agoprevwhat do rye offers to a pdm-based project? https://pdm-project.org/ reply 1attice 16 hours agoprev[context: honest question from occasional Python user] What's wrong with poetry? reply 3PS 14 hours agoparentPoetry has two flaws imo: 1. It's written in Python, which makes it slower and prone to bootstrapping issues. 2. It doesn't manage your Python installation, which necessitates the use of a tool like pyenv. Rye sidesteps both of those by (a) being written in Rust and (b) trying to solve all of the problems solved by poetry and pyenv in one go. reply noisy_boy 13 hours agorootparentI like that it doesn't manage the python/venv installation. E.g. rye creates a .venv for every project and in case of packages that are large, that starts to add up as more projects are added. With poetry, I can separately create a \"common\" virtualenv which I can use with bunch of throwaway projects; this is of course assuming that the version requirements of these projects do not clash - if they do, I can always create another virtualenv. With rye, I activated a virtualenv and then created a new project, it proceeded to setup its own .venv within the project instead of just using the one that was already activated. reply rtpg 13 hours agorootparentI would like for more venv sharing, but rye is leaning heavily into correctness, which (in the current Python universe) is much easier to do by recreating the world. reply Kwpolska 12 hours agorootparentprevI would consider both of those flaws of Rye, not Poetry. Python package managers not written in Python will by definition have less contributors, and to me, they make Python look like a toy language (you can't write a package manager, a fairly trivial program with the exception of dependency management, in Python - what can you write then?) As for managing Pythons, I would consider this to be orthogonal to packaging, and the default system Python is often good enough. reply the_mitsuhiko 11 hours agorootparentThe problem with Python for such tools is not so much the speed but that it’s hard to distribute and bootstrap. reply thelastbender12 12 hours agorootparentprevI think this is a fine opinion, we like tools that do exactly how much we want them to. But I'd suggest setting up python (and virtual envs) was actually a big headache for a lot of newer users, and some of the old ones (me that is). I also don't see why leaning into python being a wrapper around rust/cpp/c is a bad thing. Each language has its own niche and packaging/bootstrapping is more of a systems level language problem. reply theusus 16 hours agoparentprevDoes it automatically install and setup the required Python version for the project? reply VagabundoP 12 hours agorootparentYes. You choose a standard version (usually the latest stable 3.12 currently) that it downloads at setup or it downloads and sets up the pinned version from your pyproject.toml. reply agoose77 6 hours agoparentprevhttps://iscinumpy.dev/post/poetry-versions/ reply zie 15 hours agoparentprevIf poetry works for you, it's fine. It works great 90+% of the time for me and I found it before rye or hatch or whatever, so I use it too. Eventually it will either have to adopt to the new standards as they firm up or it will probably get left in the dust, but that's fine. Hopefully if/when that happens something like rye will be mature and boring and well supported everywhere instead. The latest tools are not always the best tools, old and boring, as long as they work for you are perfectly fine. reply sghiassy 16 hours agoparentprevIt doesn’t work consistently across environments reply 1attice 16 hours agorootparentCould you explain futher?

In short, it's a good facade. Also, the CLI tooling doesn't even depend on using Hatchling as a build system, which is an understated benefit. Unless one's got a particularly weird use case where they actually need to know the ins and outs of PEP 517 (Maturin/PyO3 with system specific dependencies, for example) it is going to be completely fine for the vast majority of packages with minimal additional configuration. reply kzrdude 4 hours agoparentHatch is very featureful and achieves a lot, but for me, a lot of the defaults and how it's configured is entirely backwards from what I expect. I've concluded it is not for me. My concrete suggestion is that Hatch would be better for me if it was developed by a team and not a single person. Then its core ideas would be judged by multiple people from different angles. As it is now, it's written to the taste and philosophy of a single author. reply darkteflon 13 hours agoparentprevI’ve used both Hatch and Rye extensively. Hatch is great, but currently lacks monorepo support (it is expected to be added by the Autumn). I do like the way that Rye bootstraps itself, the dependency resolver does seem to be much faster, I like that you get updated pip lockfiles on every sync, and it already has opinionated monorepo support. Getting a new developer spun up is as easy as “rye sync”. But I agree that the fact that Hatch is under the auspices of the PyPA is persuasive indeed. Rye for some reason requires that you put dev dependencies under a non-standard key in pyproject.toml, but other than that, it’s pretty trivial to swap between Hatch and Rye as you like (which was indeed one of the primary goals of PEP621 afaiu). I for one will certainly be checking in on Hatch again when monorepo support is added. reply ofek 5 hours agorootparentWorkspaces is unblocked now, it depended on a large refactor which has now been merged: https://github.com/pypa/hatch/pull/1602 In my free time, it's the only thing I'm working on! reply ttyprintk 4 hours agorootparentAwesome, thank you.

There's a few bits I don't like in uv, but I intend to submit patches soon. The one thing I think sets these projects back is the naming. Rye, uv... They just aren't as good names as pip, pip-tools, venv etc. This could make it harder to convince people of their legitimacy. But I could be wrong, maybe they will succeed based on their merits. A \"Cargo for Python\" I find a bit misleading. Python is very different to Rust and upon learning Rust I didn't find anything that I hadn't already got in all my Python work.

If you like to code interstitial (in those quiet moments between your day job) and hot desk and have a multi platform environment its pain to just use those tool and setup for each new place - I code on Windows (+wsl), MacOS and linux sometimes. I uses github privately to sync everything. Its just me. Rye is much quick to get started on a machine; install rye+git etc, pull project from git, rye sync.

    "originBody": "PySkyWiFi: completely free, unbelievably stupid wi-fi on long-haul flights 09 Jul 2024 The plane reached 10,000ft. I took out my laptop, planning to peruse the internet and maybe do a little work if I got really desperate. I connected to the in-flight wi-fi and opened my browser. The network login page demanded credit card details. I fumbled for my card, which I eventually discovered had hidden itself inside my passport. As I searched I noticed that the login page was encouraging me to sign in to my airmiles account, free of charge, even though I hadn’t paid for anything yet. A hole in the firewall, I thought. It’s a long way from London to San Francisco so I decided to peer through it. I logged in to my JetStreamers Diamond Altitude account and started clicking. I went to my profile page, where I saw an edit button. It looked like a normal button: drop shadow, rounded corners, nothing special. I was supposed to use it to update my name, address, and so on. But suddenly I realised that this was no ordinary button. This clickable rascal would allow me to access the entire internet through my airmiles account. This would be slow. It would be unbelievably stupid. But it would work. Several co-workers were asking me to review their PRs because my feedback was “two weeks late” and “blocking a critical deployment.” But my ideas are important too so I put on my headphones and smashed on some focus tunes. I’d forgotten to charge my headphones so Limp Bizkit started playing out of my laptop speakers. Fortunately no one else on the plane seemed to mind so we all rocked out together. Before I could access the entire internet through my airmiles account I’d need to write a few prototypes. At first I thought that I’d write them using Go, but then I realised that if I used Python then I could call the final tool PySkyWiFi. Obviously I did that instead. Prototype 1: Instant Messaging Here’s the basic idea: suppose that I logged into my airmiles account and updated my name. If you were also logged in to my account then you could read my new name, from the ground. You could update it again, and I could read your new value. If we kept doing this then the name field of my airmiles account could serve as a tunnel through the airplane’s wi-fi firewall to the real world. This tunnel could support a simple instant messaging protocol. I could update my name to “Hello how are you.” You could read my message and then send me a reply by updating my name again to “Im fine how are you.” I could read that, and we could have a stilted conversation. This might not sound like much, but it would be the first step on the road to full internet access. I paid for the internet on my old laptop. I hadn’t finished migrating my data off this computer, so it still had to come everywhere with me. I messaged my wife to ask her to help me with my experiments. no, what are you talking about, i'm busy she replied, lovingly. So instead I took out my new laptop, which still had no internet access. I created a test airmiles account and logged into it on both computers. I found that I could indeed chat with myself by updating the name field in the UI. Computer2 Airmiles Account Name Field Computer1 Computer2 Airmiles Account Name Field Computer1 TYPE: Hello how are you READ: Hello how are you TYPE: Im fine how are you READ: Im fine how are you This was a lousy user experience though. So I wrote a command line tool to automate it. My tool asked the user for a message, and then behind the scenes it logged into my airmiles account via the website, using my credentials. The tool updated the name field of my test account with the user’s message. It then polled the name field every few seconds to see if my account’s name had changed again, which would indicate that the other person had sent a message back. Once the tool detected a new value it printed that value and asked the user for their next reply, and so on. Airmiles Account Name Field Airmiles Account Name Field Me You (poll for new data) (no new data) WRITE: Hello how are you (poll for new data) READ: Hello how are you (poll for new data) (no new data) WRITE: Im fine how are you (poll for new data) READ: Im fine how are you Me You Using this tool I could chat with someone on the ground, via my terminal. I wouldn’t have to pay for wifi, and neither of us would have to know or care that the messages were being sent via my SkyVenture Premium Gold Rewards account. I still needed to find someone who would chat with me. But this was a good start! NB: at this point I didn’t want to send any more automated data through my airmiles account in case that got me in trouble somehow. Nothing I was doing could possibly cause any damage, but some companies get jumpy about this kind of thing. I therefore proved to myself that PySkyWiFi would work on my airmiles accounts too by updating my name ten or so times in quick succession. They all succeeded, which suggested to me that my airmiles account probably wasn’t rate-limiting the speed or number of requests I could send to it. I then wrote the rest of my code by sending my data through friendly services like GitHub Gists and local files on my computer, using the same principles as if I were sending it through an airmiles account. If PySkyWiFi worked through GitHub then it would work through my Star Power UltimateBlastOff account too. This had the secondary advantage of being much faster and easier for iteration too. I’m going to keep talking about sending data through an airmiles account, because that’s the point I’m trying to make. Prototype 2: Live headlines, stock prices, and football scores The tunnel I’d constructed through my airmiles account would be useful for more than IMing. For my next prototype I wrote a program that would run on a computer back at my house or in the cloud, and would automatically send information from the real world up to me on the plane, through my airmiles account. I could deploy it before I left for my next flight and have it send me the latest stock prices or football scores while I was in the sky. To do this I wrote a daemon that would run on a computer that was on the ground and connected to the internet. The daemon constantly polled the name field in my airmiles account, looking for structured messages that I sent to it from the plane (such as STOCKPRICE: APPL or SCORE: MANUNITED). When the daemon saw a new request it parsed it, retrieved the requested information using the relevant API, and sent it back to me via my airmiles account. It worked perfectly. Now I could use my first prototype to send IMs through my airmiles account, and I could use my second prototype tio follow the markets and the sports. It was time to squeeze the entire internet through my airmiles account. The real thing: PySkyWiFi During the rest of the flight I wrote PySkyWiFi. PySkyWiFi is a highly simplified version of the TCP/IP protocol that squeezes whole HTTP requests through an airmiles account, out of the plane, and down to a computer connected to the internet on the ground. A daemon running on this ground computer makes the HTTP requests for me, and then finally squeezes the completed HTTP responses back through my airmiles account, up to me on my plane. This meant that on my next flight I could technically have full access to the internet, via my airmiles account. Depending on network conditions on the plane I might be able to hit speeds of several bytes per second. DISCLAIMER: you obviously shouldn’t actually do any of this Here’s how it works (and here’s the source code). How PySkyWiFi works PySkyWiFi has two components: The sky proxy - a proxy that runs on your laptop, on a plane The ground daemon - a daemon that runs on a computer connected to the internet, at your home on the ground or in the cloud Here’s a simplified diagram: example.com Ground Daemon Airmiles Account Sky Proxy example.com Ground Daemon Airmiles Account Sky Proxy Me HTTP request HTTP request HTTP request HTTP request HTTP response HTTP response HTTP response HTTP response Me Setup starts before you leave your house. First you start up the ground daemon. Then you get a taxi to the airport, get on the plane, and connect to the plane’s wi-fi network. You boot up the sky proxy on your laptop. Your PySkyWiFi relay is now ready to go. You use a tool like curl to make an HTTP request to the sky proxy that you’ve started on your laptop. You address your request to the proxy (eg. localhost:1234/) and you put the actual URL that you want to query inside a custom HTTP header called X-PySkyWiFi. For example: curl localhost:1234 -H \"X-PySkyWiFi: example.com\"` The X-PySkyWiFi header will be stripped by the ground daemon and used to route your request to your target website. Everything else about the request (including the body and other headers) will be forwarded exactly as-is. Once you make your request it will hang for several minutes. If by some miracle nothing breaks then you’ll eventually get back an HTTP response, exactly as if you’d sent the request over the normal internet like a normal person. The only difference is that it didn’t cost you anything. You will now almost certainly pay for wi-fi, because your curiosity has been satisfied and your time on this earth is very short. Step-by-step Here’s what happens behind the scenes: example.com Ground Daemon Airmiles Account 2 Name Field Airmiles Account 1 Name Field Sky Proxy example.com Ground Daemon Airmiles Account 2 Name Field Airmiles Account 1 Name Field Sky Proxy Repeat until the whole HTTP request has been transferred Repeat until the whole HTTP response has been transferred Me curl localhost:1234 -H \"X-PySkYWiFi: example.com\" Write request chunk 1 (poll for new data) Read request chunk 1 Ack request chunk 1 (poll for new data) Read ack for request chunk 1 Write request chunk 2 (poll for new data) Read request chunk 2 GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: example.comHTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/htmlWrite response chunk 1 (poll for new data) Read response chunk 1 Ack request chunk 1 (poll for new data) Read ack for request chunk 1 Write response chunk 2 (poll for new data) Read response chunk 2 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/htmlMe In order: The sky proxy receives the HTTP request from your curl call. It splits the request into chunks, because the entire request is too large to fit into you airmiles account in one go The sky proxy writes each chunk one-by-one to the name field in your airmiles account. The ground daemon polls your airmiles account. When it detects that the name field has changed to a new chunk, it reads that chunk and sends an acknowledgement to the sender so that the sender knows it’s safe to send the next chunk. The receiver sticks the chunks back together and rebuilds the original HTTP request Once the ground daemon has received and rebuilt the full HTTP request, it sends the request out over the internet. The ground daemon receives an HTTP response. The ground daemon sends the HTTP response up to the sky proxy using the same process as before, in reverse. This time the ground daemon splits the HTTP response up into chunks and writes each chunk one-by-one to the name field in your airmiles account (it actually writes these response chunks using a second airmiles account to make the protocol simpler) The sky proxy polls the second airmiles account. It reads each chunk and sticks them back together to rebuild the HTTP response The sky proxy returns the HTTP response to the original call to curl. As far as curl is concerned this is a perfectly normal HTTP response, just a little slow. curl has no idea about the silliness that just transpired The sky proxy and the ground daemon are relatively simple: they send HTTP requests and parse HTTP responses. The magic is in how they squeeze these requests and responses through an airmiles account. Let’s look closer. Squeezing HTTP requests through an airmiles account PySkyWiFi’s communication logic is split into two layers: a transport layer, and a network layer. The transport layer’s job is to decide what data clients should send to each other. It dictates how senders should split up long messages into manageable chunks, as well as how senders and receivers should signal information like “I am ready to receive another chunk.” The PySkyWiFi transport layer is somewhat similar to the TCP protocol that powers much of the internet, if you squint very hard and don’t know much about TCP. By contrast, the network layer’s job is to actually send data between clients, once the transport protocol has decided what that data should be. It’s vaguely similar to the IP protocol, if you squint even harder and know even less what you’re talking about. This division of responsibility between layers is useful because the transport layer doesn’t have to care about how the network layer sends its data, and the network layer doesn’t care what the data it sends means or where it came from. The transport layer just hands the network layer some data, and the network layer sends it however it likes. This separation makes it easy to add support for new airmiles platforms, because all we have to do is implement a new network layer that reads and writes to the new type of airmiles account. This separation also allows us to write test versions of the network protocol that write and read from local files instead of airmiles accounts. In each case the network layer changes, but the transport layer stays exactly the same. Here’s how they work. The transport layer A PySkyWiFi transport connection between two clients consists of two “pipes” (or “airmiles accounts”). Each client has a “SEND” pipe that it can write data to, and a “RECV” pipe that it can read from. Clients write to their SEND pipe by writing data to it, and they read from their RECV pipe by constantly polling it and seeing if anything has changed. Client1 Client2 From the transport layer’s point of view, a pipe is just something that it can write and read data from. Beyond that the transport layer doesn’t care how its pipes work. At any given moment a PSWF (PySkYWiFi) client can only either send or receive data, but not both. A client in send mode will not see data sent by the other client, and a client in receive mode should never send data because the other client won’t see it. This is unlike TCP, where clients can send or receive data at ay time. When squeezing HTTP requests and responses through an airmiles account, the sky proxy sends the first message and the ground daemon receives it. Once the sky proxy has finished sending its HTTP request it switches to receive mode and the ground daemon switches to send. The ground daemon makes the HTTP request and sends back the response, at which point the two switch roles again so that the sky proxy can send another HTTP request. How are long messages sent through such a small pipe? PSWF uses small pipes (such as an airmiles name field) that can’t fit much data in them at once. This means that it takes some work and care to squeeze long messages (like HTTP requests) through them. To send a long message, the sender first splits up their message into chunks that will fit into their SEND pipe. They then send each chunk down the pipe one at a time. To begin a message, a sender starts by sending its first chunk of message data inside a DATA segment: A DATA segment consists of: The letter D The sequence number of the chunk (a number that uniquely identifies the chunk, padded to 6 digits) The actual chunk of data. For example, a data segment in the middle of a message might read: D000451adline\": \"Mudslide in Wigan causes m Once the sender has sent a DATA segment, it pauses. It wants to send its next DATA segment, but it can’t overwrite the airmiles account name field until it knows that the receiver has received and processed the previous one. The receiver tells the sender that it’s safe for to send a new DATA segment by acknowledging every segment that it reads. The receiver does this by writing an ACK segment to its own SEND pipe: An ACK segment consists of: The letter A The sequence number of the segment that is being acknowledged (padded to 6 digits) For example: A000451 The sender is constantly polling its own RCV pipe to check for changes, and so it reads this new ACK segment promptly. Once the sender reads the ACK, it knows that the receiver has received the segment corresponding to the ACK’s sequence number. For example, if a sender receives an ACK segment with sequence number 000451, the sender knows that it’s safe to send the next DATA segment with sequence number 000452. The sender therefore pulls the next chunk from its message and constructs a new DATA segment using this chunk and sequence number. The sender writes the new segment to its SEND pipe, and then pauses waits for another ACK. This loop continues until the sender has sent all the data in its message. To tell the recipient that it’s finished, the sender sends an END segment. An END segment is just the letter E. When a receiver sees an END segment it knows that the sender’s message is over. The sender and the receiver swap roles. The old sender starts polling its RECV pipe for DATA segments, and the old receiver starts chunking up its response message and sending it through its pipe, exactly as before. None of this transport logic cares about the details of the network layer through which the segments are sent. The transport layer just needs the network layer to provide two pipes that it can read and write to. The network layer can pipe this data around via local files, a Discord profile, or an airmiles account. This genericness is what allows PySkyWiFi to work with any airline’s airmiles account, so long as the airline allows you to login to it from the plane without paying. Here’s how PSWF uses transport protocol segments to exchange long messages: robertheaton.com Ground Daemon Airmiles Account 2 Name Field Airmiles Account 1 Name Field Sky Proxy robertheaton.com Ground Daemon Airmiles Account 2 Name Field Airmiles Account 1 Name Field Sky Proxy Repeat until the whole HTTP request has been transferred Repeat until the whole HTTP response has been transferred Me curl localhost:1234 -H \"X-PySkYWiFi: robertheaton.com\" Write DATA segment sequence number=000000: contents=`GET / HTTP/1.1 X-PySkyW` (poll for new data) Read DATA segment sequence number=000000: contents=`GET / HTTP/1.1 X-PySkyW` Write ACK segment sequence number=000000 (poll for new data) Read ACK segment sequence number=000000 Write DATA segment sequence number=000001 contents=`iFi: www.robertheaton.co` (poll for new data) Read DATA segment sequence number=000001 contents=`iFi: www.robertheaton.co` GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: robertheaton.comHTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/html, charset=UTF-8Write DATA segment sequence number=000000 contents=HTTP/1.1 200 OKCont (poll for new data) Read DATA segment sequence number=000000 contents=HTTP/1.1 200 OKCont Write ACK segment sequence number=000000 (poll for new data) Read ACK segment sequence number=000000 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/html, charset=UTF-8Me The transport layer decides what data the clients should send each other, but it doesn’t say anything about how they should send it. That’s where the network protocol comes in. The network layer The network layer’s job is to send data between clients. It doesn’t care about where the data came from or what it means; it just receives some data from the transport layer and sends it to the other client (typically via an airmiles account). This means that the network layer is quite simple. It also means that adding a new network layer for a new airmiles platform is straightforward. You use the new platform to implement a few operations and a few properties (see below), and then the transport layer can automatically to use your new airmiles platform with no extra work. A network layer consists of two operations: send(msg: str) - write msg to storage. For an airmiles-based implementation, this writes the value of msg to the name field in the user’s airmiles account recv() -> str - read the message from storage. For an airmiles-based implementation, this reads the value of the name field from the user’s airmiles account. A network layer implementation must also define two properties: sleep_for - the number of seconds that the transport layer should sleep for in between polling for new segments from a RECV pipe. sleep_for can be very low for test implementations like files, but it should be at least several seconds for an implementation like an airmiles account. This is in order to avoid hammering remote server with too many requests. segment_data_size - the number of characters that the transport layer should send in a single segment. Should be equal to the maximum size of the airmiles account field being used to transfer segments (often around 20 characters). A network layer implementation can also optionally provide two more operations: connect_send() - a hook called by the sender when a SEND pipe is initialised. In an airmiles-based implementation this allows the client to login to the platform using a username and password. This gives the client a cookie that it can use to authenticate future send and recv calls. connect_recv() - a hook called by the receiver when a RECV pipe is initialised If you fill in all these methods, you’ll be able to use PySkyWiFi on a new airline. But again, don’t. Tips and tricks When writing a network layer that uses a new airmiles provider, there are a couple of tricks that can make your implementation faster and more reliable. 1. Encode messages to make sure the airmiles account accepts them Airmiles HTML forms usually don’t let users include non-alphabetic characters in their name. Stephen will probably be allowed, but GET /data?id=5 will probably be rejected. To work around this, the network layer should encode segments using base26 before writing them to an airmiles account. base26 is a way of representing a string using only the letters A to Z . In order to convert a byte string to base26, you convert the bytes to a single large number, then you represent that number using a counting system with base 26 (hence the name) where the digits are the letters A to Z. def b26_encode(input_string: str) -> int: # Convert input string to a base-256 integer base256_int = 0 for char in input_string: base256_int = base256_int * 256 + ord(char) # Convert base-256 integer to base26 string if base256_int == 0: return 'A' # Special case for empty input or input that equals zero base26_str = \"\" while base256_int > 0: base26_str = chr(base256_int % 26 + 65) + base26_str base256_int //= 26 return base26_str b26_encode(\"Hello world\") # => 'CZEZINADXFFTZEIDPKM' The transport layer never needs to know about this encoding. The network layer receives some bytes, encodes them using base26, and writes this encoded string of A to Z to the airmiles account. When the network layer reads the base26 value back out of the airmiles account, it decodes the encoded string back into a number and then back into bytes, and then returns those bytes to the transport layer. Encoding a string using base 26 makes it significantly longer, just like how it takes many more digits to represent a number using binary than decimal. This reduces the bandwidth of our protocol. We could increase our bandwidth by using base52 (using both upper- and lower-case letters) instead of base26, which would shorten it somewhat. This is left as an enhancement for version 2. 2. Increase bandwidth by using more account fields Another way to increase our PSWF bandwidth is to increase the segment size that a network layer can handle. If we double the size of our segments, we double the bandwidth of our protocol. Fields in airmiles accounts usually have length limits. For example, you might not be allowed to set a name longer than 20 characters. However, we can maximise our bandwidth by: Using the full length of the field Spreading out a segment across multiple fields Suppose we have control over 5 fields that can each store 20 characters. Instead of using one field to transmit segments of 20 characters, we can split a 100 character segment into 5 chunks of 20 and update them all at once in a single request. The receiver can then read all 5 fields, again in a single request, and stitch them back together to reconstruct the full segment. Further enhancements HTTP CONNECT It would be better if PySkyWiFi used HTTP CONNECT requests to set up the tunnel from the sky proxy to the target site, instead of manually tossing around HTTP requests. CONNECT requests are how most HTTP proxies work, and using them would allow PySkyWiFi to act as the system-level proxy and so handle requests from a web browser. It would also mean that PySkyWiFi would negotiate TLS connections with the target website directly, so its traffic would be encrypted as it passed through the airmiles account. On the other hand, using CONNECT would also be a lot more work and I’ve already taken this joke way too far. In conclusion When I was done with all of this I used PySkyWiFi to load the homepage of my blog using curl, tunneling the data via a GitHub Gist. Several minutes later I got a response back. I scrolled around the HTML and reflected that this had been both the most and least productive flight of my life. (PySkyWiFi source code here)",

She didn't like cellphones, but usually carried one of the old \"Kindle Keyboard\" models with unlimited 3G data. The Kindle had simple web browser that could load the low-spec gmail interface, so in essence she had a fully functional SMS device, with no monthly charges. Notification of incoming texts was the only problem. I jailbroke the thing and started trying to schedule network requests, thinking I'd add some kind of new message counter on the home screen. This proved hard. But it occurred to me that the best place for the counter would be right next to the Kindle's device name, at the top of the screen. And the device name could be updated from her Amazon account. So I automated a web browser on the home server to log into Amazon and update the device name to \"My Kindle (x)\" where x was the number of unread Google Voice texts. The Kindle would update the name on the home screen in less than a minute. This worked for years! (Eventually that Kindle was stolen. I wanted to update its name to something foul but the device disappeared from her account too quickly.) reply xyzzy_plugh 4 hours agoparentThe AT&T bill (IIRC it was all under a single account) for the 3G Kindles was eye-watering.

They had paid wifi using sattelite internet, which I did not want to pay. But for payments to work, they allowed access to stripe. Turns out, everything on stripe.com was accessible, even dev docs etc. So I started to waste their bandwidth by downloading gigabytes of images from the stripe website over and over again. But that's quite unproductive. As it turned out, in order for stripe to work, it needs access to fastly CDN. And then I remembered that reddit also uses fastly. By connecting to stripe and changing the Host HTTP header to reddit.com, I could browse reddit! Images didn't work though (i.redd.it is not on fastly).

The interesting observation here wouldn't be about us \"as a culture\", it would be about the government. Because obviously it's not about \"changing your first name field on a form too often\", it's about using that field for an unintended use, in order to bypass controls to give yourself access to communications the company didn't authorize you for.

I can't imagine that every conceivable activity you might perform with a computer system would need to be explicitly documented as ok before you can perform it. In other words, if the system owner lists things you can do and things you can't do, then are you in trouble for doing things not mentioned? They never authorized me to use the brightness control on the entertainment system, but I did anyway, uh oh! They're charging money for normal easy communication with the ground, and they're not charging for slow convoluted communication with the ground.

ODBC support, Cassandra, Redis, and Azure (Table) Storage support, and support for the kinds of obsolete RDBMS and \"4GL\" you see in large enterprise and small mom-and-pop backrooms (Progress, Clipper, AdvantageDB, ElevateDB, etc). And SQL script debugging for Postgres. Currently I have separate tools/clients/IDEs for all the different data systems I target (e.g. SSMS, MySQL Workbench, Azure Storage Explorer, Azure Data Studio, Excel PowerQuery, LinqPad for .NET Framework 4.x for both x86 and x64 because ODBC and OLE-DB are like that); while I have a modest set of portable-ish VM images of obsolete Windows OS instances where I can run MS Access 2003 or some Clipper derivative. I'm also still running Firebird and even FoxPro 9 in another VM somewhere. ...so yes, having a single tool which handles 85% of my tasks without needing to juggle VMs and multiple bloated Electron apps together would be an improvement for me and worth me paying money for. > Why not fork it and implement that feature, and then use that? \"Fork it\" is not a reasonable suggestion considering the amount of work involved (see above). > If you don't want to deal with a company trying to extract profit from you, use the open source version.

I'm just expressing my frustration with DBeaver that I think they're being callous by not offering perpetual offline licenses for Dbeaver Pro, for any amount of money. The fact they used to[1] but don't anymore suggests they were getting disappointing return business from deep-pocketed \"enterprise\" customers, but I'm disappointed that their solution to this problem of theirs means leaving my money on the table because now they don't have any product licenses that I can work with.

    "originLink": "https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-faces-millions-in-damages-and-a-permanent-injunction-240708/",
    "originBody": "HOME > LAWSUITS > APPS AND SITES > Popular pirate library search engine Anna's Archive faces monetary damages and a permanent injunction at a U.S. court. The site's operators failed to respond to a lawsuit filed by OCLC, after its WorldCat database was scraped and published online. Anna's Archive remains silent but did switch to a new domain name recently, which may not be entirely coincidental. Anna’s Archive is a meta-search engine for shadow libraries that allows users to find pirated books and other related sources. The site launched in the fall of 2022, just days after Z-Library was targeted in a U.S. criminal crackdown, to ensure continued availability of ‘free’ books and articles to the broader public. Late last year, Anna’s Archive expanded its offering by making information from OCLC’s proprietary WorldCat database available online. The site’s operators took more than a year to scrape several terabytes of data and published roughly 700 million unique records online, for free. This ‘metadata’ heist was a massive breakthrough in the site’s quest to archive as much published content as possible. However, OCLC wasn’t pleased and responded with a lawsuit at an Ohio federal court, accusing the site and its operators of hacking and demanding damages. The non-profit says that it spent more than a million dollars responding to Anna’s Archive’s alleged hacking efforts. Even then, it couldn’t prevent the data from being released through a torrent. “Defendants, through the Anna’s Archive domains, have made, and continue to make, all 2.2 TB of WorldCat® data available for public download through its torrents,” OCLC wrote in the complaint it filed in an Ohio federal court. No Response from Anna’s Archive In the months that passed since then, the operators of Anna’s Archive didn’t respond in court. The only named defendant flat-out denied all connections to the site, and OCLC didn’t receive any response from any of the official Anna’s Archive email addresses that were served. Meanwhile, the pirate library continues to offer the WorldCat® data, which is a major problem for the organization. Without the prospect of a two-sided legal battle, OCLC has now moved for a default judgment. “OCLC respectfully prays that a default judgment be entered in its favor against defendant Anna’s Archive and that OCLC be granted declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and monetary damages,” the non-profit writes. The plaintiff notes that it continues to fight an unknown defendant who is unwilling to show up in court. Therefore, a default judgment is the only option it has left. Millions in Damages While the exact scale of the damages has yet to be established, OCLC states that it has suffered considerable harm. In response to the massive scraping operation, which caused substantial downtime, its technical infrastructure had to be upgraded and improved. For example, the organization spent $1,548,693 on upgrades for its hardware infrastructure, and an additional $608,069 for a two-year Cloudflare contract that helps to protect the service against malicious outside attacks. Other costs include the salaries of 34 full-time employees, who were tasked with mitigating the harm caused by the attacks, as well as various other investigation, security, and hardware-related costs. Adding up all the extra charges brings total damages to over $5 million; OCLC says the harm is ongoing, so that number continues to rise. “OCLC has incurred damages of $5,333,064 as a direct result of Anna’s Archive’s cyberattacks, but that amount does not fully compensate OCLC for the harm from Anna’s Archive’s wrongful actions. OCLC continues to suffer from harms that cannot be remedied by monetary damages.” Site Blocking? In addition to monetary damages, the non-profit also seeks injunctive relief. The motion doesn’t specify the requested measures, but the original complaint sought an order that prevents Anna’s Archive from scraping WorldCat data going forward. In addition, all previously scraped data should no longer be distributed. Instead, it should be destroyed in full, including all the torrents that are currently being offered. OCLC says the requested injunctive relief is warranted, noting that this isn’t the first time that rightsholders have requested courts to take action against the site. Multiple countries and publishers have already recognized the illegality of Anna’s Archive’s pirate activities by issuing site blocking injunctions against its domains. “Anna’s Archive has been banned in several other countries for its deliberate violations of copyright laws, and publishers are making shutting down Anna’s Archive a top priority,” the motion reads, referencing bans in Italy and The Netherlands. “Therefore, the public interest will be served by an injunction that curtails the continuing harm from Anna’s Archive’s flagrant disregard for the law,” OCLC adds. Domain Suspension? The current motion doesn’t include a request for site blocking in the United States. However, it is possible that OCLC may ask more concrete measures in the future. That could also include a potential domain suspension. In this light, it is interesting to note that Anna’s Archive moved away from its .org domain about a week ago. The .org domain is managed by the Public Interest Registry with Tucows as the registrar, both of which fall under the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. Anna’s Archive switched to a .GS domain instead, which falls under the UK-based Atlantis North registry. That domain was registered by domain privacy provider Njalla, which adds another layer of complexity from an enforcement perspective. As things stand, it appears that Anna’s Archive is not going anywhere. While OCLC may very well have the law on its side, enforcing it may turn out to be quite the challenge. — A copy of OCLC’s request for a default judgment against the unnamed “Anna’s Archive” defendant, submitted at an Ohio federal court, is available here (pdf)",

This probably means some period of exclusive monetization rights. Anyone should be able to search for and read any filed works for free from the moment they are filed, or possibly after this exclusive monopoly period. Any additional benefits to copyright holders beyond what is needed to make sure we don't lose the works are essentially graft, no different in principle to the medieval church selling lucrative offices. If these things are valuable only because of scarcity, then we are incentivizing scarcity by granting monopoly, so we should do as little of that as we can manage.

If you abolished IP all of that would go away. How would you replace that? I'm not a fan of IP either but I think it's pretty hard to escape that reality. Big companies like NVIDIA (3T market cap) are almost 100% IP. IP is more-or-less central to the US's economic and security strategy.

They are fabless. Everything they produce is digital, either in the form of software or in the form of chip designs. As far as I can tell, without protection from IP law (patents, copyrights, trade secrets) NVIDIA could not function as a company. They would have no means whatsoever at preventing a fab like TSMC from manufacturing clones of their devices and selling them, cutting NVIDIA out of the loop. reply kragen 16 hours agorootparentit's an interesting question, and hopefully after a few decades of repealing intellectual property laws, we can find out. 40 years ago it wasn't obvious that anything like nvidia could exist in the first place. possibilities include: - no company like nvidia could exist, and for chip design and fabrication we'd be stuck with companies like intel, digital, micron, samsung, and texas instruments; but many other kinds of companies could exist that can't exist currently - fabs like tsmc would hire design firms like nvidia to produce designs to fabricate; the division of labor would be the same as at present, but banks and investors would send their money to tsmc to pay to nvidia, rather than to nvidia to pay to tsmc - fabs like tsmc would provide open-source pdks like the skywater pdk to anyone who was interested in designing chips. different open-source gpu designs would proliferate, and jen-hsun huang would be the head of a nonprofit foundation in oregon, spending his days coordinating the contributions of a worldwide network of volunteer electrical engineers and raising his children - microelectronics fabrication machinery research would be focused on small job-shop equipment using electron beams rather than multibillion-dollar euv fabs, so you could get the chips of your choice fabricated in any downtown with five-day turnaround, much like printed-circuit boards. as before, different open-source gpu designs would proliferate, and huang would be the head of a nonprofit foundation in oregon - gpu development and fabrication would be internally funded by companies that wanted to use large numbers of gpus, such as amazon and the nsa of course, companies like nvidia don't depend on the particular 'intellectual property' law being weaponized against anna's archive, and things like anna's archive benefit companies like nvidia rather than threatening them reply chongli 15 hours agorootparentfabs like tsmc would hire design firms like nvidia to produce designs to fabricate; the division of labor would be the same as at present, but banks and investors would send their money to tsmc to pay to nvidia, rather than to nvidia to pay to tsmc There’s a bit of a snag with this. Chip designs are rarely ever done from scratch. Instead they’re iterated over many years, similar to how browsers, operating systems, other critical software is developed. It took NVIDIA decades to get where they are now. If anyone else can just take their designs as a starting point then NVIDIA’s whole investment (billions of dollars in R&D over decades) ceases to be a competitive advantage. I think what would actually end up happening is that chip design as NVIDIA is doing would cease to exist as a business. Perhaps we’d end up with something more akin to an open source model like Linux. But then cost of manufacturing (paying for the masks and order startup costs) would still run into the millions, and TSMC would hold all the cards. The reason I brought all this up though may have been missed by all the commenters to my original post: the U.S. government and their strategic interests. Having American companies like NVIDIA (and Apple as well, really) lose power and marketshare is not in the interest of the government.

They are a concept, but one is no more natural than another. matter exists, knowledge exists. exclusive monopoly to one or the other is no different. RE Cars: I think the analogy is apt, but you you ignore the time an effort that goes into creating one. Who would build or buy a car if someone could just get in and drive off. The same is true for literature. Why spend years writing a book, play, or song, if the first person that hears or sees it reproduces it for everyone and you recieve nothing. It is just like spending time building a car for someone to drive off with it. Your argument focuses on the user, not the creator. >and if someone else gets in my novel and drives off with it, why, i can still read it as easily as before. Thats all an well for the consumer. The car thief doesnt care either, as long as there are cars to steal and idiots buying cars. You might argue that peope will create literature out of innate desire,as an argument how screwing them over wont impact incetives, but how is that different from physical property. You think someone has a deep drive to write the next great ammercian novel, but not grow food, so it is ok to steal one, but not the other.

The thing that exists, the product that it is that you ostensibly \"own\" that is protected by the government is the copyright, a soft of reified extension of ownership, which only has any value inasmuch as the government protects it. In other words, intellectual property is only worth what the government says it is. It doesn't just hold the gun, in this case, it contrived the whole scenario in which a gun was necessary, and the presence of the gun is the only thing that prevents the \"intellectual property\" from spreading naturally, as information is wont to do.

Then I don't have anything to object. But I suspect that the above points were clear in your comments. I don't think anybody here would object to the idea that physical property law and IP law have the same legal standing. What people object to are the principles of the IP law. EDIT: Following up with more analysis of the parent's comments... Indeed the following was clearly stated [0]: > Of course I agree that there are some differences, but they are the same with respect to the sated role of government. The following example to clarify the above statement muddies the water, though: > Physical theft deprives the owner of physical property (where this right is respected by law. IP theft deprives the owner of intellectual property ( where this right is respected by law). Physical property theft deprives the owner absolutely. Whether IP “theft” deprives owner of anything is questionable, even in the legal sense. Regardless, government is “right” to pursue enforcing both laws, because they are laws after all.

Those who invade copyright are regarded as knaves who take the bread out of the mouths of deserving men. Everybody is well pleased to see them restrained by the law, and compelled to refund their ill-gotten gains. No tradesman of good repute will have anything to do with such disgraceful transactions. Pass this law: and that feeling is at an end. Men very different from the present race of piratical booksellers will soon infringe this intolerable monopoly. Great masses of capital will be constantly employed in the violation of the law. Every art will be employed to evade legal pursuit; and the whole nation will be in the plot. On which side indeed should the public sympathy be when the question is whether some book as popular as “Robinson Crusoe” or the “Pilgrim’s Progress” shall be in every cottage, or whether it shall be confined to the libraries of the rich for the advantage of the great-grandson of a bookseller who, a hundred years before, drove a hard bargain for the copyright with the author when in great distress? Remember too that, when once it ceases to be considered as wrong and discreditable to invade literary property, no person can say where the invasion will stop. The public seldom makes nice distinctions. The wholesome copyright which now exists will share in the disgrace and danger of the new copyright which you are about to create. And you will find that, in attempting to impose unreasonable restraints on the reprinting of the works of the dead, you have, to a great extent, annulled those restraints which now prevent men from pillaging and defrauding the living.\" He was decrying the increase in term of copyright to life of the author + 50 years. 1.https://www.thepublicdomain.org/2014/07/24/macaulay-on-copyr... reply matheusmoreira 12 hours agorootparentThat is a powerful address, indeed.

You can make statistical statements about it -- with, e.g., Ramsey Theory -- but you can never capture its totality in a way that would enable its use in computation.

Or is it difficult to do that? reply vundercind 5 hours agorootparentTL;DR actually delivering serious quantities of bits to clients globally is kinda hard and costs real money. The just-rent-servers scheme presents the following issues: 1) Won’t get you anywhere near as good a network of globally-distributed servers. [edit] I mean, maybe, but at that point you’re looking at a fair amount of cost in vendor management—you’ll probably need several hosting providers to even approach it. 2) You need minimum three good full-time ops people to build and support such a thing. What’s the salary on that over two years? Even with Polish salaries or what have you, it’s cheaper, but not cheap. Let’s say $300,000 fully-loaded cost over two years, just for a nice round number, for three ops/sysadmin sorts. Even in cheaper markets, that may be underestimating what it’d take. Halfway there already, and you haven’t rented servers or rack space yet. I’m not gonna claim that your infra will also work far less well and break more often than Cloudflare, because sometimes these sorts of set-ups do end up being rather stable because they can be far simpler and smaller-scale than an as-a-service product, but that is a risk if it’s not done quite well. 3) Server providers may drop you if you get too expensive. Get DDOS’d too much, just use their bandwidth too heavily but within your nominal limits. It’s a risk. 4) Those rented servers do cost money, and add to the operations salaries costs above. Buy servers? Also money, and now you need to rent rack space and bandwidth. 5) Peering agreements for server hosts are sometimes bad. It’s hard to know whether yours is bad until you do something at-scale on it and see support tickets roll in for consistently dial-up speeds for clients who really ought to be seeing better than that. This info doesn’t make service comparison spec sheets. 6) CDNs have usually put in some effort to solve e.g. China deliverability.

    "originBody": "HOME > LAWSUITS > APPS AND SITES > Two alleged Z-Library operators who were arrested in Argentina at the request of the United States, have reportedly escaped from house arrest. Russian citizens Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova were facing extradition to the United States after a judge approved their transfer. After filing an appeal at the Supreme Court of Justice requesting political refugee status, the pair apparently vanished into thin air. On November 4, 2022, the United States Department of Justice and the FBI began seizing Z-Library’s domains as part of a major operation to shut down the infamous ‘shadow library’ platform. A criminal investigation had identified two Russian nationals, Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova, as the alleged operators of the site. On October 21, 2022, at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Judge Sanket J. Bulsara ordered their arrest. They were detained in Argentina on November 3, 2022. After arriving at the Ambrosio Taravella International Airport, the unsuspecting couple cleared customs and hired a car from a popular rental company. The United States Embassy informed local authorities that the pair were subject to an Interpol Red Notice. At what point the Russians’ phones were tapped is unclear but, under the authority of a Federal Court arrest warrant, Argentinian law enforcement began tracking the couple’s movements as they traveled south in their rented Toyota Corolla. Using data submitted in support of a Chamber of Deputies (lower house of the Argentine Congress) inquiry and data made available elsewhere, we were able to recreate the route allegedly taken by Napolsky and Ermakova before their arrest. Points of reference in the reports are widely spaced, so the exact route will likely differ from that shown (right). What is clear, however, is that following a visit to El Calafate, the pair were arrested by airport security police as they arrived in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz. They were later transferred to Córdoba. Napolsky and Ermakova informed authorities they were on vacation in Argentina, enjoying the sights in a rented car. They’d done much the same in almost 100 countries previously, although without any serious issue. In January 2023, Judge Miguel Hugo Vaca Narvaja authorized the Russians to be detained under house arrest. Approval from Córdoba prosecutor Maximiliano Hairabedian, who was responsible for the request to extradite Napolsky and Ermakova to the United States, was not obtained. Pair Fight Extradition to the United States With a federal indictment, alleging criminal copyright infringement, wire fraud, and money laundering offenses, waiting for them in the United States, the priority for Napolsky and Ermakova would soon be their fight against extradition. According to a November 2022 statement made by the Russian embassy in Argentina, no official extradition request was received in the immediate wake of the pair’s arrest. The embassy noted that “Argentina does not allow automatic execution of extraterritorial decisions and requests from third states.” Yet even after the request arrived, the process was far from straightforward. After retaining counsel, the pair denied all wrongdoing. With diplomats from the Russian embassy in attendance, counsel for Napolsky argued that the extradition request failed on the basics by not specifying which copyrighted works had allegedly been infringed, among other things. That triggered a somewhat remarkable series of events. Judge Requested Additional Detail From U.S. Authorities Under pressure from the defense, Judge Sergio Pinto agreed to seek more information from U.S. authorities so that the defendants’ concerns about evidence could be addressed. However, the defense had other concerns too, including the impartiality of Judge Pinto, who had reportedly granted the United States a 30-day extension to correct defects in their extradition request. According to local news publication La Voz, the extension led to the defense accusing Judge Pinto of bias towards the United States. The defense said that a judge’s job is to judge and here, by granting an extension to the requesting state after closing the trial, the defense had no opportunity to participate in the process and suffered a disadvantage. Defendants’ counsel called for Judge Pinto’s recusal and the Judge defended his position. Having reviewed the case, Judge Abel Sánchez Torres sided with the Russians and Judge Pinto was removed. New Judge Orders Extradition After replacing Judge Pinto, Judge Sánchez Freytes presided over the second extradition hearing. Based on the charges – criminal copyright infringement, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering – the Judge said that extradition to the United States was appropriate. With Napolsky and Ermakova still under house arrest in Córdoba, an appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice sought political refugee status for the Russians. Success would mean the Russians could not be extradited to the United States. Meanwhile, another Russian was also seeking refugee status, this time to avoid extradition to Russia. Oleg Andreevich Kulakov is considered an opponent of the Kremlin. According to a La Voz report, at the hearing previously attended by diplomats from the Russian embassy, Napolsky and Ermakova mentioned that Kulakov, wanted for fraud in Russia, is a neighbor of theirs. A decision on Kulakov’s extradition awaits a decision from the National Refugee Commission; Napolsky and Ermakova, on the other hand, appear to have decided that the time for waiting was over. Z-Library Defendants Vanish Into Thin Air Patronato del Liberado (Patronage of the Liberated) is responsible for assisting people who have previously been detained by the authorities with family and social reintegration. It’s also tasked with monitoring compliance of those on probation or subject to house arrest. According to unnamed ‘judicial sources’ cited by La Voz, which receives full credit for a remarkable scoop, when the group conducted a regular visit in May, to verify that Napolsky and Ermakova were in compliance with the rules set by the state, there was no trace of them. Patronato del Liberado raised the alarm and Judge Sánchez Freytes was immediately notified. Counsel for the defense during the extradition hearings said that he hadn’t been able to contact the Russians either. The Judge ordered an international arrest warrant although there appeared to be at least some hope the pair hadn’t left the country. However, that was many weeks ago and with no obvious news suggesting their recapture, the pair could be anywhere by now.",

Discussing federal prosecutions, specifically, they talk about something known in slang as “the head-shot” for federal investigators and prosecutors: finding that someone took a loan from an associate, then used that money to secure a bank loan (a mortgage, say) while misrepresenting the loaned money as their own, then later paid the money back (making it clear, in the paper trail, that it was in fact a loan). It’s very easy to understand, easy to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, it’s fraud, and it’s a great entry to comb through the books looking for more crimes. “Something every kid does with their parents to buy their first home”, one Baltimore cop observes. reply root_axis 5 hours agorootparentWhat?

Non-rich parents are more often in a position to somewhat-uncomfortably “gift” that money.

That’s when it’s fraud. reply searealist 13 hours agorootparentprevYou shouldn't get your worldview from a TV show.

The parts of the show I have some real-world understanding of are remarkably observant and accurate. I’m inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt for parts I’m less familiar with. My point was simply that financial crimes, including some really common ones that often go un-prosecuted until suddenly it matters, are often components of federal cases.

Basically, any financial transaction made with funds considered to be “proceeds of crime” can result in a money laundering charge. Contrary to the traditional definition of “money laundering”, there doesn’t need to be any attempt by the defendant to obscure the origin of the funds. All that is required is the defendant knew (at times in a rather loose sense of “know”) the connection between the funds and the underlying crime reply beaeglebeachedd 21 hours agorootparentBasically all money in circulation is prior proceeds of crime (and also will soon be going back to crime) and all reasonable lukewarm IQ people know this.

Knowingly using the proceeds of a crime to promote the carrying on of a crime. And knowingly using the proceeds of a crime in a transaction that attempts to conceal the source of the proceeds.

I agree that the way I explained the law was less than completely accurate. But I was talking about money laundering charges as add-on charges. Your \"as long as you don't use it to commit any crimes yourself\" is unlikely to apply to a defendant who is getting a money laundering charge as an add-on rather than the sole charge. Theoretically, you might commit a crime, and draw proceeds from that crime, and never use those proceeds in any way to further the commission of the underlying crime – but in practice that doesn't seem particularly likely. An enterprising prosecutor is going to come up with some explanation of how you used the proceeds to further the criminal enterprise which produced them – e.g. you used the money to buy a car, and then you went on a crime-related car trip; you used the money to buy a phone, and then you made a crime-related phone call; etc – and once the jury is convinced you are guilty of the underlying criminal conduct, they'll be primed to believe the prosecutor's explanation. Especially since the law doesn't require the prosecution to prove that you actually used the proceeds to further the criminal enterprise, only that you intended to. reply anigbrowl 19 hours agorootparent'Defendant bought a new shirt, obviously with intent to impress his clients and expand the scope of his criminal enterprise.' reply romwell 20 hours agorootparentprevIt's absolute bullshit because the crime (copyright violation) had not been proven at the time of the transaction, and without that, how does one know they're violating copyright vs. exercising fair use rights?

Amazon may sell your data to businesses they partner with (like “Starbucks, OfficeMax, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T, J&R Electronics, Eddie Bauer and Northern Tool + Equipment.”) and they too will use that data in whatever ways they feel will benefit them.

They cover promotion (although authors complain they have to do their own these days). Most importantly, it covers printing, making the physical book, and shipping it to the stores. 50% margins is pretty common for goods. Authors get higher royalties for ebooks, 20-25%. The big part is that the Amazon wants a large cut for running the store. I read the self-publishers get 30-35% royalties (Amazon offers 35% or 70%).

When these books were new, they were in a big stack at the front of every bookstore in the United States. The authors were interviewed on the radio, on TV, in magazines and in newspapers. Any American who might conceivably have wanted to read either book would have been forced to at least look at the cover. So I waited by the phone. Nobody called. I went into Wordsworth, the bookstore in Harvard Square with the biggest nerd book collection. They carry every “how to program HTML” book ever written. They carry a bunch of Web/database titles by authors who don’t know SQL. My friends would go into the store and say “I’ve heard great things about this Greenspun Database Backed Web Site book. Do you have it?” No. “Is it on order?” No. “Can you order it?” Yes, with payment in advance. My friends at MIT Press had ordered 50 copies for their little bookstore and wanted me to come in and sign them. A signing! Just like real authors. So I went down there every day. No books. MIT Press had ordered their books a month before publication date to be sure that they had it as early as possible. Two months later: no books. The store manager had sent Macmillan a couple of FAXes and made three phone calls. Finally, Macmillan answered “Oh yes, we decided that you’re too small for us to deal with.

Here’s how I described it to my brother: > I was walking down Columbus Avenue with my friend Bobby. His literary agent also represents Saul Bellow.

I’m sure it is going to be huge, not like literary fiction.” > [Background: last time Bobby had a book at B&N it was on their 10 best sellers list and copies filled an entire front window.] > In the computer section, they had a table out front with a bunch of Internet books for people who couldn’t figure out what those nine buttons at the top of the Netscape browser do. They had a massive “for Dummies” section behind the table. Behind the “for Dummies” section was an even larger “how to program HTML” section. > They had a big Web site design area with Dave Siegel’s book. Right underneath was a two-shelf Web/Database design area. They had a big stack of IDG’s “Creating Cool Web Databases” (the book I kept on my coffee table as a joke), presented cover out. They had some better books. They did not have my book. > Nearby, Barnes & Noble also had a big database section. It did not contain my book. > We asked the clerk. He looked up the book in the computer. “Ah yes, we have one copy. It is in the network section.” So we walked across an aisle to a completely non-Web non-Internet non-database area of the bookstore. There, among books describing the TCP/IP protocol (something you don’t need to know about unless you are writing your own copy of Unix or Windows NT from scratch), was one copy of my book. Spined. > If a person walked into that store knowing that he wanted to build a database-backed Web site, he would have never come within 20 feet of my book. I don’t know if Barnes & Noble uses a central computer system but, if they do, I imagine that all 700 copies they ordered are in the wrong place. My brother promptly wrote me back that he’d gone into a Barnes & Noble in Washington, D.C. and found my book in the network section there as well. I stopped going into bookstores. When the dead trees world lets you down, you can always turn to the Web, no? So I visited the The Macmillan Computer Publishing Web Site and clicked on “what’s hot”. My book apparently wasn’t. But they did have a nice banner ad for Scientology: “with Scientology technology you could understand the purpose of life and through understanding, achieve the goals you set out.” Using the search engine, I managed to find a generic page for my book. There was no link to my Web site, no sample chapter, no scan of the cover, no blurbs from the inside cover, no author biography (just to list a few of the things that were actually in Macmillan’s possession). This was on July 4th, almost three months after my book was completed. I’d talked to Macmillan earlier about them running some advertisements for the book. They said “typically, if a book is selling well after a few months then we think about running ads.” This plays into my theory that publishers don’t read books. It is easier to hire 10 losers to write 10 books on the same topic and pay them each $10,000. Then they dump all of these books into the bookstores and let the public sort it out. After a few months, their inventory computer shows them which of the 10 books is selling best and they get behind that one. Wouldn’t we all be better off if the publisher paid a skilled writer $50,000 to do a good Perl/CGI book and then actively pushed it? Anyway, Macmillan apparently puts almost all of its efforts into schmoozing bookstore buyers and cooperative advertising with retailers. So the chance that an author would see an ad for his own book is minimal. One thing that worked great in the case of my book was sending out promotional copies. We shipped out 100 three weeks after the book was printed. Almost everybody read it. Almost everybody who read it loved it. Almost everybody who loved it recommended it to several friends. Almost everybody who recommended it to friends also wrote a reader review at amazon.com (more about that below). that was pretty much my experience with getting greenspun's book too in 01997. i went to my local bookstore, which had a really extensive and excellent computer books section. they didn't have it, but they did buy it from their distributor for me, and when it arrived, i went to the bookstore to pick it up. i don't remember if i had to pay in advance; i don't think so. so greenspun probably wasn't exaggerating at all as for self-publishers, canonically they don't get royalties, they just get printed books from the printer. then it's up to them to sell the books reply navis05 10 hours agorootparentThank you that was enlightening, and thanks for the heads up too about the images reply kragen 2 hours agorootparentglad you enjoyed it! reply kragen 18 hours agorootparentprevthe reason authors take that deal is the advance; they can pay the bills with the advance while they're writing the book, and in effect the publisher is assuming the risk that the book flops (as almost all books do), in exchange for almost all of the profits if the book blows up. because publishers have more money than authors, they can afford to take on more risk reply iczero 13 hours agorootparentlast time I checked, VCs also worked this way and didn't take 80% of your company reply kragen 5 hours agorootparentno? how much was your dilution before your first liquidity event? possibly you haven't done a startup at all and so you don't know about liquidation preferences; a down round normally means vcs take 100% of your company reply xbar 1 hour agoprevInteresting story, but I'm left wondering what happened to the Toyota Corolla. reply wkat4242 15 hours agoprevWow it must be really hard to be on the run like this.

But their push for free & universal education has been good. reply generationP 21 hours agorootparentI consider the wide-scale and fairly high-quality scientific education system to be the only genuine upside of Soviet communism. Admittedly, part of its success was the fact that it offered many people the only way to the middle or upper class (the Soviet Union was an extreme class society, with peasants forced to stay on their collective farms and non-Muscovites banned from settling in Moscow unless they took up professions that were currently desired by the system). Another caveat is that it was STEM-only, and excluded computer science (which the Soviet system was unconducive to for various reasons) until the 80s. The SU was particularly unwilling to teach anyone foreign languages, unless one chose (and was cleared) to work for intel. reply braincat31415 20 hours agorootparentThe last statement is completely wrong; there were many avenues to study foreign languages, either for adults or children. Children could attend schools that specialized in foreign language instruction, and extracurricular classes were also available. Same went for adults that could study languages as full-time students, or attend after-work classes, or participate in a directed self-study. Private tutoring was easy to find in major metro centers. I have to mention though that the quality of foreign language education in regular schools was dismal. While in school, I participated in an after-school study group that studied Spanish under a guidance of a university professor (for free), and a part-time job that I took over the summer allowed me to pay for French tutoring. My school had an exchange program with schools in Manchester, with plenty of opportunities to become fluent in English. Speaking of a middle class, it was not unusual that a factory worker's salary exceeded that of a high-school teacher with a university diploma. reply generationP 10 hours agorootparentGood point -- I was implicitly talking about serious instruction on advanced levels. There was no shortage of classes where you got to listen to French music and read some easy books; but nothing that would bring you to fluency. An exchange program with Manchester, though? That must have been late in the 80s? reply braincat31415 3 hours agorootparentUnderstood, that's true, to do any serious study people had to apply to and enter a formal program, day, evening, or remote.

Because of the sad state of those armies in the 90's, 00's, and even 10's, very few young men in particular were willing to basically waste a year or so of their life, so instead nearly every male school graduate went into a university, which contributed to the statistics. reply chx 21 hours agorootparentprevNo, this is definitely a Soviet thing. The 1897 census found 79 million peasants out of 93 million, these people basically had no chance of getting a tertiary education. Only the remaining 15% and not that many of those either had even a chance. Indeed, while the Stalinist rule was not a particularly popular one, the elderly certainly appreciated how their children became engineers, doctors and such.

Any time I'd go back to visit in the last few decades, I'd buy movies, entire discographies, and video games for a few dollars a piece from market stalls and specialized stores that sold nothing but pirated content.

Even if economic difference is not as wide as it used to be, cost of many books, subscriptions, and software tools looks prohibitively high there still.

I cannot speak for all areas of science, but at least in math and physics the paper copies of most Western research journals were available in central public libraries.

There was a considerable effort to translate English language books into Russian and publish them. I cannot vouch for all the publishers, but I know for a fact that at least MIR publisher paid royalties on sales of translated books, although I am sure they did extra printing press runs off the books, so to speak.

Needless to say there is no inherent right for an author to profit from copyright. It is a wholly constructed right. They do not \"deserve\" it.

If you enjoy reading, but don't think they deserve even that amount, well... I think they shouldn't be attached to that old business model in a world where self-publishing is possible. I also think generous UBI should exist, but I guess that's another issue. reply shadowgovt 8 hours agorootparentAnd that's the thing. One could make the case that in a world of UBI, copyright diminishes in relevance. If the intent of copyright is to allow people to use capitalism to create wealth via their words so that they can live a \"life of the mind\" and pursue grand ideas... If UBI gets us the same goal then that does something to the good/harm balance of the temporary monopoly on ideas. The key point is remembering that copyright isn't some divine right stemming from the muses blessing the author with their own exclusively-owned words; it's a right societies fabricate because we believe it will incentivize people to build new knowledge that eventually benefits everyone. It's that incentivization that's the goal. reply DEADMINCE 7 hours agorootparentI think we probably agree with each other. Even with UBI, I do think it makes sense to have some degree of copyright. Just to allow creatives room to breath and tell stories they want to tell without their narratives by more popular forks. That argument is a different issue altogether, though, I think, and we are nowhere near being in a context where we need to figure it out. I do think UBI should be a minimum, and people should still receive compensation for work they produce that people enjoy. Just not exclusive rights and perpetual royalties and all this nonsense. reply User23 18 hours agorootparentprevThat's a pretty good argument against copyright. Is it really worth losing the cultural intellectual commons so that the average author (nearly all authors, in fact) can make well below minimum wage? I'm unconvinced about that being a societally beneficial trade-off. reply root_axis 19 hours agorootparentprevIs the amount that they deserve a function of the medium of the work? reply DEADMINCE 15 hours agorootparentI'm sure someone great at math could come up with a function.

Natural rights are fairly easily thumbnail-sketched by \"What are your rights if you're on a desert island?\" Out of the context of any preexisting society, what rights would you have? On a desert island, if I find some words scrawled ten feet high on a cliffside, I may do with the ideas in those words what I will: copy them, change them 'round, claim they came from me, claim they came from god. Similarly if I hear some mountain hermit shouting them from their cave. The natural rights as apply to ideas are very, very liberal. We in modern societies (and only recently) have taken up the experiment of constraining those rights with temporarily and contextual monopolies to incentivize creation of more ideas via property law. This works, but in a clunky, hackish way; it is a strange kind of \"theft\" that leaves us with more of something than when we started. And like all good wild hacks, it deserves to be considered for refactoring frequently. reply Dalewyn 22 hours agorootparentprevI agree, though with one semantic nitpick: The digital nature of a work doesn't matter. It says right there on the tin, intellectual property; a la any work (\"property\") that is a product of human intellect. reply root_axis 21 hours agorootparentActually I agree with you, but I refer to the digital aspect because people don't seem to have any difficulties understanding why its problematic to steal physical books. reply crtified 20 hours agorootparentWhich contains its own irony, as the trees providing the primary material the physical books are made from would probably have a thing or two to say about the notion of being stolen from. reply root_axis 19 hours agorootparentI don't see any irony in it since trees don't have brains or opinions as far as we know, but when they decide to say something about it I'll definitely be sure to listen.

That's not a comparable argument because your belongings have a material effect on at least one sentient entity. Instead what if you were given the power to expunge everything in the universe outside of our solar system. Would that be acceptable? That's not a comparable argument because you haven't been properly compensated as authors of the printed word are. If you received a dime for every snuffed-out star, would it then be acceptable? Of course if you were to argue that downsizing the universe represents an intangible loss to humanity as a whole, we are have returned to ground zero in which it is ironic that exterminating trees provides a net benefit to humanity. reply root_axis 18 hours agorootparentprevIf you believe that paper is immoral then you're entitled to that opinion, but you haven't presented any reasoning to justify that belief. reply Dalewyn 18 hours agorootparentIt's scientifically known that plants respond to stimuli such as being injured, namely to communicate that fact to others of its species in the vicinity. For an example I'm sure most people can relate to, you probably know that \"cut grass smell\" when you mow your lawn? That's the grass throwing out chemical signals telling other grass \"Hey! Something cut me down! Be warned!\". While whether this can count as intelligence or sentience is worthy of further debate, to say that trees don't feel anything is a gross mistake. reply root_axis 18 hours agorootparentAll living things respond to stimuli, even some non-living things respond to stimuli (like viruses or crystals) so I don't see \"response to stimuli\" as sufficient evidence that plants suffer pain. Actually, I'm not categorically opposed to the notion, but I think you need to bring a lot to the table to explain why things without nervous systems feel pain. If the default assumption is that all complex systems feel pain then I wonder if you think things like jetstreams, economies and the internet feels pain. > that \"cut grass smell\" when you mow your lawn? That's the grass throwing out chemical signals telling other grass \"Hey! Something cut me down! Be warned!\". So is it immoral to cut grass? reply Dalewyn 17 hours agorootparent>Actually, I'm not categorically opposed to the notion, but I think you need to bring a lot to the table to explain why things without nervous systems feel pain. Note that I didn't say they feel pain, just that they can feel what is done to them by the environment around them and respond appropriately. The fact trees don't speak human plays a big role in us not understanding them, but they do clearly feel and express things whatever they may be. >So is it immoral to cut grass? Considering most of it is done for purely aesthetic purposes to satisfy human egos, arguably yes. Note that whether it's moral or not is tangent to whether it can be done or not. We humans do plenty of immoral things without a care in the world. reply root_axis 17 hours agorootparent> Note that I didn't say they feel pain Well, I never said \"they feel nothing\", but if you're saying plants have a right to life because they feel \"something\" I'm wondering where you draw the line.

They've always offered free access to books. Personally I use these services like a public library too. I buy most of the books I'm sure I want but I use public libraries and download sites alike to explore more. Once I actually dive into a book I buy it but many I don't. Of course this depends on a honour system as you could easily download everything. But books are cheap for the amount of time you spend on them and it's a nice thing to buy. Note: for technical books that equation can be very different and I could be more likely to download yes. Though i don't usually consume technical content in book form anyway. I tend to explore by doing and learning as I go. reply WarOnPrivacy 20 hours agorootparentprev> I dare you to take the same position about not paying workers for any other career. Everyone deserves to get paid for their work. Once. Past that requires a bargain with the public. The bargain was that the public would yield their rights for 14 years, for works that promoted the progress of science and the useful arts. The public could gift another 14 years to the creator. The bargain has been altered. Prayers to not alter it further are never answered. More and more years have been taken from public - almost entirely without the public's consent, typically as quietly as possible and always in response to piles of campaign cash from massive IP interests. And if it were creators that were the ~sole (or even primary) beneficiaries of purchased and ever-ratcheting copyright extensions, maybe the public would be willing to forgive the immoral methods used to arrive here. But creators didn't buy modern IP laws and most of that wealth is not flowing into creator's pockets. If we're looking for bad behavior to be angry at, there are a lot of deserving recipients. I'd even argue that some blame should go to creators that remained silent while corrupt copyright laws were purchased in their names. reply matwood 20 hours agorootparent> Everyone deserves to get paid for their work.

In addition, from the programmer's point of view this is usually how things work (unless they own the startup, the equivalent of self-publishing). And for most products that actively gain new users, there is continuous work being put into adding new features and maintenance. So in my mind, this is not a perfect analogy. reply WarOnPrivacy 19 hours agorootparentprev>> Everyone deserves to get paid for their work. Once. > Interesting way to look at it.

I'll restore the context you omitted. >> Everyone deserves to get paid for their work. Once. >> Past that requires a bargain with the public. After I write code, my client pays me as agreed and I have received 100% of what I am entitled to. That's how labor and wages work. Someone else can write the same code and sell that labor to their clients and get the same result. This is good and holy and what is right with the world. If I want to write code and deny every other person possible their right to develop and deploy that tool - Ok, well, there's a good chance I can't. The plain and obvious nature of computer instructions puts a lot of healthy limits on whether code can be copyrighted. Not enough and like everything tied to copyright it's a convoluted mess of industry-built pitfalls. But say I work all that out. If I want to force the public to gift me the protection I get - by denying the public their natural right - I have to enter into a bargain with the public. As far as it relies on purchased copyright law, it will be a corrupt bargain. But the bargain does have to exist. reply xhkkffbf 20 hours agorootparentprevWhat does \"once\" mean here?

The idea of peer review is a very sensible one. But (much like search engines) the process can be gamed by unethical actors; and where scarcity (of academic prestige) is enforced, rent-seekers invariably follow. Peer-reviewed journals charge a lot of money to submittants, but they generally don't pay the reviewers any of that.

    "originBody": "Category Security Linksys Velop routers send Wi-Fi passwords in plaintext to US servers It’s as if the routers themselves forgot the first rule of cybersecurity: don’t write your secrets on a postcard. By Alex Ivanovs Published July 9, 2024 2 min read Share with friends Link copied According to Testaankoop, the Belgian equivalent of the Consumers’ Association, two types of Linksys routers are sending Wi-Fi login details in plaintext to American Amazon servers. This discovery involves the Linksys Velop Pro 6E and Velop Pro 7 mesh routers. During routine installation checks, Testaankoop detected several data packets being transmitted to an Amazon server in the US. These packets included the configured SSID name and password in clear text, identification tokens for the network within a broader database, and an access token for a user session, potentially paving the way for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. During installation, the router sent several data packets to an Amazon server in the US. These packets contained the configured SSID name and password in clear text, as well as some identification tokens for this network within a broader database and an access token for a user session that could potentially enable a MITM attack. Testaankoop A MITM attack is a security breach in which an attacker intercepts communication between two parties without either party’s knowledge, allowing the attacker to read or alter the exchanged messages. The consumer organization conducted these tests using the latest firmware available at the time. Despite warning Linksys in November, no effective measures have been taken. The Velop 6E and 7 we tested had the most recent firmware. The Velop 6E was tested several times, the last time with firmware V 1.0.8 MX6200_1.0.8.215731 and the new Velop Pro 7 was tested with firmware 1.0.10.215314. Testaankoop Linksys released a firmware update after the initial warning, but it did not address the concerns raised. “We regret the lack of response from Linksys and expected more from such a renowned brand,” Testaankoop expressed. Testaankoop suspects the security issue might stem from third-party software used in the Linksys firmware. However, they emphasize that this does not excuse the vulnerability. For those who already own the affected routers, they have recommended changing the Wi-Fi network name and password via the web interface instead of the app. This precaution prevents the SSID name and password from being transmitted in readable text. Mesh routers like the Velop series are designed to improve Wi-Fi distribution in large or multi-story homes by creating a wireless network through multiple connected nodes. These nodes communicate either wirelessly or through cables to ensure better Wi-Fi coverage. However, the Velop Pro WiFi 6E and Pro 7’s data transmission practices undermine the security benefits they should provide. Testaankoop contacted Linksys again just days before today’s publication in response to the ongoing issue, giving them a brief window to respond. However, they have not received any acknowledgment or solution from the manufacturer. The vulnerability persists even in the latest Linksys 7 Pro, highlighting a critical security lapse. “After our long and intensive tests, we strongly advise against buying the Linksys Velop Pro WiFi 6E and Pro 7 because there is a serious risk of network intrusion and data loss,” the researchers concluded. Stack Diary has also contacted Linksys to see if they plan on responding.

But I've assisted people who's mental model is simply \"Verizon put this box in my home and now I have internet\". Who panic when a site doesn't load, and will call the first person they think is responsible for the problem. (typically, the company that gave them internet). Or more commonly nowadays, \"my phone is my internet connection\" -- and the only thing they think they have the power to do is to wave the phone in the air to find 'more bars'. I suppose it makes sense from Verizon's (or any ISPs) perspective, and honesty, if you understand how all this works, then you understand how to trivially eliminate the issue, and then of course, you know when and when not to call Verizon with problems. (Of course, it'd be awful nice if they offered 'Shibboleet' [1] service for folks who do undertsand when the problem is between the site and the router.) HOWEVER, it'd be nice if they were more upfront with the disclosure of this password sharing ... 1: https://xkcd.com/806/ reply renewiltord 56 minutes agorootparentprevXfinity these days will have the tech set up your WiFi with your password. It's an integrated device so he'll set up the cable internet and then your WiFi. Monkeybrains is all \"you're set up!\" and then you add your own WiFi router. Sonic has you set up your own WiFi. AT&T has the WiFi password printed on the device along with the admin password. That's my experience with ISPs in SF. It's clear that many people don't buy Internet access. They buy \"WiFi\" which is that Xfinity integrated service. The components don't matter. reply abadpoli 1 hour agoprevIs this actually plaintext, or is this plaintext-inside-HTTPS? The article and source material don’t say. It’s pretty normal for passwords to be “plaintext” inside an HTTPS request. That’s how practically every login to a web app works. If it’s not HTTPS, there’s a whole slew of other issues along with putting a plaintext password in the request. If it is HTTPS, then the issue really is just that the password gets sent anywhere rather than staying local. This is a lot more debatable as a practice, but unfortunately is also common for a lot of routers to support their cloud/app management functionalities. reply SahAssar 1 hour agoparent> is also common for a lot of routers to support their cloud/app management functionalities Why does the cloud need to know the wifi password to support mgmt functionalities? The only reasons I can think of right now are for more \"automatic\" setup of a second unit for meshing or if you want a factory reset to have the same password. Both of those cases have better solutions. If it's for setting a new password I don't see why they need the old one, if it's for remote management access using the wifi password as the access credential then that seems both bad (access to my network should not mean access to manage it) and like it can be done a lot better if actually needed (send just a well salted and hashed password). reply iudqnolq 1 hour agorootparentThis appears to be a cloud password first stetup feature. As in you type your new password into the app, the app sends your password to a cloud API, and then the cloud API instructs the router to change to the new password over a management API. So the password is sent for a specific feature that legitimately wants it. You could have the app connect to a special WiFi network and then communicate directly with an API exposed by the router. That's what my router does. But the experience of using a special-purpose WiFi network is janky on many common devices so I understand not taking that choice. reply abadpoli 1 hour agorootparent> But the experience of using a speical-purpose WiFi network is janky on many common devices so I understand not taking that choice. Yea, this is my hunch as well as to why this works this way. Consumers are easily confused, and asking them to disconnect from their currently working internet connect and connect to a router that hasn’t yet been set up (and might not be able to provide an internet connection) can get confusing. I know I’ve been in this situation before where I’ve been connected to a special-purpose network without internet connect, need to look up some instructions online, but then remember I can’t because I’m not connected to the internet… reply SahAssar 1 hour agorootparent> and might not be able to provide an internet connection But this router has to have an internet connection for this flow to work, right? Otherwise how can the router get the password from the cloud service? What is needed is the device-to-router connection to work securely but by sending the wifi credentials plaintext that is not secure, so not sure what is won here. reply abadpoli 1 hour agorootparentThe router itself has an internet connection but that doesn’t necessarily mean that all of the other stuff required to actually route traffic or connect other devices is configured (like DHCP). It’d be possible to have some sane defaults in there to make it work, but I wouldn’t count on them to be 100% out in the field of who-knows-what-crazy-settings-this-consumer-has. > sending the wifi credentials plaintext that is not secure If the connection between the app, router, and cloud server are all HTTPS, then it’s probably more secure to do it that way than it would be to send it over an unconfigured, insecure WiFi network (which typically uses HTTP or unsigned certificates for the management interface). reply SahAssar 47 minutes agorootparentEven if all that is true why would you not use a temporary password to then directly set the real password?

This has turned into the same abuse of customers we see from others. For example TP Link uses the same dark patterns in their routers as companies like Roku, where they make updates to the terms of service and force you to accept it in a pop up if you want to use the app. And the app is the ONLY way to access most of the router configuration features, as compared to the old method where routers would let you navigate to a password protected website to configure them. So if you don’t accept the new terms, you can’t control your router that you were able to control all this time. Additionally their app constantly pushes trials of their useless and unwanted services through nudges within the app like red circular badges next to menu items and user interface elements. It wouldn’t surprise me if their terms also let them abuse my privacy and security in the same way as Linksys. But who else do we go to? Every company is doing this. Maybe they just cannot survive without it.

    "originBody": "Making My Own Wedding Rings 07 Jul 2024 I’m getting married pretty soon, and I figured it’d be fun to make my own rings. I’d seen a Nile Red video where he made purple gold, and the process seemed simple enough: Make a mold, pour some molten metal into it, and voila you have metal in the shape of the mold. It turns out that the devil is in the details. Since I wanted the ring to fit my finger precisely, and I wanted it to be pure gold, I figured that lost PLA casting was my best bet. The process is similar to lost wax casting, but starts with a 3D printed part instead of a wax form. I’d 3D print the ring I wanted, make a plaster mold of it, heat up the mold until the plastic melted/vaporized away, then pour molten metal into the mold. After it cooled I’d rinse away the plaster, then cut off the excess metal and polish the ring. I had a 3D printer, but none of the other necessary equipment. I bought: Investment plaster Some cast iron pipe to use as a flask A vacuum pump and chamber (for getting bubbles out of the liquid plaster) A small electric kiln for burning out the mold A handheld torch for melting the metal A crucible Borax Tongs 5 ounces of fine silver (because gold is expensive) The plan was simple: 3d print the desired shape. Make a plaster mold. Heat up the mold in the kiln, curing the plaster and burning/vaporizing the plastic. Coat the crucible with borax, then torch the metal in the crucible until it’s melted. Take the out the mold and pour the molten metal in. Wash away the plaster. If the trial run worked, the plan was to buy some gold and repeat the process. Jewelry made of pure silver or gold is rare because the un-alloyed metals are very soft, causing them to scratch or deform easily. I thought it was worth the tradeoff since I wouldn’t have to worry about oxides when melting the metal. Also pure silver/gold looks unique. Pure silver is the most reflective metal, and pure gold has a deeper color than lower karat gold used in most jewerly. The First Test I didn’t have much trouble following my plan: This was the result: After polishing, it looked like this: It was promising, but it had quite a few defects. No amount of polishing could fix them, as they permeated the casting. I searched around and discovered two important facts: First, although molten silver doesn’t react with oxygen, it does dissolve oxygen from the atmosphere. Right before the silver solidifies, it spits out the oxygen and forms bubbles, ruining the cast. Second, pure metals have a melting/freezing point, while alloys have a melting range. A metal that freezes more quickly has a harder time filling in all the tiny details in the mold. Armed with this new knowledge, I changed my plan in two ways. First, I’d make an alloy of 90% silver and 10% gold. Second, I’d build a contraption to hook up my vacuum pump to the flask. This would suck oxygen out of the molten metal and help force the metal into every crevice of the mold. Testing: Alloyed silver + Vacuum Casting I went to the hardware store and grabbed some parts to construct a vacuum base for the flask. I drilled a few holes in a steel plate, then used some JB weld to attach the plate to some fittings. I used a piece of ABS pipe as support. A hose connected it to my vacuum pump. I ordered a 2 inch diameter steel tube to use as a flask, as the cast iron had no bottom opening and had degraded from the heat. I found out later that cast iron is coated in zinc, so it was a terrible idea to use it as a flask. I could have given myself metal fume fever. I also put some rubber on the steel plate to help get a seal. When I put the flask on the rubber, the rubber melted and smoked, failing to get a seal around the flask. As you can see, the result wasn’t much better than my first test. Testing Again For my next attempt, I replaced the rubber with some silicone rubber. Silicone rubber is much more resilient to high temperatures. I would have used it earlier, but the black rubber was the only thing I could find at the hardware store. I also JB welded some metal tubing to replace the janky ABS pipe support. In this test, the mold had cooled significantly before I poured the metal in. Also I think the metal wasn’t hot enough and froze before it could fill all the details in the mold. The quality of the casting was better, but still not good enough. The ring on the right is the new one. The one on the left is from the previous attempt. Polishing makes these rings look better than they really are. The inside of the ring still had quite a few defects, causing it to look bad when not on a finger. Also the irregularities made wearing it distracting. It was around this point that I realized that I liked the look of the silver more than gold. Yes, gold is expensive and rare, but it’s not as shiny. And these rings are for our benefit, not everyone else’s. Yet Another Attempt The only changes I made on this attempt were to remove the flask at the last minute and to spend more time heating the metal. It turned out perfect. You can see the layer lines from the 3D print. After cutting off the excess, I sanded, polished, and hammered it. (My fiancee preferred the faceted look of a hammered surface to a smooth polished surface.) There are still some layer lines visible in this image as I wasn’t quite done hammering and polishing it. I like the effect, but it’s not as shiny. The perspective makes it look like the ring is too big to fit on a finger, but it fits perfectly. I think only a professional jeweler could tell that this was made by a hobbyist. Conclusion This was a tough but rewarding project. Until the final attempt, I was worried that I’d never be able to make a decent ring. But I knew that jewelers are not magicians. Whatever they’re doing, I could reproduce. I just needed to understand enough of the chemistry and physics involved. The final product was exactly what I wanted. Because it’s a casting, the core is soft and malleable, meaning it won’t shatter if dropped. But since the outer surface is work hardened from hammering, it’s less likely to collect scratches. Also I can re-hammer it to remove any scratches. Since the rings are made entirely of noble metals, they’ll never corrode. The trace amounts of sulfur compounds in the atmosphere will tarnish the silver eventually, but a small amount of polishing will fix that. In total, this project took me six weekends over three months and cost around $3,500. Most of that was the ounce of gold I bought ($2,300). The equipment was a little under $1,000 and the 5 ounces of silver ran me $125. I could have ordered a sterling silver ring for $100, or I could have worked with a jeweler to fabricate two rings of the desired style and alloy, but it wouldn’t have been the same. Our rings have a story. Knowing what I know now, I probably could have made these rings without casting. I could have heated up the metal, hammered it into shape, reheated to undo the work hardening, and repeated that process until I had the ring I desired. In fact I did so with the extra gold: It’s ridiculously ostentatious, but it is kinda cool. Also gold is 1.7x the density of silver or lead, so it makes a very rewarding sound when knocked against anything. That said, I’m glad I made these rings the way I did. They’re totally unique. Nobody makes jewelry like this, because gold is so much more expensive than silver. It’s far more cost effective to alloy the silver with copper. But such alloys tarnish more quickly and are less reflective. And paying someone else for rings wouldn’t be as cool, or as romantic. Every time we look at our rings, we’re reminded of how much of our own efforts went into them. I’m reminded of the initial idea and thinking, “How hard could it be?” I’m reminded of the trial and error, the mistakes, the frustrations, the determination to keep working through problems, and the eventual beautiful success. Hmm. That almost sounds like a relationship. I’d like to thank James Binnion for publishing so much useful information about jewelry casting. In addition to his countless forum posts helping others, he published a very informative paper about casting defects in 3D printed resin. Without him, I would have had a much harder time accomplishing this.",

Excellent problem-solving, and very nice result!! Taking a completely direction, my wife and I made our own wedding rings out of stainless steel (a low-nickel alloy suitable for contact with skin -- 316L, I think), and we milled them on a lathe in my employer's machine shop after hours. Nearly 20 years later, and they have held up remarkably well. If you're going to lathe a ring, make sure you do as much shaping and polishing before you detach it from the rest of the rod, and then create a mandrel that is the correct size to hold the ring (using friction) from the other direction. Hammer it onto the mandrel, do your final burr-removal and polishing, then pop it off the hammer. Important side note: Don't do a test-fit before taking the burr off, or else you'll slice the skin on your finger all the way 'round in a very nice ring-shaped pattern and it will be the absolute dickens to try and get it off.

Plenty of stainless steels (including, AIUI, basically all the tool steels) don’t use nickel, and many of them have excellent corrosion resistance. Is austentitic steel enough easier to machine to make it worthwhile? reply HanClinto 13 hours agorootparentShorter answer: We don't know -- those are good questions! Longer answer: It was 20 years ago, and we aren't exactly metallurgists. IIRC, at the time it was something to do with a variety of \"surgical stainless\" to focus on the best corrosion resistance combined with something that was somewhat machinable. At the time, I think we were comparing 304 (easier to machine, much worse corrosion resistance) vs. 316 (harder to machine, but much better corrosion resistance). I think looking at metals that we were able to source in partial lengths might have been a factor as well. In hindsight, one might be able to find something with better properties in a more specialized alloy, but if I had to do it over again, I would 100% be willing to choose the 316L again. I have zero complaints with it, and the corrosion resistance it offers is superb. In 20 years, I've never polished my ring once, and it still has that mirror-finish quality (especially on the inside where it has never brushed concrete). I rarely take the ring off (sometimes when juggling) -- I don't worry about it and leave it on even when using tools or scrambling up a rock ledge or carrying cinder blocks or whatever. Very occasionally it will get scratches (concrete is one of the few things that has left a mark from time to time), but they're never very severe scratches, and they buff out nice and naturally over time. I imagine that I would be much more concerned about a softer precious metal, and I'm glad I have a more durable ring instead. reply amluto 8 hours agorootparentHere’s a study on this very issue: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/001093...

Osmium has density of 22.59g/cm^3, which is 17% greater than gold's 19.28g/cm^3. (For comparison, lead is 11.34g/cm^3 and silver is 10.5g/cm^3.) Sadly Osmium melts at 5500ºF and can form toxic vapors, so making a ring out of it would be impractical. reply adrian_b 9 hours agorootparentIridium has almost the same density as osmium (indistinguishable without precise instruments) and unlike osmium or rhenium it is neither toxic nor radioactive (even platinum is very slightly radioactive). So iridium would be the safest among the densest metals for contact with human skin. Unfortunately, not only iridium is very expensive, but it is extremely difficult to shape, being much harder and much less ductile than platinum (and its melting point is also much higher). Platinum-iridium alloys are much easier to shape than pure iridium, but still much more difficult than pure platinum. In the second half of the 19th century, when new standard meters and kilograms were made for distribution in all countries and to replace the original standards made of pure platinum, an alloy of platinum with 10% iridium was chosen, as the most resistant metal to mechanical and chemical degradation that was known at that time but for which it was still possible to process it into a given size and shape. reply filipezf 2 hours agorootparentprevTm.

The sentimental value of self-made wedding rings is immense. reply mauvehaus 20 hours agoprevA couple fun facts about casting metals: Many of them shrink when they solidify. For the size and tolerances needed for a ring you can probably ignore this detail. You can get what is called a low-shrink mold made for some alloys that helps mitigate this if you want to make your prototype to finished size (or you didn't know better before you takes to the jeweler). Patternmakers deal with this using what are called shrink rules. They look like regular rules, but are e.g. 5% longer. If you're buying an old rule, make sure you don't get one by mistake. Silver rings, worn regularly, won't need to be polished to keep the tarnish at bay; the contact from your skin will do quite well enough. Our wedding rings are also silver, and I've only polished mine when I haven't worn it for a while. Ours probably don't polish up to quite the same luster though. They're a regular alloy of silver for jewelry and not silver and gold. reply Lev1a 3 hours agoparentEven if you have tarnished silver things, like silver(-plated) cutlery etc. the \"un-tarnishing\" is stupid easy and cheap to do: - take some container and put warm/hot water and a large helping of (table) salt into it - put some scrunched up Al foil into the water - submerge the objects to be untarnished in the water so that the silver touches the Al foil - leave for a while in a well ventilated area (since it will smell of rotten eggs) - rinse well - done. recipe from a kid's chemistry set I had a looooong while ago, used it successfully quite a few times on my parents' silver-plated cutlery they've had and used regularly since their wedding decades ago. reply interludead 23 minutes agoparentprevYet this shrinkage is typically minimal reply ggreer 20 hours agoparentprevI was worried about the metal shrinking, but I only had to increase the size of my prints by 1.6% to get the desired ring size. eg: The PLA ring had an inner diameter of 16.8mm and the casting had a diameter of 16.5mm.

For my first attempt I split the difference (3%), then measured the actual diameter with calipers. Also I tended to err on the side of making the ring too small, as it’s pretty easy to remove material from the inside of the ring. reply sanitycheck 2 hours agoprevThe vacuum is not necessary here, something this simple is achievable with sand casting (search for \"Delft Clay\") and a bit of practice. Ensure the sprue is wide enough and air channels are plentiful, make sure the metal is as hot as it's possible to get it, and pour swiftly in one fluid motion. The snag is that you need about 3X your desired weight in metal, which in gold is... probably more expensive than the vacuum casting setup!

After 10 failures and different trials, this is my rough process: - Melt fine silver with a butane torch - Pour it into a circle mold with a metal rod in the middle (makeshift ring mold). I tried sand casting with a wax mold but couldn’t keep the metal hot enough to fill the chamber. - Hammer the ring on metal ring mandrel to shape and increase the size. This took probably 5,000 light hits with a metal hammer, periodically annealing. - Use a dremel and grinding stone to further shape it - Sand and polish by hand Since I shaped it with a metal hammer, it has a really nice and natural hammer finish that I plan to keep. I’m considering trying to electroplate it in palladium since the fine silver will tarnish and scratch over time, but it’ll be harder to fix inevitable mistakes. reply ggreer 19 hours agoparentHow did you deal with the molten silver dissolving oxygen from the atmosphere?

She mentioned the idea of casting our own rings, and I remembered my friend happened to have made his own small foundry — a concrete lined paint can with some pipe and 10$ hair drier as bellows — a couple of years prior. We bought some sand casting equipment and a thermometer and went over to his house. He had only ever used the foundry to melt aluminum, so we weren't sure it'd get hot enough to melt gold. We stuffed it with anthracite coal from a big bag he managed to get from a hardware store a while back, and sure enough, it got plenty hot enough. That 10$ hair drier really pulled its weight too, surviving hours upon hours of continuous use. Before we bought any gold though, we did some test casts in aluminum. My wife, I, and a couple of friends melted down some cans, formed our sand molds with some cheap steel model rings, and cast some pretty bad rings. They weren't even rings, really, since they didn't even form full circles. But after a few more tries, we figured out better places to put air channels, how to pour the metal better, etc. and came out with some decent aluminum rings. We also cast some other trinkets like some dice and a little darth vader figurine. More confident we'd be able to successfully cast gold rings, we ordered some 14k casting grain. When it arrived, we headed back to my friends house, cast some more aluminum trinkets to warm up, then my wife and I cast each others rings with only one small mishap; luckily gold can is easily re-melted. Breaking apart the sand molds to reveal the results was a tense moment, but they came out great. We also opted for hammer finishes, and we're both very happy with the result. They have some small pockets on the surface, and we overestimated how much the rings would shrink, so mine's a little too big and I wear it on my middle finger, but we think of the defects as reminders we cast them ourselves. The end result wasn't the point anyway; if we wanted perfect rings we would have just bought some.

Sounds like jewellery is a good dental side hustle! reply groby_b 19 hours agoprevNice! fwiw, people usually don't use a silver/gold alloy not because of cost, but because of hardness. But then, I like that for a wedding ring, it'll collect a few marks on the way - and that too is like a relationship. reply wakawaka28 19 hours agoprevFor most simple designs, you should forge the ring and solder it closed instead of casting. Casting would be more appropriate for detailed designs that you don't have time to carve or hammer out. reply seszett 10 hours agoparentYes, it's both easier and gives a better end result (unless you have good equipment and technique for casting). That's what we did for ours, and we're happy with the result. About 600€ total for two rings including the 6 grammes of gold and the tools (and a few silver coins for practicing). Also, we went for 21k because it's hard enough and easy to get in gold coins (thus, no VAT and very small premium on the price of gold). I wrote an account (in French) here: https://seos.fr/blog/20240426.or.html but it's more for future reference for myself and for the friends who knew about it than anything else. reply groby_b 19 hours agoparentprevSince OP likes symbolism, it's worth keeping in mind that wedding rings are never supposed to have a seam - they're symbolizing, amongst other things, eternity. Casting's the way to go (if that matters to you) reply 55555 7 hours agorootparentProperly handmade rings are stronger, I think. And there's no seam if you do it properly. reply wakawaka28 15 hours agorootparentprevA properly soldered ring with the right treatment will not have a seam. On the other hand, castings can easily end up with imperfections and porosity, especially in the hands of an amateur with limited equipment. reply ggreer 19 hours agoparentprevYeah, hindsight is 20/20. As my blog post mentions at the end, I had no trouble forging a gold ring. Though instead of using solder, I melted the ends together as I wanted the entire ring to remain pure gold. Had I wanted a faceted hammered look from the start, I probably would have skipped the casting step entirely. reply wakawaka28 17 hours agorootparentI'm surprised you were able to fuse the gold. In any case, you would use a tiny amount of gold solder to make the ring, perhaps before finishing the hammering. Also, pure gold is commonly considered too soft for jewelry. It will scratch and ding easily. You should use 22k or lower, with the balance being copper and/or silver. You can easily buy a great alloy so I wouldn't attempt to make one myself, unless the financial savings were amazing. reply ggreer 1 hour agorootparentYeah it took a while to melt the ends together. I think maybe six attempts. I should have punched a hole in the gold bar, then shaped the ring from there. I know that pure gold is much softer than alloys, but the color is unique and it's not too hard to re-hammer the surface to get rid of scratches. reply bsder 18 hours agorootparentprevWeren't most of your issues because you didn't use a centrifugal caster? DIY aesthetic is nice, but sometimes there are good reasons why a specific tool exists. reply ggreer 18 hours agorootparentI wasn't sure if centrifugal casting would solve the issue with oxygen bubbles, and since I already had a vacuum pump, I figured I'd try vacuum casting. The main issue was that I had problems getting a good seal because I made the device myself instead of buying a vacuum casting machine. Also I could have skipped the issue of inconsistent metal temperatures by replacing my torch with an electric melting furnace. reply 55555 7 hours agoprev [–] There is no reason to use casting to make a ring that looks like the ring in the OP. Pour the metal into an ingot, heat and hammer it (like a blacksmith would) into a long bar. Then heat and bend it into a circle/ring, an then use flux to solder it into one piece which eats its own tail. (Yes I've done this, several times.) reply gertlex 3 hours agoparent [–] > Knowing what I know now, I probably could have made these rings without casting. I could have heated up the metal, hammered it into shape, reheated to undo the work hardening, and repeated that process until I had the ring I desired.

    "originBody": "Shtetl-Optimized The Blog of Scott Aaronson If you take nothing else from this blog: quantum computers won't solve hard problems instantly by just trying all solutions in parallel. « BusyBeaver(5) is now known to be 47,176,870 The Zombie Misconception of Theoretical Computer Science In Michael Sipser’s Introduction to the Theory of Computation textbook, he has one Platonically perfect homework exercise, so perfect that I can reconstruct it from memory despite not having opened the book for over a decade. It goes like this: Let f:{0,1}*→{0,1} be the constant 1 function if God exists, or the constant 0 function if God does not exist. Is f computable? (Hint: The answer does not depend on your religious beliefs.) The correct answer is that yes, f is computable. Why? Because the constant 1 function is computable, and so is the constant 0 function, so if f is one or the other, then it’s computable. If you’re still tempted to quibble, then consider the following parallel question: Let n equal 3 if God exists, or 5 if God does not exist. Is n prime? The answer is again yes: even though n hasn’t been completely mathematically specified, it’s been specified enough for us to say that it’s prime (just like if we’d said, “n is an element of the set {3,5}; is n prime?”). Similarly, f has been specified enough for us to say that it’s computable. The deeper lesson Sipser was trying to impart is that the concept of computability applies to functions or infinite sequences, not to individual yes-or-no questions or individual integers. Relatedly, and even more to the point: computability is about whether a computer program exists to map inputs to outputs in a specified way; it says nothing about how hard it might be to choose or find or write that program. Writing the program could even require settling God’s existence, for all the definition of computability cares. Dozens of times in the past 25 years, I’ve gotten some variant on the following question, always with the air that I’m about to bowled over by its brilliance: Could the P versus NP question itself be NP-hard, and therefore impossible to solve? Every time I get this one, I struggle to unpack the layers of misconceptions. But for starters: the concept of “NP-hard” applies to functions or languages, like 3SAT or Independent Set or Clique or whatnot, all of which take an input (a Boolean formula, a graph, etc) and produce a corresponding output. NP-hardness means that, if you had a polynomial-time algorithm to map the inputs to the outputs, then you could convert it via reductions into a polynomial-time algorithm for any language or function in the class NP. P versus NP, by contrast, is an individual yes-or-no question. Its answer (for all we know) could be independent of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory, but there’s no sense in which the question could be uncomputable or NP-hard. Indeed, a fast program that correctly answers the P vs. NP question trivially exists: If P=NP, then the program prints “P=NP.” If P≠NP, then the program prints “P≠NP.” In the comments of last week’s post on the breakthrough determination of Busy Beaver 5, I got several variants on the following question: What’s the smallest n for which the value of BB(n) is uncomputable? Could BB(6) already be uncomputable? Once again, I explained that the Busy Beaver function is uncomputable, but the concept of computability doesn’t apply to individual integers like BB(6). Indeed, whichever integer k turns out to equal BB(6), the program “print k” clearly exists, and it clearly outputs that integer! Again, we can ask for the smallest n such that the value of BB(n) is unprovable in ZF set theory (or some other system of axioms)—precisely the question that Adam Yedidia and I did ask in 2016 (the current record stands at n=745, improving my and Adam’s n=8000). But every specific integer is “computable”; it’s only the BB function as a whole that’s uncomputable. Alas, in return for explaining this, I got more pushback, and even ridicule and abuse that I chose to leave in the moderation queue. So, I’ve come to think of this as the Zombie Misconception of Theoretical Computer Science: this constant misapplication of concepts that were designed for infinite sequences and functions, to individual integers and open problems. (Or, relatedly: the constant conflation of the uncomputability of the halting problem with Gödel incompleteness. While they’re closely related, only Gödel lets you talk about individual statements rather than infinite families of statements, and only Turing-computability is absolute, rather than relative to a system of axioms.) Anyway, I’m writing this post mostly just so that I have a place to link the next time this pedagogical zombie rises from its grave, muttering “UNCOMPUTABLE INTEGERRRRRRS….” But also so I can query my readers: what are your ideas for how to keep this zombie down?

OK OK I’ll see myself out… Scott Says: Comment #2 July 8th, 2024 at 3:47 pm skaladom #1: No, the perfect reply to this post is not uncomputable, as proven by the fact that you just computed it. 😀 Andrew B. Says: Comment #3 July 8th, 2024 at 3:52 pm Maybe a small syllogism is enlightening? 1. All integers are computable 2. BB(6) is an integer 3. Therefore, BB(6) is computable The misunderstanding occurs, I think, in step (1), particularly in the data type of ‘integer’. (It’s integer.) Gil Kalai Says: Comment #4 July 8th, 2024 at 3:57 pm Maybe some variant of the misconception still makes sense. Let me try: Let C be a (simple to state) mathematical conjecture. We can talk about three potential inherent obstacles for proving C: 1) Independence from ZFC, 2) There is a proof but any proof is too long for us to ever find. 3) There is even a short proof (that we can verify once presented to us) but it is computationally intractable to find a proof Regarding the third item, As Scott says, indeed it does not make sense to say “it is NP-hard to find a proof” because we do not have an asymptotic statement but a single instance. However, as we do believe that the asymptotic statements have a practical implications we can still say 3′) There is a short proof, however, any algorithm for finding a proof takes too many steps for us to ever complete. Or if you want to refer to computational complexity you can say 3”) There is a short proof, however, any algorithm for finding a proof requires more steps than running an algorithm for computing a 10000 by 10000 permanent. Some remarks: a) Also in the second item, it makes no sense to say “the length of the proof tends to infinity” but it does make sense to say, “the length of the proof is more than 10^10000 lines.” b) Having said all that, while 2) and 3) seem valid inherent obstacles for proving a conjecture C (and maybe there are more possible obstructions), I am not aware of any specific example where one can expect them to hold. c) Referring specifically to the NP=!P problem adds some confusion but I don’t think it changes matters. d) Some people believe that people’s creativity can lead them to finding short proof so that there is no (practically) efficient algorithm for finding the proof. But I don’t see any reason for that. Dave Orr Says: Comment #5 July 8th, 2024 at 3:57 pm “I got more pushback, and even ridicule and abuse that I chose to leave in the moderation queue” Do you think you might be happier if you delegated moderation and didn’t have to read that stuff? I bet it would be pretty easy to find a few volunteers to help. Scott Says: Comment #6 July 8th, 2024 at 4:15 pm Dave Orr #5: Yeah, you’re right. While I’ve been relying on a Committee of Guardians for the past couple years, maybe we should redesign things so that I don’t even need to see comments until a Guardian has reviewed them. Scott Says: Comment #7 July 8th, 2024 at 4:16 pm Gil Kalai #4: Yes, of course there can be individual mathematical questions to which we’ll never know the answers, either because the shortest proof is too long or because it’s too hard to find. Even in those cases, however, the tools of computability and complexity theory almost never let us make that sort of statement about the individual questions we care about. Ching-Tsun Chou Says: Comment #8 July 8th, 2024 at 4:26 pm Well, what do you say about the common practice of dropping in a specific hash function (say, SHA-256, which plainly has collisions when the input size is greater than 256 bits) when, properly speaking, a collision-resistant hash is needed? Would you consider this to be an instance of “this constant misapplication of concepts that were designed for infinite sequences and functions, to individual integers and open problems”? Pascal Ochem Says: Comment #9 July 8th, 2024 at 4:36 pm Or a fast program for a single diophantine equation that prints either “A solution is (42, 65537, 666, 47176870).” or “There is no solution.” Izzy Grosof Says: Comment #10 July 8th, 2024 at 4:36 pm Even more specifically than saying that BB(6) is computed by some program of the forn “print k”, we can say that BB(6) is computed by some program of the form “run turing machine M to completion, then print how many steps it took to halt”, for a finite list of programs M. We’ve identified a finite list of programs, one of which outputs BB(6). We just don’t know which one. It’s very akin to these “1 if this statement is true, 0 if it’s false” questions. Ernest Davis Says: Comment #11 July 8th, 2024 at 4:53 pm I am puzzled by Gil Kalai’s #4 formulation 3′: “There is a short proof, however, any algorithm for finding a proof takes too many steps for us to ever complete.” I don’t see how this helps. If there is a short proof F (short when written in Coq or Lean) of some particular statement (P != NP, Goldbach’s conjecture, whatever), then there is an algorithm that finds the proof that runs quickly viz, print out F and verify it. A much more elementary but much more wide-spread close relative of this zombie is the unkillable tendency of people to use “exponential” to refer to some very large, specific, number. (In more technical writing I have also often seen “exponential growth” used to describe functions that were quite obviously quadratic growth, and at least once seen it used to describe a function with linear growth, albeit with a largish constant factor.) rrb Says: Comment #12 July 8th, 2024 at 5:00 pm I think that Cooley’s paper “The Re-Discovery of the Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm” is extremely interesting to get a sense of how non-obvious the idea of asymptotic analysis of runtime is. People looked right at the central idea of “unzipping” the sequence but it didn’t stand out from other calculation tricks which only reduce the constant, as we now say. I think once you get the value of the asymptotic perspective, and I’m not sure how that happens, only then are you in a position to understand the concept of NP-hardness. To easily see that it doesn’t apply to individual questions and only to sequences, I think you have to get the value of talking about sequences. Like, it shouldn’t feel like a technicality or “gotcha”. (EDIT: by the way, this time I tried to actually verify my e-mail address the way you want us to, but when I click the link in my e-mail it says “Your address could not be verified.” Not sure how it looks on your end.) Gary Drescher Says: Comment #13 July 8th, 2024 at 5:12 pm Perhaps a way to understand (and maybe slay) the zombie confusion is to focus on *why* complexity theory looks at infinite sequences. Complexity theory wants to talk about how hard it is to figure out the answer to “What is f(x)?”. And intuitively, it makes perfect sense to ask how hard it is for some particular value. But if we ask about a particular value, we let the function cheat by hardwiring a constant answer and not doing any real work So in effect, the infinite-sequence limit is an indirect hack to rule out that cheating, because a finitely specified function can incorporate only a finite crib sheet. Past some finite point, the crib sheet runs out and the function is on its own and really does have to figure out the answer. Maybe then the solution is to be explicit that the infinite-sequence hack only partly succeeds in ruling out cheating, and thus only partially succeeds in formalizing the how-hard-is-it intuition. To avoid confusion, we have to be careful to notice when the formalism diverges from the underlying intuition, namely when asking about a specific value rather than an entire function. Ernest Davis Says: Comment #14 July 8th, 2024 at 5:14 pm To some extent, there is a de dicto/de re ambiguity here. If you interpret the phrase “The value of BB(1000)” de re then the statement “The value of BB(1000) is uncomputable” is either false or meaning less. However, if you interpret it de dicto, then the same statement is true; no computation can establish the truth of a statement of the form “BB(1000) = XYZ… ” where XYZ is the number written out in decimal notation. Scott Says: Comment #15 July 8th, 2024 at 5:24 pm Ernest Davis #14: I don’t agree that “BB(1000) is uncomputable” is known to be true “de dicto” (whatever that means in this context). Humans just figured out BB(5), which means that presumably a computation that simulated life on earth from its earliest days would eventually output BB(5) as well. Maybe God likewise has a program that eventually figures out BB(1000) “starting from nothing.” 🙂 Ernest Davis Says: Comment #16 July 8th, 2024 at 5:50 pm I had thought for a minute that you might be able to get out of this by invoking Kolmogorov complexity: Asserting that the Kolmogorov complexity of the proof that P != NP is large. But obviously, that’s wrong: if there is a proof of P != NP, then there is a proof with reasonably small Kolmogorov complexity (Small machine: generate all strings in sequence, and check each one until one of them is a proof of P != NP.) Ernest Davis Says: Comment #17 July 8th, 2024 at 5:56 pm Scott #15. That’s why I said “BB(1000)” rather than “BB(6)”. My understanding is that you and Adam Yedidia proved that the value of BB(7910) could not be proved from ZFC and that this has been lowered to BB(745) by Johannes Riebel. Joshua Grochow Says: Comment #18 July 8th, 2024 at 6:00 pm While those questions are indeed technically nonsensical – and its nice to have a place to point students to when they make such misconceptions, thanks! – there are still potentially good versions of them that do make sense and still try to get at what the OQ was asking. For example, re: “Is BB(6) uncomputable?” a technically sensical version of that question might be: is there a program p such that p(n), if it halts, outputs BB(n), p(6) halts, and such that K^{O(n)}(BB(6)|p)While they’re closely related, only Gödel lets you talk about individual statements rather than infinite families of statements, and only Turing-computability is absolute, rather than relative to a system of axioms.) This question might not make much sense, but – do you consider Turing-Computability to be “absolute” only insofar as the Church-Turing thesis is true? I’m not actually sure what you mean by absolute, actually. And I’m not sure how Turing Machines are formalized in terms of specific axiom systems; are you saying that in whatever way they are formalized, they are “equally powerful” in terms of what functions they can compute? — In any case, I tend to think that the issue with these zombie questions is people just fundamentally misunderstanding the actual meaning of the words used here (as S #24 also suggested). It’s like people learning probability/statistics, and talking about Random Variables in a kind of handwavy way, without understanding the underlying mathematical concepts; since an RV is a function, it’s not like they don’t understand the concept itself, they’re just not mapping the abstract concept of a “Random thing” used in everyday language to a specific mathematical object. I think this describes a decent amount, maybe even 90+% of people who even know what a Random Variable is. (I should know – I was in this camp before more seriously studying probability!) Martin Says: Comment #45 July 9th, 2024 at 4:31 am The number of times people bring up uncomputable integers is equal to the amount of people who think they appear smarter for bringing them up. Interestingly, this article also seems match in the spirit of that. And so does this comment. Scott Says: Comment #46 July 9th, 2024 at 6:24 am Avocado #32: There are a lot of big issues that you’ve mashed together into guacamole, as it were. 🙂 Step 1 is to clearly separate the concepts of “uncountable” and “uncomputable.” When we talk about computability, we’re normally talking about subsets of the integers—sets that are all countable but that might or might not have a Turing machine that computes them. You have to do something nonstandard even to make it meaningful to ask whether an uncountable set is computable (how is the input provided? to what kind of machine?). On the broader question of the relevance of the transfinite to real life—well, I don’t spend my own career on questions whose answers depend on CH or AC or the like! But the questions are so natural that someone would have asked them. They would have been dissatisfied as long as there were obtainable answers that weren’t being obtained—even if those answers turned out to be “it depends on your axioms.” And the clincher: if you banned me from talking about uncountable sets, in my day-to-day work and teaching in CS I’d have to invent a circumlocution for it, because the concept is that central. Regarding the determination of Busy Beaver numbers, I should be clear that I expect “merely practical” difficulties to kill us long before axiomatic ones do! But it’s possible that, in principle, more BB values would become determinable “merely” by assuming large cardinal axioms and the like, rather than anything “nonstandard.” Scott Says: Comment #47 July 9th, 2024 at 7:26 am BTernaryTau #33: Could you accomplish this by adding an axiom that asserts a value for BB(1000)? If so, how difficult would it be to find a value that doesn’t lead to a contradiction? The big problem with “adding an axiom that asserts the value” is, what if you’re objectively wrong? That is, what if there’s a different machine that halts after more steps than your machine? You’d need damn good confidence, even if short of proof, that every machine that runs for longer than your machine actually runs forever. In the case of BB(5), we’d known what ultimately turned out to be the correct machine since 1990–the one that halts in 47,176,870 steps. And there was a list of at most 43 candidate machines that might beat it, but none of them halted within a trillion steps—thereby proving that BB(5) was either 47,176,870 or more than a trillion. But until this year’s achievement, I for one didn’t have any great confidence that none of those machines halted, and certainly wouldn’t have wanted to add an axiom saying so! And that’s merely for BB(5), let alone BB(6), let alone BB(1000)… 🙂 Scott Says: Comment #48 July 9th, 2024 at 7:33 am BTernaryTau #35: I’m not sure this is true. If someone had a religious belief that God both exists and doesn’t exist, or that God neither exists nor doesn’t exist, then they could say that they believe f is ill-defined and thus cannot be a computable function. We might as well talk about the equivalent case of the number that’s 3 if God exists or 5 if God doesn’t exist. Would this person likewise say that that number isn’t prime? I hope this makes clear that the dispute has nothing to do with computability (or primality, or theology): it’s just about the person’s rejection of basic rules of logic (in a technical sense, not necessarily a pejorative one). Scott Says: Comment #49 July 9th, 2024 at 7:46 am Danylo Yakymenko #36: The first part of your comment is brilliant! Yes, absolutely, people imagine that if BB is uncomputable, then we must be able to point to a specific n such that BB(n) is uncomputable. They don’t grok the intermediate case, that there’s no general procedure that works for all n but also nothing to rule out an ad hoc solution for any particular n. On the other hand, I would not say that “there is no absolute truth after Gödel anymore.” And Gödel himself, a arch-Platonist, certainly wouldn’t have said that! There is an absolute truth about the values of BB function; it’s just that any fixed formal system can tell us only a finite initial segment of that truth. Nicolai Says: Comment #50 July 9th, 2024 at 7:52 am You could ask the P vs. NP question relative to an oracle. Given a description x of an oracle, x \\in L if P!=NP given access to oracle x. Surely L isn’t even in P, but it feels like it should be possible to show that it’s NP-hard. Which is probably one of the less interesting and weaker properties of L, but still … Scott Says: Comment #51 July 9th, 2024 at 8:06 am Gary Drescher #14 and Simon Tatham #38: Yes, on reflection, maybe I should tell theoretical computer science beginners: “I am offering to place into your hands a weapon of almost unimaginable power. With this weapon, ‘hard,’ ‘easy,’ ‘computable,’ ‘uncomputable’ will be no longer vague descriptors but precise technical terms. Vast new realms of knowledge will open before your eyes. But you must learn to respect the weapon. You must use it only as it was meant to be used, and not otherwise. Above all, you must remember that we speak only about the existence or nonexistence of particular kinds of finite algorithms for infinite sequences. The day you demand the weapon tell you whether some specific bit of information is knowable or not is the day the weapon will fail you. I will now set some challenges to test your understanding of this…” Scott Says: Comment #52 July 9th, 2024 at 8:13 am FeepingCreature #39: Nope, there’s the Zombie Misconception again! 🙂 The point you’re still missing is that the computability of f is about the relationship between f’s inputs and f’s outputs—that’s it. It has nothing to do with how hard it might be for us to find the program that maps the inputs to the outputs, which is also an important question but a completely different one. Once more, the view that f is uncomputable, is precisely equivalent to the view that the number that’s 3 if God exists and 5 if God does not exist is not prime. Scott Says: Comment #53 July 9th, 2024 at 8:19 am asdf #40 and Seth Schoen #43: To extend my analogy from comment #50, intuitionistic logic, the rejection of the Law of the Excluded Middle, etc are dark weapons. I don’t use them. If they should ever be used by anyone, they should be used by only experts who know exactly what they’re doing and why. In the hands of anyone else, these weapons will produce no end of forehead-banging confusions. Scott Says: Comment #54 July 9th, 2024 at 8:28 am John Baez #41: Oh, there are lots more zombie misconceptions in TCS! And I love your idea of collecting a list of them; maybe I’ll try that in a future post. Just off the top of my head, for example, there’s “but if time travel to the past is possible, then P=NP, regardless of what the math says!” I.e. conflating the mathematical question of whether P=NP, with the (equally profound) question of whether NP-complete problems are efficiently solvable by any physical means. Having said that, the misapplication of infinite or asymptotic concepts to individual instances is probably indeed the elementary TCS misconception that I most often encounter in the wild (at least, say, once per week), partially justifying the title “The Zombie Misconception.” Alex Shibakov Says: Comment #55 July 9th, 2024 at 8:45 am As you write in #47, the ZFC status of BB(1000) is tricky. For a given correct value x of BB(1000) there is no ZFC proof of correctness but for any wrong x there is a ZFC proof of that: if x is too small than a TM that runs longer that x steps is (the basis of) such a proof and if x is too large, simply run every machine in the pool to show none of them stop exactly after x steps. An even more intriguing and depressing thought is that ZFC itself is inconsistent but the proof of that is so unimaginably long that we will never be able to see it in full. It may even derive some of its expressive power from this inconsistency. So all we are doing is living in this `local bubble of consistency’ without ever being able to perceive the full truth. This also means that if there is a theory that establishes a certain value for BB(1000) we will forever be ignorant if it and ZFC are equiconsistent. Nick Drozd Says: Comment #56 July 9th, 2024 at 9:03 am Scott #52 Constructivists don’t reject the Law of Excluded Middle. They just accept only those instances which have been proved. And constructive logic is not some niche specialty topic: it’s the reality on the ground for anyone who uses theorem provers (Coq, Lean, etc). When it comes to actually using computers to compute stuff, it’s clear that general LEM — accepting every single instance as perfectly valid — is wild and extravagant. Real-world provers will not prove BB to be total. Functions like that will be flagged as partial. The partial flag is contagious, so that any function that relies on a partial function is itself flagged as partial. So on the one hand there are constructivist extremists who would eliminate any talk of uncomputable functions as meaningless. Of course, that is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. There are lots of interesting things to be said about BB, BBB, etc, in spite of (and because of!) various difficulties. On the other hand there are classical extremists who think that it is just pointless nitpicking to bother with these distinctions, and it’s too much work to sort out the details, and the whole endeavor only serves to shackle the power of true mathematical thinking. Far from throwing the baby out with the bathwater, classical extremists don’t even recognize a difference between the two! Personally I am open to all sorts of reasoning about uncomputable and uncountable entities, provided that the proof / reasoning resources involved are made explicit and sharply delineated. Dominik Lukes Says: Comment #57 July 9th, 2024 at 9:03 am I’d like to ponder a bit on your final question – “how to keep this zombie down?” I think this sort of misconception is the inevitable consequence of learning. We all need to go through these steps and have multiple such misconceptions corrected. But they are never corrected perfectly – which is why many persist in the published literature. But in some ways the internet popularization has made easier to engage in “drive-by” learning without the close-knit community to exercise corrective messaging on common misconceptions. All teachers get these ‘naive’ questions from students in private but because you engage in such public popularization you are bound to see more of them. I find your blog useful precisely because it also addresses misconceptions and gives me useful feedback on my own thinking – I usually get to ask silly questions in private and then read the answers when you address them here. Having reference posts like these is very useful because people who are having similar conversations can point others to them. I think this is about as good as it can ever get on this issue. But the bigger question is whether we can keep these misconceptions from multidisciplinary efforts where they can actually do more harm. I like Gelman’s repeated points: thinking about this is hard, it’s easy to make mistakes, getting and giving feedback on thinking is a part of the process. Johnny D Says: Comment #58 July 9th, 2024 at 9:25 am The following has bothered me for 4 decades. Please help! Classifying closed manifolds of dimension 4 or greater is one of these problems that any finite formal system only gives a partial answer. Since string theory is in greater than 4 dimensions of space, isn’t modeling reality with string theory as practical as modeling it with bb function? Milan Says: Comment #59 July 9th, 2024 at 9:25 am Maybe the misconception is aggravated by our use of the English language in describing programs. Conditionals, assignments and quantifiers can all be used to describe source code in a specific programming language, the abstract workings of a program and a statement about programs. Take the problem from the beginning of the post: > Let f:{0,1}*→{0,1} be the constant 1 function if God exists, or the constant 0 function if God does not exist. Is f computable? (Hint: The answer does not depend on your religious beliefs.) If I forget for a moment that I already know what the sentence means, I could understand three or four different questions: 1) If God exists, I ask: “Is the constant 1 function computable?” If God does not exist, I ask instead: “Is the constant 0 function computable?” 2) If God exists, I define: “f is the constant 1 function.” If God does not exist, I define instead: “f is the constant 0 function.” And now, having defined a simple f without knowing what it is, I ask: “Is f computable?” 3a) I ask: “Is there a computer program which does the following: We give it all our philosophy and science books as input, and it determines whether God exists, outputting either 0 or 1. It must be correct at least mumble mumble epsilon mumble distribution over worlds mumble mumble.” 3b) The same setup as 3a), but instead of being a passive consumer of information, the program instantiates an active agent in the world. The program does not need our input. Instead, it constructs telescopes and Von Neumann probes and goes searching for God. After some time, it will be certain of the answer. And then it will finally output a single 0 or a single 1, depending on the answer it found. Does such a program exist? The cases differ in how the conditional in the problem description is understood: In 1), the conditional of the problem description is turned into a disjunction of propositions about programs. In 2), the conditional is used to change which definition we bind to a function, but not inside of the function. In 3a) and 3b), the conditional is used inside of the function/program that we seek. For 3a), the notion of computability could apply, if we imagine measuring the performance in different universes. I would not describe 3b) as a problem about computability in the normal sense. A careful reading of the problem should evoke 2). I think 1) and 2) are equivalent and that 1) is even clearer. But when I first learned math, upon hearing the problem, all the different cases would have formed a big tangle in my mind. I blame the language at least a little bit. Explicitly listing these cases and sternly pointing to 2) may be good pedagogy. Scott Says: Comment #60 July 9th, 2024 at 10:01 am Nick Drozd #56: Here’s a better way of putting my point. Constructive logic, and anything less than total acceptance of LEM, are best thought of as technical tools for people doing formal verification. I’ll take your word that they’re great for that! The way to get endless nonsense is to inflate them into metaphysical claims about how to reason about what’s objectively true in the world. In the real world, if you should do X if God exists, and you should also do X if God doesn’t exist, then you should do X, end of story. Likewise, if someone proves that Riemann Hypothesis follows from P=NP and also from P≠NP, they’ve proved the Riemann Hypothesis. By analogy, there’s a whole class of howlers in the foundations of quantum mechanics that comes from taking approximation methods that are occasionally useful in dealing with the Schrödinger equation in practice (eg the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevski equation, hidden-variable models based on fluid mechanics), and inflating them into metaphysical claims about what’s actually true about the world. Peter Donis Says: Comment #61 July 9th, 2024 at 10:14 am @Scott #52: “It has nothing to do with how hard it might be for us to find the program that maps the inputs to the outputs, which is also an important question but a completely different one.” But you’re still assuming that there *is* such a program, correct? In other words, you’re assuming that there is *some* program that *computes* whether or not God exists, so that the overall function knows what to output. Which, when made explicit, does not seem like an assumption that you can just help yourself to. Or are you instead assuming that the function can make use of an Oracle that just *tells* it whether or not God exists? Scott Says: Comment #62 July 9th, 2024 at 10:20 am Peter Donis #61: In other words, you’re assuming that there is *some* program that *computes* whether or not God exists.

Or are you instead assuming that the function can make use of an Oracle that just *tells* it whether or not God exists? No. Neither. You’re still in the grip of the Misconception. I’m “assuming” that there’s a program that always outputs 1, and another program that always outputs 0. And if you like, I’m “assuming” the Law of the Excluded Middle, which implies that f is computed by one of those programs (for purposes of the question, it doesn’t matter which). That’s all. The existence nor nonexistence of a program to decide God’s existence (whatever we mean by that) never enters into it—that’s just a totally different question from the one that was asked. Peter Donis Says: Comment #63 July 9th, 2024 at 10:32 am Re my #61: after reading Milan #59, I see the point, but I think the question as it’s phrased is more a test of reading comprehension than math misconceptions. If we define f0 as the constant function that takes no input and outputs 0, and f1 as the constant function that takes no inputs and outputs 1, then the question can be rephrased as: “The label f refers to f1 if God exists and f0 if God does not exist. Does the label f refer to a computable function?” Put this way, the answer is obviously yes (at least as long as we accept the Law of the Excluded Middle for this case, as you say in #60). However, the way the original question is phrased invites the reader to imagine a third function fG, which is defined as: “Compute whether or not God exists. If God exists, output the result of f1, otherwise output the result of f0.” *This* function is *not* computable unless whether or not God exists is computable. Scott Says: Comment #64 July 9th, 2024 at 10:47 am Peter Donis #63: I mean, yes, reading comprehension is a big part of math (and any other technical field, along with most nontechnical fields)! And it’s totally fair game to say: if a problem “invites” you to give a wrong answer based on an irrelevant consideration that the problem never mentioned, then that’s a wonderful opportunity to hone your intuitions so you become less likely to do that (hence why Sipser gave this as homework). Jim Hefferon Says: Comment #65 July 9th, 2024 at 10:47 am Thanks for a most enjoyable blog. To follow up on Simon Tatham and John Baez: when students repeatedly get something like this wrong, and I see it also in my students, then folks who teach (and write texts) should look into adjusting how they present the topic. For instance, it might make sense in Sipser’s text to move this from an exercise to being directly addressed in class (assuming that he sees it among his audience). It also makes sense for these folks to see if they can understand why students are making this mistake, such as by asking them (the StackExchange group is another good resource). For instance, are students forming a wrong mental model, or confused about fine point in the definition? There is a lot of work to be done here that could help make things better. Jay L Gischer Says: Comment #66 July 9th, 2024 at 10:49 am I love Sipser’s question. I wish I could have used it when I was teaching. I think the issue stems from “functions as first-class objects”. This comes up in programming languages too. Maybe in other branches. This was a definite leap I had to take. Scott Says: Comment #67 July 9th, 2024 at 10:51 am On reflection, maybe it would help some people to consider a function f that encodes the halting problem if God exists, or the solvability problem for Diophantine equations if God doesn’t exist. Is this f computable? The answer is no, it isn’t, but the reason why not has nothing to do with God; it’s simply that the halting problem and Diophantine equations are both uncomputable. Scott Says: Comment #68 July 9th, 2024 at 10:55 am Jim Hefferon #65: I actually think this could work great as homework. If students are confused, let them sit and discuss it among themselves until enlightenment dawns. Peter Donis Says: Comment #69 July 9th, 2024 at 11:00 am @Scott #64: “it’s totally fair game to say: if a problem “invites” you to give a wrong answer based on an irrelevant consideration that the problem never mentioned, then that’s a wonderful opportunity to hone your intuitions so you become less likely to do that” Oh, definitely. I’m not saying the question isn’t a good opportunity for learning. I’m just saying that, before you conclude from someone’s answer that they have a misconception about computability, you should first make sure they don’t just have a simpler misconception about which question you actually asked. I am an example of the latter. Ashley Says: Comment #70 July 9th, 2024 at 11:09 am Hi Scott, Maybe, after you have linked them to this blog post, you could also point them to the following for a more general solution- https://x.com/wtgowers/status/1715037875786457420 Danylo Yakymenko Says: Comment #71 July 9th, 2024 at 11:20 am Scott #49 Agree, it seems the consensus is that an absolute mathematical truth exists, however, there is no way to verify all of it by a finitely described method. On the other hand, we have a way to extend any such finite method to verify a strictly larger portion of the truth. I still can’t wrap my head around it. Although, today I’m less worried about it since QM scrambles the notion of the truth even more severely 🙂 fred Says: Comment #72 July 9th, 2024 at 11:31 am I think there might be a difficulty with computability because it isn’t anchored in reality since any Turing machine has a finite number of states but it has an infinite memory/tape, but then BB(n) refers to n-state Turing machines, and when n is potentially an infinite sequence, then the state (program) of the Turing machine is itself unbounded. At that point data memory and program memory are the same and potentially unbounded (it also comes up when considering that a Turing machine can simulate Turing machines with bigger states thanks to its infinite tape). And then we ask whether an infinite program (takes infinite memory to store it) counts as a computable realization? That’s like when we say BB(5) is computable because the program itself just needs to output BB(5). And then BB(n) with nRH and P!=NP -> RH. From a constructivist point of view, this is certainly not nothing. For one thing, it means that any search for RH counterexamples can be called off, since no counterexamples exist. And yet, the proof is still kinda crummy. It’s really two proofs, one of which of is good and one of which is nonsense, and there’s no indication which is which. A constructive proof would be much better. It would give a clearer picture of the mathematical universe. It would be more useful for calculations. It would even be morally better — a truly non-constructive proof has a certain chickenshit quality to it. Again, a non-constructive proof is certainly better than no proof at all, it’s just not as good as a constructive proof. And I don’t see any reason to efface the distinction. By the way, for the various prize problems in math, are there published guidelines for proof standards? Are there different prize committees with different policies? fred Says: Comment #75 July 9th, 2024 at 11:44 am Maybe this is a dumb objection, but either “God exists” or “God does not exist” could be ill-defined. Like the function f that outputs 0 if the sentence “this is a lie” is true and outputs 1 if the sentence “this is a lie” is false (self-reference creating an oscillating state). Or the function f that outputs 0 if “yellow is smaller than blue” and outputs 1 if “yellow is not smaller than blue” (comparison of incompatible categories). Scott Says: Comment #76 July 9th, 2024 at 11:50 am fred #72: Don’t make this more complicated than it is! An integer function is computable if there’s a Turing machine that computes it on all inputs. Otherwise, it’s uncomputable. So for example, f(n)=n2 is computable, but BB(n) is uncomputable (because it would let us solve the halting problem). Christopher Says: Comment #77 July 9th, 2024 at 11:53 am Okay, here’s my take on informally what “x is computable” means, where x is an expression instead of just a numeral. When I say “x is computable”, it means that I know of a specific algorithm that outputs x. If I say “x is uncomputable”, it means that I don’t know which specific algorithm outputs x. Under this definition “BB(6) is uncomputable” is technically true, but that can change in the future. In particular, this terminology can only be used casually since “knowledge” is vague and changeable. Open problems are also generally “uncomputable” in this sense (I don’t know any open problems where we know which algorithm decides it). Finally (and this is quite weird), in constructive mathematics we can ask “is there a 6th busy beaver number”, and we can not immediately say “yes, there is”! Assuming that the proof for BB(5) is constructive, than that establishes that “is there a 5th busy beaver” can be answered with “yes”, even to a constructivist. This is similar to but not the same as the formalist position. In particular, a platonic constructivist would say that “is there a 6th busy beaver number” has an objective “platonically real” truth value independent of any particular foundation, but that they do not know it yet (just like a platonic set theorist says the continuum hypothesis has a definite truth value despite it being independent of ZFC). Scott Says: Comment #78 July 9th, 2024 at 12:00 pm Christopher #77: Not what any of those terms mean in any language that I speak. (And you probably know that, but I thought I should warn others!) Pierpaolo Frasa Says: Comment #79 July 9th, 2024 at 12:09 pm Only half-jokingly: Maybe the function that takes as an input a complete description of the universe and returns true iff there exists a God in that universe is not computable. Of course, it’s practically utterly meaningless to talk about such a “function” (even leaving aside philosophical questions such as whether the universe is even finitely describable at all), but maybe this version gets at the heart of what the “God is uncomputable” people would like to express? I think in a way this ties in with the point made in #13 – we care about theoretical noncomputability because it’s a hint that you (usually) can’t “cheat” on particular instances either. So if this mystical cross-universe function was uncomputable, it would provide a hint as to why nobody has answered the question in our world yet. (Of course, there’s also the possibility that the existence of God is completely independent of the entire physical universe, and in that sense, the function wouldn’t even be well defined… which might be my preferred answer) fred Says: Comment #80 July 9th, 2024 at 12:13 pm Scott #76 Ok, so I guess BB(n) and Chaitin’s Constant are somewhat equivalent (i.e. as hard to compute for a given N)? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant Scott Says: Comment #81 July 9th, 2024 at 12:14 pm Matthew House #73: Ah! Now we’re dealing with a different misconception, one that I’d give the honor of calling the Zombie Misconception of Metamathematics. Talking about “standard models” versus “nonstandard models” of the natural numbers presupposes that we’re talking about first-order axioms and models of those axioms. But in that case I’m already off the train! See, I knew what a natural number was long before I knew what a first-order axiom was. And—here’s the crucial part—if I didn’t already know what natural numbers were, then I couldn’t have understood axiomatic theories either, since the latter presuppose computation and arithmetic. In other words, I claim that the entire way of talking about this where we need axioms to “undergird our confidence in arithmetic” is bass-ackwards. Notably, set theory is fundamentally different. There, we really do conjure entities into existence that we have no way of talking about other than via our axiomatic theories. And if two such theories disagree about the properties of those entities, maybe not even God could resolve the disagreement. Maybe there’s no truth of the matter at all. But arithmetic and finite computation are special, because they’re the ground of everything else in math. I don’t need an axiomatic theory to tell me that 2+2=4 or that the BB function is well-defined (even though PA and ZF do tell me). And if an axiomatic theory said that 2+2=5 or that BB was not well-defined, then so much the worse for the theory. Scott Says: Comment #82 July 9th, 2024 at 12:20 pm Nick Drozd #74: – You’re very welcome to say that a constructive proof is better. You’re not welcome to say that a nonconstructive proof is not a proof. – If you agree with Arthur C. Clarke, then I’d say you should be terrified and that’s all there is to it! 😄 – For the Clay problems, they convene a jury to start reviewing a claimed solution two years after it’s published in a journal. They don’t specify the standards beyond that iirc. Christopher Says: Comment #83 July 9th, 2024 at 12:45 pm Technical point RE: “Now say it is proved that P=NP -> RH and P!=NP -> RH.

I think this is the case for all of the millennium prize problems, but I’m not sure. Pierre B. Says: Comment #84 July 9th, 2024 at 12:53 pm There is a speculation that Goldbach conjecture might be expressible with BB(6). Given that this conjecture might not be provable, then BB(6) might be unknowable, so uncomputable. Even without that, there is a contracdiction in your post since you claim BB(745) can implement an unprovable statement, thus uncomputable, and yet you claim individual BB numbers are always computable. Matthew House Says: Comment #85 July 9th, 2024 at 12:57 pm Scott #79: Of course I have a good intuitive idea of the natural numbers, and so do you. But I don’t think that this idea is inherently sufficient to make all claims of the natural numbers that BB(n) wants to make. When we make metamathematical claims about models and axioms, we’re usually working in a fairly weak metatheory. We only need very basic forms of induction to make sense of completeness, consistency, etc. None of these forms should be objectionable, except to strict finitists. But when we make claims about BB(n), we find that what we were acceptably doing is no longer sufficient at some point. We find that some machines don’t appear to halt no matter how long we look at them, but no amount of simple induction helps us extend this to all integers! So we upgrade our notion of induction to a stronger form which does prove these machines non-halting, even if this stronger induction is slightly less immediately acceptable. But this is eventually insufficient again, so we upgrade our notion of induction again, and so on. Yet we can’t keep upgrading our notion of induction forever: at some point we’ll accidentally add something that is inconsistent, or that asserts the existence of numbers that can’t truly be found anywhere. So BB(n) seems to shake one’s confidence in how well-understood the natural numbers really are: no simple inductive understanding can capture all the properties we want to talk about, nor can any process contradict an incorrect understanding within a reasonable time! In other words, I’d draw a distinction between “the natural numbers under the forms of induction sufficient for talking about metamathematics”, which are intuitive, well-behaved, and quite necessary for grounding everything, vs. “the general set of natural numbers that second-order theories operate on, where every possible statement about all natural numbers has a truth value”. > I don’t need an axiomatic theory to tell me that 2+2=4 or that the BB function is well-defined (even though PA and ZF *do* tell me). First off, I’d say 2+2=4 is quite different in form than statements about BB(n), in that the former has no quantifiers at all, and only needs to talk about a few numbers. Second off, I don’t think it really helps us here if PA or ZF can say something to the extent that “the BB function is well-defined”, if they can’t connect it back to the first order. Here, our standard-model objector would say that such a theorem is provable in PA or ZF using LEM, but not necessarily meaningful as far as reality goes. After all, just because PA + ¬Con(PA) says that “the witness to ¬Con(PA) exists” doesn’t mean that we should listen to it! And I don’t see any a priori way to distinguish between the trustworthiness of ZF and of PA + ¬Con(PA), except via obviousness. But obviousness can’t last forever.

And—here’s the crucial part—if I didn’t already know what natural numbers were, then I couldn’t have understood axiomatic theories either, since the latter presuppose computation and arithmetic. I think there is quite a bit of merit to the idea that arithmetic being not apriori. Reason: it’s clear that the laws of physics “still work” in nonstandard models, and thus our entire universe could be in one. For example, perhaps there is an alternate universe whose laws of physics are run in a nonstandard model M of arithmetic, and Scott’s blog regularly gets a nonstandard number of comments. Would the Scott in that universe be able to tell he is M instead of in the standard model? The first place this would be noticeable is in the meta-mathematical of our axiomatic systems as it turns out. For example, maybe in M the statement “PA is inconsistent” holds. In this case, M Scott could write down a proof of 0=1 starting from the PA axioms, and none of the other M mathematicians could find the error. This could be the case even if M itself is a model of Peano Arithmetic (“Peano Arithmetic+’Peano Arithmetic is inconsistent'” is consistent). So, how do you know that you’re standard model Scott and not M Scott? Jair Says: Comment #87 July 9th, 2024 at 1:03 pm I love the exercise, but I feel it’s leading to a bit of confusion due to lack of well-definedness of God, which is just a distraction from the basic math issue. I mean, can you formally prove the theorem that “if f is the constant 1 function if God exists, or the constant 0 function if God does not exist, then f is computable”? No, because defining f requires also defining the existence of God. Maybe you could use something like the Continuum Hypothesis in place of the existence of God. Then the same point stands, but this is now a theorem that could be formulated and proven in, say, Lean. Peter Donis Says: Comment #88 July 9th, 2024 at 1:16 pm @fred #75: “either “God exists” or “God does not exist” could be ill-defined.” In the terminology of my post #63, this would be a problem in deciding which function, f0 or f1, the label f would refer to. But it would still be irrelevant to the question of whether the function the label f refers to is computable, since that function still is going to end up being either f0 or f1, and both are computable. Your other functions f are analogous to the function fG in my post #63: they might not be computable, but they are not functions that the question is even asking about. The question is not talking about a *function* f that could call either f0 or f1 depending on something else. The question is talking about a *label* f that could refer to either f0 or f1, we just might not have any easy way of telling which. But both f0 and f1 are obviously computable, so which one ends up being the referent of the label f doesn’t matter. There is no third function in the question whose computability is difficult to decide. Scott Says: Comment #89 July 9th, 2024 at 1:18 pm Pierre B #84: there is a contracdiction in your post since you claim BB(745) can implement an unprovable statement, thus uncomputable, and yet you claim individual BB numbers are always computable. With some of these comments I feel like I’m marking problem sets with a red pen! “Unprovable, thus uncomputable” is where you go off the rails here. Those two adjectives aren’t even meant for the same type of thing. Scott Says: Comment #90 July 9th, 2024 at 1:24 pm Matthew House #85: To get that BB is well-defined, I need the following. – A given Turing machine either halts or doesn’t halt on a blank input. – If it halts, it does so in some positive integer number of steps. – A finite set of integers has a maximum. Which of those statements do you dispute? Note that I didn’t need to say anything about PA or ZF or models or induction schema or anything like that. fred Says: Comment #91 July 9th, 2024 at 1:25 pm While BB(N) is pretty cool, there’s also interesting hard questions to answer about stuff that’s computable. E.g. there are 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 problem instances for 3-SAT with just N=5 variables, it’d be interesting to know what proportion of these admit a solution. Does anyone know if this can be answered without actually solving all the instances? (I guess one could pick instances randomly and build a running distribution of the ones with zero solution, one solution, two solutions, etc). Scott Says: Comment #92 July 9th, 2024 at 1:32 pm Christopher #86: What would it even mean to “live in a nonstandard model”? If you want me to accept that as meaningful, you’ll need describe for me some hypothetical experiment that would bear on the question. Right now it seems to me like a pure confusion of levels—like saying that we “live in Arabic numerals” or “live in ASCII.” It’s confusing the actual number systems that we use (or plausibly could use) in physics, with certain artifacts of the first-order theories that we sometimes use to encode our reasoning about those number systems. fred Says: Comment #93 July 9th, 2024 at 1:37 pm Scott #89 yea, the thing about Turing machines (and computers in general) is that they rely on very fundamental well-defined bit wise operations, with zero confusion or uncertainty about them, so it’s either going to reach some state or it won’t. What’s interesting philosophically is that it’s similar to how we experience reality, i.e. things clearly either exist or they don’t (are observed or are not observed), they don’t depend on some theoretical assumptions. Which would indicate that the world is much more like a computer (Church-Turing thesis, and then the whole “simulation hypothesis” stuff) than some murky mathematical construct (a la Tegmark). Scott Says: Comment #94 July 9th, 2024 at 1:44 pm fred #91: The question that’s attracted the most interest there, is how the probability of there being a solution changes as you adjust the ratio α of clauses to variables in your random 3SAT instance. The big surprise is that there’s a “phase transition” at roughly α=4.25, where the 3SAT instances go from almost certainly satisfiable to almost certainly unsatisfiable (and many algorithms to decide satisfiability need more and more time, the closer you get to that critical ratio). This was discovered empirically 30+ years ago and analyzed by the statistical physicists (including Parisi, who won the Nobel Prize for these sorts of studies); since then mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists managed to get fully rigorous proofs of more and more of the picture. Of course this is all in the limit as the number of variables goes to infinity — a fixed number of variables like 5 would be considered “just a finite computation,” unless there were something broader to learn from it.

For example: does there exist an algorithm that computes the Kolmogorov complexity, K(s), of string s for arbitrary s? It is well-known that the answer is \"no\" — there is no Turing machine that takes as input a string of arbitrary length and computes K(s). The proof is quite brief and involves the halting problem. But if we ask a similar question: does there exist an algorithm that computes K(s) of string s for arbitrary string s with lengthIt also doesn't really matter if a statement is provable in theory or not. Whether or not it's possible to prove that P?=NP, it is either true or it's false and it has always been either true or false, and one of those two programs is correct. This is a pretty philosophically extremist statement (relying on a hardcore version of Platonism) and with my handle I can’t just let it stand unchallenged. :) I’m actually somewhat more sympathetic to excluded middle for P?=NP than for some other statements, so let’s start elsewhere. I don’t think it’s at all obvious that the continuum hypothesis is, and always has been, either true or false. We know it’s independent of ZFC, of course, and there are sensible “extra” axioms that would resolve it in opposite directions (e.g. V=L vs. MM). In order to believe that there’s a fact of the matter you need to posit a very well-populated Platonic realm, despite not needing that kind of philosophical commitment to do mathematics. Well, maybe P?=NP is just simpler than CH. It probably is! But you can imagine a case where it isn’t; e.g. if there exists an algorithm for 3-SAT (call it Algorithm A) which can be proved to be asymptotically optimal, and which runs in O(n^10^100) time if !CH, and exponential time if CH. Then the P?=NP question would be equivalent to CH, and you should have the same beliefs about its truth value. If you’re like me, that means you’re skeptical that it has a well-defined truth value “for all time” at all. reply empath75 3 hours agorootparentIn that case, either of \"return false\" or \"return true\" are valid computable functions depending on the domain you're operating in (with CH or without it). It's the same essentially as a function that returns true if any two lines will eventually intersect. The correct answer depends on whether you're in curved space or not. That the correct answer depends on the domain or axioms doesn't make it non computable. There's just no case where a constant function isn't computable in the technical sense. reply Aeium 3 hours agorootparentprev_the second form surely exists_ Is this true for the BB function though?

All \"beavers\" must halt, because otherwise they're just not considered for BB(n). All the challenge is in proving whether a given Turing machine does (or does not) halt, and therefore must not (or must) loop. Proving \"halt\" or \"loop\" proves the other one.

But the second form still exists (if you accept excluded middle)—you just can’t prove which one it is! Specifically, ZFC is consistent iff ZFC+“Y&A’s machine does halt” is consistent iff ZFC+“Y&A’s machine never halts” is consistent (a theorem in a fairly weak ambient metalogic). So you can take a stronger set theory that does prove the answer, it’s just that thus far we have no reason to prefer theories that answer yes to theories that answer no. (You don’t have to accept excluded middle, and it can on occasion be useful not to[2], but pragmatically you’re going to have a lot of difficulties even with first-year calculus unless you do.)

[big number from Wikipedia] \"exists\" and is \"computable\" in an academic sense, even though its digits cannot fit in our universe. reply calf 8 hours agoprevI think the problem with the wording is that it requires modal logic: > Let f:{0,1}*→{0,1} be the constant 1 function if God exists, or the constant 0 function if God does not exist. Is f computable? (Hint: The answer does not depend on your religious beliefs.) The precise question is would f be computable (i.e. exists a Turing machine M st. f(x) = M(x) everywhere). Would f be computable? Yes, because in either world there is a trivial TM, M = 1_M or M = 0_M. In contrast, the originally worded question \"Is f computable\" is a modally invalid question, analogous to the Sleeping Beauty or Red Envelope paradoxes. It's like, grammatically incorrect. Another way to look at this is the dependency on God or some potentially real fact is more like a compiler directive or pragma whose parameters get filled in later but prior to use, so the question when asked correctly is just about unpacking the strict definitions of function and computable, both of which are explicitly defined in Sipser. reply pdonis 15 minutes agoparentMy reaction was somewhat similar, and I posted along those lines in the comments to Aaronson's post. As I said there, the question is not about a function f that could call the constant 1 function or the constant 0 function depending on whether God exists. The question is about a label f whose referent will be either the constant 1 function or the constant 0 function, we just don't know which unless we can figure out whether or not God exists. To me the question isn't actually about computability at all (the computability of both of the constant functions is trivial), it's about labels. reply furyofantares 7 hours agoparentprev> Let f:{0,1}*→{0,1} be the constant 1 function if God exists, or the constant 0 function if God does not exist.

It's like, grammatically incorrect. I don't think these paradoxes are relevant here. They only highlight a fact that application of the pure mathematical notion of probability to the actual reality is sometimes a non-trivial process. It's not a surprise, if you think of it the fact that the probability theory works _at all_ when applied to reality is extremely puzzling and has been a subject of various scientific and philosophical inquiries (see \"probability interpretations\"). Now the resolution you propose (\"would\" f be) doesn't seem to resolve anything. The purpose of \"god\" question is to force the reader to abstract away from a particular P-NP problem and understand that the whole concept of computability is useless for constant functions. So what you suggest is helpful only if you could also apply it to the original P-NP question, which I don't see so far.

EDIT: And of course this starts getting even more interesting when you analyze G in a non-inertial reference frame. reply bubblyworld 8 hours agoparentprevI think the point is that whatever predicate you fill in for \"god\", the implication is strictly speaking true in classical first-order logic (and probably many other logical systems too). The pragma analogy is a good one. Whether there exists such a predicate that conforms to your conception of God or not is a separate (non-mathematical) issue. I think it's a bit like the surprise people show when they learn that in classical logic a false statement implies everything. Mathematics has strict formal rules, and it's important to leave aside your preconceptions of the semantics of various words like \"implies\" and \"if\" when engaging in it. reply rssoconnor 3 hours agoprevIn my experience, I find that constructive mathematics better aligns with peoples intuitions here rather than classical computer science. For example, we don't (yet) have a proof that there exists (constructively) a program that that prints out the answer to the P=NP problem. I had some commentary in my thesis about this issue with regards to computable Julia sets. Mark Braverman proved that every (quadratic) Julia set is computable. But, as he notes, his proof isn't uniformly computable. Instead he develops 5 machines that attempt to draw various sets (at whatever desired resolution) given the parameter for the Julia set desired. For each Julia set, one of these 5 machines will correctly draw the set. When doing constructive mathematics, the constructive notion of a compact set roughly corresponds to being a computable set in the sense we need for computable Julia sets. We cannot constructively prove that every (quadratic) Julia set is compact. Instead we have to divide the complex plane of possible parameters of the Julia set into multiple regions, and within each of those regions we can prove all of the corresponding Julia sets are compact. In classical mathematics the union of all these regions is the entire complex plane, but this result doesn't hold constructively. Analogously, in classical mathematics the union of the positive reals, and the non-positive reals is the whole real line; however, again, this result doesn't hold constructively. The constructive mathematics approach clearly states exactly what additional information is need to actually realize the computation of a (quadratic) Julia set: that is you must state in which of these regions of the complex plane you given parameter belongs to, which in turn tells you which of these 5 machines you need to run to get actually get the image you want. This is a much more satisfying answer. reply aeneasmackenzie 1 hour agoparentAnd in the P=?NP case Aaronson uses, the answer wouldn't be \"P=NP\" (a classical answer -- totally useless) but the actual function NP->P. People just instinctively know that you need to know which side of the disjunction you're on, and they haven't been trained in classical logic to forget it. reply Xcelerate 3 hours agoparentprev> For each Julia set, one of these 5 machines will correctly draw the set. That's really interesting. Does this essentially correspond to a proof of being able to compute the correct set with probability no less than 1/5? For the question \"which of the 5 is correct?\", is it presumed that there exists a proof that hasn't been found yet or that this is undecidable (e.g., within ZFC)? reply ks2048 1 hour agoprevWhat if we replace P={god exists} with P={there is a cardinality between integers and reals}?

And you can see even in this comment thread that it is not intuitive for people. reply Aeium 3 hours agoprevIsn't saying BB(6) is computable the same as assuming that it is an integer? I thought this was not necessarily true. For example, one beaver might halt after some integer number of steps. This would be the potentially very large integer the author is referring to. Another might go into an infinite loop, and clearly never halt. My understanding of the where incomputability entered the discussion is the third possibility, that a beaver might have complex behavior that neither ever halts or ever loops. The author touches on answering this, drawing the distinction that a specific answer might not be provable. But I'm not sure I understand.

What if a similar proof is made for a Beaver? That a specific beaver is constructed such that 1: It probably never halts 2: Proving that it never halts is a paradox Something like that. If assignment of BB number for BB of that size depends on that proof, then the BB value doesn't exist. And what else would it depend on? How could a smaller number be selected when larger potential numbers cannot be ruled out? reply umanwizard 3 hours agorootparent> What if a similar proof is made for a Beaver? Then we will never be able to find the Nth beaver number for the corresponding N. That doesn’t mean it is undefined or uncomputable. It actually has nothing to do with it. There is a computer program that prints out the number of hairs on my head. Doesn’t matter that you will never know how to write that program. Again, uncomputable is being used in a technical sense here which is why I asked you what definition of “computable” you’re using. reply elijaht 3 hours agorootparentprev“Probably doesn’t halt” is ill defined, it either halts or it doesn’t. In either case, computability of that number is completely separate from whether we can prove that number is BB(N) or decide whether a given beaver halts. Additionally, the way the busy beaver function is defined ensures it has a defined integer output. Computability is just our ability to construct a machine which would print out that number. We can clearly do that for any integer reply jcranmer 3 hours agoparentprevTo be frank, this is an issue where there's an abuse of terminology going on, although the people asking the question probably don't realize there's an abuse of terminology. \"Is X computable?\" is asking if there is a program that is capable of printing X out. For any integer, the answer to this question is trivially yes. But when people are asking \"Is BB(6) computable?\", that's not really what they're intending to ask. What they're trying to ask is \"is it possible for us to figure out what the value of BB(6) is?\" In a more precise sense, the question is \"Can we prove {BB(6) = x} is a true statement for some value of x?\" To some degree, I think Scott is being somewhat specious here. The question may be somewhat malformed as written, but it's also pretty clear to an expert what the question meant to ask, and--especially when you're targeting a more lay audience--insisting on giving the trivial answer to the clearly unintended question isn't likely to help the situation much. reply elijaht 3 hours agoparentprevFor the purpose of the busy beaver problem, your second and third cases are equivalent- it’s a beaver that does not halt.

Looping beavers do not halt. > there is a middle ground between non-halting and provably non-halting Yes, there are turing machines that encode mathematical theorems which are independent of ZFC, meaning they cannot be proven to halt or not to halt. The state-of-the-art is BB(748), which is known to be independent [0]. There are also much smaller known turing machines which encode classically difficult math problems, like the Goldbach conjecture [1]. This means that the value of BB(27) cannot be proven until the Goldbach conjecture is proven or disproven, as until that is done, we will always have something like \"BB(27) is N unless the Goldbach conjecture is false\". However, our inability to prove these things does not change the fact that they have specific values. To stick with the BB(27) example, say that it seems we've narrowed it down to some huge number A, or a number dependent on the first number for which Goldbach does not hold. Call that second number B. We may be unable to find the value of B (doing so would disprove Goldbach), but it is still a specific number. There still exists a concrete value for BB(27)--it's A if Goldbach is true, and it's B is Goldbach is false. [0] https://www.ingo-blechschmidt.eu/assets/bachelor-thesis-unde...

Why is f computable, just because we know the possible outputs? By that logic the halting problem is computable because h(f) is either 1 or 0. reply alexey-salmin 7 hours agoparentAny given program P either terminates or not. So yes, for any fixed P the function that h_p() that returns 0 or 1 is computable. Same is true for a function h_N(P) that accepts only a finite set of possible inputs -- it's a switch case. However a generic function h(P) that can accept any program P is not computable and the switch-case approach won't work. Long story short, the question of computability only considers whether an algorithm exists or not, not whether humans know it or not -- that is irrelevant to the question. Consider the following example from wikipedia [1]: > The following examples illustrate that a function may be computable though it is not known which algorithm computes it. > The function f such that f(n) = 1 if there is a sequence of at least n consecutive fives in the decimal expansion of π, and f(n) = 0 otherwise, is computable. (The function f is either the constant 1 function, which is computable, or else there is a k such that f(n) = 1 if nEach finite segment of an uncomputable sequence of natural numbers (such as the Busy Beaver function Σ) is computable. E.g., for each natural number n, there exists an algorithm that computes the finite sequence Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), ..., Σ(n) — in contrast to the fact that there is no algorithm that computes the entire Σ-sequence, i.e. Σ(n) for all n. Thus, \"Print 0, 1, 4, 6, 13\" is a trivial algorithm to compute Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), Σ(3), Σ(4); similarly, for any given value of n, such a trivial algorithm exists (even though it may never be known or produced by anyone) to compute Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), ..., Σ(n).

I think the key is this paragraph computability is about whether a computer program exists to map inputs to outputs in a specified way; it says nothing about how hard it might be to choose or find or write that program. Writing the program could even require settling God’s existence, for all the definition of computability cares. I guess in this case God's existence needs to be a compile time constant. I saw it elsewhere in the comments but I think computability as defined in Computer Science and used by the author is more strict a definition than you or I are/were thinking, and that is really the main point of the article. People confuse computability with \"can it be computed\".

You don't know _which_ one is the correct function, but it exists. The thing that's not computable is a function that produces an answer given any arbitrary program as input. It's the difference between: does_program_x_halt(): return true and does_program_halt(x): if x halts: return true else: return false The important distinction is that the first function is a constant that takes no input, and the second function is not a constant and takes a program as input. The first is computable(although we may not know right now if \"return false\" or \"return true\" is the correct function, one of the two is), the second is not.

Answering it is not within the realm of computation at all. Computation is simply a procedure that maps inputs to outputs. In this case, whether or not God exists is one of the inputs. It's tripping people up because we can't actually know the value of the input, but the program still exists and is a trivial program. Replace it with some other binary empirical question. Let f: {0,1}* -> {0,1} = 1 if Paris contains at least one porta potty and 0 if it does not. This one is both computatable and you can actually run it with a true input. The one about God is also computable but can only be run with a guessed input. You can't guarantee the output corresponds in any meaningful way to the universe you live in, but it is still a computable function. Maybe it's better to just consider f: {0,1}* -> {0,1}. \"God exists\" and \"God does not exist\" are both possible bit strings on their own. Can a program exists that outputs 0 if it gets one of these inputs and 1 if it gets the other? Of course it can.

Can someone show me one proof which doesn’t rely on “muh do the opposite” (how do we know the halts program can’t detect this and crash with Err(ParadoxError)?) or the circular logic appeal to Rice’s theorem which itself depends on halts being undecidable? I’ve yet to find one. Collatz Conjecture? Only with unbounded memory and time, which is un-physical. That’s something we learned from Ray Solomonoff: the difference between doable and impossible is often a time limit. According to the concept of equivalence, aren’t p and np both equivalent and not, in infinite ways (a “filibuster proof,” just make the argument for and against their equivalence based on their mutual relationship to each counting number), and fundamentally designed to be not equal by virtue of us naming them differently? Finally, what the heck was Gödel thinking to assume we can assign different numbers to zero and the logical not? If the Gödel numbers are off, or even if not, how can an incompleteness theorem be complete? And if the incompleteness theorem is itself incomplete, why should we take it super seriously? Just seems like we take the validity of these fundamentals for granted, and “most computer scientists believe X” is not exactly a strong argument for anyone to believe X, because it’s an appeal to mass belief. Lest anyone think I’m a snooty smarty pants, I’d like to say i think I’m an idiot. Every day i beat myself up for being an idiot. Go ahead and feel free to downvote for this, or call me a crackpot, but a bunch of bedrock ideas of theoretical cs really are weird and suspect - decision problems with Boolean outputs are inherently nerfed compared to ternary ones with options to refuse to answer or to stop programs from outside - p vs np suffers the same problem, since “equals” or “not equals” ignores the infinitely huge elephant of “equivalence” (not equal how?) - Gödel numbering zero (an integer) and logical not (a function) separately is a false difference because zero IS not (to the universe itself) — to say we can’t form complete systems out of items we ourselves falsely separated in the first place is what the universal substrate, if it could speak, might call a “skill issue” reply jcranmer 2 hours agoparentThe joys of responding to someone who is so confused about terminology that you have trouble even figuring out what they meant to so... > How can we justify not steelmanning a ternary approach to halting? I'm not certain I understand what you mean here. In actual practice, the usual approach to undecidable problems--which come up all the time in compilers and formal methods, mind you--is to build a trichotomy of \"yes\", \"no\", and \"don't know\" (sometimes expressed \"timeout\"). What undecidability says is we can't squeeze the \"don't know\" category down to nothing, but in many circumstances, that's just fine. > Can someone show me one proof which doesn’t rely on “muh do the opposite” (how do we know the halts program can’t detect this and crash with Err(ParadoxError)?) or the circular logic appeal to Rice’s theorem which itself depends on halts being undecidable? Depending on how you define \"muh do the opposite\", this may be impossible. The essential crux of the theorem is that once your system reaches a certain level of power, it admits the possibilities of quines, which enables a level of self-reference that leads to paradoxes. The best attempt I can give, that only indirectly reaches into self-reference is this: Let f(x) be a program that returns the size of the smallest size program needed to output x (this is called Kolmogrov complexity). Let h(p) be a program that returns whether or not the input program p will halt. If h(p) exists, then f(x) necessarily exists: for p = 1 to infinity: if h(p) is true: if p computes x: return sizeof(p) If f(x) exists, we can write g(y) (informally, output the smallest integer that has at least a given Kolmogrov complexity) as follows: for x = 1 to infinity: if f(x) > y: return x However, we have a paradox now. If g exists, it has a size, which of course bounds the maximum complexity of its output. But we've just asserted that the output has to have a minimum complexity--and if we choose the bounds right, there's no possible overlap. Consequently, something in the construction must be wrong. Yet I've given the code for every program but the halting program... which means the halting program itself can't exist. reply kaba0 3 hours agoparentprev> How can we justify not steelmanning a ternary approach to halting?

What it reveals is the difference between a well defined mathematical function and a choice one might make or imagine between various such functions (the criteria for which may or may not be well defined). I could replace the question about God with one about whether some other function (which we haven't yet determined the computability of) is computable and it would still be the case that \"the function we have defined is computable\". (Scare quotes because that's actually a category error and the correct observation is that \"both functions we have defined are computable\".

The if-then part of it is part of the function definition. The example is genuinely confusing to me because of the igtheism problem: the idea that the question of whether God exists is a poorly posed one, because God is undefinable. It's like dividing by zero or a type error or something. This was Bertrand Russell's perspective, for example. Maybe the intent of the example is \"here is a function whose inputs are unknown\" but for me it was more like \"here is a function whose outputs depend on an undefinable input.\" The second example didn't seem much better for the same reason. Knowing that the output is prime regardless of the input — a logical conclusion from the \"meta evaluation\" of the function — doesn't seem to me to be the same as asking whether the function is computable. To me it's like having the function depend on a contingency sort of like \"if the color blue tastes like cheese, then...\" It doesn't make sense. If the example was meant to incorporate an unknown state (as opposed to an undefinable one), it would have been better off with a random unseen event or something, like a person flipping a coin in a different room. Or a particle decay in a box, but then that leads to quantum issues maybe which leads to the same sort of problem possibly. reply 5- 10 hours agorootparentprevnit: > if response is true: i've always wondered how people know when to stop (which, i guess, is relevant to the subject matter). e.g. why is your next step not > if (response is true) is true: reply inexcf 9 hours agorootparentI would say it's because this is pseudo code and it is a lot clearer that way.

We don’t know which of the two it is. But equally, 50 years ago we would not have known whether to choose the program “Fermat’s last theorem is false” or “Fermat’s last theorem is true”. Still, the second program has always existed and has always printed the correct answer (at least if you sub in the theorem in pre-Fermat times). reply debugnik 9 hours agorootparentBut \"we don't know which of the two it is\" handwaves away that \"answering P vs NP\" means precisely coming up with the proof! Those constant functions aren't proofs, the proof is in coming up with a series of computable steps to reduce a model of P=NP into that constant function. That is, the proof is the computation itself, not just the constant value. What the author did describe is a function that we can only evaluate when we already have an answer for P = NP, not a function that computes it. reply jltsiren 9 hours agorootparentProving P vs. NP and answering the question correctly are two different problems. Computability is defined in terms of functions that map the input to yes/no. A function is computable if there exists a representation that computes it correctly for any input and eventually terminates. Every yes/no question where the answer does not depend on the input is by definition computable. The corresponding function is either the one that maps every input to \"yes\" or the one that maps every input to \"no\". We may not know which one, but that's irrelevant. In some sense, computability is similar to probability. Your intuition is wrong, and following it only leads to further confusion. But if you unlearn it and rebuild it from basic principles, things become much clearer. reply nyrikki 3 hours agorootparentNit, decision problems are one type of computable problems, but you have other types like function problems, optimization problems, etc. NP, by definition involves decision problems, but many NP-Hard problems are optimization problems. More specifically NP is the set of decision problems solvable by a NTM in poly time with the following conditions: 1) If the answer is \"yes,\" at least one computation path accepts. 2) If the answer is \"no,\" all computation paths reject Equivalently is is the set of decision problems verifiable by a TM in poly time. Modern programming tends to only care about #1, and structured programming paradigm helps with that. People not moving past NP in complexity theory is the real problem here. I also blame using the 'trys all answers at once' NTM intuition vs the max lucky guesser which makes it less silly. But didactic half truths do really hurt. Entscheidungsproblem is better for teaching people in my experience. reply michaelmior 9 hours agorootparentprevPart of the point is that computability is different from knowing how to write a program that actually computes the desired value. We can say a program exists to print whether P=NP (whether it is computable) without knowing how to come up with a concrete implementation of that program. reply alexey-salmin 7 hours agorootparentprev> But \"we don't know which of the two it is\" handwaves away that \"answering P vs NP\" means precisely coming up with the proof! Of course it's a not a proof of \"P=NP\", but no one is asking for it. > What the author did describe is a function that we can only evaluate when we already have an answer for P = NP, not a function that computes it. Yes. This function is still computable though. The question of computability doesn't depend on humans being able to evaluate this function on a given day in history. reply umanwizard 5 hours agorootparentprevCorrect, the author did not describe a program that computes whether P = NP. He merely proved that such a program exists, by describing two programs, and showing that one of them must be the one that computes whether P = NP (we just don't know which one, but we at least know that it exists). reply Sharlin 6 hours agorootparentprevThe whole point is simply that the notion of computability is not related to coming up with proofs or to any mechanical process for arriving at a result based on a set of axioms. \"Computable\" and \"Provable in ZFC (or whatever)\" are just two different things and pertain to different mathematical objects. Functions are computable (or not). Theorems are provable (or not). reply j16sdiz 7 hours agorootparentprev> ... handwaves away that .. These kind of handwaveing are quite common in math. For example, Axiom of Choice assume there exists a choice function. It does not specify how. reply jameshart 6 hours agorootparentprevI think the intuition people want to apply here is that ‘is P=NP’ feels like an instance of a class of questions - ‘is P=x’, and if that is computable, then it implies we can attack P=NP by coming up with a way to compute it and feeding in NP. But I think the issue there is the assumption that it even makes sense to define a function over ‘classes of questions’. reply hAFsc 8 hours agoprevExtremely strange reasoning from Aaronson. He goes from the question \"How hard is it to solve P?=NP\" to a vague existence claim of a program that cannot be concretely written, unless it takes \"P==NP\" and \"P!=NP\" as inputs, which would be a tautology. This claimed program does not answer the above question at all. His students are correct, he is wrong. reply alexey-salmin 8 hours agoparentNo, he's correct. > vague existence claim of a program that cannot be concretely written It can be concretely written. It's either \"return True\" or \"return False\". As of today we don't know which one of the two is this. However our lack of knowledge is not relevant to the question if it's computable or not. Definition of computability doesn't rely on it. > unless it takes \"P==NP\" and \"P!=NP\" as inputs, which would be a tautology. It doesn't take any inputs at all since none are necessary. It's a constant function. The question of computability isn't relevant for constant functions or for functions with a finite set of possible inputs -- they are computable as switch-case on all possible inputs. The problem only appears with functions that have an infinite set of possible inputs where the switch-case approach won't work. You need an _algorithm_ to convert inputs to outputs and sometimes this algorithm just can't exists, regardless of how far we've got in proving truthfulness of various mathematical statements. reply jonathrg 8 hours agoparentprevYou have misunderstood the article. The question being discussed was not \"How hard is it to solve P?=NP\", it was \"Is P?=NP itself NP-hard\", which is just an invalid question. reply mistercow 6 hours agorootparentNitpicking, but I’d say that it’s a valid question with a trivial answer. A problem is just a set of question/answer pairs. “P?=NP” is just a decision problem with a single instance, and all decision problems with finite instances are decidable in constant time. Consider this rephrasing of the question: “Let X be an NP-complete problem. Can X be solved in polynomial time?” This is a problem with an infinite number of instances, all of which reduce to “P?=NP”, so we know that this problem can be decided in constant time. reply alfdsv 6 hours agorootparentprevThe exact wording (as of now, I do not know if he edits) is: \"Could the P versus NP question itself be NP-hard, and therefore impossible to solve?\" That clearly implies solving. Aaronson is pretty sloppy with his own definitions and yet criticizes his students. An unambiguous presentation would be: 1) Contrary to usual language use, we define \"answer P?=NP\" as \"print 'yes' or 'no' or 'undecidable'\". 2) By \"program\" we do not mean a single program, but three separate programs that print \"yes\", \"no\", or \"undecidable\". 3) We claim the existence of the program, not that it will ever be possible to know which of the three programs is correct. reply umanwizard 5 hours agorootparent> By \"program\" we do not mean a single program, but three separate programs that print \"yes\", \"no\", or \"undecidable\". You can think of it not as he is describing three separate programs, but giving three separate possible descriptions of one program and asserting that one of them is indeed the correct description. reply landc 8 hours agorootparentprevSounds like the same question to me, for sure the students intended it that way. Many hard problems feel like you need an internal mental SAT solver to arrive at the solution. Anyway, even if it were an invalid question, his answer still does not make any sense. reply jonathrg 8 hours agorootparentThose are definitely not the same question, NP-hardness has a precise meaning while \"hard to solve\" is a subjective judgement The answer is trying to show the absurdity of the question. It's like asking for the time complexity of factoring 120. If there is no input to the algorithm, the answer is always trivial. reply kazinator 8 hours agoprev [–] That Sipser question is just sophistry. A function F that calculation 1 if god exists, otherwise 0 is not computable. A function definition F that binds F to the 1 function if god exists, or else binds the symbol F to the 0 function if god does not exist, if it can be processed, results in a function binding that contains a computable function. However, the definition cannot be processed computationally, because of the decision that it requires. Someone arbitrarily resolves it based on their religious beliefs. The religious beliefs were pushed into the definition time, leaving whatever function is decided on computable. Problem is, in math, there is no definition time versus run time. There is no difference between: if (god exists) let F(x) = 1 else let F(x) = 0 and let F(x) = if (god exists) 1 else 0 Sipser is assuming that they are different and that some person with religious beliefs processed the first version above for us, and so that we are left with a F(x) = 1 or else F(x) = 0, where our own religious beliefs no longer matter. That only makes sense if we specify that the paradigm we are in is a programming language with definition times and run times, which seems out of place in a book about theory, let alone if it is just assumed as understood. reply evanb 7 hours agoparentThis is explicitly expounded upon in the original: > The deeper lesson Sipser was trying to impart is that the concept of computability applies to functions or infinite sequences, not to individual yes-or-no questions or individual integers. Relatedly, and even more to the point: computability is about whether a computer program exists to map inputs to outputs in a specified way; it says nothing about how hard it might be to choose or find or write that program. Writing the program could even require settling God’s existence, for all the definition of computability cares. reply kazinator 7 hours agorootparentOK, so he has a concept of a time when the program is written and so on. Decisions about how the program is written, or what is to be written, can involve non-computable metaphysical questions. reply zeroonetwothree 2 hours agoparentprev [–] Computable doesn’t mean it’s easy to write down the implementation. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originLink": "https://noyb.eu/en/microsofts-xandr-grants-gdpr-rights-rate-0",
    "originBody": "Data Subject Rights / 09 July 2024 Advertising broker Xandr (a Microsoft subsidiary) collects and shares the personal data of millions of Europeans for detailed targeted advertising. This allows Xandr to auction off advertising space to thousands of advertisers. But: although only one ad is ultimately shown to users, all advertisers receive their data. This may include personal details concerning their health, sexuality or political opinions. Also, despite selling its service as “targeted”, the company holds rather random information: the complainant apparently is both a man, a woman, employed and unemployed. This could allow Xandr to sell ad space to multiple companies who think that they are targeting a specific group. As if that were not enough, Xandr does not comply with a single access request. noyb has now filed a GDPR complaint. Complaint against Xandr (EN) Complaint against Xandr (IT) Background: targeted advertising. If companies want to use targeted advertising to promote their products or services online, they have to go through so-called Real Time Bidding (RTB) platforms. One such platform is run by Microsoft subsidiary Xandr, which allows advertisers to buy ad space on websites or in mobile apps in a fully automated way. When a user visits a website, an algorithmic auction takes place in order to decide which company can display an advertisement. Because a users’ interests and characteristics ultimately determine an advertiser’s willingness to place an ad, Xandr collects and shares a massive amount of personal data in order to profile the users and to allow for targeting. Much of that data is bought by external parties like emetriq, a subsidiary of the German Telecom. Disability? Pregnant? LGBT? Previous research has shown that Xandr collects hundreds of sensitive profiles of Europeans containing information about their health, sex life or sexual orientation, political or philosophical opinions, religious beliefs or financial status. Specific segments include things like ‘french_disability’, ‘pregnant’, ‘lgbt’, ‘gender_equality’ and ‘jewishfrench’. 0% compliance with GDPR requests. According to the GDPR, everyone has the right to get access to their information. However, despite collecting vast amounts of detailed information about people, Xandr reports an astonishing 0% response rate to access and erasure requests in 2022. Xandr even publishes these internal statistics on a hidden website for everyone to see. The complainant has experienced this approach first hand: When he requested access to his data, Xandr claimed that it couldn’t identify him - and denied his request for access and erasure. In reality, the company has all the necessary information to single out specific data subjects. Identifying and targeting individuals is after all their core business. Massimiliano Gelmi, data protection lawyer at noyb: “Xandr’s business is obviously based on keeping data on millions of Europeans and targeting them. Still, the company admits that it has a 0% response rate to access and erasure requests. It is astonishing that Xandr even publicly illustrates how it breaches the GDPR.” (Un)targeted advertising. In addition, the GDPR requires data about individuals to be 'accurate'. However, the available information suggests that Xandr’s system uses tonnes of false information about users. Even from a business perspective, Xandr seems to make a mockery of the idea of targeted advertising. Thanks to an access request with the data broker – and Xandr supplier – emetriq, we know that at least part of Xandr’s database consists of wildly inaccurate and contradictory personal data about people: According to emetriq, the complainant is both male and female, has an estimated age between 16-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 and 60+. The complainant also has an income between €500 - €1,500, €1,500 - €2,500 and €2,500 - €4,000. Furthermore, the same person is looking for a job, is employed, a student, a pupil and works in a company. That company, in turn, employs 1-10, 1,000+ and 1,100-5,000 people at the same time. It is hard to imagine how these data categories can be used for accurate ad targeting. Although emetriq isn’t the only data broker supplying data to Xandr, it has to be assumed that this information is used for ad targeting. Massimiliano Gelmi, data protection lawyer at noyb: “It seems that parts of the advertising industry don’t really care about providing advertisers with accurate information. Instead, the data set contains a chaotic variety of conflicting information. This can potentially benefit companies like Xandr as they can sell the same user as young and old to different business partners.” Complaint filed in Italy. noyb has now filed a GDPR complaint with the Italian data protection authority (Garante) regarding transparency issues, the right of access and the use of inaccurate information about users. Overall, Xandr appears to be in breach of Article 5(1)(c) and (d), Article 12(2), Article 15 and Article 17 of the GDPR. We therefore ask the authority to investigate Xandr’s processing operations and to order the company to comply with the complainant’s request for access and erasure. With respect to all affected data subjects, we also suggest that the Garante orders Xandr to bring its processing operations in line with the principles of data minimisation and accuracy. Finally, we suggest that the competent authority impose an effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative fine of up to 4% of Xandr’s annual turnover.",

Putting the banner up is less effort than reconfiguring your web server to not include IP addresses in the logs, and reworking your tools that currently use IP address such as various abuse detectors to use something else. Note that it is not as simple as hashing the IP address because the IP4 address space is small enough that hashing is easily reversed by brute force. You can probably justify logging IP addresses, at least if you don't keep the logs too long, under GDPR without having to ask the visitor for permission. GDPR provides several justifications for storing personal data besides consent. But it is still personal data, so if GDPR applies then there are compliance costs. For sites that are not in the Union and have no intention of serving people in the Union a block makes sense as a way to avoid that hassle. That's because for entities that are not in the Union determining whether or not GDPR applies when they are visited by people in the Union depends greatly on intent. Article 3, \"Territorial scope\", says it applies if they are offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union or they are monitoring the behavior of data subjects that takes place within the Union. The corresponding recitals says that offering goods or services means that the site envisages such offerings.

Otherwise, corporations will just play shells games (which they already do for all kinds of liability) to reduce the fines to peanuts via limited liability/bankruptcy.

Thus I’m never faced with that dilemma. reply mtlynch 6 hours agorootparentI'd imagine it's more complicated than that. If you use iOS or Android, I'd imagine there's some practice of Google or Apple that you object to, so it's not practical to do it in all cases. In my experience, I try to avoid companies with objectionable practices, but in a lot of cases, all the vendors are varying degrees of unscrupulous. Or the vendors that are ethical have a significantly worse customer experience because they're playing fair against competitors who are playing unfair. So, I'm left to either choose the least bad vendor or face massive inconvenience from not using a competitive vendor. reply baridbelmedar 7 hours agorootparentprevWell, many industries rely on advertising to sell their products, and I wouldn't say those industries are inherently worse than others. reply latexr 3 hours agorootparent> Well, many industries rely on advertising to sell their products I’m not objecting to advertising, but the privacy violations. > and I wouldn't say those industries are inherently worse than others.

Just make more public how good their targeting database is. For example, tell their customers. Might be more efficient. reply londons_explore 7 hours agoprevThe RTB industry is IMO missing a trick by using properties of people for targeting rather than \"info vectors\" and \"bloom lists\". The info vectors would be generated by a neural net based on all information known about a customer. The vectors would specifically not be usable to identify a customer, and therefore not count as PII under GDPR rules. The vectors would be trained to predict the probability of clicking an ad (the pCTR). Using that training metric, everything an advertiser cares about will end up encoded in the vector, whilst no individual private piece of info (eg. sexual orientation) is extractable with any certainty. Notably, these vectors will be addable, allowing multiple companies to add their vectors on one visitor, creating a new vector with even greater predictive strength, but no company shares their private customer data to competitors. The 'bloom lists' will be able to identify customers, but only probabilistically. They will encode data such as \"user bob@mail.com has an account at Walmart, Lowes and Target\". However, the data they hold is only right ~99% of the time, since it is implemented with a bloom filter. That allows businesses to do remarketing to specific users, for example past customers. No individual user could ever be sure they are or are not part of such a filter, and hence it again doesn't meet the EU's PII definition. By using the above two, I believe the total CTR can be increased (since users get better targeted), whilst also giving users the privacy they expect. reply AlexandrB 6 hours agoparentI think a lot of people think that bad targeting is a technology problem, but isn't it also an economic one? It doesn't matter how good your categories are if ftx.com pays for a massive ad buy across all demographics and annoys the shit out of everyone. The opposite is also true - products I might actually be interested in probably don't get enough budget for me to see an ad for them more than once. reply londons_explore 5 hours agorootparentThis is solvable too. If an ad is 'annoying' and makes a customer install an adblock or stop using a website, then the website should be compensated for all the future lost revenue. Thats easy for an ad exchange or publisher to enforce by simply subtracting a factor from all bids from an advertiser to 'pay' for the chance of future loss of revenue caused by said annoyance. That factor would be decided based on data of past customers who stopped using a site or installed an adblocker. There are plenty of other similar factors already in use - they're typically aggregated into a \"quality factor\". They also encompass ads which make a promise but don't deliver (\"Everyone wins an iphone!\"), or otherwise generally leave the user unhappy (which, in aggregate is quite easy to estimate using bounce rate, dwell time, conversion rate, etc) reply staunton 7 hours agoparentprevNo inference made on data is ever guaranteed 100% to be right.

A social security number is a 1:1 to a person, if I understand them correctly.

I guess this may be unintuitive if you're used to \"letter of the law\" interpretations but the GDPR is very much a \"spirit of the law\" directive. You don't get around its requirements with technicalities, especially not in combination with the ePrivacy directive which further fleshes out some of the implementation specifics for cookies and such (e.g. your consent modal needs to give equal weight to \"reject all\" and \"accept all\" if it does not emphasize the former and the former must be a one-click option not hidden behind a second dialog step). The type of data mentioned in the part you cited enjoys special protection in the GDPR so you better have a watertight justification for collecting and processing that data. To be clear: - Assigning a unique ID to a user across requests is GDPR-relevant (i.e. you likely require consent) - Associating that ID with demographic segments like those mentioned in TFA is GDPR-relevant (i.e. you likely require consent for tracking that data even if you infer it) It doesn't matter whether you explicitly collect demographic data or infer it based on behavioral data you collect. There's no way to \"privacy-wash\" this data. All the rights defined in the GDPR still apply to that data. If you want \"clean\" demographic data, you need to generate it without using any data originating from the user and you can not tie it to the user in any way (such as with an ID). So your testing environment using `faker` to generate test customer data is safe. Any production environment is not. I keep saying this but it's best to consider all forms of PII radioactive: you want to avoid it if possible, you need special containment procedures to handle it and you need to audit where any of it came from and where it went until you destroy it. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

The deeper lesson seems to be not to try any of these things in any kind of complicated program, you will fuck it up. Imagine writing something with dozens of threads, each running different programs with various threading primitives sprinkled around. You would never be able to debug it, because just conjuring each case of \"if this thread gets to here and that thread gets to there\" in a test would be impossible. If you're going to use these, keep it simple. What I really prefer is not to share the state at all, just have something like a ring buffer between threads that pass messages to each other. Each thread just sits there and takes things from its input buffers and puts things onto the message queues of other threads. The ring buffer itself uses atomics, or is well tested to ensure none of these weird locking scenarios happen. This way all your thinking is just single threaded, and if there's a sync issue you know where to find it. reply mrkeen 5 hours agoparentIn the mainstream languages, synchronisation seems to be a means (locking code) to an end (locking data). The programmer usually does not care that only one thread can enter a method at a time - that's just the 'how'. The 'why' is that the programmer wants to reason about reads and writes in a multithreaded environment as easily as one would do in a single-threaded environment. Compare lock management to memory management. Method synchronisation is analogous to using stack variables - you don't have to do the work manually, but you can't work across method boundaries. Manually locking/unlocking a resource is analogous to malloc and free. It's prone to error, unless you adopt draconian rules preventing flexibility. What's the GC of lock management? reply zbentley 4 hours agorootparentChannel-based programming, perhaps? From Go style to Erlang shared-nothing, those approaches offer some of the properties you’re looking for. Or maybe the holy grail hasn’t been created yet in this category: a compiler that can transform arbitrary computations or expressions of computational goals into their maximally parallel form, where locks etc. are compiler output artifacts a la assembly instructions rather than things programmers regularly interact with. Some academic languages and frameworks have made strides in this direction, but I don’t know of any that have caught on. reply adhamsalama 1 hour agorootparentWhat do you think of this https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Bend ? reply neonsunset 4 hours agorootparentprevIn the context of C#, most code does not actively share mutable state even if it's vastly concurrent and/or parallel via Tasks or explicit threading. In case the state is still shared, most common scenarios are usually addressed by applying concurrent data structures (ConcurrentDictionary/Stack/Queue) or using a barrier/semaphoreslim. In case where more complex mutable state must be shared in a non-thread-safe way, it is nowadays easily addressed by using Channel where a single reader owns the instance of a particular class and handles concurrently submitted requests in a serialized way. Otherwise, I agree that correctly writing non-blocking code or code with granular locking strategy is extremely non-trivial, and the state space that must be handled for even most trivial cases is enormous and makes my head hurt. Some scenarios can be addressed by https://github.com/microsoft/coyote which simplifies the task, but it is still challenging. Other than above, there exists an F# implementation of Concurrent ML that solves the problem in a CSP-style fashion, similar to Channel above: https://github.com/Hopac/Hopac/blob/master/Docs/Programming.... reply xianshou 1 hour agoprevWhat this really explains is why you should use Python.

There go my dreams of being a C-slinging kernel ninja master. reply YZF 14 hours agoparentI'll give you one tip that covers a large portion of deadlocks I've seen in my career. A lock should be used to lock a data structure, that's it. Corollary: Never hold a lock while calling a function. Most common deadlocking scenario is people taking a lock, calling a function, that they don't know takes a different lock. If you can't get by just taking a lock, touching some data structure (lightly), and releasing the lock then you need to look at your data structures. reply jstimpfle 8 hours agorootparentThat sounds good in principle but is it practical? As long as you have something to do while holding the lock, chances are that implementing that something requires calling a function. That or code duplication. reply Animats 16 hours agoparentprevIt's not that bad. It's helpful to understand what's happening down at the instruction, memory access, and fence level, but most code just uses some kind of scoped mutex. You don't often have to think all this through. The big win in Rust is that the mutexes are tied to the data they protect. The compiler won't let you access data until it's locked. You can still deadlock, though. reply loeg 11 hours agorootparent> The big win in Rust is that the mutexes are tied to the data they protect. The compiler won't let you access data until it's locked. You can get this kind of behavior in C++ with, e.g., folly::Synchronized. reply tialaramex 8 hours agorootparentRust's borrow checker will of course check that if you borrowed the protected item you've given it back before unlocking, whereas all Folly and similar C++ libraries can do here is caution you that this footgun exists and is loaded and pointed at your foot so please don't. reply jstimpfle 8 hours agorootparentThat's just the usual resource ownership management problem that Rust is supposed to solve. But a simple templated type like GP proposed does indeed fix the issue discussed here. To access the thing in the first place you need to lock the correct mutex. Looking at Folly::Synchronized, locking doesn't even return the protected item itself directly. In most cases -- unless the bare pointer is needed -- you will access the item through the returned \"locked view\" object which does the unlocking in its destructor. reply loeg 41 minutes agorootparentGP isn't totally wrong. With folly::Synchronized, you can lock, take a reference, then unlock, and continue to (incorrectly/unsafely) use the reference. The compiler doesn't catch that. folly::Synchronized lockedObj; auto lockHandle = lockedObj.wlock(); auto& myReference = *lockHandle; lockHandle.unlock(); myReference = 5; // bad Still, it is harder to misuse than bare locks unattached to data. reply tialaramex 5 hours agorootparentprevSure, Rust \"just\" enforces type safety. But without type safety a type can't help us much more than the textual advice did so I think that's a really big difference, especially at scale. In a small problem the textual advice is enough, I've written gnarly C with locks that \"belong\" to an object and so you need to make sure you take the right lock before calling certain functions which touch the object. The textual advice (locks are associated with objects) was good enough for that code to be correct -- which is good because C has no idea how to reflect this nicely in the language itself nor does it have adequate type safety enforcement. But in a large problem enforcement makes all the difference. I had maybe two kinds of lock, a total of a dozen functions which need locking, it was all in my head as the sole programmer on that part of the system. But if we'd scaled up to a handful of people working on that code, ten kinds of lock, a hundred functions needing locking I'd be astonished if it didn't begin to have hard to debug issues or run into scaling challenges as everybody tries to \"keep it simple\" when that's no longer enough. reply loeg 39 minutes agorootparentprevYes. reply 4gotunameagain 11 hours agorootparentprevI will play the devil's advocate and say: You can get any behaviour in C++, but there are so many options almost nobody is using them, or using them the right way. And this is coming from someone that has written a lot of C++ and no Rust at all.. reply jcranmer 13 hours agoparentprevThere's essentially three levels of reasoning about multithreaded code. The lowest level is understanding things on the hardware memory model level--knowing how atomic operations work, and being able to build primitives based on these atomics. And quite frankly, there be real dragons here (weak memory models are mind-bending), but--like assembly programming--it's not really necessary to resort to this level unless you really need to care about the performance, and the first rule of performance engineering applies [1]. The second level is the level of the standard multithreaded primitives: mutexes, condition variables, semaphores, barriers, etc. This level is important to learn because it's generally the level of principles of how things work that matters most. But it's kind of like a BASIC programming language: it's certainly possible to write in it, but at scale, you get fatigue trying to keep all of the details straight, and it's rapidly apparent that there are lots of common patterns that could be handled more simply. The highest level of understanding is recognizing that there are a few basic common patterns of multithreading, and if you can just resort to appropriate libraries for those patterns, you generally don't have to worry about the details at all. Chief among these is embarrassingly-parallel code, stuff that generally works with a fork-join model, or generally any sort of pattern that's \"for each element in a large set\", where the work to be done involves no shared mutable state. Speaking of which, the most important thing to take away from any multithreaded programming is this: shared mutable state is inherently problematic. If you can avoid having any shared mutable state, that is ideal. The next-best option is to move all of the shared mutable state into a library that someone more competent than you has written (e.g., a database).

About sixty years ago structured control flow was rare or non-existent in most languages. Want to do X fifteen times? Well, try setting a counter N to zero, do X, increment the counter N, and if N is less than fifteen jump back to the start of your \"do-X\" routine. Simple. Oh wait, sorry, somebody else who wanted to do X is also jumping to the start of that routine, and they didn't set N so now everything is on fire. Today your programming language has structured control flow. You write a loop, the loop does X fifteen times, it's not possible for some unrelated code to just wander into part of your loop unsuspecting and cause mayhem since it wasn't prepared to count up to fifteen. New keywords appeared like \"for\" and \"while\" and \"return\". It's not that somehow a new tool magically fixed the problem, but instead programmers learned to write software in a more structured way using the better tools. Structured concurrency is the same idea again, but for concurrency. It took some time between Dijkstra writing a letter and languages delivering the nice for-each loop we're familiar with today in many languages, and so likewise what we have today as the state of the art for structured concurrency is likely nowhere close to what will be developed over coming decades, but it's already nicer to work with that the chaos of unstructured concurrent programming. reply cjfd 4 hours agoprevHmmmm.... I think the general lesson here is to use concurrency classes the way they are intended as opposed to the way they are not intended. I mean, more or less every code example here is clearly wrong and completely counter to how these classes should be used. Also, don't make things complicated. If your use of concurrency is complicated the chances of being incorrect are about 1000%. reply Animats 16 hours agoprevOh, that's just precious.

    "originBody": "TVs/ Tech/ Gadgets Dear Roku, you ruined my TV Dear Roku, you ruined my TV / A recent update seemingly added motion smoothing with no way to turn it off, and I am losing my mind. By William Joel, senior creative director for The Verge and Polygon, overseeing art, design, and product development. He has over 15 years of experience in digital media. Jul 4, 2024, 2:00 PM UTC Share this story If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Image: Kristen Radtke / The Verge Roku has made my TV unusable. On June 6th, my TCL TV’s Roku OS was updated to version 13.0.0. Ever since, on everything I watch, there is motion smoothing — a TV and film purists’ deepest nightmare. There is no way to turn it off. In the updated OS, Roku added a feature called Roku Smart Picture, which, according to its release notes, “automatically improves picture quality dynamically as users stream.” While Roku doesn’t explicitly mention motion smoothing, or what Roku calls “action smoothing,” the update has made it so that I and many others with Roku TVs see motion smoothing, regardless of whether the picture setting is Roku Smart Picture or not. My TV didn’t even support motion smoothing before this. Now, I can’t make it go away. If you’re someone who doesn’t notice motion smoothing or doesn’t particularly care about it, imagine if, suddenly, your ebook updated so all the fonts were three times as large. Or if your phone decided all video and audio would be played at 2x. Some folks might prefer that, but it should be a choice. Forcing a device to change how a user experiences content that is different than what is expected, with no means to revert or disable the change, is bad. That should be obvious. Related Roku TV owners complain that motion smoothing is stuck ‘on’ after an update Not long after the update rolled out, other Roku TV owners (mainly TCL, but Hisense, too) began posting about the issue in Roku’s community forum and on Reddit. Since I work at The Verge, I told our team about my issue. We reached out to Roku for comment and got no response. We wrote about the problem. Commenters on that post agreed: it sucks. Still, there was radio silence from Roku. Shipping software can be challenging, especially if you’re shipping updates to a multitude of different devices. QA should catch issues, but sometimes they don’t, and a bug is shipped. It happens! So, in moments like these, it’s important to have strong customer support and to be responsive and communicative. What you probably should avoid is weeks of customers flagging the same issue with no meaningful feedback or updates. Possibly even more important, your support infrastructure shouldn’t be difficult to navigate or have their own bugs that hinder their use. In this case, there’s both. Unlike my TV’s new picture setting, Roku’s customer support experience has been anything but smooth. I ran into technical issues sending a community moderator my information. The DM button was missing and then magically appeared the next day. Then, I couldn’t send a message, getting an error that my message contained invalid HTML (it did not). I was even told I had “reached the limit for number of private messages that you can send” even though I was never able to send a message to begin with. When I did finally get through, the response I got offered no solution — and barely made any sense. This whole experience strikes me as something truly wild. If you’re in the business of making a product that plays movies and shows, you should be aware of how divisive a feature like motion smoothing is, as well as how filmmakers feel about it. If your slogan is “happy streaming,” making streaming hell is a bad look. With so many competing companies and products in the streaming world, brand loyalty is something every company should covet. Again, bugs happen! We all experience irritating technical issues with apps, sites, and devices. But usually, a brand wants to address those quickly to keep their customers feeling like they are a priority in fear of losing them to any of the many other similar services out there. It’s possible that, right now, a team is working on a fix. But I’m not holding out hope: it turns out that this isn’t the first time there’s been an issue with motion smoothing. In 2020, on the same Roku community forum, almost the exact same issue happened to a different group of TCL TVs. The very last comment, posted by a user named DigitalFirefly in 2022, is short and bleak: “I’m still having this issue, I wish they would fix this already.” Me, too, DigitalFirefly. Me, too. Roku didn’t respond to requests for comment at the time of publish, but we will update this article with any responses we receive. So, I’m not holding out hope that this will be resolved soon. Because it wasn’t in 2020, and it hasn’t in the last three weeks. Instead, I’m in the market for a new TV, maybe a dumb one that I will never have to connect to the internet.

It's like the frame interpolation that some TVs had to generate 120p frames from 60p. I actually prefer the original 24p (or 24p double-exposed to 48 like cinema projectors do) for films. What really bugs me are the \"Remastered\" versions of songs on Spotify that sound like they were produced with today's audience in mind and doesn't sound like the original recording of the time, which has way more character and inherent texture by the artists without the soulless robo-producer repaint job. That would all be fine, except that they remove the original non-Remastered versions. reply MarkLowenstein 20 hours agoparentIt makes things in the foreground have very sharp edges and seem brighter than the things in the background. They call it \"soap opera effect\" because it reminds you of the way those sets and people are lit. But also--never seemingly noticed--the technology leads to very crisp changes in direction of the camera panning. So you see a very smooth pan, stopping with no deceleration period, and then a quick new pan in a different direction, with no acceleration. It's disorienting and makes everything look fake. IMO this is the most annoying part, but it's hard to identify and articulate. reply hedora 22 hours agoparentprevI got an Apple TV 4K a while back to replace my Roku. It sets my ancient sony 1080p TV to 24 fps when playing back 24 fps content. On top of that, it let me recalibrate the colors using my iPhone camera. Anyway, I bought it to reduce ad tracking, and was pleasantly surprised that it was roughly equivalent to buying a new TV. reply longtimelistnr 22 hours agorootparentYes that is my favorite part of the apple tv as well, that it adjusts output to the source frames and resolution. As long as you have a good looking panel with nice color you'll never need to get rid of it. 1080 can really look gorgeous even with everything today being 4k reply lherron 20 hours agorootparentMy 2013 Panasonic plasma is still going strong with AppleTV as the primary input source. reply devilbunny 16 hours agorootparentWell, short of Pioneer Kuro units, the Panasonic plasmas were the best screens of their time and are still very, very good. reply jnaina 15 hours agorootparentprevSame here. I have a Panasonic Plasma hooked to the AppeTV 4K in the bedroom, and the picture quality is awesome. reply CamperBob2 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat are you doing for audio? That's been my big stumbling block when trying to use a newer AppleTV with an older TV and 5.1-channel amp. I've tried several HDMI audio extractors and found them all to be pretty terrible. reply jmb99 17 hours agorootparentThe best solution I’ve found is an HDMI matrix. If all you need is to connect your HDMI devices to the TV and an older receiver, get a 2x2 or 4x2 matrix, have one of the outputs go to the TV and one to the receiver. This solves the problem where the TV supports newer HDMI standards than the receiver. Now if the receiver is old enough to not have HDMI at all, there aren’t too many options. S/PDIF from the TV to the receiver works, but is lossy above 2 channels. HDMI audio extractors work, but most suck. I had a monoprice one for a few years that was decent, but not great. There aren’t any other options than that though, unless your sources have discrete channel outputs (an RCA jack for each channel), which these days are effectively non-existent. reply kstrauser 18 hours agorootparentprevI have a decent - not great, but decent - Sony STRDH590 receiver that serves as an HDMI switcher. Apple TV and PS5 send HDMI to it, and it selects the signal to forward on to the TV. What’s your setup like? reply neuralRiot 22 hours agoparentprev> I don't know what this looks like but I probably hate it. A simple description would be: It makes film movies look like direct-to-video productions, so basically everything looks like a soap opera. Horrible indeed. reply redwall_hp 13 hours agorootparentIt butchers animation, which is carefully drawn at certain intervals. There's a reason you can pause anime at any frame and it will look like a defined, static image without blurring and smearing. Motion smoothing absolutely destroys the look of the motion. reply kstrauser 22 hours agorootparentprevI've even commonly heard it referred to as \"soap opera mode\". reply pimeys 22 hours agoparentprevFor the second part, 100%. I started years ago already collecting my own flac files, and I'm quite careful on picking the best mastering if possible. In 2024, finally, some of the latest remasters are great (like the new Steely Dans from Bernie Grundman). But between 2000-2015 or something a remaster of an album was usually just compressed to the maximum and made very _loud_. For some of my favorite albums I have multiple masters available, because they can be very different how they sound and sometimes I can't choose the best one. Oh, and for most of the people none of this really matters... reply mrob 22 hours agorootparentEarache Records released several remasters of classic metal albums with increased dynamic range: https://bandcamp.com/search?q=full+dynamic+range&item_type=a...

I only know of stems ripped from games like Rock Band. reply pimeys 21 hours agorootparentThere is nothing official available. There may or may not be services in the internet that meticulously archive every possible master and of course you can go to discogs to buy a physical copy of a certain version of the album if somebody still has it.

I highly value my collection. reply bloomingeek 22 hours agorootparentprevMp3Caprice reply m348e912 21 hours agorootparentThe site seems to sell high quality 320kpbs mp3s but as far as I can tell none of them are seperate multi-channel recordings (aka masters) reply vundercind 22 hours agoparentprevReal film does have (effectively—the aperture’s closed half the time so you don’t see a smear of moving film) a blacked out every-other-frame which makes the perceived motion smoother (some digital projectors can replicate this, though it halves the effective brightness so you need a really bright one for it to work ok) but yeah, I’d take a little judder over faked digital smoothing. It looks awful. [edit] I just mean that an actual film projector does achieve smoother motion than most TVs displaying 24 fps the best they can “naturally”, but a TV’s natural best is still far better than the alternative of alien-looking digital motion smoothing. reply blessedwhiskers 14 hours agoparentprevAnother thing that annoys me endlessly: a few months ago, Apple Music introduced animated cover art and then proceeded to animate album covers that shipped decades before Apple Music existed. If modern artists want to use this for their new albums, or if an artist wants to rethink the album artwork for a remaster, fine. But, Apple deciding to do a shoddy job of moving the Beatles to another layer and having it pulse in and out on the cover of Abbey Road? Fuck that. reply K7PJP 20 hours agoparentprev> What really bugs me are the \"Remastered\" versions of songs on Spotify that sound like … [a] soulless robo-producer repaint job.

My non-Roku TV has this as an option alongside dozens of others I can turn on and off. I'm gonna need to see some data on that. The nearly universally description I hear from regular, non-techie people is \"my TV started looking weird\", especially when they're watching content they're familiar with. If a brand new movie or show looked like this and that's the only way I'd ever seen it, fine, so be it. I remember seeing \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" in soap opera mode on our then-new TV and thinking \"WTF is this and how do I turn it off?\". That's not what Indiana Jones movies are supposed to look like. reply adamomada 20 hours agorootparent> I'm gonna need to see some data on that. It’s enabled by default on all smart TVs. Q.E.D. reply romwell 20 hours agorootparentprevWhich is why Roku decided to take away the option to disable it for people who understand and notice the effect and actively don't want it? Pardon me, it makes zero sense at all. reply adamomada 19 hours agorootparentI was trying to say that we’re in an extreme minority; they didn’t even think more than ten people would disable it. What’s the reason that makes sense? They forgot? reply romwell 19 hours agorootparentThere were way more than 10 people who read, commented on, and liked that Verge article. Both your assumptions (that we're an extreme minority, and that Roku thinks that way) seem to be only supported by the conclusion you make from them. All that said, putting the feature in enabled by default and seeing how many people end up disabling it would be how they could be grounded in reality and avoid creating a shitstorm. Put another way, the best explanation for a metric not being collected is that it's not going to reflect well on the decision-makers. A way more realistic scenario than what you suggest (i.e. that it doesn't hurt Roku, or even makes business sense) is that it's an outcome of a promotion-driven development. Someone's getting a promotion for launching that \"feature\", and statistics that show that people turn it off the moment they realize it's there wouldn't bode well with that. Instead, it appears that the new feature has a 100% adoption rate among the targeted userbase. Modern problems require modern solutions, you know. reply devilbunny 16 hours agorootparentYeah, we are not an extreme minority. My wife - who really doesn’t notice SD vs HD, let alone 4k, if the aspect ratio is correct for the screen - went ape when we got a TV with motion smoothing. I said yeah, I hate that too, give me a few minutes to fix it, believe me I don’t want it. reply moomin 10 hours agorootparentI don’t think I know of _anyone_ who prefers it on. reply t0mas88 21 hours agorootparentprevSame for me. I can't stand watching sports with fast motion or large panning scenes on a low refresh rate screen. But agree with the post above that 24p double exposed is even better. Smooth and no artefacts. Luckily that's an option Sony TVs have by default if you pick cinema mode. reply adamomada 21 hours agorootparentFor sports it’s the one and only time I enjoy 60 Hz content, to the point that 25/30 feeds look like garbage. I mainly watch footer and hockey, slower sports it might not look so bad. reply christkv 22 hours agoparentprevThe loudness war has ruined a lot of music on streaming services for me. Remasters where you lose the ability to distinguish instruments. No way to listen to the original version. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war So it's back to digging out and ripping my old cds. reply RichardCA 20 hours agoparentprevFor the music listening use case, if you can get your hands on a CD and rip it to FLAC that's the way to go. When the CD format first took hold in the early/mid 80's, it was common for the record labels to push out CD's that were just straight digital transfers of the original analog mastering that was used to create the vinyl LP. Now we're here 40 years later, and you can still find those CD's on Ebay and rip them using a program like foobar2000, and the result is basically flawless for all the common playback use cases (I'm not here to make the audiophile argument). I'm also impressed that the 80's and 90's era CD's are not going bad on me. Boomers and Gen-X-ers will always have that box full of treasured CD's, and not a single one of them has failed on me so far. reply einarfd 21 hours agoprevIf you live in the right jurisdiction consumer protection laws might be able to force the seller to get this defect fixed or have them take back and refund the tv. Where I live (Norway), there is a five year warranty on long lived products, which a tv is, and if it breaks during that period, the seller needs to fix or replace the product. Motion smoothing that can't be turned off seems a serious breakage, and if they seller pushes back, you can point out that Tom Cruise and a bunch of other movie luminaries think motion smoothing ruins movies. Not sure what the rules are with software updates after the tv is out of warranty. But I do suspect the seller would still be in hot water, if the update breaks important functionality. reply paulcole 21 hours agoparent> Motion smoothing that can't be turned off seems a serious breakage, and if they seller pushes back, you can point out that Tom Cruise and a bunch of other movie luminaries think motion smoothing ruins movies. Is this the standard in Norway, where the consumer can just call something they personally dislike \"serious breakage\" and demand their money back? Does this work? Would you actually invoke your Tom Cruise argument and expect that to change anyone's mind? Or is the culture there just so passive and avoidant that they'll give you your money back just so you go away and stop bothering them? Whole thing seems wild to me. reply madeofpalk 20 hours agorootparentKind of, yes. Terminology used in Australian consumer law is that devices must be \"fit for purpose\" and of \"acceptable quality\", especially in regards to other similar products. A software update changing the product in a significant and negative way after purchase definitely would be grounds for a \"remedy\". reply paulcole 20 hours agorootparentIt's a TV! It plays video. How is that not \"fit for purpose\" and of \"acceptable quality.\" Honestly just seems nuts to me for the law to be so vague. Why don't they just say, \"Refund under any circumstance the customer feels inconvenienced and upset\" and be done with it? I find that much more honest and easier to follow than what you're describing. Caveat emptor and all. reply throwway120385 20 hours agorootparentI think you're being unreasonable. \"Acceptable quality\" is whatever a reasonable person accepts an argument for. If Roku doesn't want to run afoul of these laws perhaps they should make these kinds of features optional instead of forcing them on people? I remember back in the day when a software update removed my ability to play FM radio on my phone and that was certainly frustrating for me. I personally continued using the phone but I could see how someone who purchased the phone for that feature would be dismayed at its sudden removal. The whole point of these laws is to prevent manufacturers from squeezing people by making products that fail early, or that are difficult to use. If you don't understand why this is important then I'd question how much life experience you really have. reply paulcole 19 hours agorootparent> If Roku doesn't want to run afoul of these laws perhaps they should make these kinds of features optional instead of forcing them on people? Maybe they don't care about running afoul of these laws? Or feel that they are on solid ground? > The whole point of these laws is to prevent manufacturers from squeezing people by making products that fail early, or that are difficult to use. But neither of those things happened in this case did they? The TV still TVs (it didn't fail early) and it's not suddenly more difficult to use. The person just dislikes the update. > I personally continued using the phone but I could see how someone who purchased the phone for that feature would be dismayed at its sudden removal. I guess this is where we differ. Somebody feeling dismayed does not mean the company owes them a refund (in my opinion) and governments should not (in my opinion) be writing laws that protect people from being dismayed with their purchases. reply madeofpalk 19 hours agorootparent> dismayed with their purchases Software updates throw a spanner in the works. They were not dismayed with their purchase - presumably they liked the product they bought. Then Roku changed their purchase through a software update to something they thought was worse. The same would be true if a software update removed motion smoothing as an option if you like it. You can understand how this is behaviour from companies - removing functionality from products through software updates - is something that pro-consumer countries might want to discourage? reply thfuran 19 hours agorootparentprevI can understand not caring about motion smoothing, but I cannot fathom being totally okay with manufacturers being able to retroactively change features of a product after you've purchased it and without your consent. Would you not mind if your car got an over the air update and suddenly had a governor at 70 mph and half the acceleration? Would you be okay with your airpods suddenly deciding that they can only pair with sufficiently new apple devices? Any change that would materially affect the purchase price or decision to purchase absolutely must not be imposed unconditionally after purchase. It's fraud with extra steps. reply paulcole 18 hours agorootparent> I cannot fathom being totally okay with manufacturers being able to retroactively change features of a product after you've purchased it and without your consent. I can! It's a thing that presumably I was happy with for some amount of time.

The software isn't developed for individual users, it's developed according to a product roadmap, which is itself driven by the behavior of the largest and most profitable cohort of users. If you don't fall into that category, you don't have a choice. Things that may be irritating or upsetting to you, if they make money or drive some number that helps a manager get a promotion internally, you're simply out of luck when it comes to software. Products aren't built for individual users, they are built for massive collections of users that generate revenue. reply MarkLowenstein 21 hours agoparentThis presumes that a very large fraction of Roku users asked for motion smoothing/soap opera effect.

It is not, has never been, and will never be connected to the Internet. I have to restart it periodically because there’s a strange sound system bug that makes the audio insanely quiet, but it sure was cheap. It gets its video from a TiVO or an AppleTV box. I’m not using the internal software for anything - I don’t trust it at all.

There’s enough hackability built into android that you can use e.g. tasker or other dedicated macro apps to do just enough customization that it ends up working the way you want. I know I’m the minority and most people don’t care or take it for granted how the thing works, but I don’t. In my case I basically would love if Fire TV never did another update, stayed on old Android 9, and just let me use the three or four streaming apps with my custom launcher – I don’t want anything else, thanks reply lsaferite 2 hours agorootparentAs a related aside, I have a Fire Cube device on one of my TVs along with Jellyfin. I've been ripping all of my Blurays and DVDs to a local NAS with the objective of having my content available even if my internet connection is down.

Other STBs in my home worked just fine during the outage. If I can't find a way to make it run Jellyfin during an outage, it's going in the bin. reply kstrauser 21 hours agoparentprevThat's a solid point! Much as I gripe about my iPad Pro not doing things I wish it did, Apple still sells a gazillion of them to people who think their vision is better than mine. They're a $3T company by knowing what their customers want. I'd be tempted to give Roku the same benefit of the doubt except that the person here on HN who says they like motion smoothing is literally the only person I've ever heard of who did. My in-laws are far, far from tech-savvy videophiles. Last time we visited them I had to set their TV to the right aspect ratio. They'd been watching it that way for ages. And when a software update turned on motion smoothing, they called to ask me how to turn it off because they absolutely hated it. These are regular, non-techie people who just want to watch TV and have zero interest in tweaking or tuning a thing. They are not nit-picky. If it bothered them so much that they had me fix it, I've gotta think there are a lot of people who dislike it. And because of all that, I think this decision is bonkers. It's a hugely polarizing setting. People who like it like it. People who don't tend to absolutely detest it.

Still, there was radio silence from Roku. They're probably working on some slimy PR excuse for why they feel the need to force-feed you an unwanted feature, how it's actually for your own good, and subtly insult you for not liking it.

People are accustomed to seeing video at ~30fps. But old soap operas were somehow at ~60fps, among other things.

Sure, it's smoother; anyone can see that. It's also weirdly smeary or something. The (presumably) 24FPS version has a regular amount of judder, and it's the same amount of judder that I've experienced when watching films for my entire life, and each of those frames is a distinct photograph. There is zero smearing betwixt them, and there is no smearing possible. reply Timon3 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's definitely something that is different from person to person. I strongly prefer it disabled, but not because it looks terrible most of the time - I could get used to it if it looked exactly like it would look if it had been produced with that higher framerate. The issue arises whenever it breaks, for example by making the acceleration of visible motion unnatural. This happens fairly often, either through unrealistic acceleration, or by breaking the previously established visual language of the movie. That's where it breaks my immersion - but that's not the case for everybody, and it's absolutely legitimate to say that you prefer either, or don't care at all! Maybe a good analogy to understand the \"it's objectively wrong\" perspective (even if I disagree) is AI upscaling, for example of historical photos. Just like autosmoothing it adds details in a mostly plausible way, and some people prefer it, but it adds fake detail (which understandably annoys purists), and sometimes it actually breaks and produces visual artifacts. reply thfuran 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I don't know why people want horrible low frame rates.

I’m probably missing a few other proposals, as I only skimmed. Did anyone stop to consider if this is really necessary? The author makes it sound like he has used his influence steadily over the years to make fonts more complicated. “In year X, I proposed that fonts be able to do Y, because why not?” I get that text shaping is so complex, that in terms of open source, there is just Harfbuzz. I’m not an expert in this area. But I don’t think it’s a good thing if “font standards” are constantly getting new features, like web standards, and font renderers are like mini browser engines, where the sheer scope and number of features and rate of new features keeps everyone using the same codebases. reply slimsag 14 hours agoprev> Moreover, the fontations platform, which is the Rust framework Oxidize is producing, will unify font compilation and consumption, reducing the number of places new font-format features need to be implemented from three (FontTools, FreeType, and HarfBuzz) to one (Fontations), which would reduce development cost and overhead. Will FreeType and HarfBuzz remain supported as C/C++ projects long-term, I wonder? Asking as someone who depends on these and doesn't want to introduce a dependency on a Rust compiler :) Anecdotally, I notice a lot of game developers avoid FreeType and Harfbuzz entirely, instead opting for much worse text rendering in the form of stb_truetype.h only (Dear Imgui uses this, for example) - which 'is nice because it is a single header C file' but sucks with international languages; many people use SDFs for similar reasons. I think the proposed move to WASM fonts, if done right, could make it easier to reduce the amount of code people need to render fonts (if the WASM font does the heavy lifting, and a small C program could render it) and alleviate this trend of people not using a good text rendering stack reply jpc0 1 hour agoparentI'm confused.

Check them out! See... the thing about solving problems is that, eventually you realize that any kind of problem can be solved by simply making a platform that can execute arbitrary code. ...and you see it again and again. Declarative compile definition in make? Why not just make it code and use cmake? Declarative infra in terraform? Why not just make it code and use pulumi? Declarative ui? Why not just make it code and use javascript? Database that holds data? Why not just use stored procedures and do it in code? The list just goes on and on, and every time you have to roll back to a few important questions: - Is the domain so complicated you really need arbitrary code execution? - Are you inventing a new programming language for it? - How will people program and test for the target? - How will you manage the security sandbox around it? It's just such a persuasive idea; can't figure out how to deal with the complexity in configuration? Make it code and push the problem to the user instead! Sometimes it makes sense. Sometimes it works out. To be fair, I get it, yes, font layouts are harder than they look, and yes, using WASM as a target solves some of those issues, but I look at llama.ttf and I really have to pause and go... ...really? Does my font need to be able to implement a LLM? I don't really think it does. ...and even if the problem is really so complex that rendering glyphs requires arbitrary code (I'm not convinced, but I can see the argument), I think you should be doing this in shaders, which already exist, already have a security sandbox and already have an ecosystem of tooling around it. I think inventing a new programmable font thing is basically inventing a new less functional form of shaders, and it's a decision that everyone involved will come to regret... reply moonchild 15 hours agoparentprogrammable hinting was already a thing. it's just switching to wasm from a bespoke language reply wokwokwok 14 hours agorootparentIt's still just doing exactly what shaders do, which is crazy. Explain to me exactly why, other than 'I guess someone already implemented some kind of basic version of it' that you would have to have custom CPU code rendering glyphs instead of a shader rendering SDF's like literally everyone does with shaders already? It's not a good solution. It's a bad, easy solution. We have a solution for running arbitrary GPU accelerated graphics instructions; it has a cross platform version with webGPU. This font thing... looks a lot like 'not invented here' syndrome to me, as an uninvolved spectator. Why would you chose or want not to use GPU acceleration to render your glyphs? What 'arbitrary code' does a font need to do that couldn't be implemented in a shader? Maybe the horse has already bolted, yes, I understand programmable fonts already exist.. but geez, its incomprehensible to me, at least from what I can see. reply vg_head 11 hours agorootparent> Explain to me exactly why, other than 'I guess someone already implemented some kind of basic version of it' that you would have to have custom CPU code rendering glyphs instead of a shader rendering SDF's like literally everyone does with shaders already? Shaping is different compared to rendering glyphs themselves. SDF renderers (and other GPU text renderers like Slug) still do shaping on the CPU, not in shaders. Maybe some experiments have been done in this area, but I doubt anyone shapes text directly in the GPU in practice. Think of it like a function that takes text as input, and returns positions as output. Shaders don't really know anything about text. Sure you could probably implement it if you wanted to, but why would you? I think it would add complexity for no benefit (not even performance). reply moonchild 10 hours agorootparentlengyel told me he has implemented some sort of hinting on the gpu for slug (i suspect it's not programmable, but didn't ask) reply vg_head 10 hours agorootparentVery interesting. Honestly I don't know much about hinting, but I suspect the whole shaping stack that Slug supports: > kerning, ligature replacement, combining diacritical mark placement, and character composition. Slug also supports a number of OpenType features that include stylistic alternates, small caps, oldstyle figures, subscripts, superscripts, case-sensitive punctuation, and fractions. Probably still uses the CPU. reply Jasper_ 14 hours agorootparentprevIt has nothing to do with shaders? Despite the name, shaping is not the same thing as a shader, shaping selects and places individual glyphs given a collection of code points. No part of the rasterizer or renderer is configurable here. As mentioned above, the rasterizer is already programmable with up to two different bespoke stack bytecode languages, but that has nothing to do with shaping through wasm. reply slimsag 14 hours agorootparentI agree shaders would be a terrible choice for this. However, the article clearly states there are intentions to move towards much more than just shaping in wasm: > I proposed that the future of font shaping and drawing/ painting will involve a fully-programmable paradigm. > Bad Apple will become much easier and faster when we introduce the draw API in Wasm. > Drawing and painting API will eventually come to HarfBuzz, probably in 2025. reply khaled 13 hours agorootparentThis is still not rasterization, but a way to modify glyph outlines on the fly.

You're conflating varius things reply bsder 14 hours agorootparentprev> CPU code rendering glyphs instead of a shader rendering SDF's 1) Because SDFs suck badly (and don't cover the whole field) when you want to render sharp text. SDFs are fine when used in a game where everything is mapped to textures and is in motion at weird angles. SDFs are not fine in a static document which is rendered precisely in 2D. 2) Because GPUs handle \"conditional\" anything like crap. GPUs can apply a zillion computations as long as those computations apply to everything. The moment you want some of those computations to only apply to these things GPUs fall over in a heap. Every \"if\" statement wipes out half your throughput. 3) Because \"text rendering\" is multiple problems all smashed together. Text rendering is vector graphics--taking outlines and rendering them to a pixmap. Text rendering is shaping--taking text and a font and generating outlines. Text rendering is interactive--taking text and putting a selection or caret on it. None of these things parallelize well except maybe vector rendering. reply wokwokwok 14 hours agorootparentI feel like, looking at the complexity of the programs that can be implemented in shaders (eg. https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/...) that it's unreasonable, bordering on disingenuous to suggest that the GPU pipeline is not capable enough to handle those workloads, or produce pixel perfect outputs. Be really specific. What exactly is it that you can't do in a shader, that you can do in a CPU based sandbox, better and faster? (There are things, sure, like IO, networking, shared memory but I'm struggling to see why you would want any of them in this context) I'll accept the answer, 'well, maybe you want to render fonts on a toaster with no GPU'; sure... but that having a GPU isn't good enough for you, yeah... nah. I'm not buying that). reply vg_head 12 hours agorootparentIt's more about the nature of the problem, not that you can't do it in shaders. After all, I think you can do pretty much anything in shaders if you try hard enough. Even if you already have a GPU renderer for glyphs and any other vector data, you still want to know where to actually position the glyphs. And since this is highly dependent on the text itself and your application state (that lies on the CPU), it would actually be pretty difficult to do it directly on the GPU. The shader that you would want should emit positions, but the code to do that won't be easily ported to the GPU. Working with text is not really what shaders are meant for. reply Jasper_ 14 hours agorootparentprevVector graphics are really hard to do on a GPU in an efficient manner. The way the data is stored as individual curve segments makes it difficult to parallelize the coverage problem, it's equivalent to a global parse; the best approaches all do some form of parsing of curve data on the CPU, either rasterizing fully on the GPU, or putting it in a structure the GPU can chew on. But again, this has nothing to do with HarfBuzz or wasm. reply jordo 13 hours agorootparenthttps://sluglibrary.com/ - game library used in many engines to do vector graphics and fonts directly on the GPU reply Jasper_ 12 hours agorootparentSlug preprocesses font curve data into something without the need for the global parse with the .slug file format. reply moonchild 10 hours agorootparentwhat exactly do you mean by 'global parse'? it's very usual, i think, when operating on data stored in files, to parse them into in-memory structures before operating on them? but it feels like you are talking about something specific to vector rendering slug builds acceleration structures ahead of time. the structures are overfit to the algorithm in a way that ttf should be but which is economical for video games. that doesn't seem like an interesting concern and nothing about it is specific to the gpu reply forrestthewoods 13 hours agoparentprevI don't disagree. But I have kind of the opposite take. I can't count how many times I've seen simple code get turned into a hideously complex declarative language that has serious gaps. Simple UI library code? Turn it into a custom declarative syntax that is now limited! Simple build system that works and is debuggable? Turn it into a declarative syntax that can't be debugged and can't handle all the edge cases! And so on and so forth. I will admit that the idea of a font programming language sounds genuinely awful to me. So I don't really disagree with your premise. But I'm increasingly annoyed with declarative system when vanilla code is often simpler, more flexible, and more powerful (by necessity). :) reply alchemio 12 hours agoprevRustyBuzz is quite limited when compared with HarfBuzz. The Rust fonts scene also seems to lack the necessary momentum to drive things through. I’m not sure whether it’s because the Rust community is mostly interested in webtech or whether Rust itself makes it hard to solve such complex problems. But I don’t see the sands shifting in less than 10 years to come. reply RazrFalcon 1 hour agoparent>RustyBuzz is quite limited when compared with HarfBuzz. As the main author of rustybuzz I'm surprised to hear this. If you need a text shaper, rustybuzz is mostly a drop-in replacement for harfbuzz. Text shaping and TrueType parsing are hard problems, but Rust does not make them more complicated. Quite the opposite. In fact, rustybuzz is written in 100% safe Rust. I would even go further and say that Rust is the only sane option for solving text-related tasks. reply carlmr 11 hours agoparentprevI can't quite see why Rust would make it harder, it's always a breeze compared to working on C++ projects, especially as the project matures. The compiler catches a lot of issues early, which otherwise slow down C++ projects as they accumulate silently, because they should have fixed all warnings, should have used ASan, TSan, MSan, religiously, and should have agreed on a manageable subset of C++, ... but of course didn't.

Fast. 🚀 Crawlee for Python is open to early adopters! Get Started pipx run crawlee create my-crawler Reliable crawling 🏗 Crawlee won't fix broken selectors for you (yet), but it helps you build and maintain your crawlers faster. When a website adds JavaScript rendering, you don't have to rewrite everything, only switch to a browser crawler. When you later find a great API to speed up your crawls, flip the switch back. Crawlee is built by people who scrape for a living and use it every day to scrape millions of pages. Meet our community on Discord. Python with type hints Crawlee for Python is written in a modern way using type hints, providing code completion in your IDE and helping you catch bugs early on build time. Headless browsers Switch your crawlers from HTTP to a headless browser in 3 lines of code. Crawlee builds on top of Playwright and adds its own features. Chrome, Firefox and more. Automatic scaling and proxy management Crawlee automatically manages concurrency based on available system resources and smartly rotates proxies. Proxies that often time-out, return network errors or bad HTTP codes like 401 or 403 are discarded. Try Crawlee out 👾 before you start Crawlee requires Python 3.9 or higher. The fastest way to try Crawlee out is to use the Crawlee CLI and choose one of the provided templates. The CLI will prepare a new project for you, and add boilerplate code for you to play with. pipx run crawlee create my-crawler If you prefer to integrate Crawlee into your own project, you can follow the example below. Crawlee is available on PyPI, so you can install it using pip. Since it uses PlaywrightCrawler, you will also need to install crawlee package with playwright extra. It is not not included with Crawlee by default to keep the installation size minimal. pip install 'crawlee[playwright]' Currently we have Python packages crawlee and playwright installed. There is one more essential requirement: the Playwright browser binaries. You can install them by running: playwright install Now we are ready to execute our first Crawlee project: import asyncio from crawlee.playwright_crawler import PlaywrightCrawler, PlaywrightCrawlingContext async def main() -> None: crawler = PlaywrightCrawler( max_requests_per_crawl=5, # Limit the crawl to 5 requests. headless=False, # Show the browser window. browser_type='firefox', # Use the Firefox browser. ) # Define the default request handler, which will be called for every request. @crawler.router.default_handler async def request_handler(context: PlaywrightCrawlingContext) -> None: context.log.info(f'Processing {context.request.url} ...') # Enqueue all links found on the page. await context.enqueue_links() # Extract data from the page using Playwright API. data = { 'url': context.request.url, 'title': await context.page.title(), 'content': (await context.page.content())[:100], } # Push the extracted data to the default dataset. await context.push_data(data) # Run the crawler with the initial list of URLs. await crawler.run(['https://crawlee.dev']) # Export the entire dataset to a JSON file. await crawler.export_data('results.json') # Or work with the data directly. data = await crawler.get_data() crawler._logger.info(f'Extracted data: {data.items}') if __name__ == '__main__': asyncio.run(main()) Docs Examples API reference Community Blog Discord Stack Overflow Twitter More Apify Platform Docusaurus GitHub Crawlee is free and open source Built by",

I’ve built my own crawler over time, but from what I see, there’s nothing truly unique. reply jancurn 8 hours agorootparentThe main advantage (for now) is that the library has a single interface for both HTTP and headless browsers, and bundled auto scaling. You can write your crawlers using the same base abstraction, and the framework takes care of this heavy lifting. Developers of scrapers shouldn't need to reinvent the wheel, and just focus on building the \"business\" logic of their scrapers. Having said that, if you wrote your own crawling library, the motivation to use Crawlee might be lower, and that's fair enough. Please note that this is the first release, and we'll keep adding many more features as we go, including anti-blocking, adaptive crawling, etc. To see where this might go, check https://github.com/apify/crawlee reply robertlagrant 6 hours agorootparentCan I ask - what is anti-blocking? reply fullspectrumdev 6 hours agorootparentUsually refers to “evading bot detection”. Detecting when blocked and switching proxy/“browser fingerprint”. reply robertlagrant 5 hours agorootparentIs this a good feature to include? Shouldn't we respect the host's settings on this? reply nlh 5 hours agorootparentIt’s a fair and totally reasonable question but clashes with reality. Many hosts have data that others want/like to scrape (eBay, Amazon, Google, airlines, etc.) and they setup anti-scraping mechanisms to try and prevent scraping. Whether or not to respect those desires is a bigger question but not one for the scraping library - it’s one for those doing the scraping and their lawyers. The fact is - many many people want to scrape these sites and there is massive demand for tools to help them do that, so if APIFY/Crawlee decide to take the moral ground and not offer a way around bot detection, someone else will. reply thebytefairy 4 hours agorootparentAh yes, the old 'if I don't build the bombs for them, someone else will'. I don't think this is taking the moral high ground, this is saying we don't care whether it's moral, there's demand and we'll build it. reply jancurn 3 hours agorootparentThere are many legitimate and legal use cases where one might want to circumvent blocking of bots. We believe that everyone has the moral right to access and fairly use non-personal publicly available data on the web the way they want, not just the way the publishers want them to. This is the core founding principle of the open web, which allowed the web to become what it is today. BTW we continuously update this exhaustive post covering all legal aspects of web scraping: https://blog.apify.com/is-web-scraping-legal/ reply beeboobaa3 2 hours agorootparentThoughts on this law? https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A... reply mnmkng 1 hour agorootparentIt’s an “old” law that did not consider many intricacies of internet and the platforms that exist on it and it’s mostly made obsolete by EU case law, which has shrunk the definition of a protected database under this law so much that it’s practically inapplicable to web scraping. (Not my opinion. I visited a major global law firm’s seminar on this topic a month ago and this is what they said.) reply amarcheschi 4 hours agorootparentprevI'm not gonna feel bad if a corporation gets its data scraped (whenever it's legal to do so, and this is another kind of question I'm not knowledgeable enough to face) when they themselves try to scrape other companies' data reply robertlagrant 2 hours agorootparentYou seem to have a massive category error here. To my understanding, this is not only going to circumvent the scraping protection of companies that scrape other people's data. reply BiteCode_dev 2 hours agorootparentprevGoogle and Amazon where built on scrapped data, who are you kidding? reply bmitc 27 minutes agoprevCan you use this to auto-logon to systems? reply ranedk 4 hours agoprevI found crawlee a few days ago while figuring out a stack for a project. I wanted a python library but found crawlee with typescript so much easier that I ended up coding the entire project in less than a week in Typescript+Crawlee+Playwright I found the api a lot better than any python scraping api till date. However I am tempted to try out python with Crawlee. The playwright integration with gotScraping makes the entire programming experience a breeze. My crawling and scraping involves all kinds of frontend rendered websites with a lot of modified XHR responses to be captured. And IT JUST WORKS! Thanks a ton . I will definitely use the Apify platform to scale given the integration. reply sauain 3 hours agoparentwould love to have your feedback on the python one too :) reply barrenko 1 hour agoprevPretty cool, and any scraping tool is really welcome - I'll try it out for my personal project. At the monment, due to AI, scraping is like selling shovels during a gold rush. reply VagabundoP 5 hours agoprevLooks nice, and modern python. The code example on the front page has this: `const data = await crawler.get_data()` That looks like Javascript? Is there a missing underscore? reply mnmkng 5 hours agoparentOh wow, thanks! Will fix it right away. Crawlee is originally a JS library. reply intev 8 hours agoprevHow is this different from Scrapy? reply sauain 7 hours agoparenthey intev, - Crawlee has out-of-the-box support for headless browser crawling (Playwright). You don't have to install any plugin or set up the middleware. - Crawlee has a minimalistic & elegant interface - Set up your scraper with fewer than 10 lines of code. You don't have to care about what middleware, settings, and anything are or need to be changed, on the top that we also have templates which makes the learning curve much smaller. - Complete type hint coverage. Which is something Scrapy hasn't completed yet. - Based on standard Asyncio. Integrating Scrapy into a classic asyncio app requires integration of Twisted and asyncio. Which is possible, but not easy, and can result in troubles. reply mdaniel 2 hours agorootparent> You don't have to install any plugin or set up the middleware. That cuts both ways, in true 80/20 fashion: it also means that anyone who isn't on the happy path of the way that crawlee was designed is going to have to edit your python files (`pip install -e` type business) to achieve their goals reply renegat0x0 4 hours agoprevCan it be used to obtain RSS contents?

(RSS uses XML format) reply holoduke 1 hour agoprevDoes it have event listeners to wait for specific elements based on certain pattern matches. One reason i am still using phantomjs is because it simulates the entire browser and you can compile your own webkit in it. reply mnmkng 1 hour agoparentIt uses Playwright under the hood, so yes, it can do all of that, and more. reply ijustlovemath 6 hours agoprevDo you have any plans to monetize this? How are you supporting development? reply sauain 6 hours agoparentCrawlee is open source and free to use and we don't have any plans to monetize it in future. It will be always free to use.

Nothing. But I personally think it does some things a little easier, a little faster and little more conveniently than the other libraries and tools out there. Although there’s one thing that the JS version of Crawlee has which unfortunately isn’t in Python yet, but it will be there soon. AFAIK it’s unique among all libraries. It’s automatically detecting whether a headless browser is needed or if HTTP will suffice and using the most performant option. reply localfirst 11 minutes agorootparent [–] is there anything that uses a computer vision model/ocr locally to extract data?

    "originLink": "https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/aquaculture/report-nearly-2-million-metric-tons-of-wild-fish-used-to-feed-norwegian-farmed-salmon-annually",
    "originBody": "February 8, 2024 Nearly 2 million metric tons of wild fish used to feed Norwegian farmed salmon annually, report finds Ned Daly Aquaculture Share Nearly 2 million metric tons of wild fish are harvested from the ocean to feed Norwegian farmed salmon every year, according to a report from U.K.- and Netherlands-based environmental campaign group Feedback, as well as a coalition of West African and Norwegian organizations. According to \"Blue Empire: How the Norwegian salmon industry extracts nutrition and undermines livelihoods in West Africa,\" these wild fish are used to produce fish oil for salmon feed, which is contributing to the loss of livelihoods and malnutrition in the West African countries of The Gambia, Senegal, and Mauritania. “Along the West African coast, small-scale fishing is the only means of subsistence for Indigenous communities,” Regional Network of Marine Protected Areas in West Africa (RAMPAO) Executive Secretary Marie Suzanna Traore said. ”The big boats that supply the fishmeal and fish oil industry with fish caught in African waters – to the detriment of these communities – undermine their human dignity.” In the report, Feedback calculated that the Norwegian salmon farming industry’s \"feed footprint\" is equivalent to 2.5 percent of global marine fisheries catch. The report also estimated that Norway’s annual output of farmed salmon is 27 percent lower than the volume of wild fish required to produce the fish oil used in Norwegian farmed salmon feed. The Norwegian industry’s plan to more than triple farmed salmon production to 5 million metric tons by 2050 would create demand for over three times as much wild-caught fish compared to 2020. “While salmon companies claim their ‘blue revolution’ will contribute to global food security by feeding the world, the rapid expansion of industrial aquaculture is fueling a modern-day colonialism – or food imperialism,” Feedback Campaigns Director Natasha Hurley said. “Despite mounting hunger and malnutrition in West African countries, corporate sustainability initiatives are failing to protect West African communities from hunger and malnutrition linked to the voracious appetite of the salmon-farming industry for wild fish.” Feedback estimated that fish sourced from West African fishing grounds to supply fish oil to the Norwegian salmon farming industry in 2020 could have provided up to 4 million people in the region with a year’s supply of fish. Four of the industry’s biggest feed producers – Mowi, Skretting, Cargill, and Biomar – supply most of the feed used in Norwegian salmon farming, and each sources fish oil from northwest Africa. One-quarter of the total volume of fish oil sourced from West Africa by Norwegian companies was purchased by Mowi in 2020, including 5,100 MT of fish oil from Mauritania in 2020, which Feedback calculates was produced from 28,300 MT of fish. Another 17,000 MT of fish oil were sourced by Skretting, Cargill, and BioMar from the major fishing area located off the west coast of Africa known as FAO 34. In Mauritania, round sardinella catches dropped by 66 percent between 2020 and 2021, while in Senegal, they dropped by 86 percent and in Gambia by 16 percent over the same period, according to Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission Techincal Advisor Mika Samba Diop. “Unfair competition from fishmeal factories, which offer more money for catches, has resulted in many women who process small pelagic fish losing their jobs,” Diop said. “The overexploitation of fish stocks has led to a drastic reduction in small-scale fishers’ incomes and local fish consumption of fish. For example, in The Gambia, annual per capita consumption of fish has gone from 15 kilograms in 2020 to only 8 kilogarms in 2021.” As part of the campaign, Feedback and fellow environmental NGO WildFish is calling for British restaurant chain Wagamama to stop serving farmed salmon.The chain, which has nearly 200 U.K. locations, currently features three dishes featuring farmed salmon. \"The campaign was launched after Wagamama failed to respond to several letters from NGOs asking for clarification on its farmed salmon sourcing standards,\" Feedback Campaigner Liam Lysaght said in a press release. \"As a restaurant which markets itself as a sustainability leader, Wagamama’s response may set a precedent for the place of farmed salmon on hospitality menus.

There is a (multi-dimensional) continuum of protein completeness in the sense that the amino acid profile doesn't just have to contain every essential amino acid, but has to contain it in the right amount, as is required by the average human being. Soy protein for example is particularly low in Methionine and Cystine. If your goal is to get enough of those, you might have to eat three times as much soy as for example egg whites (by weight). But similarly soy protein has more Tryptophan than beef. \"Completeness\" is a binary that is not quite sufficient to describe protein quality. There is a reason whey and egg proteins are more popular among strength athletes for example, as they are richer in leucine, which seems to be the limiting amino acid in muscle building. I still think we should eat way less meat and soy is a very high quality substitute for it. reply dools 10 hours agorootparentMy point is more that cows are great at taking inedible grasses and turning them into protein. Growing a rich protein and then feeding it to a cow to make slightly different tasting protein is dumb. reply ffsm8 8 hours agorootparent> My point is more that cows are great at taking inedible grasses and turning them into protein Impossible to scale however. Not sure how it is in other EU nations, but Germany in particular loves to put animals as closely together as they can get away with, which is basically in enclosures in which the animals can't move whatsoever. It's especially egregious because these factories get subventions by animal, so everyone is paying to create these factories from hell - including people that don't eat meat for moral reasons.

SOYLENT GREEN IS PEOPLE!! reply mgraupner 6 hours agoparentprevI did some fact checking on these figures and could not find a source for them. It seems that most of the soy goes to China. The dynamics of global soybean trade remain heavily influenced by China, which accounts for about 60% of worldwide soybean imports. China’s soybean imports are driven by demand for animal protein and edible oils, two essential components of a diversifying Chinese diet that reflects rising living standards. China predominantly sources its soybean supplies from Brazil and the United States. For many years, the United States was the top supplier, but in the last 15 years China has depended more on imports from South America, especially from Brazil. From 2019-2023, 73% of Brazil’s exported soybeans have headed to China, versus a 51% average for the United States (see Figure 2). Source: https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2024/02/the-united-states-.... reply bwb 12 hours agoparentprevPeople don’t like soybeans the same way they like meat. reply TaylorAlexander 12 hours agorootparentMaybe but that is cultural and influenced by marketing, public awareness campaigns, and access to quality prepared meals. Certainly in just the past 5 years I went from a meat heavy diet to a meat-free diet with a lot of consumption of soybeans (tempeh, tofu, soymilk, and cooked soybeans). We could encourage others to do the same with, as I said above, marketing, public awareness campaigns, and encouragement for meat-free restaurants. Not everyone would shift, but in aggregate we could change demand patterns and people would still be happy. I know I would much rather eat tempeh now than any kind of meat product. reply NayamAmarshe 12 hours agorootparentYes, it’s all about culture and influence. As more and more people switch to a vegetarian/vegan diet, they keep coming up with more dishes and preparations. Innovation is bound to happen where there’s an influx of interest. reply djtango 12 hours agorootparentI love food and I love eating. Some of the most interesting dishes are vegetarian because you have to work that much harder to bring a dish together. That really excites the chef/epicurean in me. And then you can just get a good quality slab of meat, give it a good char and sprinkle some salt on it and it'll stand on its own as basically a whole meal. I think meat could 10-50x in price and I'll still find a way to eat it or I'll venture off into the wilderness and hunt it myself. No one could convince me otherwise - there's really nothing like catching your fish and cooking it over an open fire to round a day spent in the outdoors... Gathering some nuts and fruit and blending soybeans to make tofu just doesn't have the same appeal to me... Even though wild fruit really are delicious and my friends stories of eating wild durian really inspire me to brave the sweat (and creepy crawlies and snakes) and venture off into the jungle reply NayamAmarshe 8 hours agorootparentWe’re still talking about the culture. It’s not that vegetarian food is hard to make, or that it’s less tasty. You just haven’t been exposed to the culture, which is why you believe it’s not feasible but literally billions of people in India have been thriving on a vegetarian diet with thousands of dishes for thousands of years. But yeah, in the end we all try to justify our actions. No argument will be convincing enough if one values their taste buds more than someone’s life or the planet. reply djtango 7 hours agorootparentIndia isn't so great an example insofar as there are plenty of sources detailing common deficiencies in the Indian vegetarian diet - namely B12 and protein. But in any case I don't think turning consumption into something moral will ever scale. If you want to curb consumption you have to price in the externalities. This is true for everything - fast fashion and cheap flights too. I don't think it is cultural - my point is that as someone who appreciates food for more than just sustenance you'll never convince me that tempeh/tofu/jack fruit/bugs will one day make me forget that meat is delicious. I will gladly vote with my wallet or blood sweat & tears to continue eating meat especially if it becomes sustainable via price hikes. And I don't say this from a position of arrogance - I'm saying that I would cut many many many other things out of my life before I gave up meat due to affordability issues. reply collingreen 2 hours agorootparent> If you want to curb consumption you have to price in the externalities. This is true for everything - fast fashion and cheap flights too. I agree with the idea that a capitalist society should work harder than we do to price in externalities in order to fulfill the social value of a free market. As a counter example to it being the only way though is how the modern world has drastically reduced and now culturally shuns (although we still have things to fix) human slavery without doing it via economic sanctions or price regulation. I don't actually have any hope here though - politically in the US I see more of a slide away from free markets and toward techno-feudalism and culturally in the US I see a backslide in empathy and personal values people are willing to make sacrifices for. You can't regulate people into having particular values (for good or for ill). reply djtango 2 hours agorootparentIts directly refuting anything you said but were you aware that the UK sweetened the deal for abolishing slavery? https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2022/the-colle.... reply lukan 11 hours agorootparentprev\"Some of the most interesting dishes are vegetarian because you have to work that much harder to bring a dish together.\" Yeah, this is the main reason why I mainly cook with meat.

Those people tend to eat their steaks rare and soybeans will never be a substitute for that. I like some vegetarian and vegan dishes but they have to be meals where meat isn’t the “hero” of that dish. For example a good curry is about the flavour of the source rather than the flavour of the protein. This is why I think lab grown meat is the way forward. reply TaylorAlexander 10 hours agorootparent> It’s not a cultural thing, some people just like the taste of meat. Can you explain why 20-39% of Indians, or 276 million Indians, are vegetarian while in China, Chile, Colombia, and France (to pick a few) it is 5%? [1] Because it is either cultural, or it is genetic. And I doubt Indians have a genetic mutation that makes them vegetarian, I think it is cultural. If a good curry is what makes more people vegetarian, then we can cook good curries anywhere. In a meat-heavy culture, a lot of people might not realize how much they would like vegetarian meals! > I like some vegetarian and vegan dishes but they have to be meals where meat isn’t the “hero” of that dish. Not to be snarky, but that is the definition of a vegetarian dish. But I know what you mean, and you are right, meat substitutes do not make for very good vegan meals. A good vegan meal is one where it's not just trying to emulate meat based foods, but building a flavor profile that celebrates the actual vegetables and other ingredients in harmony. Go to any of these Michelin rated vegan restaurants [2] for example, and you will find absolutely incredible tasting vegan meals. It takes culture to spread this kind of thing to chefs and patrons, and that is something we have influence over. I have been to Millennium [3], and it is incredible. If more meals like this were available, people \"liking the taste of meat\" would not really matter that much, because they would LOVE the taste of this stuff.

You’ve completely ignored what I said. 1. Some people like the taste of meat. Saying they shouldn’t and it’s just a cultural thing misses the point that the flavour is desirable. This is why I suggested other means of sourcing that protein which is ethical is a better path forward than simply saying we need to change culture. 2. I’d already said in curries the meat isn’t the hero of the dish. > In a meat-heavy culture, a lot of people might not realize how much they would like vegetarian meals! “You shouldn’t like X, you should learn to love a completely different thing instead” is, frankly, a silly argument. What needs to happen instead is X is replaced with an ethical alternative. In this case, lab grown meat. As I’ve said already, most meat eaters will enjoy a lot of vegetarian meals too. The problem is they also like the taste of meat. So there needs to be an ethical alternative and soybeans sadly isn’t it. > Not to be snarky, but that is the definition of a vegetarian dish. The fact you’ve commented saying that proves you’ve not been reading my comment properly. > A good vegan meal is one where it's not just trying to emulate meat based foods, but building a flavor profile that celebrates the actual vegetables and other ingredients in harmony. That’s literally the point I was making that you knee jerk argued against! reply wheels 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat is cultural is how much meat eating seems reasonable. I love meat, but both my own ethics and those of my social group basically tell me not to eat too much of it. Same for say, something like drinking beer. People like beer. But drinking too much of it too often isn't socially acceptable. I'm from a family where one of my grandfathers was a cattle rancher and the other one a butcher, still I only eat about 1 kg of meat a month. I was terrified recently to learn that that's 10% of average American consumption. But I go in for the good shit. A little smoked meat goes a long way in altering the flavor profile of a dish. I love cooking myself a €20 steak, but I only do that every couple months. I save my fat caps and off-cuts to make sausage every few months. I only buy organic or meat with another animal welfare certification. It's expensive. As it should be. reply hnlmorg 9 hours agorootparentThat’s fair. But I think the only way to change that is to have substitutes that are equivalent in taste and cost. Though even there, it would be an uphill battle fighting the farming lobbyists. reply wheels 9 hours agorootparentI think it's more likely to expect the changes to be largely generational. That's how most dietary trends change. I give my kids less meat than my parents did, and they'll probably give their kids even less. The other piece is that meat should have its externalities priced in. We shouldn't be doing to animals the things we do in factory farming. Not being shitty to animals makes animal products a lot more expensive, which generally means people consume less of them. A carbon tax also wouldn't be crazy. People eat a lot more meat than they used to because it's cheap now. Eating meat with every meal is a relatively recent cultural phenomenon in the west. Making it not cheap again would put us back to where we were a few generations back. People liked cigarettes as much as they liked meat, but social norms, policy changes and price hikes have made it to where people smoke now a lot less than they used to. Having a cheap / enjoyable alternative is a nice route, but it's not the only one. reply ahoka 10 hours agorootparentprevProf. Frederick Starr’s comment from 1936 about Roman cooking: “Many of the Apician dishes will not appeal to the beef eaters. It is worthy of note that much criticism was heaped upon Apicius some 200 years ago in England when beef eating became fashionable in that country. The art of Apicius requires practitioners of superior intellect. Indeed, it requires a superior clientèle to appreciate Apician dishes. But practitioners that would pass the requirements of the Apician school are scarce in the kitchens of the beef eaters. We cannot blame meat eaters for rejecting the average chef d’œuvre set before them by a mediocre cook who has learned little besides the roasting or broiling of meats. Once the average man has acquired a taste for the refined compositions made by a talented and experienced cook, say, a composition of meats, vegetables or cereals, properly “balanced” by that intuition that never fails the real artist, the fortunate diner will eventually curtail the preponderant meat diet. A glance at some Chinese and Japanese methods of cookery may perhaps convince us of the probability of these remarks. Nothing is more perplexing and more alarming than a new dish, but we can see in a reversion to Apician cookery methods only a dietetic benefit accruing to this so-called white race of beef eaters. … One has but to study the methods of ancient and intelligent people who have suffered for thousands of years under the perennial shortage of food supplies in order to understand and to appreciate Apician methods. Be it far from us to advocate their methods, or to wish upon us the conditions that engendered such methods; for such practices have been pounded into these people by dire necessity. They have graduated from the merciless school of hunger. Food materials, we repeat, were never as cheap and as abundant as they are today. But who can say that they always will be so in the future?” reply hansworst 12 hours agorootparentprevIf that’s true, you could make a killing by creating soy bean based food products and actually marketing them properly. reply TaylorAlexander 9 hours agorootparentNo I could not. I’m a robotics engineer and I’m bad at business (I’ve tried) and probably worse at marketing. Also, soy bean based products are abundant. Tofu, tempeh, and soy milk are everywhere. Soy beans are one of the most significant crops in the world. The deliciousness of soy beans is present in the existing simple foods. I don’t personally believe the thing missing is some new kind of soy-based food. One thing we can do is encourage individuals all over the world to eat more vegan meals, and dine out at vegan restaurants. This will encourage more restaurant owners to offer more vegan options. I really don’t think this is a problem that can be solved by one big company. Soy is not some secret. We just need meat-focused cultures to understand both the problems of meat based diets and the deliciousness of vegan options. And as a vegan of five years now, the tastiest vegan meals are not some heavily processed product made from extracts of soy.

But my point was that pretty much all asian countries love meat. I mean, food in South Korea and the Philippines is 90% chicken. Meat consumption is everywhere, because it provides the calories people need, easily, and tastes delicious. People don't want to (and sometimes can't!) eat the stuff we feed to cows and chicken, anywhere. reply Al-Khwarizmi 10 hours agorootparentI would say they eat a smaller proportion of meat. Many Asian dishes do have meat but it's just one out of many ingredients, including rice/noodles, vegs, spices, etc. While in the West sometimes we just eat meat with a side of potatoes or whatever, maybe some spices but the majority of the dish by mass is meat. I agree that it's not necessarily easy to find dishes with no meat at all in Asian countries, though. It's probably a better strategy to try to convince people to eat less meat per dish (as in many Asian preparations) than to go vegetarian, anyway. At least it would be easier to convince me, that's for sure... if my country had the hawker stalls that they have in Singapore, I would already be eating less meat. reply theultdev 10 hours agorootparentIt depends on the country.

I significantly reduced my meat consumption, but when I eat it I am looking for really high quality meat, such as locally grass fed beef. reply eru 11 hours agorootparentYes, if you look at actual impact instead of at moral judgement, then getting someone to reduce their consumption by x% gets you x% towards the same goal as complete abstinence. Similar, if you can get a population to reduce their consumption by x%, it doesn't matter if that's because x% went totally without (and the rest didn't change anything), or whether you could a more uniform, mild change. Convincing people to give up some meat is pretty straightforward: one proven way is for meat to become more expensive. People react to economic incentives on the margin after all. Other ways might be to make the alternatives more appealing. (About the margins: meat would have to get extremely expensive for many people to completely give up on it. But if sometimes you are deciding between going to a steak place and a pasta place, and then price can sway your decision fairly easily. The meal at the pasta place can still have meat in it for this example to work, just less of it.) reply theultdev 11 hours agorootparentIf it's over a steak place or pasta place it will be steak every time, no matter the price.

In terms of overall utilitarian impact, I mean. Not in terms of some moral systems. reply theultdev 10 hours agorootparentIs there an app for that? I think people around here would charge too much to go vegan.

I can only hope you were deliberately trying to make a shitty argument for some reason, otherwise it seems likely that the BGH, HFC and antibiotics in your diet have addled your brain.

Of the currently known methods for producing proteins, the one that has the potential to be significantly more efficient than raising chicken or insects is the culture of genetically-modified strains of the fungus Trichoderma, which produce either ovalbumin (the main protein of egg white) or beta-lactoglobulin (the main protein of whey). These egg-white proteins or whey proteins are identical to those of chicken eggs or cow milk and they have an excellent amino acid profile. They could easily satisfy all the protein needs of a human. Such proteins are water-soluble powders, looking the same as the whey protein concentrates that can be bought now. Used alone, they would be bland, but they can be an essential ingredient for cooking various kinds of tasty food, from savory dishes based on various vegetables to sweet creams, e.g. with cocoa or vanilla. I am currently using whey protein concentrate for cooking and I would like very much if a fungus-produced alternative would become available at a decent price. I prefer very much such a protein powder, which can be used to enhance both the taste and the nutritional value of any food, instead of fake meat. reply impossiblefork 11 hours agoparentprevInsects aren't any more efficient than chickens though, especially American chicken.

It was already approved for commercial use by the EU in 2017. Specifically the industry is looking at places where there is both waste biomass and low-grade waste heat available nearby, and close proximity to fish farms, in order to produce fish feed from farmed insects. AFAIK the black soldier fly (BSF) larvae and the yellow mealworm are the two species which are in focus. For BSF larvae I believe they have some extremely convenient biological urge to migrate once they have reached maximum size, so it's possible to set up systems where they \"collect themselves\" at the optimum size for processing into meal. reply eru 11 hours agoparentprevIt's viable, if you can get customers to pay.

[That figure also includes] the indirect use of capture fisheries production by the fishmeal sector.” “the conversion of wild-capture fish that would not be used for human consumption into fishmeal and subsequent use as aquafeed, results in an overall increase in human consumption of fish”. Figures do seem to show that most ocean fishing is for human consumption, but 16Mt of forage fishing (non-edible) is still greater than 10% of our total ocean fishing. About 75% of fish meal is used for farm fisheries (aquaculture), the other 25% for animal farming on land.

Meat is tasty, yes, but to me feels like something that should be enjoyed maybe once or twice a week, instead of every day. I say that as someone who has helped my dad hunt wild animals, remove the guts from the carcasses, bring them home, skin them, de-bone the meat and perhaps has a bit more understanding of what it takes to get to a tasty meat meal than the average person. Very humbling experience, presumably a little bit similar to working on a farm.
