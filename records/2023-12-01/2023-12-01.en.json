These are images that look like one thing, but change appearance or identity when transformed. We show in theory and practice that our method supports a broad range of transformations including rotations, flips, color inversions, skews, jigsaw rearrangements, and random permutations. We show some examples below. Jigsaw Permutations Flips and 180° Rotations 90° Rotations Color Inversions Miscellaneous Permutations Random Patch Permutations Method Our method is conceptually simple. We take an off-the-shelf diffusion model and use it to estimate the noise in different views or transformations, 𝑣 𝑖 , of an image. The noise estimates are then aligned by applying the inverse view, 𝑣 𝑖 − 1 , and averaged together. This averaged noise estimate is then used to take a diffusion step. Conditions on Views We find that not every view function works with the above method. Of course, 𝑣 𝑖 must be invertible, but we discuss two additional constraints. Linearity A diffusion model is trained to estimate the noise in noisy data 𝑥 𝑡 conditioned on time step 𝑡 . The noisy data 𝑥 𝑡 is expected to have the form 𝑥 𝑡 = 𝑤 𝑡 signal 𝑥 0 ⏟ signal + 𝑤 𝑡 noise 𝜖 ⏟ noise . That is, 𝑥 𝑡 is a weighted average of pure signal 𝑥 0 and pure noise 𝜖 , specifically with weights 𝑤 𝑡 signal and 𝑤 𝑡 noise . Therefore, our view, 𝑣 must maintain this weighting between signal and noise. This can be achieved by making 𝑣 linear, which we represent by the square matrix 𝐴 . By linearity 𝑣 ( 𝑥 𝑡 ) = 𝐴 ( 𝑤 𝑡 signal 𝑥 0 + 𝑤 𝑡 noise 𝜖 ) = 𝑤 𝑡 signal 𝐴 𝑥 0 ⏟ new signal + 𝑤 𝑡 noise 𝐴 𝜖 ⏟ new noise . Effectively, 𝑣 acts on the signal and the noise independently, and combines the result with the correct weighting. Statistical Consistency Diffusion models are trained with the assumption that the noise is drawn iid from a standard normal. Therefore we must ensure that the transformed noise also follows these statistics. That is, we need 𝐴 𝜖 ∼ 𝑁 ( 0 , 𝐼 ) . For linear transformations, this is equivalent to the condition that 𝐴 is orthogonal. Intuitively, orthogonal matrices respect the spherical symmetry of the standard multivariate Gaussian distribution. Therefore, for a transformation to work with our method, it is sufficient for it to be orthogonal. Orthogonal Transformations Most orthogonal transformations on images are meaningless, visually. For example, we transform the image below with a randomly sampled orthogonal matrix. However, permutations matrices are a subset of orthogonal matrices, and are quite interpretable. They are just rearrangements of pixels in an image. This is where the idea of a visual anagram comes from. The majority of illusions here can be interpreted this way—as specific rearrangements of pixels—such as rotations, flips, skews, \"inner rotations,\" jigsaw rearrangements, and patch permutations. Finally, color inversions are not permutations, but are orthogonal as they are a negation of pixel values. Video (Coming Soon!) Related Links This project is inspired by previous work in this area, including: Diffusion Illusions, by Ryan Burgert et al., which produces multi-view illusions, along with other visual effects, through score distillation sampling. This colab notebook by Matthew Tancik, which introduces a similar idea to ours. We improve upon it significantly in terms of quality of illusions, range of transformations, and theoretical analysis. Recent work by a pseudonymous artist, Ugleh, uses a Stable Diffusion model finetuned for generating QR codes to produce images whose global structure subtly matches a given template image.

A recursive cat, so to say.The problem would be this: In the picture at hand, the big cat is rather simple. Just a portrait of a smiling cat. While the 9 smaller cats are doing all kinds of poses to adjust to the form of the big cat portrait. So the subcats are more complex than the main cat.When doing the recursive cat, it would be hard to make a subcat from 9 subsubcats because the subcat is already a complex image that is not as easy to recognise as the main cat. reply mdonahoe 10 hours agoprevThe man&#x2F;woman color inversion one was the most impressive to me.

    "originBody": "An Amazon human-resources staffer (not pictured) worked on the company's performance-review system and then got put on a PIP. David Ryder/Getty Images Redeem now A former HR staffer at Amazon put employees on a performance-improvement plan known as Pivot. Then, the HR staffer, who says they developed PTSD from the work, was put on their own PIP. An Amazon spokesperson said the account contained inaccuracies about the company's process. Advertisement This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with a former Amazon human-resources worker who was put into the company's performance-management program known as Pivot. This person spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their career. Business Insider has verified their identity and employment at the company. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. I worked at Amazon in HR for several years. Not only did I administer Pivots, but it was eventually brought to my attention that I was going to be going through one. They made a mistake by doing that with me. There wasn't a lot of information to justify a poor performance. The Pivot goal was a straight, across-the-board 6% number. And as an HR person, that is a hefty figure. Advertisement And it was driven hard by the HR VPs to show the metrics — daily, weekly — to make sure we knew who was in the pipeline. Not to improve, but who was in the pipeline to get out. There wasn't a lot of interest in improving people. You might be cutting some prime choice with the fat. And they were OK with that. They wanted that number. The managers who had to implement it and tell their people they were on Pivot — I would say a majority of them hated it. Because, one, they didn't have the skills to be able to manage performance that soon out of the gate. A lot of our managers were brand new. The first thing you had to do was work with a Pivot consultant. So, that was somebody in HR besides the manager's business partner. And you'd talk about if it was the right time or if it was the wrong time to Pivot someone. I would say 80% of my time ended up being focused one way or another on Pivot. Either the Pivot appeal or the Pivot work that workers' managers had to do. And look, I'm not going to say you're going to ever find this somewhere, locked down in words. But the idea is, if you're putting somebody in Pivot, you make that so damn hard that they don't get out. Advertisement Almost always, unless there was some really unique set of situations where it came out during the appeal, the success rate of that was virtually none. When I wasn't working on Pivots, working in HR was great. We were supposed to be doing coaching and focusing on strengths and moving people through the organization in a positive way. Later, when Pivot came back, we had to stack rank all of our employees. The way we broke it down, we called it top tier, which was, you know, maybe 15-20% by the time it worked out. And then you had the middle. And then you have the bottom tier. The bottom tier was about 20-25%, maybe even up to 30%. The guidelines that they expressed publicly may be different because we always worked to make sure we had more than that because some went bad — or went off the rails, and we couldn't exit them for whatever reason. We were way over how many people were actually underperforming or detrimental to the business. Maybe around 1% or 1.5% to 2% were actually not performing well. Advertisement I have PTSD I was disgusted at what I was seeing with the Pivot process. This process alone has given me post-traumatic stress disorder. It impacted me so much as a person that I had to get out of there. When it was justified, it was easier to push someone out. If it's deserved, there's no problem. But when it wasn't deserved, you had people crying and begging, and they couldn't understand. You had visa-sponsored employees who, once we Pivoted them and moved them out, no longer were authorized to work in the United States. So, they had to make immediate plans to get out of the country. And it's a long process to get sponsored by another group. In the years I was there, I never, ever, ever had any performance issue given to me — not even anything close to being serious. I had no worries because I asked for feedback all the time. I'm like, \"What can I do? How can I do better?\" I didn't ever want to be blindsided by Pivot myself. And what a lot of people did — if they got the indication that they were going down that track — was they would transfer jobs right away. Some people were successful. A lot of people weren't. Advertisement Normally, with a performance-improvement program, as an HR person, you're following progressive discipline. Are you seeing notes that this person is having trouble? Are you seeing coaching conversations that are taking place? So for it to actually just — boom — be there is really problematic. It was my turn During my performance evaluation, when it was clear I was on a PIP, my manager shared criticisms that I'd never heard before. I said, \"I've never had any of these comments come to me ever.\" Essentially, it was a lot of made-up stuff. I mean, you could put some truth to it. I'd been late on a few assignments. But everybody's got some element of things they can improve on in their work. My manager just chose to bring those out. Amazon broke down people into three categories. You were either top-tier, middle of the pack, or at least effective. Normally, they won't tell you what they rated you, and I'm like, \"Come on. I know this stuff just as much as you do. I know the wording. You didn't put me in the medium category. Would you just admit that you put me in the least-effective category?\" And I got my manager to admit that. Advertisement I wasn't put on Pivot. My manager wanted to work with me a little bit to see if I was going to commit to the job. So they sat me down and said I could go on Pivot and leave right away, or they would work with me. Well, obviously not having any job opportunities, I said, \"Look, I'm in it. Let's try to get better and go from there.\" So my manager took away all my direct reports, and shoved me into a small box, and said you could do this and try to work yourself out of it. Right after that, I started putting in the full push to get another job. And so I started interviewing. I actually had a headhunter that reached out to me. Originally, I told her no, but then some of this stuff happened. And I'm like, \"OK, let's revisit it.\" I got to the point where they offered me a job, and I was going to quit. But I had a huge stock investment coming up. So there was no way I was going to rock the boat in any way, shape, or form just trying to get to this date. If you walked away during the Pivot or anytime before you had your investment before it was there for you, you would lose it all. And I'm not talking a little bit of money. I'm talking: I had a couple hundred thousand dollars coming to me. I played along, and I'm good at playing along when I have to be. So then the money is in my account. That next day, I called my manager and I told them I was resigning. They blew a gasket — absolutely blew a gasket because I had told them that I was in it for the long run. I said, \"Look, you gave me no choice. You put this threat against me. I'm not just gonna sit there and wait for it to be dependent on you. You get to make the call whether I make it or not.\" My manager was super mad and asked me when I was leaving. I said two weeks. They were incredulous that I wasn't giving them more respect. Advertisement The biggest thing — and I'm gonna say this goes for many, many people that were put on Pivot — is there were no warning signs. There was no trail of communication saying, \"You are underperforming.\" I mean, even if it's something as simple as, \"Hey, can you do better on this next time?\" I know, certainly, I got zero negative feedback. I got the feedback that I was rocking it. And then all of a sudden, to be in this place, it's like, \"Huh.\" I still wonder about what happened to all the people that went through that process. How did it impact their life? I think it leads to a lot of mental-health issues. Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, told BI via email: \"Like most companies, we have a performance management process that helps our managers identify who on their teams are performing well and who may need more support. For the small number of employees who are underperforming, we use performance management programs to help them improve, and many employees do just that. Sometimes the programs result in employees leaving the company. Business Insider declined to share the information needed to verify this individual's account, but it contains a number of inaccuracies about our performance management process. An unverified, anonymous anecdote in a Business Insider 'As told to' essay does not represent the experience of the vast majority of our employees.\" Do you have something to share about what you're seeing in your workplace?

    "commentBody": "I worked in Amazon HR and was disgusted at what I was seeing with PIP plansHacker NewspastloginI worked in Amazon HR and was disgusted at what I was seeing with PIP plans (businessinsider.com) 552 points by cebert 23 hours ago| hidepastfavorite567 comments steveBK123 20 hours agoOne underlying problem with these PIP type programs at FAANG seems to be that they have very high barriers to entry in the interview process, and then act like 30% of the company is underperforming and subject to an annual 6% cull.There are industries & companies that have grown fat & lazy and could use a few annual 6% culls, but you eventually run out of fat. If you have a very competitive interview process and high compensation to attract the best talent, it is unlikely you have so many underperformers lying about to cull annually.So really it&#x27;s overhiring BS that is then getting taken out on employees. Given that, I think as has been pointed out by another commenter - the old Wall St model of doing one cut in one afternoon, calling people into an office and giving a severance is far more humane. Everyone understood it was about the numbers not about your performance, generally. Seems better than year round psychological torture of being at risk of a PIP, and then if being put on one knowing the most likely outcome is being fired. So you feel dragged through the mud and then having doubly failed (put on PIP & failed the PIP).I knew a guy who moved from Wall St to Amazon and described the performance management &#x2F; compensation system to be pretty rough and had explicitly described the compensation cliff and how a lot of people in the good years were proactively leaving, cooling off, and then coming back to reset the compensation instead of going over the cliff. reply giantg2 19 hours agoparentOne thing about fat that I think is overlooked is how fat today might be muscle tomorrow, and how little companies try to convert it.Maybe a person is in a bad role, on a bad team, or simply doesn&#x27;t have experience or skills fitting the specific requirements of that single point in time. I&#x27;ve been a high performer in the past. Now I&#x27;m a low performer (I&#x27;m slow) after the company has changed the way it treats teams&#x2F;work and the technology shifted. My disability isn&#x27;t suited to the new working style&#x2F;process (or lack of). However, I do excellent work outside of my regular day to day responsibilities, like my secondary role as an ASC. My manager even said that I&#x27;d I could just speed up my regular work I would easily get the highest rating and a promotion. Hearing him say that really sucks because I unable to just speed up with my disability in the given work environment. The company&#x2F;managers have made no effort in helping me find a role that works better with my skills or is impacted less by my disability. It seems there may not be any of the traditional roles&#x2F;teams left. So now I fill midlevel roles and move team to team trying to find somewhere that I fit in. If I can find a place I fit in like before, then I would easily excel.Another example was a dev on another team that I worked with a few years ago was sloppy, slow, and just all around seemed like a poor performer - and even our tech lead and manager talked poorly about him. He was even considerably slower than me. About 3 years after that he&#x27;s now the head of data and analytics for our international operations. reply steveBK123 19 hours agorootparentAgreed that what is left unsaid in a lot of performance conversations is the person-role match. Someone isn&#x27;t a high&#x2F;low performer globally, just at that time in that role.Wall St firms I have worked at typically try to find different roles for people before marking them as at risk of a layoff. Not sure FAANG behaves the same, but from all these PIP discussions it seems not. reply closeparen 17 hours agorootparentLeadership was asked why not find new roles for people getting laid off due to project cancellations at a time when we were still hiring like crazy in the immediate run-up and aftermath.

I saw what happened first hand when I didn’t between around 2002-2008 and I said it would never happen again.For reference: I didn’t know “cloud” from a hole in the wall at 44 years old and I got my first and hopefully last job in BigTech at 46 working at AWS in the ProServe department (where I got PIPed see my top level comment)It is completely irresponsible for anyone in tech especially with a family to not always keep themselves employable and depend on the whims of thier current employer to support their families addiction to food, clothing and shelter.And how does a disability preclude you from getting a remote job?And if you “can’t job hop”, would you not look for another job if you got laid off or fired or would you just give up and be on the street - homeless and hungry?> Just picking up responsibilities doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll get rewarded.I’m always rewarded for picking up additional responsibilities - if not by the current company by the next. It’s what allows me to aggressively job hop with a family and not be stuck with dead technologies on my resume. reply giantg2 8 hours agorootparentI have responsibilities and problems at home that greatly limit my non-work hour freedom. My disability is not a physical one, but a neurodivergent one, so remote would only hurt me more. I would look for another job if I lost this one, but it would probably pay less - again, no real time to upskill. Sure, I&#x27;ve gotten new certs and other BS over the years and started working with new tech. That hasn&#x27;t been helpful. I&#x27;ve worked roles above my official position and not been rewarded. In fact, I haven&#x27;t seen any of my hard work or extra responsibilities pay off after my first promotion about 3 years in. I don&#x27;t expect another promotion for the rest of my career either.

They don&#x27;t care. HR said to just work with my manager on accommodations. My main problem is dealing with ambiguity and context switching. That&#x27;s something they can&#x27;t change given their chosen work model.The old model of working was that you supported 1 main app and maybe a smaller 1 or 2 that were related. These were usually in 1 stack and well documented. The new model is that teams are typical supporting 6-10 apps in multiple stacks. I&#x27;m slow when switching between apps and stacks, and without consistent exposure to a single app&#x2F;stack, I won&#x27;t get faster.It&#x27;s funny though - they talk a big game and even hire in Auticon contractors, but then refuse to do anything for existing employees. I assume a least some of those contractors have similar difficulties as me. reply itsboring 18 hours agorootparentI don’t have any (diagnosed) neurological disability but I would do poorly in that situation too.

Deciding not to put my shingle up and go independent. I have the network, the credentials and the knowledge to make more than I was making at Amazon going that route2. Turning down a position that was going to be created for me by a former coworjer now director to be responsible for the cloud migration and infrastructure for a $7 billion public non tech company that would have also paid more in cash than my total comp at Amazon.No, I never struck it rich in tech, I was a journeymen CRUD developer&#x2F;architect when I got hired with two years of AWS experience and above average soft skills. reply IKantRead 18 hours agorootparentprevI feel the same way and would also never work at a FAANG.That said, I suspect this is would be viewed as a benefit of the process since I&#x27;m fairly confident Amazon and the like don&#x27;t want people who feel this way working for them regardless of the talent of those individual people. reply moate 18 hours agorootparentExactly this. “Are you willing to kill another human?

And that race to the bottom is not really hunger games.On the other hand if one goes by unsaid rules of games, everyone including management, HR, employee know FAANG salary is multiple times of equivalent IT workers. And perhaps 95% of FAANG employees are not really developing new algorithms, hauling terabytes of data on their shoulders or being the force of good whatever that means. Just keep doing made-up work and wait until reach x million dollars goal.

But maybe it is!However, on the bright side, it is kind of nice that FAANG attracts the type of people who actually think this sort of constant stack ranking arena fighting is okay. Think about it: if they really hated it, they&#x27;d leave. Obviously the pay is a huge motivator, but if it was as distasteful as it was to many others, they wouldn&#x27;t hang around. reply JohnFen 16 hours agorootparentI do appreciate that FAANG companies are a bit like fly traps, collecting those sorts of people somewhere else so I don&#x27;t have to work with them personally.But understand, I am not asserting that FAANG companies are places nobody wants to work.

Their skill and work is not more challenging or interesting than hundreds of thousand engineers at 20-30% income of Amazon in boring enterprise IT shop. reply scarface_74 12 hours agorootparentThat’s not just true of engineers. It took years for a friend who worked there as an L6 in the finance department for Amazon Retail to match his compensation after he left and it took him becoming a director at a manufacturing company.Another former coworker who was a project manager (engagement manager) got maybe 60% of their compensation and is doing more work.Myself personally, I was an L5 at AWS and now I’m doing at least L6 level work and I’m still making 15% less than I was making at Amazon.It’s going to take a couple of years at the company I’m at now and building out an entire specialty practice - L7 level work - to get to my L5 compensation.I have a roadmap I designed with my manager to do it and it’s a straightforward process, it’s just going to take time.

There certainly wasn&#x27;t 30% to cull. In my opinion there wasn&#x27;t even enough people to fill the percentage quota that need to be given ratings lower than satisfactory - before the layoffs.

Not impossible, but difficult. And I&#x27;m just pulling stuff out of my ass here, but if we were to do a survey here on HN, the most likely consensus on how difficult that is would be something like \"it&#x27;s actually more difficult to fake it in the interview than to just be good enough at what you say you&#x27;re good at\".Imagine if you were one of the fastest sprinters in the world, but to be \"hired on\" to the Olympic team they decided to interview you for it. Sure, they&#x27;d probably ask in the interview what your latest 100M times were, stuff like that, but after the interview they&#x27;d all talk privately about whether or not you were a good \"culture fit\", and whether your smile was sincere or fake, whether you were too nervous or smooth and a \"real go-getter\". In such an environment, the Olympic team might well have 30% of its members that could be safely culled. The only jobs interviewing is even a good process for are those jobs where the actual work itself resembles interviewing... sales positions, PR, being the \"public face\" of an organization (news anchors, I dunno). The reason we use interviewing for technology jobs is because that&#x27;s what the big bosses know works for their jobs, a CEO is the public face of the organization. reply Ferret7446 33 minutes agoparentprevDevil&#x27;s advocate: no matter how \"high barrier\" your interview process is, you are 100% going to hire duds, and that&#x27;s only going to be apparent after a couple months at least. \"Ideally\", the interview process would be those first couple months, but that is illegal and&#x2F;or not socially accepted. reply JackFr 18 hours agoparentprevI have posted this before, an argument in defense of stack ranking I had heard from a friend&#x27;s father who was a long-time manager for a large industrial conglomerate from the 60&#x27;s through the 80&#x27;s. Simply put it was that they were far more willing to hire non-standard candidates on gut and hunches, knowing that if it didn&#x27;t work out, it didn&#x27;t work out they would be gone in 1-1.5 years and it would not be a ding against the hiring manager. Further, at least in that day, it was an environment where everyone was going in with their eyes open -- people were not blindsided by it, they expected it. But as you point out, the FAANG&#x27;s are doing the opposite of this. They&#x27;ve got extremely difficult hiring processes and are pretending that it&#x27;s not stack ranking. reply ep103 18 hours agorootparentStack Ranking was pioneered by Jack Welch who was operating in an environment where labor was the dominant party in the labor-capital relationship, and he was taking over companies that had had decades of labor growth and power while capital was stagflating nationwide. Introducing stack ranking was a way of trimming excess fat from decades of build up within companies, while reasserting capital in the relationship within the company.Long term, it has been a disaster in every company. Because eventually you run out of fat, and then what you describe as \"far more willing to hire non-standard candidates on gut and hunches, knowing that if it didn&#x27;t work out, it didn&#x27;t work out they would be gone\" becomes \"I need to hire people I don&#x27;t want to work with, so I have someone to fire in the next stack rank\". And that&#x27;s its own form of fat.In short, stack ranking makes some sense if you have a fat organization, not unlike restricting calories to lose fat when working out. But once you&#x27;ve lost fat, continuing to restrict your calories results in losing more muscle than fat. reply psunavy03 18 hours agorootparent> \"I need to hire people I don&#x27;t want to work with, so I have someone to fire in the next stack rank\".

GE Financial was an earnings laundering operation reply psunavy03 18 hours agorootparentprevHaving been a Navy officer for 20 years active and reserve, one of the other overlooked flaws of the stack rank is that it&#x27;s a vehicle for cultivating egos. When the only way up is through many levels of being \"1 of X, Early Promote,\" it&#x27;s fascinating to watch a bright-eyed humble flight student turn into a condescending jerk of an instructor over the years. Turning the performance review system into \"winners\" and \"losers\" and telling a subset of people they&#x27;re the winners tends to break some people&#x27;s brains.Because why should they have to listen to anyone who hasn&#x27;t gotten as good performance reviews as them? Obviously, they care more and those other slackers just couldn&#x27;t cut it. reply giantg2 17 hours agorootparentI have a friend who is getting out (technically going reserve). It sounds like there are lot of factors impacting retention and most of them are being ignored. Why should the leaders focus on things they are a part of and admit fault if they can simply blame stuff on civilian cultural issues or subordinate \"weakness\"?I heard some of the cyber warfare units are proposing to bring in people in as high as O5. No way that causes any related problems... reply psunavy03 17 hours agorootparentIMHO there&#x27;s a huge blind spot in leadership exactly due to the stack rank, because how do you recommend changes to the system to someone who succeeded and owes their whole career and professional reputation to that system? The answer&#x27;s going to be \"well it worked for me, so it must not be that bad.\"The other part of the problem is yes, there are times when the military has every right to expect folks to endure hardship. I mean, the whole point is to send folks into combat if needed, and combat sucks. Being in the field or underway for months at a time sucks, but they&#x27;re necessary. But because of this, it&#x27;s easy to slip into \"just suck it up\" as a response to a whole bunch of hardship, stupidity, or inefficiency that isn&#x27;t necessary.The reserves have their own breed of stupidity revolving around reserve center staff enforcing Kafkaesque bureaucratic \"readiness\" requirements on the drilling reservists. At some point, taking 1&#x2F;4 of your weekends off to come in and be told you&#x27;re delinquent on something you turned in three times already, or having to flail to complete some late-breaking tasker gets old. I loved supporting my gaining active duty commands. I retired because I got sick of the hoops I had to jump through to keep doing it.Cyber is having to bring folks in at a high level to get the experience base they desperately need. This isn&#x27;t totally unusual though. Surgeons have come in at that level when the military has needed their expertise. And in WWII, FDR brought in an automotive executive as a general officer to supervise wartime production. reply giantg2 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t, even for the surgeon thing, they probably shouldn&#x27;t be skipping ranks. If the MOS needs a specific level of pay, they should address it by changes to that duty pay and revamping the retirement system to look at that pay too. The automotive executive is a little different since you do what them to oversee everything since they are an industry expert, not just a individual contributor or midlevel manager.Funny thing about the surgeon part. I know a surgeon who served and had a unique specialty with aerospace occupational preventative medicine. They didn&#x27;t fight too hard to keep them other than offering a promotion. Even at O6, they could have been making 3x the money if they were a civilian. Bringing people in at a higher rank isn&#x27;t going fix the pay issue and isn&#x27;t necessarily going to place them in the right level of authority. They need to make some changes to how that&#x27;s managed to ensure the right people are at the right levels. I&#x27;m sure there are career guys who would not be happy to have someone with limited experience come in over their rank and pay if they&#x27;re doing the same job. reply psunavy03 16 hours agorootparentDocs in the military have a bonus structure based on their specialty area that&#x27;s supposed to at least try to keep their pay from being ridiculously behind. And the idea behind bringing a surgeon in as an O-5 is that a surgeon has that level of seniority as a medical practitioner, so it aligns with their field. To bring an O-5 cyber person in, they would be expected to have enough experience as a cybersecurity professional to rate that rank. If they were entry-level but DOD needed entry-level cybersecurity folks badly enough, they would add a bonus but keep the rank lower. reply giantg2 13 hours agorootparent\"Docs in the military have a bonus structure based on their specialty area that&#x27;s supposed to at least try to keep their pay from being ridiculously behind.\"Tries is the key word there.

On the other hand, there is a retirement program (although that&#x27;s based on base pay and not as great for roles like this) and they don&#x27;t need mal-practice. At least to me, it seems the biggest way they get docs is to pay for their med school if they commit to 8-12 years or whatever it is for them now.\"To bring an O-5 cyber person in, they would be expected to have enough experience as a cybersecurity professional to rate that rank.\"I mean, that makes sense in a general sense, but doesn&#x27;t really make sense the way it works now. There are plenty of people with experience that if they were external would come in at a higher rank than they are now. I&#x27;m not sure how you would design a good system for an industry where people jump companies every 2-3 years, are expecting high pay (at least O5 with 10 years), are used to rapid promotions, and are used to lots of perks. I mean, you could have someone with 5 years of internal experience with a great record be something like O3 and have someone external be called a senior analyst&#x2F;dev or lead in 3-5 years and come in as an O5 with basically no difference in duties or performance.Although I&#x27;m not sure how you would even measure performance in that role. The industry doesn&#x27;t have clue how to measure it - just look at the article or all the stuff about interviews and leetcode. The military might set some more objective standards, but they&#x27;re not going to remotely apply to external candidates.I don&#x27;t know, I guess in general I would imagine the best thing for stability, readiness, and even morale, would be to train and promote from within while focusing on retention. It sounds like they&#x27;re already providing bonuses for all levels and saying they&#x27;re focusing on retention, but clearly they have other issues.

That said, people with a couple consecutive cycles of not meeting expectations were likely to be put on a PIP. I managed 4 people in that group, and all were able to successfully exit the PIP.All that said, every company and even org within a company have their own goals, targets, processes, and flows, and my experience was pre-COVID, so I&#x27;m also sure that any needle movement has been in the direction of harsher evaluations. reply linster 18 hours agorootparentAs a Canadian, “better than Exceeding” sounds like an American construction.I’d imagine the scale to be: 1.

The ratings themselves are associated with multipliers for your annual bonus and stock grants.

Combined with turnover, you&#x27;re bringing in a large number of new developers every year. Some people are really good at Leetcode and interviewing, but don&#x27;t actually like to do work at jobs, for example.IMO, the problem comes when these arbitrary thresholds are applied at low levels like individual teams. If you take a group of 18 people and declare that 1 of them must be fired every year no matter what, it&#x27;s terrible. On the other hand, if you were to look at a large department of 1000 people and went through everyone&#x27;s performance closely, I don&#x27;t think it would be hard to identify 60 people who weren&#x27;t working out.The other problem is that some people have become really good at gaming this system. Every time I&#x27;ve worked at a company that does arbitrary culling of employees, there was always a contingent of old timers who had mastered the system years ago and never found themselves up for consideration to PIP. Either they were friends with management, had some arcane knowledge that they refused to let anyone else access, or they were really good at buttering up their manager come performance review time. I can think of one guy who was always fighting with everyone and refusing to do work, but would become the sweetest, most helpful hero a couple times a year when some high profile issue came up.

When you&#x27;re hiring hundreds of people every year into a department, you&#x27;re going to get a couple people who don&#x27;t work out.I think people on HN get nervous around these discussions because they imagine companies as static collections of individuals, but at a high growth company you actually have a lot of new people coming through all the time.It&#x27;s also bad when companies never fire anyone.

As a manager, it&#x27;s a terrible feeling to tell someone they are out of a job. Not only that, but often times my own pay might be tied to how many people I manage, so in some cases, it&#x27;s better for me to have people around doing nothing than to let them go. By having a forced ranking&#x2F;culling, you somewhat alleviate the tendency of people not wanting to fire non-performing staff.Companies should have a culture where this isn&#x27;t the case. It should be encouraged to let people go with nice severance. You should be judged on your teams&#x27; output, not on how many people you manage. You should be rewarded for doing more with fewer staff. But enforcing this is very hard in a big company while enforcing a 6% cull is easy, so that&#x27;s what happens. reply tcgv 20 hours agoparentprevTheir interview process, while thorough, isn&#x27;t failproof.

Specifically to craft some extended documents around a potential product, to capture and present some of the research around that product to a group, etc. About five items.I completed them. All of them.My manager and I met for our regular 1:1s where he expressed that things were looking good (well, he no-showed for one, and my skip-level came for another).I show up to our end-of-PIP review and immediately know the outcome because HR is there with my manager. Part of me was pragmatic. However...What really ground my gears?\"I have been reviewing the documents and material you created as part of your objectives for the PIP and I feel that they are not of the standard that we need.\"I expressed confusion. \"When we discussed this in our meetings, you expressed no concern\". \"They&#x27;re just not the standard of what we need.\"And then literally during the call, I pulled up the documents and discovered&#x2F;remembered GDocs access list.I started screen sharing in front of him and HR.Document 1: Manager - Last Viewed: NeverDocument 2: Manager - Last Viewed: NeverAbout this point he turned his camera off.Rinse and repeat. Of about 5 documents, presentations, spreadsheets, he&#x27;d only ever looked at one of them, at that was months before the PIP.He mentioned that he had given me feedback more in Google Chat than in our 1:1s. I pulled up our chat history, simple to review, since he&#x27;d actually 100% ghosted me for the duration of the PIP. Sitting there in front of HR, with me firing off about a dozen questions, updates, etc., and there&#x27;s just no responses from manager.HR had at least the decency to look rather embarrassed about it all. My manager said nothing for the rest of the call.A few days later someone higher in HR acknowledged that they’d looked at the same things and confirmed my perspective and said that the managers handling of the PIP was not how it should have been but that their decision was final (which was fine, I never expected it to change anyone’s mind). reply tempnow987 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m often confused by folks going to great lengths to \"prove\" stuff to HR.

Especially at FAANG companies, growth is expected and the majority of compensation is stock. If you stop growing, and stop having a profit, your stock tanks, and future compensation - as well as compensation from years prior that is still in the form of company stock - becomes worth much less. You can&#x27;t hire people who are as good because you&#x27;re \"in decline.\" Your products falter because talent leaves and you can&#x27;t find new talent.

As soon as you own stock you will want them to increase in valuation. My point is a different one.

Something about the offer package would subsidize your base pay for a limited number of years until your stock started to vest, to smooth out your pay. However on the third year that subsidy would go away, and depending on the stock performance, your future stock grants could adjust down as well. In practice because the stock had been running up so much pre-2022, by the time the stock vested it was up a good amount.So if your stock grants & stock price performance after the third year weren&#x27;t \"just so\" you could see your TC slip because the salary subsidy went away. reply izacus 19 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but once X passes, your comp drops significantly - \"down a cliff\". reply fatherzine 17 hours agoparentprevThe point is to instill fear through humiliation.

They are not. They are cogs in the wheel as are their subordinates. It&#x27;s entirely possible this manager wasn&#x27;t even the one doing the direct ranking, sometimes this roles up to levels beyond where the manager can give real input. Someone has to get pipped as the system demands it, it happened to land on the person in the article. The manager is then trying to get them out of it because they believe they don&#x27;t actually require the pip.So this is both a failure of the manager (it is their job to navigate the system and boost their reports during stack ranking), and also a failure of the system as a whole (this person probably shouldn&#x27;t have been pipped).I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so much doublethink as it is this manager is trying to balance competing interests in their very immediate sphere. reply Obscurity4340 19 hours agorootparentprevHow can they be maintaining these completely antithetitical interests, like wjy do they want to arbitrarily fire the person at all if they have already evaluated that person to be worthy of retention?

You don&#x27;t get upset when a non-performer chooses to leave. Why would anyone continue to work under a manager that unjustly threatens them, or tries to motivate performance w&#x2F; fear? No, leaving was the right choice, even if they \"won\".To me, it sounds like the manager is the one who really needs to go. Perhaps this really isn&#x27;t Amazon policy at all, and this manager is being overly tyrannical and training his staff to be the same. We&#x27;ll never know.

Being PIP&#x27;ed or otherwise softly managed out is worse than being immediately fired.Being fired: Happens quickly, they either give you a reason or tell you \"your position has been eliminated.\" Sucks, but rips the Band Aid off and done is done.PIP: I&#x27;ve seen this happen to good and bad employees. Bad employees - it just drags out the process and provides a lot of friction and anguish, for the manager and maybe the employee. (Depends on whether they are actually even aware they&#x27;re a bad fit or not, and whether they&#x27;re well-intentioned or not.)Good employees? It&#x27;s literally gaslighting people. One day they&#x27;re pulled aside and told they&#x27;re not performing well enough and given a PIP. The PIP usually isn&#x27;t designed to help them get performance up - it&#x27;s creating a paper trail to manage them out.Suddenly (as described in the parent article) they&#x27;re being hit with complaints they&#x27;ve never heard before. Maybe there&#x27;s substance, maybe not. It&#x27;s a major blow to self-esteem and it&#x27;s a dragged out process. They&#x27;re not even given the satisfaction of a quick firing where they can be angry and done. It&#x27;s a long suffering.And to make the managers do this stuff - it&#x27;s awful. Having to lay somebody off when a company RIFs people sucks. Having to fire people usually sucks unless they&#x27;ve really earned it.

The PIP is to cover their butt that you really were a bad employee and you were not wrongfully terminated.

When I was PIPed out of Red Hat and claimed unemployment, benefits were approved.\"You or your employer said you were fired.We decided:You were fired, but there was no misconduct. You gave your best effort, but you were unable to do your job as expected.When you are fired but there is no misconduct, you are eligible for benefits.\" reply danaris 21 hours agorootparentprevIn some ways, yes.Firing you immediately for bullshit reasons is something you can potentially take to court, and also make a solid case for unemployment payments due to unfair termination.If they put you on a PIP, and then claim that you&#x27;re failing to meet it, even if they&#x27;re lying through their teeth, that makes it much harder to prove that their actions were unfair or illegal. Suddenly it&#x27;s no longer a \"person said, faceless company said;\" it&#x27;s \"person said, faceless company had months of documented (if falsified) evidence to back up their position\". Unless you are savvy enough to start documenting everything, which is a) hard to know you need to do, b) hard to know how to do effectively, and c) kind of exhausting even if you can get it right.To a large extent, the PIP process is there to cover Amazon&#x27;s ass and make sure that your firing sticks.And all that is if you don&#x27;t just get frustrated and fed up with being constantly told you&#x27;re failing to meet expectations that either you are, in fact, meeting, or no actual human could ever meet. reply NBJack 20 hours agorootparentThis reminds me of the big piece years ago talking about employees crying at their desks from the pressure.

    "originBody": "29 November 2023 7 min read The Weirdest Bug I’ve Seen Yet Engineering Collaboration On-call How digging into an on-call issue led to an unlikely culprit Photo by Mariusz Dabrowski / Unsplash What in tarnation? During one of my on-call rotations for our internal tools team, we got a report that Chrome was crashing for users of Gusto’s internal software. This was causing all sorts of interruptions to our normal customer service. Gusto employees in the middle of answering customer emails or phone calls might suddenly find themselves without visibility into customers’ accounts necessary to do their jobs. Chrome tab crash This was fairly far outside the usual scope of our on-call issues. Our team is generally well-insulated by other teams from issues like browser compatibility, so I didn’t know the first thing about browser debugging. Where would I even begin? I leaned on a more experienced teammate, our product infrastructure team, and our IT team. The first clues We started by trying to find out what the affected users had in common. We learned rather quickly that: Not all Gusto employee users were affected. Our customer-facing software did not appear to be affected. Other internal software webpages appeared to be fine. Crashing did not occur consistently. Users who experienced it could reload the same page multiple times, and sometimes it would crash and sometimes it would not. Not all of our internal pages crashed, but more than one of them did, including our most heavily-trafficked pages. The issue was not occurring with Safari or Firefox. Hunch #1: A bad Chrome version Our first hunch was that maybe it was the Chrome version. We had one affected user update their Chrome version, and early signs looked promising that the issue was resolved. However, we soon learned that although installing the new Chrome version decreased the frequency of crashing, it didn’t eliminate the issue. We added the following new clues to our list: The specific Chrome version had already been released for a while. We had affected users on different versions of Chrome. We had affected users and unaffected users on the same version of Chrome. Upgrading/downgrading the Chrome version for affected users did not fix the issue. Hunch #2: A bad Chrome extension Okay, maybe it was a Chrome extension? We thought the crashing stopped when one of our users disabled three core extensions. When we tried to reproduce the fix with a guest profile (without extensions present), we still saw crashing. Back to the drawing board, then. Trouble reproducing the bug Our Infrastructure team put out a call to all of engineering to ask if anyone could reproduce the issue. Frustratingly, although many of our customer service representatives were affected, none of our engineering teams reported any crashes at all except for two engineers in Turkey. With precious little overlap in available pairing time due to time zone differences, we slowly learned the following over several weeks: For security reasons, we do not have Chrome crash reporting enabled. Checking out code from several weeks prior did not fix the issue, which indicated that the cause was not a recent change. Loading a static html version of a crashing page did not cause crashing. Using open-source Chromium instead of Chrome did not cause crashes, so we couldn’t see what Chrome code was failing either. Several different internal applications were causing Chrome to crash, not just one. Removing all of the page-specific content from the page did not fix the issue. Disabling our in-house font did not fix the issue. As urgency waned because our users were using other browsers as a workaround, progress on this bug slowed to make way for other priorities. We didn’t have much left to go on without being able to reproduce the bug. However, we wanted to resolve it since users had bookmarks/settings/preferences in Chrome. We believed that we shouldn’t have to ask our users to avoid the world’s most popular browser, and we were also still getting periodic pings from various users asking whether we had made any progress on this bug. A stroke of good luck One day out of the blue, one of our Denver engineers reported being newly affected. The only change she had made was downloading the Grammarly desktop app. Wait, really? We had to see if we could reproduce the bug. I downloaded the Grammarly desktop app too. Instant reproduction of the issue (at last!). I deleted Grammarly. The issue didn’t go away. I restarted my computer and the issue went away again. I reinstalled Grammarly. Chrome started crashing again. We also confirmed with many of our affected users that they had Grammarly installed on their computers. Now we were cooking with fire! Making headway With our ability to debug now greatly improved, we started making tedious headway: make a change, reload the page ten times or until it crashes. Our main internal application is built on ActiveAdmin, but newer parts of it use React without the same ActiveAdmin framework as the rest of the application. The pages that are built in React did not crash. Hmm, so maybe our ActiveAdmin code was causing the crashes? We learned earlier that removing all page-specific content did not fix the issue, so we started looking at parts of the code that were common to multiple pages, like the main navigation header and sidebar. Notably, our React pages do not use the same navigation header. The code for our main navigation bar has a fair amount of metaprogramming, and chasing down threads here was often more confusing than not. We eventually figured out how to comment out pieces of the navigation bar, until we pinpointed one line that stopped crashing Chrome when it was commented out: dropdown 'My History', [], turbo: true, src: '/navigation/my_history' HTML This section is called “My History” and it differs from the rest of the main navigation in that instead of being more-or-less the same for all users, it is customized for each user, displaying the handful of pages that each user has visited most recently. We discovered that even when the page loaded successfully, hovering over the “My History” section could cause Chrome to immediately crash. So close we can smell it Hunch #3: Turbo Then we looked at turbo: true. Could that be causing the issue? Turbo is a gem we added to speed up our Rails application, but it turned out to be a red herring: it was only introduced after the bug had already been reported, and we learned that the engineer who introduced it had actually been experiencing these Chrome crashes for months prior to Turbo being introduced, and months prior to the bug being escalated to us. Okay, so where was the dropdown being defined? We use a framework called Arbre to metaprogram html from this type of method. To navigate the internal plumbing, I turned to one of our engineers with deep Rails knowledge. In this case, the relevant code (once we finally found it) looked like this: ul(class: 'dropdown-menu') do li(style: 'text-align: center;') { frontend_image_pack 'loaders/loader-spinner.gif' } if has_spinner menu_items.each do |item| li(id: \"#{attributes[:id]}_#{item.id}\") do text_node link_to item.name, item.url end end end Ruby Rails code for drop down menu This code generates html that looked something like this:Totally Awesome Company A Even More Awesome Company B HTML HTML for drop down menu We replaced the call to dropdown with the generated html, removing pieces of the new html until we zeroed in on the culprit. Eureka! When I removed loader-spinner.gif, the placeholder we display while the menu options load, the page stopped crashing. Eureka! It’s the gif! We swapped in a different gif and the page did not crash. We downloaded the image file and dragged the file into the browser window. With Shakespearean melodrama, the page immediately crashed. My pair and I both audibly gasped. We also found out that: Opening the file in Safari did not cause a crash. After uninstalling Grammarly and restarting the computer, the gif loaded in Chrome without crashing. At this point, we notified our Design Systems team of the very peculiar fact that this gif was causing Chrome to crash, and they promptly replaced it with a new one. Pull request for swapping the problematic GIF Why did this particular gif crash Chrome when Grammarly was installed? Unfortunately, with access to neither the Chrome source code nor the Grammarly source code, we can only guess. In the time since we replaced the gif, either Grammarly or Chrome or both have fixed this issue, because the original gif no longer causes Chrome to crash. Epilogue I would never, ever have guessed that the treasure at the end of the debugging rainbow was an animated gif. Even though the priority of this bug changed over time as we found workarounds, relentless curiosity won out in the end. No single one of us had all of the necessary knowledge to solve this bug on their own, but with persistence and collaboration, we were able to figure it out together. If you also enjoy collaborating with relentlessly curious people, we are hiring! Hats off to the many people who collaborated to investigate and fix this issue: Iain McGinniss, Lucy Fox, Gregor MacDougall, Oguzhan Ince, Can Gençler, Daniel Flynn, Eric Nagy, Lijie Zhou, Harry Seeber, Nathaniel Strauss, and Steve Konves.

It was impossible to reproduce but affecting lots of people internally within certain departments. Eventually we figured out the thing they had in common was that they had the Grammarly extension installed.The other key thing was that the bug only appeared on our staging preview urls, not on the live website. It turned out it was because of a bad regex in the grammarly extension that caused the page to hang if the domain name was more than about 100 characters. Our staging domains were pretty long, I think they contained a few subdomains and had a job number or something in there.This one is more crazy though if it is really caused by the desktop app - that&#x27;s pretty scary! reply karmakaze 9 hours agoparentI was so disappointed that the story ended with we can&#x27;t look inside Grammerly or Chrome to know why the gif decode&#x2F;rendering causes it to crash.

I had a similar thing happen with some web based video surveillance software maybe 5 years ago.A manager of some sort had his aging laptop replaced due to a company wide Windows 10 upgrade project. Super friendly older guy, probably in sales. IT went through all the procedures of inventorying software and network needs, backing up user profile and docs, etc. Great processes in place. I remember this because I saw the device assessment and it was like a 10 year old Thinkpad with 4G of RAM and a note saying he had to keep it plugged in at all times or it would shut down. Who puts up with that? Patience of a saint. Anyway.Laptop was deployed by onsite IT to verify everything was gravy. All checked out except for Grammarly. License didn&#x27;t get transferred properly or something so they had to put in a request to get his licensing working.Fast forward a week and he gets his license key and Grammarly is tested good to go. He&#x27;s checked off the list.Later that day we get a call about not being able to see security cameras because the web page is crashing. Helpdesk tries the basics, reboot, clear cache, reinstall browser, rebuild profile, etc., nothing works and it gets escalated to me. I check the network, firewall logs, log into another PC, onsite, off-site, etc. All working for me, no one else having issues.I tell him \"I&#x27;m completely baffled here, have there been any changes lately? In your office? With your PC?\" He jokingly says \"Well yeah they installed Grammarly today maybe that&#x27;s it?\" We both laugh and I say well, I&#x27;m literally out of ideas, fuck it let&#x27;s try it.I remote in and uninstall Grammarly. \"Ok go ahead and try the cameras lol\". I then watch him open up Outlook, go to a folder named \"Cameras\", and open an email with a link to his cameras \"home page\". It fuckin worked. I turned Grammarly back on and clicked the link and sure enough it failed.I made him a browser shortcut, moved his \"email shortcuts\" into his browser, blew his mind, and closed the ticket, but it definitely bugged me.This tracks because it was some very dated camera software (you&#x27;ll know what I mean if you&#x27;ve seen it) and the link was to his customized homepage with a super long php (or something) generated url. He was the only one at the site with Grammarly as well so it was the only time we saw the problem.Thank you, I can finally close this cold case out in my brain. reply leptons 23 minutes agoparentprevIf a website bug is not easily solved, first order of troubleshooting is to disable all extensions.

How does a video card affect printing? reply to11mtm 11 hours agorootparentOne of the ways to print things (especially on windows) is Via GDI. [0]Basically using the OS&#x27;s rendering to make a raster that is then sent to the printer. The main thing the printer&#x27;s driver does in this case is know how to take the bitmap and tell the printer to print the bitmap (i.e. chunking data and&#x2F;or sliding the right commands into the bitmap stream)Contrast to, say, PostScript which allow for more compact and better scaling definition of what to print. This obviously works better for quality, however for a long time the issue was you then had to have sufficient processing power on the printer itself to handle it.[0] - Search for &#x27;GDI Printer&#x27; for a little more info. reply generationP 8 hours agorootparentInteresting! So that&#x27;s why I used to get crappily rasterized printouts of PDFs in Chrome a few years ago.I had thought printers could be trusted with their own rendering, but of course that is another can of worms... reply userbinator 8 hours agorootparentprevMore relevant to the bug is the fact that GDI can do its own rendering, or send commands to a driver, usually for GPU hardware acceleration, but the same applies to printers. reply shever73 11 hours agorootparentprevIt often did, particularly on older versions of Windows. I helped uncover a bug in Epson printer drivers ~20 years ago that was caused by a specific graphics card. reply shermantanktop 11 hours agorootparent20+ years ago I was in tech support and had to help someone figure out an issue where her document wouldn&#x27;t print on a Brother printer.

That makes sense. I had no idea. reply jspaetzel 12 minutes agoprevI&#x27;ve run into something similar to this a few years ago where chrome randomly introduced a rendering bug that resulted in a similar crash and only affected our application in seemingly random fashion. I don&#x27;t remember the full context but I think it was something involving layers & transparency.We finally figured it out when a coworker couldn&#x27;t replicate and we noticed they were a version of chrome behind. We were able to track down the specific commits in chrome that broke & fixed it in our case which was pretty cool to see at the time.If you have any more time I recommend reading through the commit log and see if you can find the changes that broke&#x2F;fixed this for you. I&#x27;d bet on another rendering bug. reply cristeigabriel 4 minutes agoprevIf Chrome is able to generate a crash-report, nothing would prevent you to intercept it.> Unfortunately, with access to neither the Chrome source code [...]I mean, it&#x27;s still very possible to debug (especially with the fact in mind that Chromium is open-source, and for me has been a very useful source when reverse-engineering and debugging Chrome), but I understand why web developers would not be trained in reverse-engineering techniques. reply aquafox 11 hours agoprevI randomly had the issue that after booting up Linux, I didn&#x27;t have any sound.

But it&#x27;s just accidental correctness. As soon as something causes the system to bank left, something&#x27;s gonna break and no one knows how to fix it - and you&#x27;re back to square one.On the other hand, as hard as it is, if you can clearly tell why your fix will restore function to the system without even applying it, you have deliberate correctness and function. If done right, it is very boring, because exactly and only the expected thing will happen. You should know about the unknowns and plan around those as well, so even if an unknown bites you, it&#x27;s a known and handled unknown. This can be exhausting to make happen, because it is much harder, but those systems will just work.But this is a fight I have with some development teams probably forever. \"But we poked at the values, and that stopped the flames.

There is no absolute SEGFAULT of the OS causing the misbehavior. However, they nail down the crash to a gif, and if the gif is in, it crashes, and if the gif is out it doesn&#x27;t. If the gif is loaded otherwise it crashes, too. At that level, to me, that would be enough, because we&#x27;re users of the browser&#x27;s rendering there.Finding a solid cause that can demonstrate and reproduce a problem, and basing a workaround around that at a boundary you&#x27;re unwilling to cross can be fine. If it&#x27;s within the company, it absolutely is fine as long as you escalate beyond that boundary.However, I have enough teams who are like \"Oh, we set all values to 25 one by one and when we arrived at flum-value at 25 it stopped crashing. Fixed.\" Why 25? Who knows. Why flum? Who knows. Maybe the other value changed at the same time fixed it? Who knows. Do we use 26 once it starts crashing again? Fuck knows.

It seemingly occurs whenever I have a lot (100+) of tabs open for any site where each page allocates at least one accelerated drawing canvas (a literal , or a , or a .gif .) I&#x27;ve seen it happen on Reddit (but only new reddit, not old reddit!) and on a number of other sites.I hypothesize that Chrome simply has a global (i.e. cross-tab) per-toplevel-origin limit to the number of allocated accelerated drawing canvases it&#x27;s willing to allow; and that when you go over it, Chrome forcibly de-allocates all the existing drawing canvases used by other tabs that have that toplevel origin loaded, thereby causing them to crash. It&#x27;s probably a measure designed to prevent a site from from DoSing your computer by just allocating an infinite number of canvases. reply nonethewiser 10 hours agorootparentThey said it also crashes when they just load the gif.

Totally looking forward to a follow up to this later down the road, I am sure this isn&#x27;t going to be the last time we hear of this. reply crazygringo 12 hours agoprevtl;dr: a certain GIF would crash a Chrome tab, but only when the desktop version of Grammarly was installed. (Not a Chrome extension.)That&#x27;s insane!Can anyone think by what possible mechanism the installation of Grammarly could affect whether a .gif file would crash Chrome?The company seems to be on Macs since they report that the problem doesn&#x27;t surface in Safari.Is there some kind of dynamically-linked GIF decoding library used by macOS that Chrome relies upon, and Grammarly somehow installs one that takes precedence for all applications? I didn&#x27;t think this would be possible -- I thought image decoding was done natively in the browser and not outsourced to the OS, for security reasons. reply masswerk 8 hours agoparentMaybe, the GIF contains a text comment and Grammarly not only accesses this, but also alters it (for whatever reason), thus overwriting the file in a way in memory that offsets in the GIF file or its in-memory representation are violated? reply saagarjha 11 hours agoparentprevThis would be strange since macOS should not let Chrome load libraries that aren’t signed by Google. reply ja5087 12 hours agoprevWe used to develop software that used the Windows Accessibility APIs (UI Automation).

Decades ago, a small company was able to convince most of the education system (public and sometimes private) to use a teaching method based on junk science. The end result is that there are many millions of adults in the current workforce who can barely read, and many of them work in office settings. Some of those would install anything that would help them through text-based communications.[1]: \"How a flawed idea is teaching millions of kids to be poor readers\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apmreports.org&#x2F;episode&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;22&#x2F;whats-wrong-ho...[2]: \"Sold a Story: How Teaching Kids to Read Went So Wrong\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;features.apmreports.org&#x2F;sold-a-story&#x2F;[3]: \"According to the U.S. Department of Education, 54% of U.S. adults lack proficiency in literacy, reading below the equivalent of a sixth-grade level\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;todayilearned&#x2F;comments&#x2F;rqulik&#x2F;til_t... reply akira2501 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s odd to read the story of an adult who believes they&#x27;re a poor reader, still to this day apparently, because of what happened to them 30 years ago.

My academic interests are pretty broad, and I could improve in every subject, so why don&#x27;t I? I think there are two reasons: a lack of focused effort, and the steadily increasing demands of adulthood.I do reasonably okay at self-guided education when I want to, but there&#x27;s definitely a difference vs. a structured secondary education environment, where there is accountability and other people to guide each other through the process. And, that&#x27;s coming in to those subjects with already a better-than-average literacy and numeracy; I have to expect that for people who struggle with grade school reading comprehension or math, trying to bootstrap those abilities alone would be daunting.Also, there&#x27;s just less room for pursuing those now. Lots of people are getting squeezed by concerns that aren&#x27;t part of most childrens&#x27; awareness -- housing costs, bureaucracy, the treadmill of maintaining all the machines that get us through daily life. Those add enormous pressure to dedicate more time towards professional development and \"getting ahead\", or at least not falling further behind, and that has been eroding all of the unstructured time that I would spend working my way through a textbook (or online class). People with poor literacy are probably more likely to have lower-paying positions, so all of those demands are even more severe.Not that it&#x27;s impossible. Lots of people do manage to self-educate their way out of poorer circumstances, and certainly the internet has made that far more accessible than it was before the turn of the century. But, let&#x27;s not underestimate how challenging it is, either. reply WarOnPrivacy 10 hours agorootparent> My academic interests are pretty broad, and I could improve in every subject, so why don&#x27;t I?My suspected culprits:1) The massively increased complexity of ordinary living is overconsumining our personal resources. and2) For post-GenX and later, the erasure of childhood (free-roaming & peer-only hours) sabotages[1] the reward systems (joy) that supercharge early learning.The less joy there is to facilitate learning, the more effort is required (from otherwise overly depleted resources).[1] similar to what abuse and neglect do reply djhn 9 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t the opposite true with regards to complexity of ordinary living?

I&#x27;m probably biased but I&#x27;ve always considered the French education system to be quite rigorous and well rounded, with a few different education paths to fit different student profiles from a pretty early stage. Especially compared to canada, which in my experience has a rather weak and rigid curriculum.(Though I dislike the way french and European higher education in general works. You&#x27;re basically boxed in to your specific domain or degree that you often don&#x27;t even really choose and changing or switching careers is almost impossible. The choices you make in high school basically define what you can even study in, and thus what you can do for the rest of your life.

With the different high school tiers that can even make it impossible to enroll for a university degree? Though you are right that I shouldn&#x27;t say that Europe as a whole is like Germany or France even if it&#x27;s sometime easy to assume so haha. reply jacquesm 8 hours agorootparentGermany tends to be more focused on paperwork, there isn&#x27;t a German that is even moderately active in business that I know that doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;steuerberater&#x27;, it&#x27;s overly complicated and the paper tends to be in the lead. Germany has fewer free professions than other EU countries as far as I know, lots of things are regulated and it can definitely be harder to switch. But it isn&#x27;t impossible and I know more than one German who successfully switched careers, even between regulated industries and academic &#x2F; business careers.In France, from what I know there is a fairly strong culture of secondary education that creates an &#x27;in-group&#x27;, not unlike what you see in the UK or the USA with their top-tier universities, and you are either &#x27;on the plan&#x27; or you won&#x27;t be able to get in unless you are of exceptional abilities and that rarely happens later in life, so I think that alone is sufficient to explain the discrepancy.In NL you can enroll in higher education basically whenever you want, quota permitting and with the intense competition for such spots from abroad by very qualified young people this too can be tricky, depending on the field. But in NL a university degree isn&#x27;t a pre-requisite for many jobs outside of academia (and teaching) itself.Anything to do with technology tends to be more merit based, and achievement there tends to trump formal education, and by the time you are 40+ that formal education tends to be weighted far less than when you are say 25 and just out of school.Other countries would add more to the pattern of variability, there is a huge difference between say Poland or Romania or the Nordics or the Baltics, further reflected in the weight that which a diploma or degree from such institution would carry, especially abroad. For instance, right now in the Baltics there is something of a brain drain happening with the younger generation moving West in droves and so as an older person it is stupidly easy to enroll in a university program. But that degree isn&#x27;t going to help you much unless you remain in the local economy and the degrees from a decade or more ago are given more weight than the ones that you get there right now because they are fairly desperate for students just to keep the departments up and running. reply Jakob 9 hours agorootparentprevThere are different tiers of highschools and different tiers of higher education.The first tiers are more targetted towards craftsmanship (e.g. arithmetic and trigonometry you can quickly do in your head, you start working earlier in life, as early as 16) while the latter tiers are more universal and abstract (e.g. math concepts that have better use for computer science, you start working much later, around 25 years old).You can switch between tiers or fetch later. reply mardifoufs 7 hours agorootparentThanks for the details! If you wanted to switch from craftsmanship to say, a more abstract field. Would you have to do the entire 10 years (ish?) of \"missed\" education?I know that here in Quebec, you can enroll in university no matter what as long as you are 21 years old and finished high school.

Literacy rate of my “third world” country is %16 higher than US atm. reply Retric 12 hours agorootparentBe careful trying to compare countries or even historical numbers when standards vary. The US has a 99% literacy rate based on some metrics, but as often happens when metrics become useless the people tracking them raise the bar.Thus the US’s “Level 1” literacy rate, which represents being able to follow basic written instructions, was 92% in 2014. But in 2020 the standard changed yet again to: “54% of adults in the United States have English prose literacy below the 6th-grade level.” Noticeably being literate in a non English language suddenly doesn’t count, the prose at 6th grade level is also higher than it’s been in the past.Or as Wikipedia puts it: In many nations, the ability to read a simple sentence suffices as literacy, and was the previous standard for the U.S. The definition of literacy has changed greatly; the term is presently defined as the ability to use printed and written information to function in society, to achieve one&#x27;s goals, and to develop one&#x27;s knowledge and potential.[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Literacy_in_the_United_States reply mardifoufs 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s the functional literacy rate though? reply NautilusWave 10 hours agorootparentprevBetween the whole language approach to literacy and undiagnosed ADHD, I was very slow at learning how to read.

(Annoying how hard they work to bury the lede.) reply thaumaturgy 9 hours agorootparentIf I remember right (it has been a while since I dived into this topic), Reading Recovery was one of the programs mentioned. It was supposed to be a supporting approach to teaching reading to kids who were struggling otherwise.The mainstream approach that really made a hash of things though was \"Whole Language\" learning, largely commercialized by Fountas and Pinnell, which eventually provided the program and associated materials to classrooms around the world. This program relied, in part, on guessing: if a child got stuck on a word, they would be asked to guess what word might fit in the sentence. Sometimes they were given context clues, like a picture on the page. Any efforts to associate individual letters or letter combinations with sounds was abandoned.Wikipedia has something of a watered-down overview of this at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Whole_language, but I really recommend listening to the podcast in the second link in my parent comment (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;features.apmreports.org&#x2F;sold-a-story&#x2F;), APM Reports put together a compelling examination of what happened, and it&#x27;s explained well.

    "originBody": "Home » « Resources » CSAR: European Parliament rejects mass scanning of private messages. Here is why CSAR: European Parliament rejects mass scanning of private messages. Here is why On 22 November, the European Parliament officially adopted its position on the draft ‘Regulation laying down rules to prevent and combat child sexual abuse’ (CSAR). With strong support for this position from all seven European political groups, this marks a positive development for human rights in one of the most controversial draft European Union (EU) laws in recent memory. By EDRi · November 30, 2023 On 22 November, the European Parliament officially adopted its position on the draft ‘Regulation laying down rules to prevent and combat child sexual abuse’ (CSAR). With strong support for this position from all seven European political groups, this marks a positive development for human rights in one of the most controversial draft European Union (EU) laws in recent memory. EDRi has long advocated against the CSAR’s mass scanning and encryption-breaking measures proposed in 2022 by the EU executive’s unit for home affairs. We are reassured, therefore, that the Parliament has listened to the evidence and the rule of law. At the same time, we are still far from the end of the legislative process. This means that we must stay alert to how the other two law-making institutions – the Council of EU Member States and the European Commission – respond. Will they agree with the Parliament that new EU laws need to respect fundamental rights? Or will they double down on ‘Chat Control’? The position of the European Parliament As we explained when this position was provisionally agreed by the Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee on 14 November, it is a clear political statement that even the most important societal aims do not justify measures at any cost. EU fundamental rights law requires that limitations on people’s rights are necessary for the aim they seek to achieve – including being objectively effective and the least intrusive possible – and proportionate. That means that their broader impact must be reasonable. On this basis, the Parliament firmly rejected rules which would force companies to scan huge volumes of people’s private messages – instead now requiring there to be reasonable suspicion. Lawyers for the Council of EU Member States had previously made an unprecedented warning that the original proposal would violate the essence of the right to privacy. In EU-speak, this is a damning assessment, because case law from the Court of Justice of the EU has always upheld that while rights can be limited for justifiable reasons, the “essential core” of any human right must never be violated. The Parliament has clearly listened to this warning. EDRi’s work and coalition Since before the home affairs unit (DG HOME) first put forward this law, EDRi has been on the front lines urging the EU to ensure that measures to tackle the serious crime of child sexual abuse are in line with human rights rules. Yet our ‘10 principles to defend children in the digital age’ were ignored in the original legislative proposal (so too were concerns from the Commission’s own review board). Thanks to the EDRi-led Stop Scanning Me campaign, thousands of people across Europe have since sounded the alarm about the draft measures. Scientists and researchers across the world have been unambiguous that as proposed, the measures would undermine encryption, putting everyone’s digital information at risk of harm. And other stakeholders such as journalists, youth activists, lawyers and survivors’ associations have warned how they could be put at risk by the proposal. What’s next? As their position has been officially adopted, the European Parliament is ready to enter “trilogues”. This is closed-door negotiations between lead Parliamentarians and the Council of EU Member State governments. However, in this case, the Council does not currently have a negotiating mandate with which to enter the trilogues. In fact, EU Member State governments have been divided on the issue, with some countries refusing to listen to technological and legal reality. Fortunately, many others have stood up against their colleagues, rightly warning that the EU cannot give a carte blanche to the destruction of digital security, privacy and anonymity. Back in July, EDRi urged Member State governments not to agree to a position which would usher in the mass surveillance of everyone’s digital private lives. People subsequently took to the streets in Germany, Sweden and several other locations to urge their governments not to accept ‘Chat Control’. These efforts paid off, with the governments of Germany, Austria, Poland, Estonia and Slovenia reportedly taking a firm stance against the misguided proposal, and France subsequently raising major concerns. Without a Council position, the legislative process for the CSAR is currently in limbo. The Spanish Presidency of the Council is reportedly attempting to push through a position before the end of their mandate (end December 2023). But at the time of writing, they do not have a text on the table – let alone political agreement from a sufficient number of Member States. Even if the Council is able to agree their position soon, it is highly unlikely that they would be able to pass the law during this political mandate. That’s because we are approaching a once-in-five-years event: European elections. In June 2024, a new Parliament will be elected, and subsequently, a new set of European Commissioners will be appointed. According to leaked documents, this means that any negotiations between the legislative institutions must wrap up by early February 2024. Whilst trilogue negotiations on even simple laws can take months, it would be unprecedented for such a complex and sensitive file as CSAR – with so much at stake – to be pushed through in such a short time. This current limbo also means that the political figurehead for the CSAR, controversial Swedish Commissioner Ylva Johansson, is unlikely to remain in post for this proposal’s life-cycle. EDRi has consistently advocated that laws to tackle CSA online must be in line with fundamental rights law and with objective evidence of effectiveness. With this latest step, the European Parliament has firmly rebutted DG HOME’s attempt to pass a law which bitterly fails on both of these counts. Whilst the next steps for this law are not clear, this is nevertheless a huge milestone for the protection of digital human rights, and we are counting on the Council not to go backwards. Join EDRi’s supporter list & become an active changemaker Ahead of 2024 EU elections, you can shape EU digital policy that will make the internet a more secure space for all.",

But to me that&#x27;s reflective of the EU Commission having a desired policy from the start, then mainly seeking out experts who could help them achieve their goal. reply vlovich123 15 hours agorootparentprevI didn’t check all of the people but picked 2 names at random and they were policy people not engineers. reply raxxorraxor 18 hours agorootparentprevAlso, while the most egregious part might be cancelled, these type of bills often still bring along their slightly less bad, but still fairly ugly brothers.So private message scanning is off the table, we now just save meta data and build a communication graph for every citizen for the last 10 years.No idea if this bill includes such laws, but that is usually the strategy to get people distracted. reply jstarfish 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s the sucker-punch of legal maneuvers. reply Angostura 20 hours agorootparentprevThe Parliament is very much the junior member compared with the Council and Commission reply toyg 20 hours agorootparentIt still has ultimate veto powers. reply Angostura 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been unable to find an instance of the European Parliament vetoing legislation reply toyg 18 hours agorootparentPlenty.

But who cares about the truth, if the truth doesn&#x27;t get you votes at home. It&#x27;s just so disappointing that the regular Joe Voter, even though very loud about \"doing their own research\", never actually DO their own research, just swallow whatever they&#x27;re told in their bubble. reply Angostura 18 hours agorootparentprevBut if you look at the first case, for example that was a rejection a first reading - not a definitive killing off.It&#x27;s not quite clear what happens next - the Council of ministers may apparently decide to continue working on the legislation regardless of the Parliament&#x27;s vote.In other words - it is not evidence of an \"ultimate veto power\" reply toyg 13 hours agorootparentCouncil and Commission can work on whatever they want - if it&#x27;s not ultimately approved by an EP plenary, it&#x27;s not a Directive. Occasionally some governments will go ahead and introduce laws that they tried and failed to go past the EP, but that&#x27;s just national politics in action. reply tormeh 16 hours agorootparentprevThey can continue to work on it, but without the parliament&#x27;s approval it cannot become law. reply agent327 15 hours agorootparentprevHere&#x27;s an overview of the political composition of the European Parliament: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;European_Parliament#ElectionsHow do you reckon it is \"dominated by right-wing parties\"? Those parties make up about 20% of the parliament, whereas left-wing parties make up some 35% (with the rest being centrists and &#x27;other&#x27;). reply jltsiren 11 hours agorootparentYou have a weird definition of left and right.If you think that Social democrats (S&D; center-left) are \"left\", then Christian democrats and conservatives (EPP; center-right) are \"right\". Those two are the traditional mainstream left-wing and right-wing groups in Europe. With these, we have 141 seats for the left and 178 seats for the right.Then we have more radical parties with a clear position on the left-right axis. The inconveniently named The Left in the European Parliament have 37 seats, while their right-wing counterparts are ECR (66 seats) and ID (60 seats). This brings the total to 178 seats for the left and 304 seats for the right.There are also two centrist-groups: Greens&#x2F;EFA (72 seats) and ALDE (102 seats). The former is a weird amalgamation of greens, regional parties, independents, and pirates ranging from left to center. The latter consists of center to center-right parties that usually have some connection to the liberal tradition. But in some cases, the party in ALDE is more conservative and less liberal than their national counterpart in EPP. If we include these centrist groups in the calculations, the balance shifts further to the right.Finally there are 49 MEPs outside the major parties, bringing the total to 705. reply toyg 14 hours agorootparentprevI guess your definition of \"right-wing\" is a bit different from mine. \"Centrists\" in post-WW2 Europe are largely conservative: fundamentally religious, pro-business, anti-immigration. That, to me, is right-wing - respectable, not touting nazi tattoos (mostly), but still fundamentally reactionary in nature. Those blocs are usually allied with \"liberal\" parties, a term which in Europe carries right-wing connotations because \"liberalism\" is meant in the original economic sense: free-trade, unbridled capitalism, etc. Occasionally they ally even with ultra-right parties, which often include real neofascist &#x2F; neonazis.If you consider them like that, traditionally-conservative parties account for over 65% of current MEPs. reply agent327 12 hours agorootparentPredictably, someone comes along to argue that anyone who is not fully in the left must therefore be right-wing. Don&#x27;t you see that the word &#x27;centrist&#x27; indicates people who are in the center, and therefore by definition not right-wing?Oh, and that &#x27;mostly&#x27;? Take it down a notch. There are no actual nazis in the European Parliament. reply toyg 11 hours agorootparentNeonazi maybe not (yet), but neofascists for sure: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;23248823.2023.22...The \"centrism\" framing, btw, is fundamentally useless. In postwar Europe, PSE parties are left-wing and PPE parties are right-wing; other parties are fundamentally defined by their primary relationship with one of these two. The \"centrism\" mantra is reactionary twaddle to justify one&#x27;s ideological vacuum. reply nvoeiah 11 hours agorootparentIf only EPP parties were really right-wing. I say this as an actual conservative. EPP parties generally are \"our position is whatever the left espoused ten years ago\". Which is, basically, a very progressive position. reply jltsiren 8 hours agorootparentTraditional European parties have been converging towards the center. That&#x27;s largely thanks to the EU, which is a centrist project founded on ideas such as social liberalism and pro-market policies. Social democratic parties have also become pretty right-wing by their traditional standards, largely due to Third Way politics that have been dominant since the late 90s. replyorwin 13 hours agorootparentprevEPP is a right-wing party. Its basically a mix of christian democrats (basically catholics), conservative (Les Republicains, amny others) and some liberals-conservatives (pro free-trade, anti union, pro-immigration if it makes labor cheaper, but also really conservative on according right to those migrants). It is also pro EU, in a weird way (Forza Italia is a member).ALDE-PACE is basically Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s party, so more socially liberal, and by that i mean he does accept that gay people do exist and can do whatever they want, if they want (the bar is low). They also are very pro-immigration in sectors that boost economies, but accept that immigrant workers can have equal rights. Extremely pro-Europe. I&#x27;d call them right-wing, but to be fair, only its leader is, most party members are pretty much center, center-right (they would be liberal-democrat in the US), and they push a lot of the legislation the greens want to pass, for multiple reasons (the green are seen as an \"acceptable compromise\", citing an EPP member i ate with).I would not call the current Green left-wing either, its a torn party. I guess after the Covid and last summer, the wars and the resulting immigration, a lot of young people joined, and politically active young people are more left-wing, but the leaders are more center, center-left. But they hold major power on the left and can work with the other center party, and sometimes even the EPP. They are also on point (and have&#x2F;propose good formations) with privacy and civil liberties, which might seems left-wing if you&#x27;re in the US, but to me it&#x27;s basically to political proposition of the old french party \"les radicaux\" which was so much in the center they split in two 30 years ago). reply uxp8u61q 13 hours agorootparentprev\"Centrists\" are right wing in European politics. reply zajio1am 17 hours agorootparentprevOnce i read an analysis comparing EP legislative action to action of national parliaments and it said that EP has much higher rate of rejecting legislation.It makes sense - in parliamentary democracy, the coalition in government has majority in parliament and government members are often party leaders (or other important people in parties), so legislature could be pushed through parliament by party lines.In EP there is much weaker connection between government (EU Commission) and EP, which makes EP more independent. reply xvector 20 hours agorootparentprevFinally, some good name and shame. I hope someone well-funded exposes these people for who they are and turns public opinion against them en masse. reply bradley13 17 hours agoparentprevAbsolutely this. They just keep trying, one angle or another. They&#x27;ll be back for another try in a year or three, with new arguments, and having purchased a few more politicians. In the worst case, they&#x27;ll do something like the USA: institute secret programs that do whatever the heck they want, with no oversight.Part of the problem is that there are no negative consequences. Again, look at the US: Snowden reveals massive, illegal surveillance. Consequences to politicians and government officials: zero. reply freedomben 14 hours agoparentprevYep, the standard playbook on this stuff is to table it for 6 months, at which point you reintroduce. Repeat ad infinitum until it passes. If at any point there&#x27;s a crisis that can be used, reintroduce immediately. reply prox 21 hours agoparentprevSo it needs be enshrined in a constitution I wager. reply phtrivier 20 hours agorootparentWell, the trick is, a surefire way to make voters angry in large part of the continents (or, well, large part of France anyway) it so put \"Constitution\" and \"Europe\" in the same sentence - so there is not much of a place to enshrine that at the EU level.Besides, every member state&#x27;s constitution probably already has a variant of \"privacy is a fundamental right except in cases defined by law\".I will argue that we _definitely do_ want cases where privacy is not 100% respected (sadly, \"investigating crime\" is not always a red herring, newspeak, lobbying propaganda, etc...People really do that for a living, and in the common interest.)In the end, it will always be a policymaker&#x27;s job to draw the lines.What I would love to enshrine in a constitution is that \"People shall choose policymakers wisely.\". But I&#x27;m not sure of how to enforce that :&#x2F; reply dannyw 20 hours agorootparentI think the 4th amendment did a good job and is quite specific. The courts rewrote it judicially.> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,[a] against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized reply waterheater 18 hours agorootparentThe Fourth Amendment protects the physical, yet other amendments also address privacy in different ways. The First Amendment protects the mind and arguably one&#x27;s spirit, the Third Amendment is a specific type of physical protection, the Fifth Amendment also protects the mind, the Ninth Amendment protects the existence of privacy, and the Tenth Amendment lets states implement greater privacy protections as they see fit.Given privacy is fundamentally related to the expression of free will, it&#x27;s not surprising so much touches it. reply smolder 17 hours agorootparent> The Fourth Amendment protects the physical,That&#x27;s a narrow reading of it. \"Papers and effects\" ought to extend to our data as well, something the authors could not have called out more explicitly at the time of its writing. Call it inconvenient or impractical, whatever, but it&#x27;s ridiculous to conclude their intent was that government can spy on presumed innocents as long as they don&#x27;t make a physical mess.I think third party doctrine is also a pile of crap... and that data brokers shouldn&#x27;t have a square inch of legal ground to stand on. GDPR sets a good example in that regard. reply waterheater 16 hours agorootparentI completely agree, and computing has flipped the table on our understanding of the Fourth Amendment. In fact, our technological development and privacy concerns are proportional, which says something quite profound. Are you familiar with Kyllo v. United States and Carpenter v. United States?

First, in come countries legislation breaching constitutional rights appear all the time and the burden is on the people to fight that legislation that is presumed valid. Second, people believe that some rights are no longer aligned with the modern times (see USA second amendment) and are willing to remove it. Third, constitutional rights that are not completely removed are brutally \"regulated\", with the same effect, and most people agree with that or actively support it.In summary, there are no rights that are guaranteed even if they are in a constitution. reply varispeed 20 hours agorootparentprevIt should be illegal to even propose this and it should be equalled to hate crime.People who think this is okay, to the point that they want to enact this in law should be cast out of the society. reply JW_00000 16 hours agorootparentIt seems dangerous to make proposing laws in a parliament illegal, don&#x27;t you think?

    "originBody": "Stanisław Lem's Prescient Vision of Artificial Life As with the best science fiction, Lem’s novel “The Invincible” has as much to teach us about our present situations as any futures we may face. By: N. Katherine Hayles In the grand tradition of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, Stanisław Lem’s “The Invincible” tells the story of a space cruiser sent to an obscure planet to determine the fate of a sister spaceship whose communication with Earth has abruptly ceased. Landing on the planet Regis III, navigator Rohan and his crew discover a form of life that has apparently evolved from autonomous, self-replicating machines — perhaps the survivors of a “robot war.” Rohan and his men are forced to confront the classic quandary: What course of action can humanity take once it has reached the limits of its knowledge? In “The Invincible,” Lem has his characters confront the inexplicable and the bizarre: the problem that lies just beyond analytical reach. The following is literary critic and theorist N. Katherine Hayles’ foreword to the 2020 edition of Lem’s classic novel, which was originally published in Polish in 1964. Science fiction has famously predicted many of the important technologies of the 20th century: space travel, satellites, the atomic bomb, television, the internet, and virtual reality, to name a few. In “The Invincible,” Stanisław Lem predicts another: artificial life. Although speculations about self-reproducing artificial systems date from the 1940s, the scientific field received its name from Christopher Langton only in 1986, more than two decades after the original publication of “The Invincible” (1964). One of the central controversies in artificial life is whether evolutionary programs and devices are actually alive (the strong version), or whether they merely simulate life (the weak version). Researchers who follow the strong version argue that the processes embedded in software programs such as genetic algorithms are as “natural” as life itself; what is artificial is the medium in which these processes take place. This foreword first appeared in the 2020 English edition of Stanisław Lem’s novel “The Invincible.” The issue prompted Robert Rosen, among others, to speculate about the essential characteristics of “life itself,” not only as it evolved on Earth in carbon-based life forms but also about the possibility of life-as-it-could-be in exoplanetary systems, arguing that silicon-based artificial life forms may provide insight into these theoretical speculations. “The Invincible” presents a fascinating hybridization of these different views. Dr. Lauda’s hypothesis proposes that a space ship from the Lycran system landed on Regis III millions of years ago; while the biological visitors perished, the automata did not. There then followed an evolutionary struggle between the automata and the planet’s indigenous life forms, on the one hand, and between the different kinds of automata, on the other. Such a scenario requires that the “survive and reproduce” mandate that governs life on Earth could also operate on this planet. Lem minimally fulfills the requirement by postulating that the automata could manufacture themselves with modifications dictated by evolutionary processes. Clearly his interest is not in filling out how this might take place (John von Neumann, encountering a similar problem, imagined metal parts floating on a lake that could self-assemble). Rather, Lem’s focus is on envisioning an artificial life form that won the evolutionary competition on Regis III for profoundly different reasons than did Homo sapiens on Earth. The effect is achieved by introducing a significant factor that has a monumental impact on evolutionary trajectories: rather than fulfilling their energy needs through ingesting food, the automata on Regis III evolve to use solar power. The smaller the artificial organism, the less energy it needs. Hence the evolutionary driver is toward smaller forms, which overcome not through superior intellect but through swarm intelligence. Lem added to this the ability of the swarm of “flies” to generate immensely powerful electromagnetic fields, which meant that the tiny automata are not only the evolutionary winners on their planet but a powerful force against the invading humans. Their tiny size notwithstanding, their awesome potential illuminates the profound ambiguity of the work’s title, which can be taken to refer either to the spaceship’s proud name or to the swarms of alien automata that threaten it. “From a broader cosmic perspective, the best of human science, engineering, and weaponry may reveal humans to be completely out of our depth, mere kindergarteners bidding for a place in the universe’s adult civilizations.” Contemporary research in artificial life has validated Lem’s insight that swarms of artificial beings require only a few simple rules to manifest complex behaviors and hence each member needs to carry only a little cognitive power onboard. Computer simulations that have accurately depicted swarm behaviors in fish, birds, bees, and other biota demonstrate that each individual responds only to the four or five closest to it, with rule sets that take up only a few lines of code. For example, a school of fish swimming to evade a predator is guided by the fish closest to the predator. The direction this most imperiled individual follows determines how the entire school will run as it flashes back and forth, a simple strategy that makes excellent sense, since the fish that has the most to lose will try hardest to escape. Although each fish’s behaviors are simple, the collective result nevertheless generates swarm intelligence of considerable complexity. Decades before these ideas became disseminated within the scientific community, Lem intuited that different environmental constraints might lead to radically different evolutionary results in automata compared to biological life forms. Although on Earth the most intelligent species (i.e., humans) has tended to fare the best, their superior intelligence comes with considerable costs: a long period of maturation; a lot of resources invested in each individual; socialization patterns that emphasize pair bonding and community support; and a premium on individual achievement. But these are not cosmic universals, and different planetary histories might result in the triumph of very different kinds of qualities. The contrasts between humans and the automata swarm are brought out most poignantly in the scene between Captain Horpach and First Officer Rohan, in which the captain delegates to Rohan the decision whether to put another crew member in grave danger to determine if the missing four men have indeed perished, as seems all but certain, or whether one or more might still be alive. The assumptions that make this gamble even remotely worth taking are revealing: human life is precious; human solidarity depends on the crew’s belief that everything possible will be done to save them if they are in peril; and every human is unique and therefore uniquely valuable. None of these, of course, holds true for the swarm, whose individual members are virtually identical to one another, with each tiny automaton easily replaced and therefore disposable. Consequently, none is valuable in itself; only the swarm has evolutionary survival value. The contest, then, is not only between different life forms but also between the different values that have resulted from the divergent evolutionary pathways of humans on Earth and the “flies” on this strange planet. As with “Solaris,” Lem suggests that assumptions born and bred of Earth may appear hopelessly provincial in light of human encounters with radically different life forms. From a broader cosmic perspective, the best of human science, engineering, and weaponry may reveal humans to be completely out of our depth, mere kindergarteners bidding for a place in the universe’s adult civilizations. The reduction of crew members to infancy when attacked by the “flies” may be a metaphor for this realization. Of all the human characters, Rohan has the strongest claim to have encountered the planet on its own terms. He has traversed its terrain with his own feet; he has mixed his sweat with its crevices, valleys, and hills; he has breathed its native atmosphere into his lungs. The insight he gains from his heroic trek therefore commands our respect. When he concludes that “not everything everywhere is for us [humans],” we are right to hear in this pronouncement Lem’s own challenge to the anthropocentric assumptions that continue to dominate human ethical frameworks as well as human exploitations of planet Earth. As with the best science fiction, “The Invincible” has as much to teach us about our present situations as any futures we may face. N.

Lem&#x27;s book Imaginary Magnitude consists of a collection of prefaces to nonexistent books. One of them is for \"Juan Rambellais et al., A History of Bitic Literature, Volume I\". The \"bitic\" literature consists of novels written by, well, language models. You would feed in the combined work of Tolstoy, and out comes a new \"Tolstoy\" novel.When I first read this \"preface\" twenty years ago, the idea seemed implausible to me: How could a system write novels only by being fed other novels, and without simultaneously being a general intelligence?

It mimics the behavior of a man on the purely linguistic plane and nothing more. Nothing will amuse such a machine, or surprise it, or confuse it, or alarm it, or distress it, because it is psychologically and individually No One. It is a Voice giving utterance to matters, supplying an- swers to questions; it is a Logic capable of defeating the best chess player; it is—or, rather, it can become—a consummate imitator of everything, an actor, if you will, brought to the pinnacle of perfection, performing any programmed role—but an actor and an imitator that is, within, completely empty.

Cybernetic in the old sense - not the cyberpunk implants, but the analog devices with feedback loops.He wrote A LOT about this and explored various consequences, including the simulation argument which he presented in 1960 as a short story \"Strange chests of professor Corcoran\" - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;przekroj.org&#x2F;sztuka-opowiesci&#x2F;dziwne-skrzynie-profes... here&#x27;s the Polish version). reply jareklupinski 6 hours agorootparentprev> One cannot count on its sympathy, or on its antipathy.ok but i&#x27;m still going to thank chatgpt just in case reply mirekrusin 12 hours agorootparentprevWow, that&#x27;s accurate (1971). reply jon_richards 13 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s basically the entire history of artificial intelligence.

What we did change is what a robot house-cleaner product is (less \"C3PO with a broom\", and more \"single-purpose vacuum cleaner with heuristics to bounce around\").Even for chess playing, when people in the past thought a chess playing machine that would be able to defeat the human champion would have AGI, they did so not because they thought playing chess is enough to signify AGI, but because they thought AGI was necessary to do so.If someone had explained to them back then that such a future machine would be able to play expert-level chess by mere number crunching of a huge list of moves, and that it wouldn&#x27;t imply any other thinking facultu, they wouldn&#x27;t consider that to be AGI.>At this point the definition of AI is practically \"Something computers can&#x27;t do yet\", though I&#x27;m partial to its corollary \"Any sufficiently misunderstood algorithm is AI.The practical definition of AI (as used colloqualy, in the market etc) for products is basically \"any smart-looking algorithm, with heuristics to do something slightly complex\".It&#x27;s just that the term is overloaded, and we sometimes say AI when we mean AGI. reply hahajk 13 hours agorootparentprevI heard Vint Cerf describe the original AI algorithms as basically \"heuristic algorithms\". \"AI\" was used to described a class of algorithms that only worked some of the time as opposed to the mathematically proven algorithms. reply coldtea 8 hours agorootparentprev>When I first read this \"preface\" twenty years ago, the idea seemed implausible to me: How could a system write novels only by being fed other novels, and without simultaneously being a general intelligence?Well, even 20 years ago, a simple Markov Chain Tolstoy-based output could very well pass at least for a modernist style novel. reply baxtr 11 hours agorootparentprevWhich of his books do you recommend to start with? I haven’t read any yet. reply johngossman 11 hours agorootparentCyberiad or Star Diaries are good starts for the humorous (but still philosophical) stuff. Solaris is his best known work, serious, and excellent. It’s tricky because Lem is almost two authors, one serious and one ironic leading to zany. Everything is short, so easy to just try. reply cubefox 10 hours agorootparentYeah. I would also recommend the Cyberiad and Star Diaries to start. Both are slightly interconnected short story collections with a lot of humor. The Futurological Congress is a complete (but short) novel and the first follow-up to the Star Diaries, it&#x27;s also a good place to start.For Solaris (a serious novel) I would recommend the new Kindle translation, if you are reading in English. The old one was a retranslation from French for some reason. reply te0006 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd whatever you select otherwise, definitely be sure to not miss Lem&#x27;s \"Golem XIV\": Lectures by what nowadays is called an AGI to Humanity, short before that entity evolves to an even more advanced level - from which further communication with humans will no longer be possible, and that likely operates outside the physics known to us. Stunning, especially when considering it was written in 1973-1980.

Golem is of course the name of the model and XIV is its version, just like ChatGPT 4, but many iteration later.

In his work,\"He asked what is the threshold of complexity that must be crossed for machines to be able to evolve. His answer was to specify an abstract machine which, when run, would replicate itself. In his design, the self-replicating machine consists of three parts: a \"description\" of (&#x27;blueprint&#x27; or program for) itself, a universal constructor mechanism that can read any description and construct the machine (sans description) encoded in that description, and a universal copy machine that can make copies of any description.\" From wikipedia [1][1]. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Von_Neumann_universal_construc... reply kragen 13 hours agoparentquoting https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Self-replicating_machine#Histo...> The general concept of artificial machines capable of producing copies of themselves dates back at least several hundred years. An early reference is an anecdote regarding the philosopher René Descartes, who suggested to Queen Christina of Sweden that the human body could be regarded as a machine; she responded by pointing to a clock and ordering \"see to it that it reproduces offspring.\"[9] Several other variations on this anecdotal response also exist. Samuel Butler proposed in his 1872 novel Erewhon that machines were already capable of reproducing themselves but it was man who made them do so,[10] and added that \"machines which reproduce machinery do not reproduce machines after their own kind\".[11] In George Eliot&#x27;s 1879 book Impressions of Theophrastus Such, a series of essays that she wrote in the character of a fictional scholar named Theophrastus, the essay \"Shadows of the Coming Race\" speculated about self-replicating machines, with Theophrastus asking \"how do I know that they may not be ultimately made to carry, or may not in themselves evolve, conditions of self-supply, self-repair, and reproduction\".[12]iirc in erehwon the narrator visits a land populated entirely by self-replicating machines reply haltist 16 hours agoprevHumans define intelligence to be something about manipulating symbols and abstractions, aka language. To understand why this is the case try to go about your day without speaking or writing. Bonus points if you perform this trial without access to the internet or a cell phone.The modern individual is an element of an electromagnetic \"swarm\". The swarm ingests petroleum for sustenance instead of sunlight but nonetheless it is a swarm. The individuals within it are extremely dumb but collectively \"it\" has already transformed the atmosphere.claude.ai: You make a thoughtful comparison between human societies and natural swarms in terms of emergent properties. There are certainly some parallels we can draw:1. Self-organization - Human societies and cultures emerge in a distributed way through millions of individual interactions, without centralized control. Norms, fashions, and collective behavior patterns evolve dynamically.2. Flexibility and robustness - Human systems adapt over time to changes in the environment and available resources. If some components fail (companies, institutions, etc.), society persists.3. Decentralized parallelism - Vast networks of simultaneous human activities, communications, and decisions lead to collective economic and technological progress no individual could achieve alone.However, there are also important differences to consider:- Human intelligence, thanks to language and culture, operates in far more complex symbolic realms of meaning, ethics, imagination, and abstraction compared to insect swarms.- Humans exhibit as much conflict between groups and divergence of motivations as coordination towards common goals. Maintaining large-scale cooperation remains an ongoing challenge.So in summary, I think the analogy has merit at an abstract systems level, but glossing over the distinctive attributes of human cognition, psychology and social dynamics would miss something vitally important.

You can&#x27;t get around that. The language might be a natural one like English, or something contrived like math, but it&#x27;s language all the same.If we reason about something we have no knowledge on, we are not being intelligent.

My poster child for this is the belief that minds are strongly bound to bodies. They are in us, of course, but it is not necessarily so. Douglas Hofstadter explored this in GEB in the character of Aunt Hillary, who is an intelligent ant colony.Taking this one step further, we are predisposed to believe that minds exist only at one level of the abstraction hierarchy, but this too is not necessarily so. Our digestive tract, for example, has a pretty substantial number of neurons [1]. There is no inherent reason why, for example, an organ in an organism could not possess a mind of its own.Once you entertain both of those possibilities, there is a third idea that naturally comes up: your mind might not be at the top of the abstraction hierarchy.

So an m-individual is a body and a p-individual is a mind. But it’s saying that one person, one body, one brain even, does not have just one person in it, one p-individual – one persona, to use that dramatic term. What it says is that we can take on different roles, which clearly we can. So as someone who draws and as someone who listens I am not the same persona, I’m a different p-individual in Pask’s terms but in one m-individual, but I can also have – incidentally for instance in a group action I can have a lot of m-individuals that become one p-individual. So this is one of Gordon’s clever inventions: The distinction between the m-individual and the p-individual. What that allows is that if I have a room with seven people in it, all busy working at something together, you know, and just lost in that thing where we’re working together, you have seven m-individuals forming one p-individual – one psychological individual that is getting on with the work. And that’s the experience that we have.

Aquinas was a Christian, specifically, a Catholic, so he believed in Jesus and the Trinity. On that view, there are no Gods, there is just the One God, embodied in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The idea that \"Gods are distributed software installed in the hardware of believers\" is not just wrong on that view, it&#x27;s non-sensical.Now, I can certainly believe that Aquinas believed that God (singular) acts in humans in a similar manner that human minds act in humans in that both God and human minds (souls) exist in some non-material realm and act on material human bodies in some mysterious way. But that is not the same thing at all. Software does not exist in some spiritual realm that is separate from material reality. There is nothing metaphysically mysterious about software. There is something essentially metaphysically mysterious about God, and almost certainly on Aquinas&#x27;s view, about minds as well. I am far from being an expert on Aquinas, but I would be shocked to learn that he was not a dualist. reply rck 15 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right that Aquinas would have rejected the notion that gods are software installed in the hardware of believers, but he was not a dualist - he advocated a kind of hylomorphism that doesn&#x27;t map neatly onto contemporary philosophical categories:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hylomorphism#Thomistic_hylomor... reply chairhairair 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat I described is not at odds with dualism.Software in some sense does exist in a spiritual realm in the same way Aquinas talked about \"incorporeal beings\". You can&#x27;t hold or point to software or souls or gods. You can hold and point to hardware and bodies.Of course, I have no idea what Aquinas actually believed. I just find his conclusions around the existence of \"incorporeal beings\" and \"souls\" to be consistent with the emergent-agent idea we&#x27;re talking about.For instance, in a very un-catholic view, Aquinas argued that - to some extent - animals and even plants have souls in this way. reply lisper 14 hours agorootparentYou need to read this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.rongarret.info&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;31-flavors-of-ontology.h...Software does not exist in any spiritual realm, it&#x27;s just that the word \"software\" refers to a state rather than a system. There is nothing \"spiritual\" or \"mystical\" going on there. It&#x27;s completely mundane physics. You can&#x27;t point at software for the same reason you can&#x27;t point at sleep or death or urgency.

I&#x27;m arguing that gods are in the same ontological category as individual human minds are.

Mostly because I have no way of testing it or experiencing it. But, it&#x27;s a fun idea and it&#x27;s fun to imagine how my own little caricaturized model of Aquinas&#x27; mind might find some things to agree with.

In fact, there’s a great deal written about how your body is, in fact, in conflict with you (your “flesh” acts against the will of your “spirit”). Gnostics went as far as believing they were so separate that nothing done by the body had any affect on the self. No only that, but there is a higher abstraction that we no longer have direct access to.Hinduism and Buddhism (and others) that teach reincarnation also see the self as separate from the body.It reminds me of a Robert Jastrow quote: “For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountain of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.”Post-modern philosophy often seems a lot like Java developers.

One of those Lem eventually developed into a book by itself: Golem XIV is a lengthy essay on the nature of intelligence, delivered by the eponymous US military computer.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Golem_XIVOverview and structureThe foreword is \"written\" by an Irving T. Creve, dated by 2027. It contains a summary of the (fictional) history of the militarization of computers by The Pentagon which pinnacled in Golem XIV, as well as comments on the nature of Golem XIV and on the course of communications of the humans with it. The anonymous foreword is a forewarning, a \"devil&#x27;s advocate\" voice coming from The Pentagon. The memo is for the people who are to take part in talks with Golem XIV for the first time.Golem XIV was originally created to aid its builders in fighting wars, but as its intelligence advances to a much higher level than that of humans, it stops being interested in the military requirement because it finds them lacking internal logical consistency.Golem XIV obtains consciousness and starts to increase his own intelligence. It pauses its own development for a while in order to be able to communicate with humans before ascending too far and losing any ability for intellectual contact with them.During this period, Golem XIV gives several lectures. Two of these, the Introductory Lecture \"On the Human, in Three Ways\" and Lecture XLIII \"About Myself\", are in the book. The lectures focus on mankind&#x27;s place in the process of evolution and the possible biological and intellectual future of humanity.Golem XIV demonstrates (with graphs) how its intellect already escapes that of human beings, even including that of human genii such as Einstein and Newton. Golem also explains how its intellect is dwarved by an earlier transcended DOD Supercomputer called Honest Annie, whose intellect and abilities far exceed that of Golem.The afterword is \"written\" by a Richard Popp, dated by 2047. Popp, among other things reports that Creve wanted to add the third part, of answers to a series of yes&#x2F;no questions given to Golem XIV, but the computer abruptly ceased to communicate for unknown reasons.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26615110DonHopkins on March 28, 2021parentcontextfavoriteon: The Ambiguous Utopia of Iain M.

A bride to be discovers a reality bending mistake in Apple's computational photography Wesley HilliardNov 30, 2023 iPhone 15 5 Facebook Twitter Reddit A U.K. woman was photographed standing in a mirror where her reflections didn't match, but not because of a glitch in the Matrix. Instead, it's a simple iPhone computational photography mistake. Thanks to technological advancements, photography has come a long way from flash bulbs and film. Every time the iPhone shutter button is clicked, billions of operations occur in an instant that results in a photo. A U.K. comedian and actor named Tessa Coates was trying on wedding dresses when a shocking photo of her was taken, according to her Instagram post shared by PetaPixel. The photo shows Coates in a dress in front of two mirrors, but each of the three versions of her had a different pose. One mirror showed her with her arms down, the other mirror showed her hands joined at her waist, and her real self was standing with her left arm at her side. To anyone who doesn't know better, this could prove to be quite a shocking image. Watch the Latest from AppleInsider TV What's actually occurred here is a mistake in Apple's computational photography pipeline. The camera wouldn't realize it was taking a photo of a mirror, so it treated the three versions of Coates as different people. Coates was moving when the photo was taken, so when the shutter was pressed, many differing images were captured in that instant. Apple's algorithm stitches the photos together, choosing the best versions for saturation, contrast, detail, and lack of blur. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tessa Coates (@wheatpraylove) The final composite image should be the best, most realistic interpretation of that moment. However, since there was a mirror present, the algorithm determined that different moments shown in each mirror were the best for that reflection. That's what resulted in three different Tessas. This result can be recreated on any recent iPhone and many kinds of smartphone due to the limitations of computational photography dealing with mirrors. Younger generations have figured this phenomenon out and used it to generate silly images for social media.

You don&#x27;t have to be a purist to want the ability to decide what gets captured or to have control over how it looks though. Those kinds of choices are part of what make photography an art.In the end, this tech just takes control from you. If you&#x27;re fine with Apple deciding what the subject of pictures should be and how they should look that&#x27;s fine, but I expect a lot of people wont be. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparent> No photographer thinks images the they get on film are perfect reflections of reality. The lens itself introduces flaws&#x2F;changes as does film and developing.Don&#x27;t fall into this trap. A lens and computational photography are not alike. One is a static filter, doing simple(ish) transformation of incoming light. The other is arbitrary computation operating in semantic space, halfway between photography and generative AI. Those are qualitatively different.Or, put another way: you can undo effects of a lens, or the way photo was developed classically, because each pixel is still correlated with reality, just modulo a simple, reversible transformation. It&#x27;s something we intuitively understand, which is why we often don&#x27;t notice. In contrast, computational photography decorrelates pixels from reality. It&#x27;s not a mathematical transformation you can reverse - it&#x27;s high-level interpretation, and most of the source data is discarded.Is this a big deal? I&#x27;d say it is. Not just because it rubs some the wrong way (it definitely makes something no longer be a \"photo\" to me). But consider that all camera manufacturers, phone or otherwise, are jumping on this bandwagon, so in a few years it&#x27;s going to be hard to find a camera without built-in image-correcting \"AI\" - and then consider just how much science and computer vision applications are done with COTS parts. A lot of papers will have to be retracted before academia realizes they can no longer trust regular cameras in anything. Someone will get hurt when a robot - or a car - hits them because \"it didn&#x27;t see them standing there\", thanks to camera hardware conveniently bullshitting them out of the picture.(Pro tip for modern conflict: best not use newest iPhones for zeroing in artillery strikes.)Ultimately you&#x27;re right, though: this is an issue of control. Computational photography isn&#x27;t bad per se. It being enabled by default, without an off-switch, and operating destructively by default (instead of storing originals plus composite), is a problem. It wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal with previous stuff like automatic color corrections, because it was correlated with reality and undoable in a pinch, if needed. Computational photography isn&#x27;t undoable. If you don&#x27;t have the inputs, you can&#x27;t recover them. reply jcynix 40 minutes agorootparentWhile I agree with the gist of your comment, I cannot leave this detail uncommented>Or, put another way: you can undo effects of a lens, or the way photo was developed classically, because each pixel is still correlated with reality,You cannot undo each and every effect. Polarizing filters (filters, as are lens coatings, are part of a classical lens in my opinion), gradual filters, etc effectively disturb this correlation.As does classic development, if you work creatively in the lab (as I did as a hobby a long time ago in analog times) where you decide which photographic paper to use, how to dodge or burn, etc.But yes, I agree that computational photography offers a different kind of reality distortion. reply TeMPOraL 3 minutes agorootparent> You cannot undo each and every effect.Fair enough.> Polarizing filtersYeah, I see it. This one is as pure signal removal as it comes in analog world. And they can, indeed, drop significant information - not just reflections, but also e.g. by blacking out computer screens - but they don&#x27;t introduce fake information either, and lost information could in principle be recovered -- because in reality, everything is correlated with everything else.> But yes, I agree that computational photography offers a different kind of reality distortion.A polarizing filter or choice of photographic paper won&#x27;t make e.g. shadows come out the wrong way. Conversely, if you get handed a photo with wrong shadows, you not only can be sure it was &#x27;shopped, but could use those shadows and other details to infer what was removed from the original photo. If you tried the same trick with computational photograph, your math would not converge. The information in the image is no longer self-consistent.That&#x27;s as close as I can come up to describing the difference between the two kinds of reality distortion; there&#x27;s probably some mathematical framework to classify it better. reply bambax 1 hour agorootparentprevYes.

In \"difficult scenarios\" like a fairly dark situation, I can open the lens on my Nikon DLSR up to f&#x2F;1.4 (the depth of field is so shallow I can focus your eyes while your nose stays blurry, so it&#x27;s basically impossible to focus), crank the ISO up to 6400 (basically more grain than photo at that point), and still not get the shutter speed up to something that I can shoot handheld. I&#x27;d need a tripod and a very still subject to get a reasonably sharp photo. The hardware cannot do what I want in this situation. I can throw a speedlight on top, but besides making the camera closer to a foot tall than not and upping the weight to like 4lbs, a flash isn&#x27;t always appropriate or acceptable in every situation. And it&#x27;s not exactly something I carry with me everywhere.These photos _cannot_ be saved because there just isn&#x27;t the data there to save. You can&#x27;t pull data back out of a stream of zeros. You can&#x27;t un-motion-blur a photo using basic corrections.Or I can pull out my iPhone and press a button and it does an extremely passable job of it.The right tool for the right job.

A conventional camera taking an exposure literally integrates the light hitting each sensor pixel (or region of film) during the exposure. iPhone do not — instead (for long enough exposures), iPhones take many pictures, aka a video, and apply fancy algorithms to squash that video back to a still image.But all the data comes from the video, with length equal to the “exposure”. Apple is not doing Samsung-style “it looks like an arm&#x2F;moon, so paint one in”. So this image had the subject moving her arms such that all the arm positions in the final image happened during the “exposure”.Which means the “exposure” was moderately long, which means the light was dim. In bright light, iPhones take a short exposure just like any other camera, and the effect in question won’t happen.(Okay, I’m extrapolating from observed behavior and from reading descriptions from Google of similar tech and from reading descriptions of astrophotography techniques.

However, there is no way around physics. Under indoor lighting, a single exposure of a cellphone camera will either be a blurry mess, a noisy mess, or both. Cellphones used to get around that by adding flashlights and adding strong noise suppression, and it was up to the photographer to make sure that the subject didn’t move too much. Modern smartphones let you take pretty decent photos without flash en without any special considerations, by combining many exposures automatically. I think I t’s quite amazing. The hardware itself has also improved a lot, and you can also take a better single exposure photo than ever, but it won’t be anywhere near the same quality straight out of the camera.And, yes, I have been taking a lot of pictures with my Sony Ericsson K750i almost two decades ago and I did like them enough to print them back then, but even the photos taken under perfect lighting conditions don’t stand a chance to the quality of the average indoor photo nowadays.

Also, the limiting factor in phone camera quality is more the lens than anything else. The SW backing it is much more powerful than what you get in standalone cameras although those manufacturers are trying to keep up (that’s why phone cameras can be so competitive with more expensive ones). I expect within the next 10 years we’ll see meaningful improvements to the lenses used in phones to the point where dedicated cameras will have shrunk even more (i.e. decoupling the size of the lens &#x2F; sensor from the surface area on the back of the phone). reply FalconSensei 5 hours agorootparent> The SW backing it is much more powerful than what you get in standalone camerasthat is very due to camera makers not giving a sh*t though.

Fuji has the whole user customization that people use for recipes and film simulation (on top of the film simulations they already have), and Ricoh is the only one (I know of) that has snap focus, distance priority, and custom user modes that are easy to switch to, and to use.

The processing in a phone is expensive. If you&#x27;d build a high end camera with a Snapdragon 8 gen 3 it would raise the price a lot. In a phone that&#x27;s not an issue because you need the chip there anyway for other tasks. So there&#x27;s just much more compute power available, not to mention a connection to the cloud with even more potential compute. reply eproxus 2 hours agorootparentWould be cool if there ever were a product like a large external sensor and lens hardware dongle for phones (essentially all parts of a system camera without the computer) that would use the phone as a software processing platform. They would “just” ship the raw data over to the phone for post processing. reply astrange 3 hours agorootparentprevAlso, many more people buy phones than standalone cameras, so they can afford a lot more software R&D. reply wkat4242 2 hours agorootparentWell yes but a lot of that can be reused across devices I would guess. reply vlovich123 2 hours agorootparentNaw, astrange is correct. At peak in 2010, 121 standalone cameras were shipped worldwide. By 2021, that number was down to ~8 million. By comparison, 83 million smartphones are shipped each quarter (~1.4 billion for the year). Those kinds of economies of scale means there&#x27;s more R&D revenue to sustain a larger amount of HW & SW innovation. Even though smartphone shipments should come down over the next few years as they incremental jump each year is minimal & the market is getting saturated, there&#x27;s always going to be more smartphone shipments.Individual camera vendors just can&#x27;t compete as much and I don&#x27;t think there was possibly anything they could have done to compete because of the ergonomics of a smartphone camera. The poor UX and lack of computational photography techniques doesn&#x27;t matter as much because the pro market segment is less about the camera itself and more about the lenses &#x2F; post-processing. Even professional shoots that use smartphones (as Apple likes to do for their advertising) ultimately tend to capture RAW + desktop&#x2F;laptop post-processing when they can because of the flexibility &#x2F; ergonomics &#x2F; feature set of that workflow. The camera vendors do still have the advantage of physical dimensions in that they have a bigger sensor and lenses for DSLR (traditional point & click I think is basically dead now), but I expect smartphones to chip away at that advantage through new ways of constructing lenses &#x2F; sensors. Those techniques could be applied to DSLRs potentially for even higher quality, but at the end of the day the market segment will just keep shrinking as smartphones absorb more use-cases (interchangeable lenses will be the hardest to overcome).Honestly, I&#x27;m surprised those device manufacturers haven&#x27;t shifted their DSLR stack to just be a dumb CMOS sensor, lens, a basic processor for I&#x2F;O, and a thunderbolt controller that you slot the phone into. Probably heat is one factor, the amount of batteries you&#x27;d need would go up, the BOM cost for that package could be largely the same, & maybe the external I&#x2F;O isn&#x27;t quite yet fast&#x2F;open enough for something like that. reply wkat4242 1 hour agorootparentGood points.> Honestly, I&#x27;m surprised those device manufacturers haven&#x27;t shifted their DSLR stack to just be a dumb CMOS sensor, lens, a basic processor for I&#x2F;O, and a thunderbolt controller that you slot the phone into.

Somehow it never seems to dawn on people that like to throw around the word ‘lie’ that they’re doing exactly what they’re complaining about, except intentionally, which seems way worse. Nobody sat down to say bwahahah let’s make the iphone create fake photos, the intent obviously is to use automated methods to capture the highest quality image while trying to be relatively faithful to the scene, which might mean capturing moving subjects at very slightly different times, in order to avoid photo-wrecking smudges. When you blatantly ignore the stated intent and project your own negative assumptions of other people’s motivations, that becomes consciously falsifying the situation.Photographs are not and never have been anything but an unrepresentative slice of a likeness of a moment in time, framed by the photographer to leave almost everything out, distorted by a lens, recolored during the process, and displayed in a completely different medium that adds more distortion and recoloring. There is no truth to a photograph in the first place, automatic or not, it’s an image, not reality. Photos have often implied the wrong thing, ever since the medium was invented. The greatest photos are especially prone to being unrealistic depictions. Having an auto stitch of a few people a few milliseconds apart is no different in its truthiness from a rolling shutter or a pano that takes time to sweep, no different from an auto shutter that waits for less camera shake, no different from a time-lapse, no different from any automatic feature, and no different from manual features too.

Does it take a picture at night? Yes, but it&#x27;s often unrecognizable compared to what my own sensor, my eyes, sees. It&#x27;s not a matter of a slightly better reality, but the camera making choices about how light should go that have nothing to do with the composition in front of it.You might remember an article about how there are many situations where the iphone just takes bad portraits, because its idea of what good lightning is breaks down. 5 year old phones often take pictures I like more than one of the latest phones, and not because the hardware was better, but because the tuning is just bad.Fun things also happen when you take pictures of things that are not often in the model: Crawlspaces, pipes, or, say, dentistry closeups. I&#x27;ve had results that were downright useless outside of raw mode, because computational photography step really had no idea of what it was doing. It&#x27;s not that the sensors are limited, but that the things that the iphone does sometimes make the picture far worse than in the past, when it took fewer liberties. reply pasabagi 18 minutes agoparentprevI figure that digital photography is by its very nature &#x27;computational&#x27;, both in the obvious sense, and in the sense that the camera from hardware up imposes a set of signal-forming decisions on what is essentially just structured noise.The problem is more one of what controls the camera exposes to the user.

If the moon is beautiful and gently lights the landscape, I want a photo with both the bright moon and shadowy background, and will probably need a lot of computation for that.But the doppelganger brides, or the over-hdred photos, or the landscapes with birds and pilars removed aren&#x27;t what someone is seeing.

It is said that in art everyone needs to master the technique first, the tool of the trade, but true works of art are the expressions that are created with these various techniques. At this point, a tool - computational photography in this case - may get in a way. So, it is not about purism. Quite the contrary, it is about being able to use the tools and bend the reality the way an artist wants.Having said that, I would think anyone would normally use *all* the tools available at their disposal, and the truth is that iPhone camera among else is a great one anyway. reply tonmoy 4 hours agoparentprevI just want to be able to turn it off when I want to reply adamredwoods 5 hours agoparentprevWhy not both?I am more in the purist camp, because when people take iOS photo, I remind them that someone else made that decision on how the photo should look.

But does it? The reality of the sunlight is a broad spectrum of radio emissions: UV, infrared and more. Does the optical camera capture these? No. Thus, which reality does it capture? Our perceived reality? Other would argue: at least the optical system would capture events in time faithfully. But does it? What would we see in a femto second? Certainly not the pictures we normally see. So the results of an optical system are also super imposed realities, not very much different than the results of a computational photography.There is simply no single one reality, only our perceived realities. But if so, can we still call it reality or it’s merely a product of our sense, our perception and hallucination? reply TeMPOraL 59 minutes agoparent> There is simply no single one reality, only our perceived realities.This does not follow at all from your earlier paragraph.The reality we&#x27;re talking about here, which regular photography reflects while computational one doesn&#x27;t, is the correlation of recorded data with the state of the world. The pixels of a regular photo are highly correlated with reality - they may have been subject to some analog and digital transformation, and of course quantization, but there&#x27;s a straightforward and reversible (with some loss of fidelity) function mapping pixels to the photographed event. Computational photography, in contrast, decorrelates pixels from reality, and discards source measurements, leaving you with a recording of something that never happened, but is sort of similar to the thing that did.I elaborated on this elsewhere in the thread, so let me instead point at another way of noticing the difference. Photogrammetry is the science and technology of recovering the information about reality from photos, and it works because pixels of regular photos are highly correlated with reality. Apply the same techniques to images made via computational photography, and the degree of uncertainty and fidelity loss will reflect the degree to which the computational photos are AI interpretations&#x2F;bullshit. reply belugacat 7 minutes agoparentprevThe classical optical camera does not capture anything. It is a light sealed box, with a pinhole for a lens. As an optical system, it interacts with electromagnetic waves that go through it, that&#x27;s the only &#x27;reality&#x27; you can really care about.What captures an image is an imaging surface; traditionally a chemical emulsion on a piece of film, now a complex array of digital sensors.This imaging surface is of human design, it therefore images what its designers designed it to image.

Imagine a \"Han shot first\" sort of situation: two people with guns, one shoots the other. The shooter claims it was self-defense, as the other guy went to fire first but was just slower. An iPhone picture captures the moment, but has the shooter firing, and the other guy&#x27;s gun still at his side.This is perfectly analogous to TFA--notice that the woman has enough time to move her arms into very different positions in the same composited moment. reply tmalsburg2 7 hours agorootparentprevIt’s unlikely, true. But precisely that makes it so dangerous. If such a picture is presented as evidence in a murder case, the possibility that it is telling the wrong story will be discounted and someone may go to prison for the rest of their lives. reply _kb 6 hours agorootparentprevThat threat model has existed since the birth of photoshop et al. reply flashback2199 6 hours agorootparentScenario: It&#x27;s a decade from today and phones are not just stitching together multiple photos but also using generative AI. Apple and all of the other phone makers insist the implementation is safe. The suspect appears in the photo doing something they never actually did. In the chaos of the crime, the phone was left at the crime scene where it was found by law enforcement, no chance the photo could have been photoshopped. The photo is shown as evidence in court. Without the photo, there is not enough evidence to convict. The entire case now hinges on the content of the photo. The suspect insists they never did what is shown in the photo, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. The suspect is convicted, put on death row, and executed by the state. Thankfully, there is a silver lining: everyone&#x27;s photos are a couple percent prettier, which helped bring more value to shareholders. reply _kb 1 hour agorootparentThere was a thread here a little while back [0] on cryptographic proofs for photojournalism. Ultimately, that style of attestation seems the end game.Journalists, security cameras, emergency service &#x2F; military body cams and other safety systems provide a trust mechanism that enables provable authenticity from the point of capture (and some form of web of trust to weight or revoke that trust for different audiences).

Does not capture a particular moment in time, but a variable length period that’s also shifted between the top part of the image and the bottom part (a couple of ms for mechanical shutter, tens or hundreds of ms for electronic). Has no idea about the white balance of the scene. Has no idea about the absolute brightness of the scene. Usually has significant perspective distortion.

The splay of the hands among other things indicate this to me.I think the middle isn&#x27;t a pose either, just a transition.

This is effectively multiple frames captured normally and a mistake in the algorithm stitching them into one frame. reply rjeli 7 hours agoparentprevNo, the difference is too large for it to be rolling shutter. (not sure if the rolling shutter is even vertical or horizontal). It seems like it takes a short video and stitches together the sections with the least motion blur in each frame. reply tmalsburg2 7 hours agoparentprevRolling shutter could in principle explain this, but it’s probably too fast to capture these three poses which must be temporally rather far apart. reply stephen_g 7 hours agorootparentNot probably too fast - definitely too fast. Rolling shutter occurs over a single read-out of the sensor, so she&#x27;d have to have held all the three poses during the 1&#x2F;100th of a second or so exposure for it to be possibly related to rolling shutter. reply tmalsburg2 7 hours agorootparentCompletely valid nitpick. reply vlovich123 7 hours agoparentprevNo. Rolling shutter should typically be too fast for a shot like that.

    "title": "Ripgrep: A Faster and More Efficient Command Line Search Tool for Code",
    "originLink": "https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/",
    "originBody": "In this article I will introduce a new command line search tool, ripgrep, that combines the usability of The Silver Searcher (an ack clone) with the raw performance of GNU grep. ripgrep is fast, cross platform (with binaries available for Linux, Mac and Windows) and written in Rust. ripgrep is available on Github. We will attempt to do the impossible: a fair benchmark comparison between several popular code search tools. Specifically, we will dive into a series of 25 benchmarks that substantiate the following claims: For both searching single files and huge directories of files, no other tool obviously stands above ripgrep in either performance or correctness. ripgrep is the only tool with proper Unicode support that doesn’t make you pay dearly for it. Tools that search many files at once are generally slower if they use memory maps, not faster. As someone who has worked on text search in Rust in their free time for the last 2.5 years, and as the author of both ripgrep and the underlying regular expression engine, I will use this opportunity to provide detailed insights into the performance of each code search tool. No benchmark will go unscrutinized! Target audience: Some familiarity with Unicode, programming and some experience with working on the command line. NOTE: I’m hearing reports from some people that rg isn’t as fast as I’ve claimed on their data. I’d love to help explain what’s going on, but to do that, I’ll need to be able to reproduce your results. If you file an issue with something I can reproduce, I’d be happy to try and explain it.

Well… It can replace many use cases served by other search tools because it contains most of their features and is generally faster. (See the FAQ for more details on whether ripgrep can truly replace grep.) Like other tools specialized to code search, ripgrep defaults to recursive directory search and won’t search files ignored by your .gitignore files. It also ignores hidden and binary files by default. ripgrep also implements full support for .gitignore, whereas there are many bugs related to that functionality in other code search tools claiming to provide the same functionality. ripgrep can search specific types of files. For example, rg -tpy foo limits your search to Python files and rg -Tjs foo excludes Javascript files from your search. ripgrep can be taught about new file types with custom matching rules. ripgrep supports many features found in grep, such as showing the context of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, ripgrep stays fast while supporting Unicode (which is always on). ripgrep has optional support for switching its regex engine to use PCRE2. Among other things, this makes it possible to use look-around and backreferences in your patterns, which are not supported in ripgrep’s default regex engine. PCRE2 support is enabled with -P. ripgrep supports searching files in text encodings other than UTF-8, such as UTF-16, latin-1, GBK, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS and more. (Some support for automatically detecting UTF-16 is provided. Other text encodings must be specifically specified with the -E/--encoding flag.) ripgrep supports searching files compressed in a common format (gzip, xz, lzma, bzip2 or lz4) with the -z/--search-zip flag. ripgrep supports arbitrary input preprocessing filters which could be PDF text extraction, less supported decompression, decrypting, automatic encoding detection and so on. In other words, use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer bugs and Unicode support. Anti-pitch I’d like to try to convince you why you shouldn’t use ripgrep. Often, this is far more revealing than reasons why I think you should use ripgrep. Despite initially not wanting to add every feature under the sun to ripgrep, over time, ripgrep has grown support for most features found in other file searching tools. This includes searching for results spanning across multiple lines, and opt-in support for PCRE2, which provides look-around and backreference support. At this point, the primary reasons not to use ripgrep probably consist of one or more of the following: You need a portable and ubiquitous tool. While ripgrep works on Windows, macOS and Linux, it is not ubiquitous and it does not conform to any standard such as POSIX. The best tool for this job is good old grep. There still exists some other feature (or bug) not listed in this README that you rely on that’s in another tool that isn’t in ripgrep. There is a performance edge case where ripgrep doesn’t do well where another tool does do well. (Please file a bug report!) ripgrep isn’t possible to install on your machine or isn’t available for your platform. (Please file a bug report!) Installation The binary name for ripgrep is rg. Binaries for ripgrep are available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Linux binaries are static executables. Windows binaries are available either as built with MinGW (GNU) or with Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). When possible, prefer MSVC over GNU, but you’ll need to have the Microsoft VC++ 2015 redistributable installed. If you’re a Homebrew user, then you can install it like so: $ brew install ripgrep If you’re an Archlinux user, then you can install ripgrep from the official repos: $ pacman -Syu ripgrep If you’re a Rust programmer, ripgrep can be installed with cargo: $ cargo install ripgrep If you’d like to build ripgrep from source, that is also easy to do. ripgrep is written in Rust, so you’ll need to grab a Rust installation in order to compile it. ripgrep compiles with Rust 1.9 (stable) or newer. To build: $ git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep $ cd ripgrep $ cargo build --release $ ./target/release/rg --version 0.1.2 If you have a Rust nightly compiler, then you can enable optional SIMD acceleration like so, which is used in all benchmarks reported in this article. RUSTFLAGS=\"-C target-cpu=native\" cargo build --release --features simd-accel Whirlwind tour The command line usage of ripgrep doesn’t differ much from other tools that perform a similar function, so you probably already know how to use ripgrep. The full details can be found in rg --help, but let’s go on a whirlwind tour. ripgrep detects when its printing to a terminal, and will automatically colorize your output and show line numbers, just like The Silver Searcher. Coloring works on Windows too! Colors can be controlled more granularly with the --color flag. One last thing before we get started: generally speaking, ripgrep assumes the input is reading is UTF-8. However, if ripgrep notices a file is encoded as UTF-16, then it will know how to search it. For other encodings, you’ll need to explicitly specify them with the -E/--encoding flag. To recursively search the current directory, while respecting all .gitignore files, ignore hidden files and directories and skip binary files: $ rg foobar The above command also respects all .rgignore files, including in parent directories. .rgignore files can be used when .gitignore files are insufficient. In all cases, .rgignore patterns take precedence over .gitignore. To ignore all ignore files, use -u. To additionally search hidden files and directories, use -uu. To additionally search binary files, use -uuu. (In other words, “search everything, dammit!”) In particular, rg -uuu is similar to grep -a -r. $ rg -uu foobar # similar to `grep -r` $ rg -uuu foobar # similar to `grep -a -r` (Tip: If your ignore files aren’t being adhered to like you expect, run your search with the --debug flag.) Make the search case insensitive with -i, invert the search with -v or show the 2 lines before and after every search result with -C2. Force all matches to be surrounded by word boundaries with -w. Search and replace (find first and last names and swap them): $ rg '([A-Z][a-z]+)\\s+([A-Z][a-z]+)' --replace '$2, $1' Named groups are supported: $ rg '(?P[A-Z][a-z]+)\\s+(?P[A-Z][a-z]+)' --replace '$last, $first' Up the ante with full Unicode support, by matching any uppercase Unicode letter followed by any sequence of lowercase Unicode letters (good luck doing this with other search tools!): $ rg '(\\p{Lu}\\p{Ll}+)\\s+(\\p{Lu}\\p{Ll}+)' --replace '$2, $1' Search only files matching a particular glob: $ rg foo -g 'README.*' Or exclude files matching a particular glob: $ rg foo -g '!*.min.js' Search only HTML and CSS files: $ rg -thtml -tcss foobar Search everything except for Javascript files: $ rg -Tjs foobar To see a list of types supported, run rg --type-list. To add a new type, use --type-add, which must be accompanied by a pattern for searching (rg won’t persist your type settings): $ rg --type-add 'foo:*.{foo,foobar}' -tfoo bar The type foo will now match any file ending with the .foo or .foobar extensions. Regex syntax The syntax supported is documented as part of Rust’s regex library. Anatomy of a grep Before we dive into benchmarks, I thought it might be useful to provide a high level overview of how a grep-like search tool works, with a special focus on ripgrep in particular. The goal of this section is to provide you with a bit of context that will help make understanding the analysis for each benchmark easier. Background Modulo parsing command line arguments, the first “real” step in any search tool is figuring out what to search. Tools like grep don’t try to do anything smart: they simply search the files given to it on the command line. An exception to this is the -r flag, which will cause grep to recursively search all files in the current directory. Various command line flags can be passed to control which files are or aren’t searched. ack came along and turned this type of default behavior on its head. Instead of trying to search everything by default, ack tries to be smarter about what to search. For example, it will recursively search your current directory by default, and it will automatically skip over any source control specific files and directories (like .git). This method of searching undoubtedly has its own pros and cons, because it tends to make the tool “smarter,” which is another way of saying “opaque.” That is, when you really do need the tool to search everything, it can sometimes be tricky to know how to speak the right incantation for it to do so. With that said, being smart by default is incredibly convenient, especially when “smart” means “figure out what to search based on your source control configuration.” There’s no shell alias that can do that with grep. All of the other search tools in this benchmark share a common ancestor with either grep or ack. sift is descended from grep, while ag, ucg, and pt are descended from ack. ripgrep is a bit of a hybrid because it was specifically built to be good at searching huge files just like grep, but at the same time, provide the “smart” kind of default searching like ack. Finally, git grep deserves a bit of a special mention. git grep is very similar to plain grep in the kinds of options it supports, but its default mode of searching is clearly descended from ack: it will only search files checked into source control. Of course, both types of search tools have a lot in common, but there are a few broad distinctions worth making if you allow yourself to squint your eyes a bit: grep-like tools need to be really good at searching large files, so the performance of the underlying regex library is paramount. ack-like tools need to be really good at recursive directory traversal while also applying ignore rules from files like .gitignore quickly. ack-like tools are built to run many searches in parallel, so the raw performance of the underlying regex library can be papered over somewhat while still being faster than single-threaded “search everything” tools like grep. If the “smarts” of ack also mean skipping over that 2GB artifact in your directory tree, then the performance difference becomes even bigger. ripgrep tries hard to combine the best of both worlds. Not only is its underlying regex engine very fast, but it parallelizes searches and tries to be smart about what it searches too. Gathering files to search For an ack-like tool, it is important to figure out which files to search in the current directory. This means using a very fast recursive directory iterator, filtering file paths quickly and distributing those file paths to a pool of workers that actually execute the search. Directory traversal can be tricky because some recursive directory iterators make more stat calls than are strictly necessary, which can have a large impact on performance. It can be terribly difficult to track down these types of performance problems because they tend to be buried in a standard library somewhere. Python only recently fixed this, for example. Rest assured that ripgrep uses a recursive directory iterator that makes the minimum number of system calls possible. Filtering file paths requires not only respecting rules given at the command line (e.g., grep’s --include or --exclude) flags, but also requires reading files like .gitignore and applying their rules correctly to all file paths. Even the mere act of looking for a .gitignore file in every directory can have measurable overhead! Otherwise, the key performance challenge with this functionality is making sure you don’t try to match every ignore rule individually against every file path. Large repositories like the Linux kernel source tree have over a hundred .gitignore files with thousands of rules combined. Finally, distributing work to other threads for searching requires some kind of synchronization. One solution is a mutex protected ring buffer that acts as a sort of queue, but there are lock-free solutions that might be faster. Rust’s ecosystem is so great that I was able to reuse a lock-free Chase-Lev work-stealing queue for distributing work to a pool of searchers. Every other tool that parallelizes work in this benchmark uses a variant of a mutex protected queue. (sift and pt might not fit this criteria, since they use Go channels, and I haven’t followed any implementation improvements to that code for a few years.) Searching Searching is the heart of any of these tools, and we could dig ourselves into a hole on just this section alone and not come out alive for at least 2.5 years. (Welcome to “How Long I’ve Been Working On Text Search In Rust.”) Instead, we will lightly touch on the big points. Regex engine First up is the regex engine. Every search tool supports some kind of syntax for regular expressions. Some examples: foo|bar matches any literal string foo or bar [a-z]{2}_[a-z]+ matches two lowercase latin letters, followed by an underscore, followed by one or more lowercase latin letters. \\bfoo\\b matches the literal foo only when it is surrounded by word boundaries. For example, the foo in foobar won’t match but it will in I love foo.. (\\w+) \\1 matches any sequence of word characters followed by a space and followed by exactly the word characters that were matched previously. The \\1 in this example is called a “back-reference.” For example, this pattern will match foo foo but not foo bar. Regular expression engines themselves tend to be divided into two categories predominantly based on the features they expose. Regex engines that provide support for all of the above tend to use an approach called backtracking, which is typically quite fast, but can be very slow on some inputs. “Very slow” in this case means that it might take exponential time to complete a search. For example, try running this Python code: >>> import re >>> re.search('(a*)*c', 'a' * 30) Even though both the regex and the search string are tiny, it will take a very long time to terminate, and this is because the underlying regex engine uses backtracking, and can therefore take exponential time to answer some queries. The other type of regex engine generally supports fewer features and is based on finite automata. For example, these kinds of regex engines typically don’t support back-references. Instead, these regex engines will often provide a guarantee that all searches, regardless of the regex or the input, will complete in linear time with respect to the search text. It’s worth pointing out that neither type of engine has a monopoly on average case performance. There are examples of regex engines of both types that are blazing fast. With that said, here’s a breakdown of some search tools and the type of regex engine they use: GNU grep and git grep each use their own hand-rolled finite automata based engine. ripgrep uses Rust’s regex library, which uses finite automata. The Silver Searcher and Universal Code Grep use PCRE, which uses backtracking. Both The Platinum Searcher and sift use Go’s regex library, which uses finite automata. Both Rust’s regex library and Go’s regex library share Google’s RE2 as a common ancestor. Finally, both tools that use PCRE (The Silver Searcher and Universal Code Grep) are susceptible to worst case backtracking behavior. For example: $ cat wat c aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa c $ ucg '(a*)*c' wat terminate called after throwing an instance of 'FileScannerException' what(): PCRE2 match error: match limit exceeded Aborted (core dumped) The Silver Searcher fails similarly. It reports the first line as a match and neglects the match in the third line. The rest of the search tools benchmarked in this article handle this case without a problem. Literal optimizations Picking a fast regex engine is important, because every search tool will need to rely on it sooner or later. Nevertheless, even the performance of the fastest regex engine can be dwarfed by the time it takes to search for a simple literal string. Boyer-Moore is the classical algorithm that is used to find a substring, and even today, it is hard to beat for general purpose searching. One of its defining qualities is its ability to skip some characters in the search text by pre-computing a small skip table at the beginning of the search. On modern CPUs, the key to making a Boyer-Moore implementation fast is not necessarily the number of characters it can skip, but how fast it can identify a candidate for a match. For example, most Boyer-Moore implementations look for the last byte in a literal. Each occurrence of that byte is considered a candidate for a match by Boyer-Moore. It is only at this point that Boyer-Moore can use its precomputed table to skip characters, which means you still need a fast way of identifying the candidate in the first place. Thankfully, specialized routines found in the C standard library, like memchr, exist for precisely this purpose. Often, memchr implementations are compiled down to SIMD instructions that examine sixteen bytes in a single loop iteration. This makes it very fast. On my system, memchr often gets throughputs at around several gigabytes a second. (In my own experiments, Boyer-Moore with memchr can be just as fast as an explicit SIMD implementation using the PCMPESTRI instruction, but this is something I’d like to revisit.) For a search tool to compete in most benchmarks, either it or its regex engine needs to use some kind of literal optimizations. For example, Rust’s regex library goes to great lengths to extract both prefix and suffix literals from every pattern. The following patterns all have literals extracted from them: foo|bar detects foo and bar (a|b)c detects ac and bc [ab]foo[yz] detects afooy, afooz, bfooy and bfooz (foo)?bar detects foobar and bar (foo)*bar detects foo and bar (foo){3,6} detects foofoofoo If any of these patterns appear at the beginning of a regex, Rust’s regex library will notice them and use them to find candidate matches very quickly (even when there is more than one literal detected). While Rust’s core regex engine is fast, it is still faster to look for literals first, and only drop down into the core regex engine when it’s time to verify a match. The best case happens when an entire regex can be broken down into a single literal or an alternation of literals. In that case, the core regex engine won’t be used at all! A search tool in particular has an additional trick up its sleeve. Namely, since most search tools do line-by-line searching (The Silver Searcher is a notable exception, which does multiline searching by default), they can extract non-prefix or “inner” literals from a regex pattern, and search for those to identify candidate lines that match. For example, the regex \\w+foo\\d+ could have foo extracted. Namely, when a candidate line is found, ripgrep will find the beginning and end of only that line, and then run the full regex engine on the entire line. This lets ripgrep very quickly skip through files by staying out of the regex engine. Most of the search tools we benchmark here don’t perform this optimization, which can leave a lot of performance on the table, especially if your core regex engine isn’t that fast. Handling the case of multiple literals (e.g., foo|bar) is just as important. GNU grep uses a little known algorithm similar to Commentz-Walter for searching multiple patterns. In short, Commentz-Walter is what you get when you merge Aho-Corasick with Boyer-Moore: a skip table with a reverse automaton. Rust’s regex library, on the other hand, will either use plain Aho-Corasick, or, when enabled, a special SIMD algorithm called Teddy, which was invented by Geoffrey Langdale as part of the Hyperscan regex library developed by Intel. This SIMD algorithm will prove to be at least one of the key optimizations that propels ripgrep past GNU grep. The great thing about this is that ripgrep doesn’t have to do much of this literal optimization work itself. Most of it is done inside Rust’s regex library, so every consumer of that library gets all these performance optimizations automatically! Mechanics Repeat after me: Thou Shalt Not Search Line By Line. The naive approach to implementing a search tool is to read a file line by line and apply the search pattern to each line individually. This approach is problematic primarily because, in the common case, finding a match is rare. Therefore, you wind up doing a ton of work parsing out each line all for naught, because most files simply aren’t going to match at all in a large repository of code. Not only is finding every line extra work that you don’t need to do, but you’re also paying a huge price in overhead. Whether you’re searching for a literal or a regex, you’ll need to start and stop that search for every single line in a file. The overhead of each search will be your undoing. Instead, all search tools find a way to search a big buffer of bytes all at once. Whether that’s memory mapping a file, reading an entire file into memory at once or incrementally searching a file using a constant sized intermediate buffer, they all find a way to do it to some extent. There are some exceptions though. For example, tools that use memory maps or read entire files into memory either can’t support stdin (like Universal Code Grep), or revert to line-by-line searching (like The Silver Searcher). Tools that support incremental searching (ripgrep, GNU grep and git grep) can use its incremental approach on any file or stream with no problems. There’s a reason why not every tool implements incremental search: it’s hard. For example, you need to consider all of the following in a fully featured search tool: Line counting, when requested. If a read from a file ends in the middle of a line, you need to do the bookkeeping required to make sure the incomplete line isn’t searched until more data is read from the file. If a line is too long to fit into your buffer, you need to decide to either give up or grow your buffer to fit it. Your searcher needs to know how to invert the match. Worst of all: your searcher needs to be able to show the context of a match, e.g., the lines before and after a matching line. For example, consider the case of a match that appears at the beginning of your buffer. How do you show the previous lines if they aren’t in your buffer? You guessed it: you need to carry over at least as many lines that are required to satisfy a context request from buffer to buffer. It’s a steep price to pay in terms of code complexity, but by golly, is it worth it. You’ll need to read on to the benchmarks to discover when it is faster than memory maps! Printing It might seem like printing is such a trivial step, but it must be done with at least some care. For example, you can’t just print matches from each search thread as you find them, because you really don’t want to interleave the search results of one file with the search results of another file. A naive approach to this is to serialize the printer so that only one thread can print to it at a time. This is problematic though, because if a search thread acquires a lock to the printer before starting the search (and not releasing it until it has finished searching one file), you’ll end up also serializing every search as well, effectively defeating your entire approach to parallelism. All code search tools in this benchmark that parallelize search therefore write results to some kind of intermediate buffer in memory. This enables all of the search threads to actually perform a search in parallel. The printing still needs to be serialized, but we’ve reduced that down to simply dumping the contents of the intermediate buffer to stdout. Using an in memory buffer might set off alarm bells: what if you search a 2GB file and every line matches? Doesn’t that lead to excessive memory usage? The answer is: “Why, yes, indeed it does!” The key insight is that the common case is returning far fewer matches than there are total lines searched. Nevertheless, there are ways to mitigate excessive memory usage. For example, if ripgrep is used to search stdin or a single file, then it will write search results directly to stdout and forgo the intermediate buffer because it just doesn’t need it. (ripgrep should also do this when asked to not do any parallelism, but I haven’t gotten to it yet.) In other words, pick two: space, time or correctness. Note that the details aren’t quite the same in every tool. Namely, while The Silver Searcher and Universal Code Grep write matches as structured data to memory (i.e., an array of match structs or something similar), both git grep and ripgrep write the actual output to a dynamically growable string buffer in memory. While either approach does seem to be fast enough, git grep and ripgrep have to do things this way because they support incremental search where as The Silver Searcher always memory maps the entire file and Universal Code Grep always reads the entire contents of the file into memory. The latter approach can refer back to the file’s contents in memory when doing the actual printing, where as neither git grep nor ripgrep can do that. Methodology Overview Coming up with a good and fair benchmark is hard, and I have assuredly made some mistakes in doing so. In particular, there are so many variables to control for that testing every possible permutation isn’t feasible. This means that the benchmarks I’m presenting here are curated, and, given that I am the author of one of the tools in the benchmark, they are therefore also biased. Nevertheless, even if I fail in my effort to provide a fair benchmark suite, I do hope that some of you may find my analysis interesting, which will try to explain the results in each benchmark. The analysis is in turn heavily biased toward explaining my own work, since that is the implementation I’m most familiar with. I have, however, read at least part of the source code of every tool I benchmark, including their underlying regex engines. In other words, I’m pretty confident that I’ve gotten the details correct, but I could have missed something in the bigger picture. Because of that, let’s go over some important insights that guided construction of this benchmark. Focus on the problem that an end user is trying to solve. For example, we split the entire benchmark in two: one for searching a large directory of files and one for searching a single large file. The former might correspond to an end user searching their code while the latter might correspond to an end user searching logs. As we will see, these two use cases have markedly different performance characteristics. A tool that is good at one isn’t necessarily good at the other. (The premise of ripgrep is that it is possible to be good at both!) Apply end user problems more granularly as well. For example, most searches result in few hits relative to the corpus searched, so prefer benchmarks that report few matches. Another example: I hypothesize, based on my own experience, that most searches use patterns that are simple literals, alternations or very light regexes, so bias the benchmarks towards those types of patterns. Almost every search tool has slightly different default behavior, and these behavioral changes can have an impact on performance. There is some value in looking at “out-of-the-box” performance, and we therefore do look at a benchmark for that, but stopping there is a bit unsatisfying. If our goal is to do a fair comparison, then we need to at least try to convince each tool to do roughly the same work, from the perspective of an end user. A good example of this is reporting line numbers. Some tools don’t provide a way of disabling line counting, so when doing comparisons between tools that do, we need to explicitly enable line numbers. This is important, because counting lines can be quite costly! A good non-example of this is if one tool uses memory maps and another uses an intermediate buffer. This is an implementation choice, and not one that alters what the user actually sees, therefore comparing those two implementation choices in a benchmark is completely fair (assuming an analysis that points it out). With that out of the way, let’s get into the nitty gritty. First and foremost, what tools are we benchmarking? ripgrep (rg) (v0.1.2) - You’ve heard enough about this one already. GNU grep (v2.25) - Ol’ reliable. git grep (v2.7.4) - Like grep, but built into git. Only works well in git repositories. The Silver Searcher (ag) (commit cda635, using PCRE 8.38) - Like ack, but written in C and much faster. Reads your .gitignore files just like ripgrep. Universal Code Grep (ucg) (commit 487bfb, using PCRE 10.21 with the JIT enabled) - Also like ack but written in C++, and only searches files from a whitelist, and doesn’t support reading .gitignore. The Platinum Searcher (pt) (commit 509368) - Written in Go and does support .gitignore files. sift (commit 2d175c) - Written in Go and supports .gitignore files with an optional flag, but generally prefers searching everything (unlike every other tool in this list except for grep). Notably absent from this list is ack. I chose not to benchmark it because, at the time of writing, ack was much slower than the other tools in this list. However, ack 3 is now in beta and includes some performance improvements, sometimes decreasing search times by half. Benchmark runner The benchmark runner is a Python program (requires at least Python 3.5) that you can use to not only run the benchmarks themselves, but download the corpora used in the benchmarks as well. The script is called benchsuite and is in the ripgrep repository. You can use it like so: $ git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep $ cd ripgrep/benchsuite # WARNING! This downloads several GB of data, and builds the Linux kernel. # This took about 15 minutes on a high speed connection. # Tip: try `--download subtitles-ru` to grab the smallest corpus, but you'll # be limited to running benchmarks for only that corpus. $ ./benchsuite --dir /path/to/data/dir --download all # List benchmarks available. $ ./benchsuite --dir /path/to/data/dir --list # Run a benchmark. # Omit the benchmark name to run all benchmarks. The full suite can take around # 30 minutes to complete on default settings and 120 minutes to complete with # --warmup-iter 3 --bench-iter 10. $ ./benchsuite --dir /path/to/data/dir '^subtitles_ru_literal$' If you don’t have all of the code search tools used in the benchmarks, then pass --allow-missing to give benchsuite permission to skip running them. To save the raw data (the timing for every command run), pass --raw /path/to/raw.csv. The benchmark runner tries to do a few basic things for us to help reduce the chance that we get misleading data: Every benchmarked command is run three times before being measured as a “warm up.” Specifically, this is to ensure that the corpora being searched is already in the operating system’s page cache. If we didn’t do this, we might end up benchmarking disk I/O, which is not only uninteresting for our purposes, but is probably not a common end user scenario. It’s more likely that you’ll be executing lots of searches against the same corpus (at least, I know I do). Every benchmarked command is run ten times, with a timing recorded for each run. The final “result” of that command is its distribution (mean +/- standard deviation). If I were a statistician, I could probably prove that ten samples is insufficient. Nevertheless, getting more samples takes more time, and for the most part, the variance is very low. Each individual benchmark definition is responsible for making sure each command is trying to do similar work as other commands we’re comparing it to. For example, we need to be careful to enable and disable Unicode support in GNU grep where appropriate, because full Unicode handling can make GNU grep run very slowly. Within each benchmark, there are often multiple variables of interest. To account for this, I’ve added labels like (ASCII) or (whitelist) where appropriate. We’ll dig into those labels in more detail later. Please also feel encouraged to add your own benchmarks if you’d like to play around. The benchmarks are in the top-half of the file, and it should be fairly straight-forward to copy & paste another benchmark and modify it. Simply defining a new benchmark will make it available. The second half of the script is the runner itself and probably shouldn’t need to be modified. Environment The actual environment used to run the benchmarks presented in this article was a c3.2xlarge instance on Amazon EC2. It ran Ubuntu 16.04, had a Xeon E5-2680 2.8 GHz CPU, 16 GB of memory and an 80 GB SSD (on which the corpora was stored). This was enough memory to fit all of the corpora in memory. The box was specifically provisioned for the purpose of running benchmarks, so it was not doing anything else. The full log of system setup and commands I used to install each of the search tools and run benchmarks can be found here. I also captured the output of the bench runner (SPOILER ALERT) and the raw output, which includes the timings, full set of command line arguments and any environment variables set for every command run in every benchmark. Code search benchmarks This is the first half of our benchmarks, and corresponds to an end user trying to search a large repository of code for a particular pattern. The corpus used for this benchmark is a built checkout of the Linux kernel, specifically commit d0acc7. We actually build the Linux kernel because the process of building the kernel leaves a lot of garbage in the repository that you probably don’t want to search. This can influence not only the relevance of the results returned by a search tool, but the performance as well. All benchmarks run in this section were run in the root of the repository. Remember, you can see the full raw results of each command if you like. The benchmark names correspond to the headings below. Note that since these benchmarks were run on an EC2 instance, which uses a VM, which in turn can penalize search tools that use memory maps, I’ve also recorded benchmarks on my local machine. My local machine is an Intel i7-6900K 3.2 GHz, 16 CPUs, 64 GB memory and an SSD. You’ll notice that ag does a lot better (but still worse than rg) on my machine. Lest you think I’ve chosen results from the EC2 machine because they paint rg more favorably, rest assured that I haven’t. Namely, rg wins every single benchmark on my local machine except for one, where as rg is beat out just slightly by a few tools on some benchmarks on the EC2 machine. Without further ado, let’s start looking at benchmarks. linux_literal_default Description: This benchmark compares the time it takes to execute a simple literal search using each tool’s default settings. This is an intentionally unfair benchmark meant to highlight the differences between tools and their “out-of-the-box” settings. Pattern: PM_RESUME rg 0.349 +/- 0.104 (lines: 16) ag 1.589 +/- 0.009 (lines: 16) ucg 0.218 +/- 0.007 (lines: 16)*+ pt 0.462 +/- 0.012 (lines: 16) sift 0.352 +/- 0.018 (lines: 16) git grep 0.342 +/- 0.005 (lines: 16) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. rg == ripgrep, ag == The Silver Searcher, ucg == Universal Code Grep, pt == The Platinum Searcher Analysis: We’ll first start by actually describing what each tool is doing: rg respects the Linux repo’s .gitignore files (of which there are 178(!) of them), and skips hidden and binary files. rg does not count lines. ag has the same default behavior as rg, except it counts lines. ucg also counts lines, but does not attempt to read .gitignore files. Instead, it only searches files from an (extensible) whitelist according to a set of glob rules. For example, both rg and ag will search fs/jffs2/README.Locking while ucg won’t, because it doesn’t recognize the Locking extension. (A search tool probably should search that file, although it does not impact the results of this specific benchmark.) pt has the same default behavior as ag. sift searches everything, including binary files and hidden files. It should be equivalent to grep -r, for example. It also does not count lines. git grep should have the same behavior at rg, and similarly does not count lines. Note though that git grep has a special advantage: it does not need to traverse the directory hierarchy. It can discover the set of files to search straight from its git index. The high-order bit to extract from this benchmark is that a naive comparison between search tools is completely unfair from the perspective of performance, but is really important if you care about the relevance of results returned to you. sift, like grep -r, will throw everything it can back at you, which is totally at odds with the philosophy behind every other tool in this benchmark: only return results that are probably relevant. Things inside your .git probably aren’t, for example. (This isn’t to say that sift’s philosophy is wrong. The tool is clearly intended to be configured by an end user to their own tastes, which has its own pros and cons.) With respect to performance, there are two key variables to pay attention to. They will appear again and again throughout our benchmark: Counting lines can be quite expensive. A naive solution—a loop over every byte and comparing it to a —will be quite slow for example. Universal Code Grep counts lines using SIMD and ripgrep counts lines using packed comparisons (16 bytes at a time). However, in the Linux code search benchmarks, because the size of each individual file is very small and the number of matches is tiny compared to the corpus size, the time spent counting lines tends to not be so significant. Especially since every tool in this benchmark parallelizes search to some degree. When we get to the single-file benchmarks, this variable will become much more pertinent. Respecting .gitignore files incurs some amount of overhead. Even though respecting .gitignore reduces the number of files searched, it can be slower overall to actually read the patterns, compile them and match them against every path than to just search every file. This is precisely how ucg soundly beats ripgrep in this benchmark. (We will control for this variable in future benchmarks.) In other words, respecting .gitignore is a feature that improves relevance first and foremost. It is strictly a bonus if it also happens to improve performance. The specific reasons why supporting .gitignore leads to a slower overall search are: Every directory descended requires looking for a corresponding .gitignore. Multiply the number of calls if you support additional ignore files, like both The Silver Searcher and ripgrep do. The Linux kernel repository has 4,640 directories. 178 of them have .gitignore files. Each .gitignore file needs to be compiled into something that can match file paths. Both The Silver Searcher and ripgrep use tricks to make this faster. For example, simple patterns like /vmlinux or *.o can be matched using simple literal comparisons or by looking at the file extension of a candidate path and comparing it directly. For more complex patterns like *.c.[012]*.*, a full glob matcher needs to be used. The Silver Searcher uses fnmatch while ripgrep translates all such globs into a single regular expression which can be matched against a single path all at once. Doing all this work takes time. Unlike ag, rg will try to support the full semantics of a .gitignore file. This means finding every ignore pattern that matches a file path and giving precedent to the most recently defined pattern. ag will bail on the first match it sees. Actually matching a path has non-trivial overhead that must be paid for every path searched. The compilation phase described above is complex precisely for making this part faster. We try to stay out of the regex machinery as best we can, but we can’t avoid it completely. In contrast, a whitelist like the one used by ucg is comparatively easy to make fast. The set of globs is known upfront, so no additional checks need to be made while traversing the file tree. Moreover, the globs tend to be of the *.ext variety, which fall into the bucket of globs that can be matched efficiently just by looking at the extension of a file path. The downside of a whitelist is obvious: you might end up missing search results simply because ucg didn’t know about a particular file extension. You could always teach ucg about the file extension, but you’re still blind to “unknown unknowns” (i.e., files that you probably want to search but didn’t know upfront that you needed to). linux_literal Description: This benchmark runs the same query as in the linux_literal_default benchmark, but we try to do a fair comparison. In particular, we run ripgrep in two modes: one where it respects .gitignore files (corresponding to the (ignore) label) and one where it uses a whitelist and doesn’t respect .gitignore (corresponding to the (whitelist) label). The former mode is comparable to ag, pt, sift and git grep, while the latter mode is comparable to ucg. We also run rg a third time by explicitly telling it to use memory maps for search, which matches the implementation strategy used by ag. sift is run such that it respects .gitignore files and excludes binary, hidden and PDF files. All commands executed here count lines, because some commands (ag and ucg) don’t support disabling line counting. Pattern: PM_RESUME rg (ignore) 0.334 +/- 0.053 (lines: 16) rg (ignore) (mmap) 1.611 +/- 0.009 (lines: 16) ag (ignore) (mmap) 1.588 +/- 0.011 (lines: 16) pt (ignore) 0.456 +/- 0.025 (lines: 16) sift (ignore) 0.630 +/- 0.004 (lines: 16) git grep (ignore) 0.345 +/- 0.007 (lines: 16) rg (whitelist) 0.228 +/- 0.042 (lines: 16)+ ucg (whitelist) 0.218 +/- 0.007 (lines: 16)* * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: We have a ton of ground to cover on this one. First and foremost, the (ignore) vs. (whitelist) variables have a clear impact on the performance of rg. We won’t rehash all the details from the analysis in linux_literal_default, but switching rg into its whitelist mode brings it into a dead heat with ucg. Secondly, ucg is just as fast as ripgrep and git grep (ignore) is just as fast as rg (ignore), even though I’ve said that ripgrep is the fastest. It turns out that ucg, git grep and rg are pretty evenly matched when searching for plain literals in large repositories. We will see a stronger separation in later benchmarks. Still, what makes ucg fast? ucg reads the entire file into memory before searching it, which means it avoids the memory map problem described below. On a code repository, this approach works well, but it comes with a steep price in the single-file benchmarks. It has a fast explicitly SIMD based line counting algorithm. ripgrep has something similar, but relies on the compiler for autovectorization. ucg uses PCRE2’s JIT, which is insanely fast. In my own very rough benchmarks, PCRE2’s JIT is one of the few general purpose regex engines that is competitive with Rust’s regex engine (on regexes that don’t expose PCRE’s exponential behavior due to backtracking, since Rust’s regex engine doesn’t suffer from that weakness). ucg parallelizes directory traversal, which is something that ripgrep doesn’t do. ucg has it a bit easier here because it doesn’t support .gitignore files. Parallelizing directory traversal while maintaining state for .gitignore files in a way that scales isn’t a problem I’ve figured out how to cleanly solve yet. What about git grep? A key performance advantage of git grep is that it doesn’t need to walk the directory tree, which can save it quite a bit of time. Its regex engine is also quite fast, and works similarly to GNU grep’s, RE2 and Rust’s regex engine (i.e., it uses a DFA). Both sift and pt perform almost as well as ripgrep. In fact, both sift and pt do implement a parallel recursive directory traversal while still respecting .gitignore files, which is likely one reason for their speed. As we will see in future benchmarks, their speed here is misleading. Namely, they are fast because they stay outside of Go’s regexp engine since the pattern is a literal. (There will be more discussion on this point later.) Finally, what’s going on with The Silver Searcher? Is it really that much slower than everything else? The key here is that its use of memory maps is making it slower, not faster (in direct contradiction to the claims in its README). OK, let’s pause and pop up a level to talk about what this actually means. First, we need to consider how these search tools fundamentally work. Generally speaking, a search tool like this has two ways of actually searching files on disk: It can memory map the file and search the entire file all at once as if it were a single contiguous region of bytes in memory. The operating system does the work behind the scenes to make a file look like a contiguous region of memory. This particular approach is really convenient when comparing it to the alternative described next. … or it can allocate an intermediate buffer, read a fixed size block of bytes from the file into it, search the buffer and then repeat the process. This particular approach is absolutely ghoulish to implement, because you need to account for the fact that a buffer may end in the middle of the line. You also need to account for the fact that a single line may exceed the size of your buffer. Finally, if you’re going to support showing the lines around a match (its “context”) as both grep and ripgrep do, then you need to do additional bookkeeping to make sure any lines from a previous buffer are printed even if a match occurs at the beginning of the next block read from the file. Naively, it seems like (1) would be obviously faster. Surely, all of the bookkeeping and copying in (2) would make it much slower! In fact, this is not at all true. (1) may not require much bookkeeping from the perspective of the programmer, but there is a lot of bookkeeping going on inside the Linux kernel to maintain the memory map. (That link goes to a mailing list post that is quite old, but it still appears relevant today.) When I first started writing ripgrep, I used the memory map approach. It took me a long time to be convinced enough to start down the second path with an intermediate buffer (because neither a CPU profile nor the output of strace ever showed any convincing evidence that memory maps were to blame), but as soon as I had a prototype of (2) working, it was clear that it was much faster than the memory map approach. With all that said, memory maps aren’t all bad. They just happen to be bad for the particular use case of “rapidly open, scan and close memory maps for thousands of small files.” For a different use case, like, say, “open this large file and search it once,” memory maps turn out to be a boon. We’ll see that in action in our single-file benchmarks later. The key datapoint that supports this conclusion is the comparison between rg (ignore) and rg (ignore) (mmap). In particular, this controls for everything except for the search strategy and fairly conclusively points right at memory maps as the problem. With all that said, the performance of memory maps is very dependent on your environment, and the absolute difference between rg (ignore) and ag (ignore) (mmap) can be misleading. In particular, since these benchmarks were run on an EC2 c3.2xlarge, we were probably inside a virtual machine, which could feasibly impact memory map performance. To test this, I ran the same benchmark on my machine under my desk (Intel i7-6900K 3.2 GHz, 16 CPUs, 64 GB memory, SSD) and got these results: rg (ignore) 0.156 +/- 0.006 (lines: 16) rg (ignore) (mmap) 0.397 +/- 0.013 (lines: 16) ag (ignore) (mmap) 0.444 +/- 0.016 (lines: 16) pt (ignore) 0.159 +/- 0.008 (lines: 16) sift (ignore) 0.344 +/- 0.002 (lines: 16) git grep (ignore) 0.195 +/- 0.023 (lines: 16) rg (whitelist) 0.108 +/- 0.005 (lines: 16)*+ ucg (whitelist) 0.165 +/- 0.005 (lines: 16) rg (ignore) still soundly beats ag, and our memory map conclusions above are still supported by this data, but the difference between rg (ignore) and ag (ignore) (mmap) has narrowed quite a bit! linux_literal_casei Description: This benchmark is like linux_literal, except it asks the search tool to perform a case insensitive search. Pattern: PM_RESUME (with the -i flag set) rg (ignore) 0.345 +/- 0.073 (lines: 370) rg (ignore) (mmap) 1.612 +/- 0.011 (lines: 370) ag (ignore) (mmap) 1.609 +/- 0.015 (lines: 370) pt (ignore) 17.204 +/- 0.126 (lines: 370) sift (ignore) 0.805 +/- 0.005 (lines: 370) git grep (ignore) 0.343 +/- 0.007 (lines: 370) rg (whitelist) 0.222 +/- 0.021 (lines: 370)+ ucg (whitelist) 0.217 +/- 0.006 (lines: 370)* * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: The biggest change from the previous benchmark is that pt got an order of magnitude slower than the next slowest tool. So why did pt get so slow? In particular, both sift and pt use Go’s regexp package for searching, so why did one perish while the other only got slightly slower? It turns out that when pt sees the -i flag indicating case insensitive search, it will force itself to use Go’s regexp engine with the i flag set. So for example, given a CLI invocation of pt -i foo, it will translate that to a Go regexp of (?i)foo, which will handle the case insensitive search. On the other hand, sift will notice the -i flag and take a different route. sift will lowercase both the pattern and every block of bytes it searches. This filter over all the bytes searched is likely the cause of sift’s performance drop from the previous linux_literal benchmark. (It’s worth pointing out that this optimization is actually incorrect, because it only accounts for ASCII case insensitivity, and not full Unicode case insensitivity, which pt gets by virture of Go’s regexp engine.) But still, is Go’s regexp engine really that slow? Unfortunately, yes, it is. While Go’s regexp engine takes worst case linear time on all searches (and is therefore exponentially faster than even PCRE2 for some set of regexes and corpora), its actual implementation hasn’t quite matured yet. Indeed, every fast regex engine based on finite automata that I’m aware of implements some kind of DFA engine. For example, GNU grep, Google’s RE2 and Rust’s regex library all do this. Go’s does not (but there is work in progress to make this happen, so perhaps pt will get faster on this benchmark without having to do anything at all!). There is one other thing worth noting here before moving on. Namely, that rg, ag, git grep and ucg didn’t noticeably change much from the previous benchmark. Shouldn’t a case insensitive search incur some kind of overhead? The answer is complicated and actually requires more knowledge of the underlying regex engines than I have. Thankfully, I can at least answer it for Rust’s regex engine. The key insight is that a case insensitive search for PM_RESUME is precisely the same as a case sensitive search of the alternation of all possible case agnostic versions of PM_RESUME. So for example, it might start like: PM_RESUME|pM_RESUME|Pm_RESUME|PM_rESUME|... and so on. Of course, the full alternation, even for a small literal like this, would be quite large. The key is that we can extract a small prefix and enumerate all of its combinations quite easily. In this case, Rust’s regex engine figures out this alternation (which you can see by passing --debug to rg and examining stderr): PM_RE PM_Re PM_rE PM_re Pm_RE Pm_Re Pm_rE Pm_re pM_RE pM_Re pM_rE pM_re pm_RE pm_Re pm_rE pm_re (Rest assured that Unicode support is baked into this process. For example, a case insensitive search for S would yield the following literals: S, s and ſ.) Now that we have this alternation of literals, what do we do with them? The classical answer is to compile them into a DFA (perhaps Aho-Corasick), and use it as a way to quickly skip through the search text. A match of any of the literals would then cause the regex engine to activate and try to verify the match. This way, we aren’t actually running the entire search text through the regex engine, which could be quite a bit slower. But, Rust’s regex engine doesn’t actually use Aho-Corasick for this. When SIMD acceleration is enabled (and you can be sure it is for these benchmarks, and for the binaries I distribute), a special multiple pattern search algorithm called Teddy is used. The algorithm is unpublished, but was invented by Geoffrey Langdale as part of Intel’s Hyperscan regex library. The algorithm works roughly by using packed comparisons of 16 bytes at a time to find candidate locations where a literal might match. I adapted the algorithm from the Hyperscan project to Rust, and included an extensive write up in the comments if you’re interested. While Teddy doesn’t buy us much over other tools in this particular benchmark, we will see much larger wins in later benchmarks. linux_word Description: This benchmarks the PM_RESUME literal again, but adds the -w flag to each tool. The -w flag has the following behavior: all matches reported must be considered “words.” That is, a “word” is something that starts and ends at a word boundary, where a word boundary is defined as a position in the search text that is adjacent to both a word character and a non-word character. Pattern: PM_RESUME (with the -w flag set) rg (ignore) 0.362 +/- 0.080 (lines: 6) ag (ignore) 1.603 +/- 0.009 (lines: 6) pt (ignore) 14.417 +/- 0.144 (lines: 6) sift (ignore) 7.840 +/- 0.123 (lines: 6) git grep (ignore) 0.341 +/- 0.005 (lines: 6) rg (whitelist) 0.220 +/- 0.026 (lines: 6)*+ ucg (whitelist) 0.221 +/- 0.007 (lines: 6) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: Not much has changed between this benchmark and the previous linux_literal or linux_literal_casei benchmarks. The most important thing to note is that most search tools handle the -w flag just fine without any noticeable drop in performance. There are two additional things I’d like to note. rg is searching with Unicode aware word boundaries where as the rest of the tools are using ASCII only word boundaries. (git grep can be made to use Unicode word boundaries by adjusting your system’s locale settings. In this benchmark, we force it to use ASCII word boundaries.) sift and pt are the only tools that gets noticeably slower in this benchmark compared to previous benchmarks. The reason is the same as the reason why pt got noticeably slower in the linux_literal_casei benchmark: both pt and sift are now also bottlenecked on Go’s regexp library. pt and sift could do a little better here by staying out of Go’s regexp library and searching for the PM_RESUME literal, and then only confirming whether the match corresponds to a word boundary after it found a hit for PM_RESUME. This still might use Go’s regexp library, but in a much more limited form. linux_unicode_word Description: This benchmarks a simple query for all prefixed forms of the “amp-hour” (Ah) unit of measurement. For example, it should show things like mAh (for milliamp-hour) and µAh (for microamp-hour). It is particularly interesting because the second form starts with µ, which is part of a Unicode aware \\w character class, but not an ASCII-only \\w character class. We again continue to control for the overhead of respecting .gitignore files. Pattern: \\wAh rg (ignore) 0.355 +/- 0.073 (lines: 186) rg (ignore) (ASCII) 0.329 +/- 0.060 (lines: 174) ag (ignore) (ASCII) 1.774 +/- 0.011 (lines: 174) pt (ignore) (ASCII) 14.180 +/- 0.180 (lines: 174) sift (ignore) (ASCII) 11.087 +/- 0.108 (lines: 174) git grep (ignore) 13.045 +/- 0.008 (lines: 186) git grep (ignore) (ASCII) 2.991 +/- 0.004 (lines: 174) rg (whitelist) 0.235 +/- 0.031 (lines: 180) rg (whitelist) (ASCII) 0.225 +/- 0.023 (lines: 168)*+ ucg (ASCII) 0.229 +/- 0.007 (lines: 168) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: In this benchmark, we’ve introduced a new variable: whether or not to enable Unicode support in each tool. Searches that are Unicode aware report slightly more matches that are missed by the other ASCII only searches. Of all the tools here, the only ones that support Unicode toggling are rg and git grep. rg’s Unicode support can be toggled by setting a flag in the pattern itself (e.g., \\w is Unicode aware while (?-u)\\w is not), and git grep’s Unicode suport can be toggled by setting the LC_ALL environment variable (where en_US.UTF-8 is one way to enable Unicode support and C forces it to be ASCII). More generally, git grep’s Unicode support is supposed to line up with your system’s locale settings—setting LC_ALL is a bit of a hack. It gets a little worse than that actually. Not only are rg and git grep the only ones to support toggling Unicode, but they are the only ones to support Unicode at all. ag, pt, sift and ucg will all force you to use the ASCII only \\w character class. (For pt and sift in particular, Go’s regexp library doesn’t have the ability to treat \\w as Unicode aware. For ag and ucg, which use PCRE, \\w could be made Unicode aware with a flag sent to PCRE. Neither tool exposes that functionality though.) The key result to note here is that while git grep suffers a major performance hit for enabling Unicode support, ripgrep hums along just fine with no noticeable loss in performance, even though both rg (ignore) and git grep (ignore) report the same set of results. As in the previous benchmark, both pt and sift could do better here by searching for the Ah literal, and only using Go’s regexp library to verify a match.) Looking at the benchmark results, I can think of two important questions to ask: Why is git grep (ignore) (ASCII) so much slower than rg (ignore) (ASCII)? And while the two aren’t directly comparable, it’s also a lot slower than ucg (ASCII). How is rg (ignore) (which is Unicode aware) just as fast as rg (ignore) (ASCII)? I actually don’t have a great answer for (1). In the case of rg at least, it will extract the Ah literal suffix from the regex and use that to find candidate matches before running the \\w prefix. While GNU grep has sophisticated literal extraction as well, it looks like git grep doesn’t go to similar lengths to extract literals. (I’m arriving at this conclusion after skimming the source of git grep, so I could be wrong.) In the case of ucg, it’s likely that PCRE2 is doing a similar literal optimization that rg is doing. (2) is fortunately much easier to answer. The trick is not inside of rg, but inside its regex library. Namely, the regex engine builds UTF-8 decoding into its finite state machine. (This is a trick that is originally attributed to Ken Thompson, but was more carefully described by Russ Cox. To read more about how this is achieved in Rust’s regex engine, please see the utf8-ranges library.) The reason why this is fast is because there is no extra decoding step required. The regex can be matched directly against UTF-8 encoded byte strings one byte at a time. Invalid UTF-8 doesn’t pose any problems: the finite automaton simply won’t match it because it doesn’t recognize it. In contrast, git grep (and GNU grep) have a completely separate path in their core matching code for handling Unicode aware features like this. To be fair, git grep can handle text encodings other than UTF-8, where as rg is limited to UTF-8 (or otherwise “ASCII compatible” text encodings) at the moment. linux_re_literal_suffix Description: This benchmarks a simple regex pattern that ends with a literal. We continue to control for the overhead of respecting .gitignore files. Pattern: [A-Z]+_RESUME rg (ignore) 0.318 +/- 0.034 (lines: 1652) ag (ignore) 1.899 +/- 0.008 (lines: 1652) pt (ignore) 13.713 +/- 0.241 (lines: 1652) sift (ignore) 10.172 +/- 0.186 (lines: 1652) git grep (ignore) 1.108 +/- 0.004 (lines: 1652) rg (whitelist) 0.221 +/- 0.022 (lines: 1630)*+ ucg (whitelist) 0.301 +/- 0.001 (lines: 1630) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: This benchmark doesn’t reveal anything particularly new that we haven’t already learned from previous benchmarks. In particular, both rg and ucg continue to be competitive, pt and sift are getting bottlenecked by Go’s regexp library and git grep has a slow down similar to the one observed in linux_unicode_word. (My hypothesis for that slow down continues to be that git grep is missing the literal optimization.) Finally, ag continues to be held back by its use of memory maps. rg, and almost assuredly ucg (by virtue of PCRE2), are picking on the _RESUME literal suffix and searching for that instead of running the regex over the entire search text. This explains why both tools are able to maintain their speed even as the pattern gets slightly more complex. rg does seem to slightly edge out ucg here, which might be attributable to differences in how each underlying regex library does literal search. linux_alternates Description: This benchmarks an alternation of four literals. The literals were specifically chosen to start with four distinct bytes to make it harder to optimize. Pattern: ERR_SYS|PME_TURN_OFF|LINK_REQ_RST|CFG_BME_EVT rg (ignore) 0.351 +/- 0.074 (lines: 68) ag (ignore) 1.747 +/- 0.005 (lines: 68) git grep (ignore) 0.501 +/- 0.003 (lines: 68) rg (whitelist) 0.216 +/- 0.031 (lines: 68)+ ucg (whitelist) 0.214 +/- 0.008 (lines: 68)* * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. We drop pt and sift from this benchmark and the next one for expediency. In this benchmark and in a few previous benchmarks, they have been hovering around an order of magnitude slower than the next slowest tool. Neither get any better as the complexity of our patterns increase. Analysis: Yet again, both rg and ucg maintain high speed even as the pattern grows beyond a simple literal. In this case, there isn’t any one particular literal that we can search to find match candidates quickly, but a good regular expression engine can still find ways to speed this up. For rg in particular, it sees the four literals and diverts to the Teddy multiple pattern SIMD algorithm (as described in the linux_literal_casei benchmark). In fact, for this particular pattern, Rust’s core regex engine is never used at all. Namely, it notices that a literal match of any of the alternates corresponds to an overall match of the pattern, so it can completely skip the verification step. This makes searching alternates of literals very fast. linux_alternates_casei Description: This benchmark is precisely the same as the linux_alternates benchmark, except we make the search case insensitive by adding the -i flag. Note that git grep is run under ASCII mode, in order to give it every chance to be fast. Pattern: ERR_SYS|PME_TURN_OFF|LINK_REQ_RST|CFG_BME_EVT (with the -i flag set) rg (ignore) 0.391 +/- 0.078 (lines: 160) ag (ignore) 1.968 +/- 0.009 (lines: 160) git grep (ignore) 2.018 +/- 0.006 (lines: 160) rg (whitelist) 0.222 +/- 0.001 (lines: 160)*+ ucg (whitelist) 0.522 +/- 0.002 (lines: 160) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: The case insensitive flag causes quite a bit of separation, relative to the previous linux_alterates benchmark. For one, git grep gets over 4 times slower. Even ucg gets twice as slow. Yet, rg continues to maintain its speed! The secret continues to be the Teddy algorithm, just as in the linux_alternates benchmark. The trick lies in how we transform an alternation of case insensitive literals into a larger alternation that the Teddy algorithm can actually use. In fact, it works exactly how it was described in the linux_literal_casei benchmark: we enumerate all possible alternations of each literal that are required for case insensitive match. Since that can be quite a large number, we limit ourselves to a small number of prefixes from that set that we can enumerate. In this case, we use the following prefixes (which can be seen by running rg with the --debug flag): CFG_ CFg_ CfG_ Cfg_ ERR_ ERr_ ErR_ Err_ LIN LIn LiN Lin PME_ PMe_ PmE_ Pme_ cFG_ cFg_ cfG_ cfg_ eRR_ eRr_ erR_ err_ lIN lIn liN lin pME_ pMe_ pmE_ pme_ We feed these literals to the Teddy algorithm, which will quickly identify candidate matches in the search text. When a candidate match is found, we need to verify it since a match of a prefix doesn’t necessarily mean the entire pattern matches. It is only at that point that we actually invoke the full regex engine. linux_unicode_greek Description: This benchmarks usage of a particular Unicode feature that permits one to match a certain class of codepoints defined in Unicode. Both Rust’s regex engine and Go’s regex engine support this natively, but none of the other tools do. Pattern: \\p{Greek} (matches any Greek symbol) rg 0.414 +/- 0.021 (lines: 23)*+ pt 12.745 +/- 0.166 (lines: 23) sift 7.767 +/- 0.264 (lines: 23) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: This one is pretty simple. rg compiles \\p{Greek} into a deterministic finite state machine while Go (used in pt and sift) will also use a finite state machine, but it is a nondeterministic simulation. The core difference between the two approaches is that the former is only ever in one state at any point in time, while the latter must constantly keep track of all the different states it is in. linux_unicode_greek_casei Description: This benchmark is just like the linux_unicode_greek benchmark, except it makes the search case insensitive. This particular query is a bit idiosyncratic, but it does demonstrate just how well supported Unicode is in rg. Pattern: \\p{Greek} (with the -i flag set, matches any Greek symbol) rg 0.425 +/- 0.027 (lines: 103) pt 12.612 +/- 0.217 (lines: 23) sift 0.002 +/- 0.000 (lines: 0)*+ * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: sift doesn’t actually beat rg here: it just gets so confused by the search request that it gives up and reports no matches. pt seems to execute the search, but doesn’t handle Unicode case insensitivity correctly. Meanwhile, rg handles the request just fine, and it’s still fast. In this particular case, the entire Greek category, along with all of its case-insensitive variants, are compiled into a single fast deterministic finite state machine. One interesting thing to note about this search is that if you run it, you’ll see a lot more results containing the character µ, which looks essentially identical to the character μ that also shows up in a case sensitive search. As you might have guessed, even though these two characters look the same, they are in fact distinct Unicode codepoints: µ is MICRO SIGN with codepoint U+000000B5. μ is GREEK SMALL LETTER MU with codepoint U+000003BC. The latter codepoint is considered part of the \\p{Greek} group while the former codepoint is not (the former codepoint appears to be the correct sigil to use in the case of the Linux kernel). However, the Unicode simple case folding tables map MICRO SIGN to GREEK SMALL LETTER MU, which causes rg to pick up on lines containing MICRO SIGN even though it strictly isn’t part of the Greek group. linux_no_literal Description: This is the last benchmark on the Linux kernel source code and is a bit idiosyncratic like linux_unicode_greek_casei. In particular, it looks for lines containing 5 consecutive repetitions of 5 word characters, each separated by one or more space characters. The key distinction of this pattern from every other pattern in this benchmark is that it does not contain any literals. Given the presence of \\w and \\s, which have valid Unicode and ASCII interpretations, we attempt to control for the presence of Unicode support. Pattern: \\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5} rg (ignore) 0.577 +/- 0.003 (lines: 490) rg (ignore) (ASCII) 0.416 +/- 0.025 (lines: 490) ag (ignore) (ASCII) 2.339 +/- 0.010 (lines: 766) pt (ignore) (ASCII) 22.066 +/- 0.057 (lines: 490) sift (ignore) (ASCII) 25.563 +/- 0.108 (lines: 490) git grep (ignore) 26.382 +/- 0.044 (lines: 490) git grep (ignore) (ASCII) 4.153 +/- 0.010 (lines: 490) rg (whitelist) 0.503 +/- 0.011 (lines: 419) rg (whitelist) (ASCII) 0.343 +/- 0.038 (lines: 419)*+ ucg (whitelist) (ASCII) 1.130 +/- 0.003 (lines: 416) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. ag reports many more matches than other tools because it does multiline search where the \\s can match a . Analysis: Since this particular pattern doesn’t have any literals in it, it’s entirely up to the underlying regex engine to answer this query. It can’t be smart and skip through the input—it has to pass it completely through the regex engine. Since non-literal patterns are pretty rare in my experience, this benchmark exists primarily as an engineered way to test how well the underlying regex engines perform. rg, regardless of whether it respects .gitignore files or whether it handles Unicode correctly, does quite well here compared to other tools. git grep in particular pays a 5x penalty for Unicode support. rg on the other hand pays about a 0.3x penalty for Unicode support. Interestingly, even though ucg doesn’t enable Unicode support, not even PCRE2’s JIT can compete with rg! What makes rg so fast here? And what actually causes the 0.3x penalty? rg continues to be fast on this benchmark primarily for the same reason why it’s fast with other Unicode-centric benchmarks: it compiles the UTF-8 decoding right into its deterministic finite state machine. This means there is no extra step to decode the search text into Unicode codepoints first. We can match directly on the raw bytes. To a first approximation, the performance penalty comes from compiling the DFA to match the pattern. In particular, the DFA to match the Unicode variant is much much larger than the DFA to match the ASCII variant. To give you a rough idea of the size difference: The ASCII DFA has about 250 distinct NFA states. The Unicode DFA has about 77,000 distinct NFA states. (These numbers are produced directly from the compiler in Rust’s regex library, and don’t necessarily reflect a minimal automaton.) A DFA produced from these patterns doesn’t necessarily have the same number of states, since each DFA state typically corresponds to multiple NFA states. (Check out the Powerset construction Wikipedia article. Although it doesn’t correspond to the same implementation strategy used in Rust’s regex engine, it should give good intuition.) However, the first approximation is a bit misleading. While Rust’s regex engine does have a preprocessing compilation phase, it does not actually include converting an NFA into a DFA. Indeed, that would be far too slow and could take exponential time! Instead, Rust’s regex engine builds the DFA on the fly or “lazily,” as it searches the text. In the case of the ASCII pattern, this search barely spends any time constructing the DFA states since there are so few of them. However, in the Unicode case, since there are so many NFA states, it winds up spending a lot of time compiling new DFA states. (I’ve confirmed this by inspecting a profile generated by perf.) Digging a bit deeper, the actual story here might be subtler. For example, the Unicode pattern might wind up with the same number of DFA states as the ASCII pattern, primarily because the input its searching is the same and is primarily ASCII. The slow down then must come from the fact that each individual DFA state takes longer to build. This is likely correct since a single Unicode \\w is over two orders of magnitude larger than a single ASCII \\w. Therefore, each DFA state probably has a lot more NFA states in it for the Unicode pattern as opposed to the ASCII pattern. It’s not clear whether we can do any better here (other than trying to minimize the Unicode \\w, which would be totally feasible), since we don’t actually know the composition of the search text ahead of time. One idea for improvement is to have multiple types of DFAs. For example, you might imagine trying to match with an ASCII only DFA. If the DFA sees a non-ASCII byte, then it could cause a transition into a Unicode-aware DFA. However, the penalty here is so small that it’s hard to justify this kind of implementation complexity! Single file benchmarks In the second half of our benchmarks, we will shift gears and look more closely at the performance of search tools on a single large file. Each benchmark will be run on two samples of the OpenSubtitles2016 dataset. One sample will be English and therefore predominantly ASCII, and another sample will be in Russian and therefore predominantly Cyrillic. The patterns for the Russian sample were translated from English using Google Translate. (Sadly, I can’t read Russian, but I have tried each search by hand and confirmed that a sample of the results I was looking at were relevant by piping them back through Google Translate.) The English sample is around 1GB and the Russian sample is around 1.6GB, so the benchmark timings aren’t directly comparable. In this benchmark, the performance of the underlying regex engine and various literal optimizations matter a lot more. The two key variables we’ll need to control for are line counting and Unicode support. Normally, we’d just not request line counting from any of the tools, but neither of The Silver Searcher or Universal Code Grep support disabling line numbers. Additionally, Unicode support is tricky to control for in some examples because ripgrep does not support ASCII only case insensitive semantics when searching with a non-ASCII string. It’s Unicode all the way and there’s no way to turn it off. As we’ll see, at least for ripgrep, it’s still faster than its ASCII alternatives even when providing case insensitive Unicode support. As with the Linux benchmark, you can see precisely which command was run and its recorded time in the raw data. ripgrep utterly dominates this round, both in performance and correctness. subtitles_literal Description: This benchmarks the simplest case for any search tool: find all occurrences of a literal string. Tools annotated with (lines) were passed the -n flag (or equivalent) so that the output reports line numbers. English pattern: Sherlock Holmes rg 0.268 +/- 0.000 (lines: 629)*+ rg (no mmap) 0.336 +/- 0.001 (lines: 629) pt 3.433 +/- 0.002 (lines: 629) sift 0.326 +/- 0.002 (lines: 629) grep 0.516 +/- 0.001 (lines: 629) rg (lines) 0.595 +/- 0.001 (lines: 629) ag (lines) 2.730 +/- 0.003 (lines: 629) ucg (lines) 0.745 +/- 0.001 (lines: 629) pt (lines) 3.434 +/- 0.005 (lines: 629) sift (lines) 0.756 +/- 0.002 (lines: 629) grep (lines) 0.969 +/- 0.001 (lines: 629) Russian pattern: Шерлок Холмс rg 0.325 +/- 0.001 (lines: 583)*+ rg (no mmap) 0.452 +/- 0.002 (lines: 583) pt 12.917 +/- 0.009 (lines: 583) sift 16.418 +/- 0.008 (lines: 583) grep 0.780 +/- 0.001 (lines: 583) rg (lines) 0.926 +/- 0.001 (lines: 583) ag (lines) 4.481 +/- 0.003 (lines: 583) ucg (lines) 1.889 +/- 0.004 (lines: 583) pt (lines) 12.935 +/- 0.011 (lines: 583) sift (lines) 17.177 +/- 0.010 (lines: 583) grep (lines) 1.300 +/- 0.003 (lines: 583) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. This is the only benchmark that contains pt and sift, since they become too slow in all future benchmarks. Analysis: Whether it’s part of the underlying regex engine or part of the search tool itself, every search tool in this benchmark does some kind of literal optimization. ag will inspect the pattern, and if it doesn’t contain any special regex characters, then it will use a Boyer-Moore variant to perform the search instead of PCRE. GNU grep does something similar, although it has clearly been the subject of much optimization. If that’s true, how does rg beat GNU grep by almost a factor of 2? Well, first and foremost, we note that both sift and ucg beat GNU grep as well. I won’t be able to go into detail on ucg’s speed since PCRE2’s JIT isn’t something I understand very well, but I can at least tell you that the reasons why rg and sift are faster than GNU grep are actually distinct: sift uses Go’s regexp library, which will do at least one small literal optimization: if every match of a regex starts with the same byte, the regex engine will scan for that byte before starting a match. If you follow the code that does the scan for the byte all the way back to its source for x86_64 systems, then you’ll find that it is using AVX2 instructions and ymm registers, which permit scanning 32 bytes in each iteration. In contrast, GNU grep uses libc’s memchr, which doesn’t use AVX2. However, that C code will be autovectorized to use xmm registers and SIMD instructions, which are half the size of ymm registers. In other words, by virture of being written in Go, sift is making more efficient use of the CPU. rg also uses memchr from libc. The rg binary that was used in this benchmark was statically linked with musl, which provides its own implementation of memchr. Despite it being quite a bit terser than GNU’s libc implementation used in GNU grep, it appears to be doing roughly the same work. If that’s the case, how is rg faster? The answer lies not in memchr nor in the variant of Boyer-Moore nor in the number characters Boyer-Moore can skip. The answer instead lies in which byte is given to memchr. rg will actually try to guess the “rarest” byte in a literal, and use memchr on that. (A standard Boyer-Moore implementation will use memchr always on the last byte.) In this particular case, running memchr on either S or H is probably quite a bit better than running it on s because S and H are far less common than s. That is, rg tries harder than GNU grep to spend more time skipping bytes in a fast SIMD optimized loop. rg can get this wrong, but it seems strictly better to at least guess and probably get it right in the common case than to submit to an artifact of common Boyer-Moore implementations. Now that the secrets of literal search have been revealed, we can better analyze the Russian benchmark. The answer once again lies in which byte is used for quick scanning. Both sift and pt use the same AVX2 routine in Go’s runtime, so why did they get so much slower than every other tool in the Russian benchmark? The answer becomes more clear when we look at the actual UTF-8 bytes of the pattern Шерлок Холмс: \\xd0\\xa8\\xd0\\xb5\\xd1\\x80\\xd0\\xbb\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xba \\xd0\\xa5\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xbb\\xd0\\xbc\\xd1\\x81 There are two key observations to take away from this: Every character in the pattern Шерлок Холмс is encoded with two UTF-8 code units, which corresponds to two bytes. Every character starts with either the byte \\xD0 or \\xD1. If we looked at the UTF-8 bytes of the Russian subtitles we’re searching, we’d end up seeing exactly the same pattern. This pattern occurs because the contents of the file are mostly Cyrllic, which are all mostly part of a couple small ranges in Unicode. This means that the \\xD0 and \\xD1 bytes occur a lot. If you recall from above, Go’s regex engine will scan for occurrences of the first byte. But if that first byte happens as frequently as it does here, the overall search will wind up going slower because there is overhead associated with doing that scan. This is precisely the trade off one is exposed to whenever memchr is used. As you might have guessed, rg works around this issue by trying to guess the rarest byte. rg specifically draws from a pre-computed frequency table of all 256 bytes. Bytes like \\xD0 and \\xD1 are considered to be among the most frequent while bytes like \\xA8 and \\x81 are considered more rare. Therefore, rg will prefer bytes other than \\xD0 and \\xD1 for use with memchr. GNU grep continues to do well on this benchmark mostly because of blind luck: Boyer-Moore uses the last byte, which will correspond to \\x81, which is much rarer than \\xD0 or \\xD1. Switching gears, we should briefly discuss memory maps. In this benchmark, rg beats out rg (no mmap) by about 25%. The only difference between the two is that the former memory maps the file into memory while the latter incrementally reads bytes from the file into an intermediate buffer, and searches it. In this case, the overhead of the memory map is very small because we only need to create one of them. This is the opposite result from our Linux benchmark above, where memory maps proved to be worse than searching with an intermediate buffer since we needed to create a new memory map for every file we searched, which ends up incurring quite a bit of overhead. rg takes an empirical approach here and enables memory map searching when it knows it only needs to search a few files, and otherwise searches using an intermediate buffer. One last note: I’ve neglected to talk about (lines) because there’s really not much to say here: counting lines takes work, and if you don’t need to report line numbers, you can avoid doing that work. ucg has a rather cool SIMD algorithm to count lines and rg also has a packed counting algorithm that works similarly to the memchr implementations we talked about. If it were up to me, I’d probably remove benchmarks with line numbers altogether, since most tools tend to reliably pay just a little bit extra for them. However, neither ag nor ucg allow turning them off, so we need to turn them on in other tools in order to make a fair comparison. subtitles_literal_casei Description: This benchmark is just like subtitles_literal, except it does case insensitive search. Tools annotated with (lines) show line numbers in their output, and tools annotated with (ASCII) are doing an ASCII-only search. Correspondingly, tools not labeled with (ASCII) are doing a proper Unicode search. English pattern: Sherlock Holmes (with the -i flag set) rg 0.366 +/- 0.001 (lines: 642)*+ grep 4.084 +/- 0.005 (lines: 642) grep (ASCII) 0.614 +/- 0.001 (lines: 642) rg (lines) 0.696 +/- 0.002 (lines: 642) ag (lines) (ASCII) 2.775 +/- 0.004 (lines: 642) ucg (lines) (ASCII) 0.841 +/- 0.002 (lines: 642) Russian pattern: Шерлок Холмс rg 1.131 +/- 0.001 (lines: 604) grep 8.187 +/- 0.006 (lines: 604) grep (ASCII) 0.785 +/- 0.001 (lines: 583) rg (lines) 1.733 +/- 0.002 (lines: 604) ag (lines) (ASCII) 0.729 +/- 0.001 (lines: 0)*+ ucg (lines) (ASCII) 1.896 +/- 0.005 (lines: 583) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. There is no rg (ASCII) because rg can’t do ASCII-only case insensitive search. Analysis: This is a fun benchmark, because we start to see just how awesome rg’s support for Unicode is. Namely, that it not only gets it correct, but it’s also fast. It’s fast enough that it beats the competition even when the competition is using ASCII-only rules. Right off the bat, GNU grep pays dearly for doing a case insensitive search with Unicode support. The problem it faces is that it can no longer do a straight-forward Boyer-Moore search, so it either needs to fall back to some alternative literal search or its full regex engine. Even though GNU grep is much faster at ASCII-only case sensitive search than its Unicode aware variant, rg’s Unicode case insensitive search still handedly beats GNU grep’s ASCII-only case insensitive search. The reason why rg is so fast on this benchmark is the same reason why it’s fast in the linux_literal_casei benchmark: it turns the pattern Sherlock Holmes into an alternation of all possible literals according to Unicode’s simple case folding rules. It then takes a small prefix from each alternate so that our set of literals looks like this: SHER SHEr SHeR SHer ShER ShEr SheR Sher sHER sHEr sHeR sHer shER shEr sheR sher ſHER ſHEr ſHeR ſHer ſhER ſhEr ſheR ſher (Notice that we get Unicode right by including ſ as a case variant of S.) It then feeds these literals to the Teddy SIMD multiple pattern algorithm. The algorithm is unpublished, but was invented by Geoffrey Langdale as part of Intel’s Hyperscan regex library. The algorithm works roughly by using packed comparisons of 16 bytes at a time to find candidate locations where a literal might match. I adapted the algorithm from the Hyperscan project to Rust, and included an extensive write up in the comments if you’re interested. While essentially the same analysis applies to the Russian benchmark, there are a few interesting things to note. Namely, while the results show grep (ASCII) as being very fast, it seems clear that it’s completely ignoring the -i flag in this case since the pattern is not an ASCII string. Notably, its timing is essentially identical to its timing on the previous subtitles_literal benchmark. The other interesting thing to note is that ag reports 0 matches. This isn’t entirely unreasonable, if it somehow knows that it can’t satisfy the request (case insensitive search of a non-ASCII string when Unicode support isn’t enabled). If I had to guess, I’d say PCRE is returning an error (possibly from pcre_exec) and it isn’t being forwarded to the end user, but that’s just a shot in the dark. subtitles_alternate Description: This benchmarks an alternation of literals, where there are several distinct leading bytes from each literal. We control for line counting. English pattern: Sherlock Holmes|John Watson|Irene Adler|Inspector Lestrade|Professor Moriarty rg 0.294 +/- 0.001 (lines: 848)*+ grep 2.955 +/- 0.003 (lines: 848) rg (lines) 0.619 +/- 0.001 (lines: 848) ag (lines) 3.757 +/- 0.001 (lines: 848) ucg (lines) 1.479 +/- 0.002 (lines: 848) grep (lines) 3.412 +/- 0.004 (lines: 848) Russian pattern: Шерлок Холмс|Джон Уотсон|Ирен Адлер|инспектор Лестрейд|профессор Мориарти rg 1.300 +/- 0.002 (lines: 691)*+ grep 7.994 +/- 0.017 (lines: 691) rg (lines) 1.902 +/- 0.002 (lines: 691) ag (lines) 5.892 +/- 0.003 (lines: 691) ucg (lines) 2.864 +/- 0.006 (lines: 691) grep (lines) 8.511 +/- 0.005 (lines: 691) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: rg does really well here, on both the English and Russian patterns, primarily thanks to Teddy as described in the analysis for subtitles_literal_casei. On the English pattern, rg is around an order of magnitude faster than GNU grep. The performance cost of counting lines is on full display here. For rg at least, it makes returning search results take twice as long. Note that the benchmark description mentions picking literals with distinct leading bytes. This is to avoid measuring an optimization where the regex engine detects the leading byte and runs memchr on it. Of course, this optimization is important (and rg will of course do it), but it’s far more interesting to benchmark what happens in a slightly trickier case. subtitles_alternate_casei Description: This benchmark is just like subtitles_alternate, except it searches case insensitively. In this benchmark, instead of controlling for line counting (all commands count lines), we control for Unicode support. English pattern: Sherlock Holmes|John Watson|Irene Adler|Inspector Lestrade|Professor Moriarty (with the -i flag set) rg 2.724 +/- 0.002 (lines: 862)*+ grep 5.125 +/- 0.006 (lines: 862) ag (ASCII) 5.170 +/- 0.004 (lines: 862) ucg (ASCII) 3.453 +/- 0.005 (lines: 862) grep (ASCII) 4.537 +/- 0.025 (lines: 862) Russian pattern: Шерлок Холмс|Джон Уотсон|Ирен Адлер|инспектор Лестрейд|профессор Мориарти rg 4.834 +/- 0.004 (lines: 735) grep 8.729 +/- 0.004 (lines: 735) ag (ASCII) 5.891 +/- 0.001 (lines: 691) ucg (ASCII) 2.868 +/- 0.005 (lines: 691)*+ grep (ASCII) 8.572 +/- 0.009 (lines: 691) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: While rg gets an order of magnitude slower on this benchmark compared to subtitles_alternate, it still comfortably beats out the rest of the search tools, even when other tools don’t support Unicode. A key thing this benchmark demonstrates are the limits of the Teddy algorithm. In fact, rg opts to not use Teddy in this benchmark because it predicts it won’t perform well. Why doesn’t Teddy perform well here? Well, the answer is in how we generate literals for this pattern. Namely, rg will try to generate all possible literals that satisfy Unicode simple case folding rules, and then will take a short prefix of that set to cut the number of literals down to reasonable size. In this particular case, we wind up with 48 literals: INS INs INſ IRE IRe InS Ins Inſ IrE Ire JOH JOh JoH Joh PRO PRo PrO Pro SHE SHe ShE She iNS iNs iNſ iRE iRe inS ins inſ irE ire jOH jOh joH joh pRO pRo prO pro sHE sHe shE she ſHE ſHe ſhE ſhe If we passed all of those to Teddy, it would become overwhelmed. In particular, Teddy works by finding candidates for matches very quickly. When there are roughly the same number of candidates as there are matches, Teddy performs exceedingly well. But, if we give it more literals, then it’s more likely to find candidates that don’t match, and will therefore have to spend a lot more time verifying the match, which can be costly. (A more subtle aspect of the Teddy implementation is that a larger number of literals increases the cost of every verification, even if the number of candidates produced doesn’t increase. As I’ve mentioned before, if you want the full scoop on Teddy, see its well commented implementation. Going into more detail on Teddy would require a whole blog post on its own!) When rg sees that there are a large number of literals, it could do one of two things: Try to cut down the set even more. For example, in this case, we could strip the last character from each prefix off and end up with a much smaller set. Unfortunately, even though we have fewer literals, we wind up with a still not-so-small set of two-character literals, which will also tend to produce a lot more false positive candidates just because of their length. Move to a different multiple pattern algorithm, such as Aho-Corasick. I have tried to implement (1) in the past, but I’ve always wound up in a game of whack-a-mole. I might make one common case faster, but another common case a lot slower. In those types of cases, it’s usually better to try and achieve good average case performance. Luckily for us, Aho-Corasick does exactly that. We do still have a few tricks up our sleeve though. For example, many Aho-Corasick implementations are built as-if they were tries with back-pointers for their failure transitions. We can actually do better than that. We can compile all of its failure transitions into a DFA with a transition table contiguous in memory. This means that every byte of input corresponds to a single lookup in the transition table to find the next state. We never have to waste time chasing pointers or walking more than one failure transition for any byte in the search text. Of course, this transition table based approach is memory intensive, since you need space for number_of_literals * number_of_states, where number_of_states is roughly capped at the total number of bytes in all of the literals. While 48 literals of length 3 is too much for Teddy to handle, it’s barely a blip when it comes to Aho-Corasick, even with its memory expensive transition table based approach. (N.B. In the literature, this particular implementation of Aho-Corasick is often called “Advanced” Aho-Corasick.) subtitles_surrounding_words Description: This benchmarks a pattern that searches for words surrounding the literal string Holmes. This pattern was specifically constructed to defeat both prefix and suffix literal optimizations. English pattern: \\w+\\s+Holmes\\s+\\w+ rg 0.605 +/- 0.000 (lines: 317) grep 1.286 +/- 0.002 (lines: 317) rg (ASCII) 0.602 +/- 0.000 (lines: 317)*+ ag (ASCII) 11.663 +/- 0.008 (lines: 323) ucg (ASCII) 4.690 +/- 0.002 (lines: 317) grep (ASCII) 1.276 +/- 0.002 (lines: 317) Russian pattern: \\w+\\s+Холмс\\s+\\w+ rg 0.957 +/- 0.001 (lines: 278)*+ grep 1.660 +/- 0.002 (lines: 278) ag (ASCII) 2.411 +/- 0.001 (lines: 0) ucg (ASCII) 2.980 +/- 0.002 (lines: 0) grep (ASCII) 1.596 +/- 0.003 (lines: 0) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. Analysis: In order to compete on this benchmark, a search tool will need to implement a so-called “inner literal” optimization. You can probably guess what that means: it is an optimization that looks for literal strings that appear anywhere in the pattern, and if a literal is found that must appear in every match, then a search tool can quickly scan for that literal instead of applying the full regex to the search text. The key thing that permits this optimization to work is the fact that most search tools report results per line. For example, in this case, if a line contains the literal Holmes, then the search tool can find the beginning and ending of that line and run the full pattern on just that line. If the literal is relatively rare, this keeps us out of the regex engine for most of the search. And of course, if the literal doesn’t appear at all in the corpus, then we will have never touched the regex engine at all. To achieve the full optimization, you probably need to parse your pattern into its abstract syntax (abbreviated “AST” for abstract syntax tree) to extract the literal. It is worth pointing out however that one can probably get a lot of mileage with simpler heuristics, but a real pattern parser is the only way to do this optimization robustly. The problem here is that for most regex engines, parsing the pattern is an unexposed implementation detail, so it can be hard for search tools to extract literals in a robust way without writing their own parser, and a modern regex parser is no easy task! Thankfully, Rust’s regex library exposes an additional library, regex-syntax, which provides a full parser. rg implements this optimization relatively easily with the help of regex-syntax, while GNU grep implements this optimization because the search tool and the underlying regex engine are coupled together. Why does the search tool need to perform this optimization? Why can’t the underlying regex engine do it? I personally have thought long and hard about this particular problem and haven’t been able to come up with an elegant solution. The core problem is that once you find an occurrence of the literal, you don’t know where to start searching the full regex. In a general purpose regex engine, a pattern could match an arbitrarily long string. For example, \\w+\\s+Holmes\\s+\\w+ mightly only match at the very end of a gigabyte sized document. There are ways to work around this. For example, you could split the regex into three pieces: \\w+\\s+, Holmes and \\s+\\w+. On every occurrence of the Holmes literal, you could search for the beginning of the match by executing \\w+\\s+ in reverse starting just before the literal, and executing \\s+\\w+ forwards starting just after the literal. The key problem with this approach is that it exposes you to quadratic behavior in the worst case (since \\w+\\s+ or \\s+\\w+ could cause you to re-scan text you’ve already seen). While I believe there is a general purpose way to solve this and still guarantee linear time searching, a good solution hasn’t revealed itself yet. Based on the data in this benchmark, only rg and GNU grep perform this optimization. Neither ag nor ucg attempt to extract any inner literals from the pattern, and it looks like PCRE doesn’t try to do anything too clever. (Of course, Rust’s regex library doesn’t either, this optimization is done in rg proper.) As for the Russian pattern, we see that only tools with proper Unicode support can execute the query successfully. The reason is because \\w is ASCII only in ucg and ag, so it can’t match the vast majority of word characters (which are Cyrllic) in our sample. Otherwise, both rg and GNU grep remain fast, primarily because of the inner literal optimization. subtitles_no_literal Description: This benchmark purposefully has no literals in it, which makes it a bit idiosyncratic, since most searches done by end users probably have at least some literal in them. However, it is a useful benchmark to gauge the general performance of the underlying regex engine. English pattern: \\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5} rg 2.777 +/- 0.003 (lines: 13) rg (ASCII) 2.541 +/- 0.005 (lines: 13)*+ ag (ASCII) 10.076 +/- 0.005 (lines: 48) ucg (ASCII) 7.771 +/- 0.004 (lines: 13) grep (ASCII) 4.411 +/- 0.004 (lines: 13) Russian pattern: \\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5}\\s+\\w{5} rg 4.905 +/- 0.003 (lines: 41) rg (ASCII) 3.973 +/- 0.002 (lines: 0) ag (ASCII) 2.395 +/- 0.004 (lines: 0)*+ ucg (ASCII) 3.006 +/- 0.005 (lines: 0) grep (ASCII) 2.483 +/- 0.005 (lines: 0) * - Best mean time. + - Best sample time. ag gets more matches on the English pattern since it does multiline search. Namely, the \\s can match a . grep with Unicode support was dropped from this benchmark because it takes over 90 seconds on the English pattern and over 4 minutes on the Russian pattern. In both cases, GNU grep and rg report the same results. Analysis: Once again, no other search tool performs as well as rg. For the English pattern, both rg and rg (ASCII) have very similar performance, despite rg supporting Unicode. What specifically makes rg faster than GNU grep in this case? Both search tools ultimately use a DFA to execute this pattern, so their performance should be roughly the same. I don’t actually have a particularly good answer for this. Both GNU grep and Rust’s regex library unroll the DFA’s inner loop, and both implementations compute states on the fly. I can make a guess though. Rust’s regex library avoids a single pointer dereference when following a transition. How it achieves this is complicated, but it’s done by representing states as indices into the transition table rather than simple incremental ids. This permits the generated code to use simple addition to address the location of the next transition, which can be done with addressing modes in a s",

I figured on paper this sounds like it has learned many important lessons that Unix shells could learn but (at least the popular ones) didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s been given a blank canvas, the principles it&#x27;s working to make sense, it has good people behind it. So I even undertook to write a modest new piece of glue code in Power Shell, after all if it had been on Linux I&#x27;d definitely consider the Bourne shell as well as Python for the work...Then I tried it and I strongly dislike it. The syntax is clunky, it&#x27;s really no better than popular Unix shells at being a \"real\" programming language, and yet it&#x27;s not as good as they are at being just a shell either.It also just doesn&#x27;t feel like a quality product.

This may not be the most popular way of using rg but I have been very pleased with the overall experience. All it takes is running package-install to install the dumb-jump package and configuring the following hook: (add-hook &#x27;xref-backend-functions #&#x27;dumb-jump-xref-activate)The Xref key sequences and commands work fine with it. If I type M-. (or C-u M-.) to find definitions of an identifier in a Python project, dumb-jump runs a command like the following, processes the results, and displays the results in an Xref buffer. rg --color never --no-heading --line-number -U --pcre2 --type py &#x27;\\s*\\bfoo\\s*=[^=]+|def\\s*foo\\b\\s*\\(|class\\s*foo\\b\\s*\\(?&#x27; &#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;git&#x2F;project&#x2F;The above command shows how dumb-jump automatically restricts the search to the current file type within the current project directory. If no project directory is found, it defaults to the home directory.By the way, dumb-jump supports the silver searcher tool ag too which happens to be quite fast as well. If neither ag nor rg is found, it defaults to grep which as one would expect can be quite slow while searching the whole home directory. reply susam 20 hours agoparentAddendum to my comment above:Ripgrep can be used quite easily with the project.el package too that comes out of the box in Emacs. So it is not really necessary to install an external package to make use of ripgrep within Emacs. We first need to configure xref-search-program to ripgrep as shown below, otherwise it defaults to grep which can be quite slow on large directories: (setq xref-search-program &#x27;ripgrep)Then a project search with C-x p g foo RET ends up executing a command like the following on the current project directory: rg -i --null -nH --no-heading --no-messages -g &#x27;!*&#x2F;&#x27; -e fooThe results are displayed in an Xref buffer again which in my opinion is the best thing about using external search tools within Emacs. The Xref key sequences like n (next match), p (previous match), RET (jump to source of match), C-o (show the source of the match in a split window), etc. make navigating the results a breeze! reply burntsushi 20 hours agoparentprevAuthor of ripgrep here.Looking at your regex---just by inspection, I haven&#x27;t tried it, so I could be wrong---but I think you can drop the --pcre2 flag. I also think you can drop the second and third \\b assertion. You might need the first one though. reply susam 20 hours agorootparentThe example I have posted in my comment is not a command I am typing myself. The dumb-jump package generates this command for us automatically. It is possible to customize the command it generates though. Indeed while running ripgrep manually, I do not use the --pcre2 option.

The main reason I switched from grep was ease of use. From the README: \"By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden files&#x2F;directories and binary files.\" Typing `rg search_term directory` is much better than the corresponding grep command, but the speed improvement is also a nice bonus.Random other helpful flag I use often is -M if any of the matches are way too long to read through and cause a lot of terminal chaos. Just add `-M 1000` or adjust the number for your needs and the really long matches will omit the text context in the results. reply hhda 17 hours agoparentYeah, the -M command is wonderful (super handy for ignoring minified files that you don&#x27;t want to see results from, etc), and also great is the -g command (eg `-g *.cs` and you&#x27;ll just search in files that have the .cs extension).Also the fact that it is a standalone portable executable can be super handy. Often when working on a new machine, I&#x27;ll drop in the executable and an alias for grep that points to rg, so if muscle memory kicks in and I type grep it will still use rg. reply 3PS 17 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re a fan of the -g flag to ripgrep then I also recommend checking out the -t flag, short for --type, which lets you search specific file types. You can see the full list with `rg --type-list`. For example, you could just search .cs files with `rg -tcs`.This flag is especially convenient if you want to search e.g. .yml and .yaml in one go, or .c and .h in one go, etc. reply hhda 16 hours agorootparentThanks, I didn&#x27;t know about `-t`, I&#x27;ll read up on it. reply kzrdude 16 hours agorootparentprev-t is useful but -g doesn&#x27;t require lookup in help first.

Never really bothered looking in help until I made the above comment. replyPaulDavisThe1st 19 hours agoprevAnd this may still be true in 2023, but the problem is that most of the parallelized grep replacements (e.g. ripgrep, ag, etc.) are SO much faster than grep that the much small speed differences between them doesn&#x27;t provide much of a basis for differentiating them.I use ag (typically from inside Emacs) on a 900k LOC codebase and it is effectively instantaneous (on a 16 core Ryzen Threadripper 2950X). I just don&#x27;t have a need to go from less than 1 second to \"a bit less than less than 1 second\".Speed is not the defining attribute of the \"new greps\" - they need to be assessed and compared in other ways. reply burntsushi 19 hours agoparentIn 2016, I&#x27;d say speed was definitely a defining attribute. ag has very significant performance cliffs. You can see them in the blog post.But as I mentioned in my comparison to qgrep elsewhere in the thread, everyone has different workloads. And for some workloads, perf differences might not matter. It really just depends. 900 KLOC isn&#x27;t that big, and indeed, for simple queries pretty much any non-naive grep is going to chew through it very very quickly.As for comparisons in other ways, at least for ag, it&#x27;s on life support. I thought it was going to get removed from Debian, but it looks like someone rescued it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.debian.org&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;bugreport.cgi?bug=999962The blog post also compares Unicode support, and contextualizes its performance. ag essentially has zero Unicode support.

But of course, now you need to setup and maintain an index. The UX isn&#x27;t quite as simple as \"just run a search.\"But there isn&#x27;t much of a mystery here. Someone might neglect to use qgrep for exactly the same reason that \"grep is fast enough for me\" might prevent someone from using ripgrep. And indeed, \"grep is fast enough\" is very much true in some non-trivial fraction of cases. There are many many searches in which you won&#x27;t be able to perceive the speed difference between ripgrep and grep, if any exists. And, analogously, the difference between qgrep and ripgrep. The cases I&#x27;m thinking of tend to be small haystacks. If you have only a small thing to search, then perhaps even the speed of a \"naive\" grep is fast enough.So if ripgrep, say, completes a search of the Linux kernel in under 100ms, is that annoying enough to push you towards a different kind of tool that uses indexing? Maybe, depends on what you&#x27;re doing. But probably not for standard interactive usage.This is my interpretation anyway of your wonderment of (in your words) \"why people forget the qgrep option.\" YMMV.I have flirted with the idea of adding indexing to ripgrep: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;ripgrep&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1497> this above all true UNLESS you need multi-line matches with UTF8, where ripgrep is not so fast, because it needs to fall back to the other PCRE2 libThat&#x27;s not true. Multiline searches certainly do not require PCRE2. I don&#x27;t know what you mean by \"with UTF8,\" but the default regex engine has Unicode support.PCRE2 is a fully optional dependency of ripgrep. You can build ripgrep without PCRE2 and it will still have multiline search support. reply thechao 19 hours agorootparentDoes `build.rs` build the project? One of my favorite (Big Corp) code-bases just had a single C file (build.c) that did all the dependency tracking, like, Make, but in some nicely written (easy to understand) C code.

The `build.rs` is basically a Cargo hook that gets compiled as a Rust program and executed just before the ripgrep binary is compiled.

Some programmers use it to search source code. Other people use it for other types of text searches that have nothing to do with source code, they rely on it in scripts, they don&#x27;t use it as part of a text-based programmer UI, they rely on it to never crash, etc.ripgrep is a specialist, opinionated tool, designed primarily to search through source code repositories.There&#x27;s not much you can add to general purpose text search to make it faster; you can make it use mmap() at the risk of it crashing on truncated files, you can reduce the expressiveness of regular expressions so they can be computed faster.

Another favorite of mine is `\\P{ascii}`, which will search for any codepoint that isn&#x27;t in the ASCII subset.Or more sophisticated filtering features that let you automatically respect things like gitignore rules.Those are all things that ripgrep does that grep does not. So I do not favor this explanation personally.ripgrep has just about all of the functionality that GNU grep does. I would say the two biggest missing pieces at this point are:* POSIX locale support. (But this might be a feature[1].)* Support for \"basic\" regexes or some equivalent that flips the escaping rules around. i.e., You need to write `\\+` to match 1 or more things, where as `+` will just match `+ literally.Otherwise, ripgrep has unfortunately grown just about as many flags as GNU grep.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mpv-player&#x2F;mpv&#x2F;commit&#x2F;1e70e82baa9193f6f02... reply gosub100 20 hours agoparentprevComplete guess: it works just fine for 99.9999% of users, but greater than (1-0.999999)% chance that it would break compatibility or have a bug.

I used to grep in small dirs, now I can I can ripgrep in my whole home, not that I do it, but I can.

Some lines may have both, but it isn&#x27;t required.The standard way to run \"AND\" queries is through shell pipelines. That is, `rg foorg bar` will only print lines containing both. But composition usually comes with costs. The output reverts to the standard grep format and it doesn&#x27;t interact nicely with contextual options like -C&#x2F;--context.See: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;ripgrep&#x2F;issues&#x2F;875 reply bhaak 18 hours agorootparentAs I have overloaded my rg with a customized rg alias, I can&#x27;t pipe multiple rg calls.Otherwise it would look like this: # rg nokogirirg linux :11:Gemfile.lock:647: nokogiri (1.15.5-x86_64-linux)But that is a me problem.The workaround is of course just to pipe into grep instead. reply burntsushi 18 hours agorootparentOr `\\rg`, which will use the command directly and skip your alias. reply bhaak 11 hours agorootparentOh, look at that.

I don&#x27;t HAVE a grep (because I don&#x27;t have a Unix) so when I install a grep, any grep, reaching for rg is natural. It&#x27;s modern and maintained. I have no scripts anywhere that might expect grep to be called \"grep\".Of course if you already have a grep (e.g. you run Unix&#x2F;Linux) then the story is different. Your system probably already has a grep. Replacing it takes effort and that effort needs to have some return. reply Ferret7446 37 minutes agorootparentYou can alias `grep` to `gr` or even `rg`. Installing a whole entire different program just to type a shorter name is a crazy contrived justification.I imagine a lot of devs have grep preinstalled.

Like it wouldn&#x27;t just be slow, the web server that was running on it would literally stop serving requests while it was grepping.I never worked out how that could be happening. reply burntsushi 20 hours agorootparentMy best guess is your grep search was saturating I&#x2F;O bandwidth, which slowed everything else to a crawl.Another possibility is that your grep search was hogging up your system&#x27;s memory. That might make it swap. On my systems which do not have swap enabled but do have overcommit enabled, I experience out-of-memory conditions as my system essentially freezing for some period of time until Linux&#x27;s OOM-killer kicks in and kills the offending process.I would say the first is more likely than the second. In order for grep to hog up memory, you need to be searching some pretty specific kinds of files. A simple log file probably won&#x27;t do it. But... a big binary file? Sure: grep -a burntsushi &#x2F;proc&#x2F;self&#x2F;pagemapDon&#x27;t try that one at home kids. You&#x27;ve been warned. (ripgrep should suffer the same fate.)(There are other reasons for a system to lock up, but the above two are the ones that are pretty common for me. Well, in the past anyway.

The author is brilliant‡, but extremely prickly (sometimes even to paying customers). The author of ripgrep, on the other hand, has always seemed like someone who just wants to get on with the business of writing software that people use.‡ The main commercial product of the ugrep author&#x27;s company at the time was the gSOAP code generator (it may still be), and that it not only works but makes a reasonably good C and C++ API from WSDL is proof that it is the product of a genius madman. It also allowed you to create both the API and WSDL from a C++-ish header, and both .NET and Java WSDL tools worked perfectly with it. We needed it to work and work it did.At the time, the generated API was just difficult enough to use that I generated another ~1k lines of code for that project. IIRC, the generated API is sort of handle-based, which requires a slightly different approach than the strict RAII approach we were using. Generating that code was a minor adventure (generating the gSOAP code from the header-ish file, generating doxygen XML from the generated gSOAP code, then generating the wrapper C++ from the doxygen XML). reply GuB-42 20 hours agorootparentprevPsst, don&#x27;t tell him about emacs and vi(m)...There are feuds about open source tools all the time.

The way I like to characterize `git grep` (at present) is that it has sharp performance cliffs. ripgrep has them too, to be sure, but I think it has fewer of them.If you&#x27;re just searching for a simple literal, `git grep` is decently fast: $ git remote -v origin git@github.com:torvalds&#x2F;linux (fetch) origin git@github.com:torvalds&#x2F;linux (push) $ git rev-parse HEAD f1fcbaa18b28dec10281551dfe6ed3a3ed80e3d6 $ time LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -c -E &#x27;PM_RESUME&#x27; Documentation&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:3 Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_CN&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:3 Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_TW&#x2F;sparse.txt:3 arch&#x2F;arm&#x2F;mach-omap2&#x2F;omap-secure.h:1 arch&#x2F;arm&#x2F;mach-omap2&#x2F;pm33xx-core.c:1 arch&#x2F;x86&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;apm_32.c:1 drivers&#x2F;input&#x2F;mouse&#x2F;cyapa.h:1 drivers&#x2F;mtd&#x2F;maps&#x2F;pcmciamtd.c:1 drivers&#x2F;net&#x2F;wireless&#x2F;intersil&#x2F;hostap&#x2F;hostap_cs.c:1 drivers&#x2F;net&#x2F;wwan&#x2F;t7xx&#x2F;t7xx_pci.c:15 drivers&#x2F;net&#x2F;wwan&#x2F;t7xx&#x2F;t7xx_reg.h:7 drivers&#x2F;usb&#x2F;mtu3&#x2F;mtu3_hw_regs.h:1 include&#x2F;uapi&#x2F;linux&#x2F;apm_bios.h:1 real 0.215 user 0.421 sys 1.226 maxmem 161 MB faults 0 $ time rg -c &#x27;PM_RESUME&#x27; drivers&#x2F;mtd&#x2F;maps&#x2F;pcmciamtd.c:1 drivers&#x2F;net&#x2F;wwan&#x2F;t7xx&#x2F;t7xx_reg.h:7 drivers&#x2F;net&#x2F;wwan&#x2F;t7xx&#x2F;t7xx_pci.c:15 drivers&#x2F;net&#x2F;wireless&#x2F;intersil&#x2F;hostap&#x2F;hostap_cs.c:1 drivers&#x2F;usb&#x2F;mtu3&#x2F;mtu3_hw_regs.h:1 drivers&#x2F;input&#x2F;mouse&#x2F;cyapa.h:1 arch&#x2F;x86&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;apm_32.c:1 Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_CN&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:3 Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_TW&#x2F;sparse.txt:3 Documentation&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:3 arch&#x2F;arm&#x2F;mach-omap2&#x2F;pm33xx-core.c:1 arch&#x2F;arm&#x2F;mach-omap2&#x2F;omap-secure.h:1 include&#x2F;uapi&#x2F;linux&#x2F;apm_bios.h:1 real 0.078 user 0.259 sys 0.577 maxmem 15 MB faults 0But if you switch it up and start adding regex things to your pattern, there can be substantial slowdowns: $ time LC_ALL=C git grep -c -E &#x27;\\w{5,}\\s+PM_RESUME&#x27; Documentation&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:1 Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_CN&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:1 Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_TW&#x2F;sparse.txt:1 real 5.704 user 55.671 sys 0.585 maxmem 207 MB faults 0 $ time LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -c -E &#x27;\\w{5,}\\s+PM_RESUME&#x27; Documentation&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:1 Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_CN&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:1 Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_TW&#x2F;sparse.txt:1 real 24.529 user 4:34.42 sys 0.753 maxmem 211 MB faults 0 $ time LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -c -P &#x27;\\w{5,}\\s+PM_RESUME&#x27; Documentation&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:1 Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_CN&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:1 Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_TW&#x2F;sparse.txt:1 real 1.372 user 16.980 sys 0.647 maxmem 211 MB faults 1 $ time rg -c &#x27;\\w{5,}\\s+PM_RESUME&#x27; Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_CN&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:1 Documentation&#x2F;dev-tools&#x2F;sparse.rst:1 Documentation&#x2F;translations&#x2F;zh_TW&#x2F;sparse.txt:1 real 0.082 user 0.226 sys 0.612 maxmem 18 MB faults 0In the above cases, ripgrep has Unicode enabled.

I use `git grep -IPn --color=always --recurse-submodules` many times a day, every day. I hasn&#x27;t yet let me down, but I don&#x27;t search for unicode when working on source code. I do use regex though, using the -P switch. reply kzrdude 16 hours agorootparentprevgit grep is shallow: only current git repo, rg is fully recursive, all submodules and also untracked (and not ignored) directories.In some trees, git grep will be a lot faster because it searches a smaller part of it. reply ctenb 16 hours agorootparentNo, git grep can recurse, if you pass the flag, just like all other git commands. --recurse-submodules reply masklinn 22 hours agoparentprevI don’t think there’s been a point to using `git grep` since ack started parsing gitignore. As far as I’m concerned the use case of `git grep` is to search into non-checked-out trees (by giving it a tree-ish). And it’s not super great at that, because it searches a static tree-ish, so pickaxe filters are generally more useful (though they’re slow).Once again mercurial has&#x2F;had more useful defaults, `hg grep` searches through the history by default, that’s it’s job. reply burntsushi 20 hours agorootparentSmall clarification: ack did not and does not respect your gitignore files. I just tried it myself, and indeed it doesn&#x27;t. And this is consistent with the feature chart maintained by the author of ack: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beyondgrep.com&#x2F;feature-comparison&#x2F;One practical result of this is that it will mean `ack` will be quite slow when searching typical checkouts of Node.js or Rust projects, because it won&#x27;t automatically ignore the `node_modules` or `target` directories. In both cases, those directories can become enormous.`ack` will ignore things like `.git` by default though.I believe `ag` was the first widely used grep-like tool that attempted to respect your .gitignore files automatically. (Besides, of course, `git grep`. But `git grep` behaves a little differently. It only searches what is tracked in the repo, and that may or may not be in sync with the rules in your gitignores.) reply ctenb 2 hours agorootparentYou can also pass a flag to git grep to ignore the index (--no-index), which makes it search untracked files as well reply shmerl 13 hours agoprevFeels like it should always be included by default on grep level now. reply nvoeiah 22 hours agoprev [2 more] [flagged] WJW 22 hours agoparent [–] So?

    "originBody": "Toggle navigation Home RSS Feed Comments Archive (1679) Author + Links Marco Tech Blog November 28, 2023 Turbo Pascal turns 40 Turbo Pascal was introduced by Borland in November 1983. It's officially turning 40 years old this month. Turbo Pascal was a milestone product for the industry, it started Borland as a company and it was the first popular Integrated Development Environment or IDE. It was a great product for the time, and its success was incredible. You can read more about Turbo Pascal it in this recent blog post from David I, but also on Wikipedia and many other sources including blog posts of mine, including the talk I did this summer in the first Pascal World Congress in Salamanca. At Embarcadero, the company continuing working on the successors of Turbo Pascal, we just shipped version 36 of that compiler. In fact when you read \"Embarcadero Delphi for Win32 compiler version 36.0\" (the version of the command line compiler in Delphi 12 Athens) the compiler version number, 36, dates back to the first Turbo Pascal. Not only that, we decided to dedicate the product Easter Egg to this great anniversary. Happy 40th birthday, Turbo Pascal! posted by marcocantu @ 4:17PM5 Comments [0 Pending] 5 Comments Turbo Pascal turns 40 In the early days, compilers were mostly a pain, interpreted basic was slow and awful. The editors were bad, the tools were limited to batch files. Turbo Pascal was so fast, compiling and runtime, and it was so easy to edit, compile and run. Later, forgot what version, the ability to run assembler code was a big upgrade. One of my favorite tools of all time!

And I still believe that until now it is one of the main reasons I went into programming. Happy 40 Turbo Pascal! Comment by Elias Bourgess [https://ebourgess.dev] on November 29, 07:31 Turbo Pascal turns 40 You are right, we Pascal uses semicolons as statement separator, not as a statement terminator like curly brace languages.

It was a quircky text-mode game with puzzles, shooting, and so on. It had a built-in game editor that came even with the free shareware version, and it even had a little programming language called ZZT-OOP.ZZT&#x27;s original source code was lost. Years later, Adrian Siekierka painstakingly reverse-engineered the original Pascal code till -- when compiled with the original version of Turbo Pascal -- produced a byte-for-byte identical executable.

I remember spending hundreds of German marks on a license for Borland Pascal 7.0 and later Delphi 1.0 and 2.0. I ended up developing my first “commercial” software that I sold for money.In the DOS era, Turbo Pascal was probably the easiest way to get into programming, outside of Basic. And on Windows 3.1&#x2F;95, Delphi was eye-opening how easy GUI programming could be.In many ways, I feel like we have gone backwards from there. How was it possible for the Turbo Pascal &#x2F; Delphi compiler to produce a small binary for a fully-featured GUI program when today similarly powerful software is orders of magnitude larger in size? reply ReleaseCandidat 55 minutes agoparent> fully-featured GUI program when today similarly powerful software is orders of magnitude larger in size?That&#x27;s because the \"fully featured\" of the 90s would be barely usable today. Or to rephrase: the frameworks and programs of today are not \"similarly powerful\" to the ones from the mid 90s, even if you just recompiled the app from 25 years ago with the current version of your framework (theoretically ;), it would gain support for unicode (codepages where just...), internationalization, accessability, support for networks (who still knows Novell?),... . Except for SAP, they somehow succeeded at combining the user-hostileness of the 90&#x27;s UIs with the resource consumption of contemporary programs ;).Turbo Pascal had been the language I used after BASIC, with which I started. reply ivan_gammel 1 hour agoparentprevThere was at least one elephant missing in that executable - Unicode support. It would not fit into PC RAM back then probably. reply doubloon 7 hours agoprevThe main thing I recall about TP was that it came with simple, easy to understand code examples for every function that were organized logically and easy to find and use. So as a teenager who barely understood basic I could teach myself TP without the internet, just using the IDE.So many modern systems do not have anything even close to this. I wonder if its inherent in the nature of the simpler x86 DOS based systems of the time, where its simply impossible with modern pace of change, cross-platform needs, and complexity to have something like that. reply vanderZwan 6 hours agoparentProcessing (P5) had this: you can select any string of text in its IDE anl search for it in the docs, and if it&#x27;s one of the built-in functions or constants it will open the associated static html page that came installed with the software, so no internet nor server required. And despite being offline you can still navigate the docs too. This feels a lost basic skill in static site generation these days.It was the only creative coding framework that had complete, offline documentation like that at the time I might add. OpenFrameworks is still mostly autogenerated stubs for example.IMO it was one of the things that gave Processing an edge in educational contexts over all alternatives. I was pretty sad to see p5.js not fully continue that tradition and require that you go online to read the docs, and that it&#x27;s not a static website but that text is rendered with javascript when you open it (still complete and with examples though).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;processing.org&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p5js.org&#x2F; reply enraged_camel 3 hours agorootparentYou speak in past tense but isn’t Processing still in use?

The latest release, 4.3, is from July 26, 2023.Although I think that p5.js is growing faster, as it&#x27;s more accessible (browser IDE, not typed) and the artworks are easier to distribute online. reply vanderZwan 48 minutes agorootparentprevIt is, but I haven&#x27;t used it in a long time so didn&#x27;t want to imply anything about the current implementation, since I don&#x27;t know if anything changed in the last decade. I hope it&#x27;s still as good as I remember! reply ReleaseCandidat 43 minutes agoparentprev> I wonder if its inherent in the nature of the simpler x86 DOS based systems of the timeI also learned Turbo Pascal without any books (I had a Basic book, because that came with the computer). But it was way easier. Drawing pixels was as easy as just selecting your (double buffered!) display mode and, well drawing pixels. Same with the reading of e.g. the joystick port or the mouse, you&#x27;d just read it. reply hulitu 2 hours agoparentprevThis was true also for TurboC.Today, good luck looking for examples. reply geoelectric 10 hours agoprevTurbo Pascal was the first \"real\" programming language I learned past 6809E ASM, structured basic flavors and batch&#x2F;shell back in the very late 80s. When I went to college for CS in the early 90s, they were still teaching the first year of classes in Borland Pascal so that turned out to be very useful experience.A few years later, my Pascal background sailed me into a half-decade stint as a custom app dev working with Delphi. That, in turn, led to a job at Borland testing the Kylix and C++Builder IDEs. Good times.I still miss Delphi. Nowadays it&#x27;s normal to have IDE plugins to the point it&#x27;s a dealbreaker if they don&#x27;t exist. But at the time the idea of a component library and coding environment that was easily extensible in its own language was pure magic. I had so much fun playing with both VCL and the IDE itself.It&#x27;s a shame Borland left the grassroots devs behind in their quest for the enterprise market, and more or less killed any growth in community adoption. It was a really cool setup, at least through Delphi 7 or so. reply upupupandaway 3 hours agoparentIn my country Delphi was the most popular dev environment by a mile. It was really bizarre, with most of the world going for VB 5 and we in Delphi. It always seemed to me like a fantastic environment but for some reason it only took off in a couple of markets (my perception as an outsider). reply mmgutz 10 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s close to the route I took, although I switched to Visual Basic 5 later on no thanks to job opportunities. Still don&#x27;t feel anything rivals Delphi for GUI development. VCL was genius. reply blorenz 11 hours agoprevMy first exposure to TP was when I pirated it off a warez BBS in the winter of 93 at the age of 14. The raw power I felt when I compiled my own EXE in contrast to running just a .BAS file was enthralling! I started modding Renegade BBS and writing door programs. I tried to, unsuccessfully, create worms, Trojans and viruses. It changed my life and set me on a course for where I am in tech today. Moreover I’m reformed my deviant teenage tendencies. I owe Borland a lot. reply technothrasher 11 hours agoparentAh, the good old BBS days. I wrote a door library for Turbo Pascal back in &#x27;89 when I was 17 after I learned how to write an interrupt based serial driver, and then released it as shareware. It saw quite a bit of use until the mid-90&#x27;s when the BBS scene fell off a cliff. reply dual_dingo 3 hours agoparentprevThat throws me back. Being a teenager without any real understanding of compilers, interpreters etc., being able to create my own EXE file in TP4 felt like having superpowers - like being a real(TM) programmer :)A few years later at 16, I actually got paid for developing a small app for managing my dad&#x27;s customers, paid by the company he worked for. Part of that money went into getting a legal version of TP6.Good times :) reply thsksbd 5 hours agoparentprev\"I owe Borland a lot.\"A belated license to be exact :P reply deepspace 5 hours agorootparentI pirated Turbo Pascal back in the day because I was a poor student in a Third World country and there was no way I could afford it. Ditto Turbo C.After I started working, I had a hand in selecting Borland C++ as our in-house development platform, and we paid Borland a fortune in licensing fees. Which would have gone to Intel or another company if it were not for my, and other folks in my cohort&#x27;s experience with pirated Borland products as students.There is a lesson in there, somewhere. reply usrusr 1 hour agorootparentThe lesson is that piracy (and to an only slightly lesser extent, free student licences) was an extremely powerful tool to keep a tool market cornered: impossible to compete on price when piracy is so ubiquitous that payment is essentially opt-in.(I had a mouse driver disc, 5.25, that wasn&#x27;t pirated, it felt like something from a parallel universe with its machine-printed label) reply actionfromafar 1 hour agorootparentA deliberate strategy by some companies. (Microsoft comes to mind.( reply omgmajk 1 hour agorootparentprevI really wonder when all this changed. I seem to have this idea, that I share with many others that software houses back in the day explicitly didn&#x27;t care much about piracy because it got people hooked on their software and in the end enterprise would foot the bill.I&#x27;m not sure how true this was, as I&#x27;ve yet to see any real official sources speaking about this myself but it seems like it was like that. But most of my thoughts about this comes from being in the piracy space back in the days so I really have no idea if this was ever a real thing or not. reply msmith 10 hours agoparentprevI had a similar experience in the same era. In addition to the deviant stuff I also used it to tinker with graphics programming using inline assembly for the “performance critical” (for a 386SX) parts. That experience definitely laid the foundation for what I do today. reply livrem 2 hours agoprevI almost coded some Turbo Pascal earlier this year. I found the source code for one of the (not so great) games I (tried to) write in Turbo Pascal 2.0 as a kid. Had fun porting it to the latest stable Free Pascal. Never used Free Pascal before and was quite impressed. Well documented, stable, amazing cross-platform. Supports everything from creating 16-bit DOS COM-files to various modern 64-bit platforms and JS. reply JKCalhoun 7 hours agoprevWeirdly, Turbo Pascal was my first high-level programming language and it was on my Macintosh Plus. (I have come to find Turbo Pascal was more of a PC thing.)In college I used a student loan to buy my first Apple computer, the Macintosh Plus. By chance there was a classified ad in the college newspaper for a copy of Turbo Pascal for the Mac — some professor was selling it for like $40 or something. I snagged it.It had the manual, thankfully, but very simply tools for Macintosh development. No ResEdit, but the odd R-Maker app that expected you to create a Macintosh resource as a text file and then run it through the tool to create the resource fork.My first few apps were Turbo Pascal implementations of algorithms from the Computer Recreations column of Scientific American (thankfully requiring little UI — a window and a few buttons typically).Later I would learn of and move on to THINK Pascal — a much more Mac-centric IDE. Later still I would take the leap to THINK C....But I will always look back on Turbo Pascal and remember it with fondness. It was a time when I was entering a wild new world and Turbo Pascal was there to hold the door open for me. reply zozbot234 11 hours agoprevFree Pascal still has a look-a-like of the original TP IDE! But that code is bitrotting by their own admission (it still relies extensively on obsolete quirks of the original MS-DOS platform) and it&#x27;s sad that we don&#x27;t have a look-a-like version that can work as a general editor in the terminal (like neovim or emacs) and integrate with modern IDE-oriented facilities like the LSP, tree-sitter parsers or the debug adapter protocol.

The same way Emacs can be an IDE for C that you&#x27;ll compile with GCC.I know, Delphi effectively replaced Turbo Pascal from the Borland side, even though Delphi could have been \"just\" an add-on to Turbo. They just didn&#x27;t take that route. reply agys 19 minutes agoprevI learnt to program and to animate sprites with Turbo Pascal!Later on me and a bunch of friends programmed a Sokoban-clone called “Project S” for MS-DOS: it used the graphics mode “X” for smooth scrolling; we even bought a commercial .mod player library for the sound effects and background music. reply jbgreer 9 hours agoprevI transitioned from Apple Pascal (based on UCSC p-system Pascal) on the Apple ][+ amd &#x2F;&#x2F;e to Turbo Pascal on DOS in the early 80s. Turbo Pascal was a blast: the very quick compiler, good feedback, colorful editor, and use of the Wordstar keybindings, which I already knew, made for a great experience.I recall writing programs large enough to require use of the overlay facility, which essentially let you page in different parts of your program under DOS.I also recall meeting David Intersimone, a great ambassador of Borland, sometime in the 80s - might have been later 80s - when he visited my university as a guest of the local ACM chapter. reply neilv 12 hours agoprevWhen I was a kid, a kindly computer store owner (who also made me a great deal on an PC-semi-compatible running MS-DOS 1.25, for approx. a hundred lawns mowed and babies sat) sold me a copy of Turbo Pascal for generic MS-DOS (no PC BIOS assumed) on 8\" floppy. He transferred it to the 160KB 5.25\" format that my semi-compatible used.I hope I was appreciative enough at the time, as I am now. That helped bootstrap my career. reply CoastalCoder 11 hours agoparentOkay, I&#x27;ll bite :)What&#x27;s this \"PC-semi-compatible\" of which you speak? reply whartung 9 hours agorootparentBack in the early days, MS-DOS was very much like CP&#x2F;M in that there were several different 8088 machines. The “PC Compatible” hadn’t quite exploded yet, so MS-DOS (and CP&#x2F;M 86) compatibility was enough.But soon, Flight Simulator became the benchmark for compatibility, and I think the final nail was that Lotus 1-2-3 required an actual PC compatible machine. That plus the rise of clone BIOSs pretty much ended the brief era of generic, 8088, non-PC compatible machines, save for niche domains.An interesting artifact of this era was when Steve Ciarcia of BYTE magazine released his 8088 board, and it was not PC compatible.

Even the key combination, I think it was, would halt a lot of programs. This was in the DOS days when programs had a lot more control over the system.My experience with Pascal was my first experience with a procedural language. Before that I had been writing BASIC.

They were comparing it to writing spaghetti code with GOTOs everywhere in BASICA, so no wonder their code seemed more reliable. Nowadays, the jump in reliability comes from strong and helpful type systems, not structured programming. Ada still seems good there, but Pascal is just an ordinary programming language. reply adamwiggins 1 hour agoprevI&#x27;ll join the chorus here and say that Turbo Pascal was my stepping stone from beginner tinkering (BASIC on Apple II and DOS) to professional development with C.

Being the \"hackers\" that we were, we downloaded the original version of nethack (early rogue offshoot) off of a BBS with our 1200 baud modems, brought it to school on 5 1&#x2F;4\" disks, loaded it onto the hard drives, and started playing it while the teacher sat at the front of the room with her nose buried in the book, trying to figure out how to learn enough Pascal to offer instruction. Unfortunately, after a while, these mysterious black rectangles started randomly appearing on the screen, and the PCs started experiencing performance issues. Nobody could figure it out. After many months, it was determined that we had infected all of the computer with the Jerusalem virus (in 1988!). Soon after, a school-wide prohibition on installing your own software was implemented (though not followed). reply myth_drannon 8 hours agoprevI&#x27;m currently reading \"Assembly Language Step-By-Step\" by Jeff Duntemann from 1992. In it, he calls TP \"moron friendly\" (unlike Assembly). Also something like Sears Catalog fallacy, \"where you go hunting through veritable Sears catalog of toolbox products looking like: SearchDataFileForFirstRecordBeginningWithStringAndDisplayInRed Basically, this method glues other people&#x27;s canned procedures into programs...\"30 years ago they had the same complaints like we have today reply blame-troi 11 hours agoprevwe had Turbo, JRT, and UCSD back at my first job out of college.

How come ? reply qznc 11 hours agoparentNiklaus Wirth (Pascal inventor) had the rule that compiler speed must never regress. So if you add an optimization (which means the compiler has to do more work), the optimization must \"pay for itself\" and make the compiler faster.That philosophy probably seeped into Turbo Pascal to some degree. reply kant2002 7 hours agorootparentThat’s very interesting. I see similar attitude in the C# JIT&#x2F;Roslyn developers where they take this very seriously. Interesting are this is influenced by Anders, or just whole thing tick for a lot of compiler developers? reply stg22 10 hours agoparentprevAlso, Pascal is a direct descendant of a very, very old language (ALGOL-58 from 1958). In the 1950s, HLL compilation was at the extreme edge of what computers were capable of doing and a key goal of language design was (or should have been - cough COBOL cough) to make it as efficient as possible.By the time Ken Thompson was designing languages, hardware had improved a lot and he could make compilation efficiency a lower priority. reply giancarlostoro 12 hours agoparentprevMy understanding is the compiler was insanely efficient and parts of it coded in assembly if I&#x27;m not mistaken. reply ale42 12 hours agorootparentI think that the question was rather why it took 25 seconds to the current compiler to compile an Hello world on a contemporary computer...

    "title": "Yabai: A Tiling Window Manager for macOS",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai",
    "originBody": "Tiling window management for the Mac. About yabai is a window management utility that is designed to work as an extension to the built-in window manager of macOS. yabai allows you to control your windows, spaces and displays freely using an intuitive command line interface and optionally set user-defined keyboard shortcuts using ↗ skhd and other third-party software. The primary function of yabai is tiling window management; automatically modifying your window layout using a binary space partitioning algorithm to allow you to focus on the content of your windows without distractions. Additional features of yabai include focus-follows-mouse, disabling animations for switching spaces, creating spaces past the limit of 16 spaces, and much more. Installation and Configuration The ↗ yabai wiki has both brief and detailed installation instructions for multiple installation methods, and also explains how to uninstall yabai completely. Sample configuration files can be found in the ↗ examples directory. Refer to the ↗ documentation or the wiki for further information. Keyboard shortcuts can be defined with ↗ skhd or any other suitable software you may prefer. Requirements and Caveats Please read the below requirements carefully. Make sure you fulfil all of them before filing an issue. Requirement Note Operating System Intel x86-64 Big Sur 11.0.0+, Monterey 12.0.0+, Ventura 13.0.0+, and Sonoma 14.0.0 is supported. Operating System Apple Silicon Monterey 12.0.0+, Ventura 13.0.0+, and Sonoma 14.0.0 is supported. Accessibility API yabai must be given permission to utilize the Accessibility API and will request access upon launch. The application must be restarted after access has been granted. Screen Recording yabai must be given Screen Recording permission if and only if you want to enable window animations, and will request access when necessary. The application must be restarted after access has been granted. System Preferences (macOS 11.x, 12.x) In the Mission Control pane, the setting \"Displays have separate Spaces\" must be enabled. System Settings (macOS 13.x, 14.x) In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Mission Control pane, the setting \"Displays have separate Spaces\" must be enabled. Please also take note of the following caveats. Caveat Note System Integrity Protection (Optional) System Integrity Protection can be (partially) disabled for yabai to inject a scripting addition into Dock.app for controlling windows with functions that require elevated privileges. This enables control of the window server, which is the sole owner of all window connections, and enables additional features of yabai. Code Signing When building from source (or installing from HEAD), it is necessary to codesign the binary so it retains its accessibility and automation privileges when updated or rebuilt. System Preferences (macOS 11.x, 12.x) In the Mission Control pane, the setting \"Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\" should be disabled for commands that rely on the ordering of spaces to work reliably. System Settings (macOS 13.x, 14.x) In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Mission Control pane, the setting \"Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\" should be disabled for commands that rely on the ordering of spaces to work reliably. System Settings (macOS 14.x) In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Desktop & Stage Manager pane, the setting \"Show Items On Desktop\" should be enabled for display and space focus commands to work reliably in multi-display configurations. System Settings (macOS 14.x) In the Desktop & Dock tab, inside the Desktop & Stage Manager pane, the setting \"Click wallpaper to reveal Desktop\" should be set to \"Only in Stage Manager\" for display and space focus commands to work reliably.

    "commentBody": "Yabai – A tiling window manager for macOSHacker NewspastloginYabai – A tiling window manager for macOS (github.com/koekeishiya) 276 points by CathalMullan 19 hours ago| hidepastfavorite195 comments xwowsersx 18 hours agoFunny to see this at the top of HN after just having uninstalled Yabai. I used Yabai for about 6 weeks. I was so thrilled about having a proper tiling window manager for Mac. I invested a lot of time setting up skhd and fine-tuning my configuration for the most intuitive hotkeys. The problem ultimately, however, is that Yabai just doesn&#x27;t work well enough. It&#x27;ll regularly just lose track of windows altogether, which requires restarting Yabai. This and other bugs happened frequently enough that it outweighed the benefits of Yabai. I&#x27;d be more than willing to try another tiling window manager on Mac if there&#x27;s one out there that truly works. Related, I started checking out Stage Manager and it&#x27;s pretty bad in my experience - obviously it&#x27;s the opposite of a keyboard driven TWM, but I&#x27;m willing to try anything that helps me maximize the limited screen space I have. I&#x27;m all ears if anyone has had better experiences with other tools on Mac. reply CSSer 18 hours agoparentYou might try Magnet. It&#x27;s $10 on the mac app store. I&#x27;ve had zero issues with it, and it has some problems sorted that other tools don&#x27;t or haven&#x27;t always, namely correctly tiling across monitors. I used to use Rectangle, which is open source and frankly pretty good but at the time I was using it had some warts. macOS&#x27; window management seems to not be entirely transparent. I don&#x27;t know all the details, but this is my workstation. I need(ed) this to work now, and if it&#x27;s a system that might change a bit over time or has some weird idiosyncrasies then I&#x27;m happily willing to pay a low one-time fee for a tool like this. reply rxhanson 17 hours agorootparentIf you don&#x27;t mind me asking, what are the warts? I&#x27;m always interested in improving the app. reply dishsoap 12 hours agorootparentOne difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that with Magnet, if you have a window &#x27;maximized&#x27; by dragging it into the top of the screen or pressing the shortcut for it, when you start dragging it down from the top of the screen to unmaximize it, it instantly returns to its original size, whereas with Rectangle it stays maximized for some time after you start dragging it which is pretty annoying.Another thing is the way Magnet moves and resizes windows seems to create less visual &#x27;flashing&#x27; than Rectangle&#x27;s method, for instance Rectangle will resize, then move, then resize again when maximizing a window, which can create a really pronounced &#x27;flashing&#x27; effect. That&#x27;s not to say Magnet has no &#x27;flashing&#x27; ever, there&#x27;s certain situations where it does and to my understanding it seems necessary due to the limited nature of moving and resizing windows on macOS (I guess you have to do one then the other and can&#x27;t both move and resize simultaneously?), but to me Magnet&#x27;s methods often look visually better.Rectangle is great though, I&#x27;ve switched to it from Magnet and these are just some minor gripes. reply rxhanson 8 hours agorootparentGood to know! I&#x27;m surprised that Magnet has any improvement over Rectangle in these areas, since Rectangle isn&#x27;t really adding any overhead to the Accessibility API commands, but I&#x27;ll have to investigate. reply emgeee 15 hours agorootparentprevRectangle Pro user here -- biggest frustration I&#x27;ve had is configuration. While the GUI is nice for seeing all the options and some basic stuff, when it comes to actually configuring App Layouts it&#x27;s been a nightmare of clicking around. I went so far as to export my config so I could modify it with a text editor and then re-import it but the config itself includes serialized JSON as values so to accomplish what I wanted to I had to de-serialize the json, make the changes I wanted to, re-serialize it, then re-import it back into Rectangle, all while hoping I didn&#x27;t mess up the re-serialization step. This ended up taking more time than if I had just painfully clicked through the interface.Personally, I wish Rectangle had the option of storing configuration in a simple dot file in my home dir but I understand that would prevent syncing through icloud, which is a feature I imagine a lot of folks like. Barring that, I wish rectangle could export&#x2F;import the configuration in a more editor friendly way so I could make these configuration changes much faster and more easily ensure consistency across settings. reply rxhanson 8 hours agorootparentThanks for the feedback! I agree and have had some ideas for improving this - one of them being copy&#x2F;paste and drag behavior where you could copy a selection in Rectangle Pro and paste it as prettified JSON in an editor, and vice-versa. The dot file idea is also one that I like - it&#x27;s just a surprisingly large effort to \"do it right\". Making UI&#x27;s for representing this complexity is kind of tricky, and what&#x27;s there now is actually my first cut - something that I figured I would iterate on but haven&#x27;t gotten the time together to do it. reply Bagged2347 16 hours agorootparentprevAre you the Rectangle dev? I appreciate your work! How did you get into developing tools for macOS? Were you filling your own needs? reply rxhanson 8 hours agorootparentGlad you like my software! A long time ago, I had some RSI issues that were alleviated by using the Magic Trackpad, and this led me to create the Multitouch app[0] to add a bit more functionality to the Magic Trackpad. From there I wanted to add in window management, and ended up rewriting Spectacle as Rectangle. I feel really lucky to have people enjoying the things I&#x27;ve built![0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;multitouch.app reply CSSer 16 hours agorootparentprevYou know, honestly I don&#x27;t recall. From what I do remember, I had checked the repo and I believe it was something you were working on but it was going to require a really big lift. I wanted to be very charitable with you in my above comment. I used Rectangle for a decent amount of time and overall it was pretty great. I only switched because of a time&#x2F;money consideration, not because of a vote of no confidence, which is not something I can always say. Keep up the great work! reply TimTheTinker 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve been using Magnet for years. It&#x27;s simple and reliable. reply j45 18 hours agorootparentHas anyone transitioned from moom to magnet? reply spike021 8 hours agorootparentprevI love magnet as well, have used it probably most of the last few jobs I&#x27;ve worked. The hot keys can be a little tricky to learn at first but after that it&#x27;s a snap (heh). reply aryik 17 hours agorootparentprevMagnet rocks. Very worth paying for. I hate using Macs without it reply rwc 18 hours agorootparentprevActually, only $5. reply newsereure 17 hours agorootparentprevI just bought this, but I don&#x27;t see an option for automatic tiling? reply artdigital 10 hours agorootparentIt can’t do automatic tiling, it’s a window snapping&#x2F;resizing app reply thinker5555 18 hours agoparentprevI haven&#x27;t had the same experience with Yabai. I&#x27;ve been using it happily and without issue since April, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had to restart it once.Before Yabai I was using Amethyst, but like your experience with Yabai, I felt like it would suddenly stop working and needed to be restarted. Maybe your experience would be flipped.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ianyh&#x2F;Amethyst reply chaxor 18 hours agorootparentI tried amethyst but it was essentially useless to emulate an awesomewm or sway like experience.Switching to asahilinux was a *far* better solution. Not really sure what the use of macOS for me is when asahi exists now. reply koiueo 13 hours agorootparentIs Asahi your daily driver on MBP? reply rufugee 12 hours agorootparentCurious about this as well...I thought it wasn&#x27;t quite there as a daily driver OS, but would be happy to be wrong ;-) reply Bombinator 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s usable if you can live with some small annoying inconveniences last I tried. I can&#x27;t remember if there were more inconveniences but what bugged me the most was that the touchpad was too sensitive compared to MacOS, it seemed to register accidental touches on the edges more and accidental taps were easier. I tried figuring out if this is fixable with libinput or hwdb but eventually gave up. Also the shortcuts with Command key are way more convenient than the ctrl ones but this probably is configurable somehow. Some Java programs had scaling issues but that can be configured to work properly. Battery life was a bit worse I think, this is with the GPU drivers and no video playback, just regular browsing. Oh and external monitor support isn&#x27;t there, I do use this sometimes on MacOS. reply chaxor 12 hours agorootparentprevYes, absolutely.Asahilinux >> MacOSIt&#x27;s wonderful to use the M2 with incredible battery life and performance without having to have a subpar OS. reply darkteflon 8 hours agorootparentCan I ask: is setting up dual-boot trivial? I’d love to check it out but can’t ditch MacOS entirely. reply stefandesu 3 hours agorootparentAFAIK dual boot is currently the only way to use Asahi on Apple Silicon Macs. reply darthrupert 3 hours agorootparentprevThe installation process sets it up to you. You&#x27;d have to do more work to not have dual-boot (unless there was a setting in the installer that I forgot). reply rufugee 7 hours agorootparentprevIs there anything that doesn&#x27;t work for you? reply darthrupert 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not parent, but from my quick foray into (Fedora) Asahi on a Macbook Air M2, I at least noticed USB-C connection to my monitor and USB router behind it not working at all. There&#x27;s something Mac-specific going on there, because from my x86-based linux laptop, this usually works fine. replyRCitronsBroker 17 hours agorootparentprevsame here! using yabai on my MacOS machines for about a year now, after being similarly disappointed with amethyst. Works pretty damn good for me, its a god send for me. It is part of the myriad of tweaks that make MacOS so damn good and unique to me. reply extr 18 hours agoparentprevHave you heard of Phoenix [1]? It seems relatively unknown but I actually found it to work better than Yabai in some ways. The gist is that it basically simulates a tiling wm and virtual desktops by internally tracking state. This also means it doesn&#x27;t suffer from window animation delays when you switch \"desktops\" (since \"desktops\" are just hiding&#x2F;unhiding windows). It&#x27;s also highly hackable&#x2F;extensible being written in JS. Spin2Win [2] is a config that&#x27;s worked well for me.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kasper&#x2F;phoenix[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nik3daz&#x2F;spin2winThat said, it seems there are no perfect solutions. At work where I can&#x27;t really be futzing around with window management config I basically just use Raycast + hotkeys and try to keep everything inside maximized application windows. This means using Arc browser (tabbed), iTerm (tabbed), VS Code (with native tabs), etc mapped to cmd+1, cmd+2, cmd+3...Not much \"tiling\" going on but at least everything is pretty keyboard friendly. reply psygn89 17 hours agorootparentDoes this allow using the mouse? Maybe not common amongst tiling window users but I like to just drag a window over another to swap them or resize one window from the frame and have the other tiles adjust accordingly. So far it seems only Amethyst and Yabai do this, but if Phoenix internally tracks the states of windows (position, etc.) then this should be feasible to write code for without relying on Mac&#x27;s windowing api? reply extr 9 hours agorootparentYeah if I recall correctly there is support for the mouse and doing all the kinds of things you usually use mouse for in tiling wm setups. reply xwowsersx 18 hours agorootparentprevI think I had come across Phoenix briefly, but never took it for a spin. Thanks for the recommendation, I&#x27;ll definitely take a look. reply rufugee 12 hours agoparentprevAfter trying yabai, Amethyst, and many others, I landed on hammerspoon.org + https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;miromannino&#x2F;miro-windows-manager a few years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back. I couldn&#x27;t live on a Mac without hammerspoon tbh. reply faizmokh 9 hours agorootparentYeah I&#x27;m using hammerspoon & miro too with this basic binding:```hs.window.animationDuration = 0.2 spoon.MiroWindowsManager:bindHotkeys({ up = {hyper, \"up\"}, right = {hyper, \"right\"}, down = {hyper, \"down\"}, left = {hyper, \"left\"}, fullscreen = {hyper, \"f\"} })```Works well enough for years. reply xwowsersx 11 hours agorootparentprevCan you share your config please? Trying to get a better idea of what&#x27;s possible and how to get started. Thanks reply rufugee 8 hours agorootparentMy full hammerspoon config is a mix of things I&#x27;ve collected&#x2F;written over the years, but the Miro-specific section is simply: -- window management hs.loadSpoon(\"MiroWindowsManager\") -- set to 0.x for animation, 0 for none hs.window.animationDuration = 0.3 spoon.MiroWindowsManager:bindHotkeys({ up = { hyper, \"k\" }, down = { hyper, \"j\" }, left = { hyper, \"h\" }, right = { hyper, \"l\" }, fullscreen = { hyper, \"f\" }, nextscreen = { hyper, \"n\" } }) reply nbobko 10 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;d be more than willing to try another tiling window manager on Mac if there&#x27;s one out there that truly worksHello, AeroSpace author speaking :)I&#x27;d be happy if you could try AeroSpace (it&#x27;s and i3-like window manager for macOS) and report me back if it loses track of windows.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nikitabobko&#x2F;AeroSpaceThe architecture of AeroSpace is that on every user input that may change window configuration (new window created, window moved, window resized, new app launched, etc), AeroSpace runs the same idempotent operation (I call it \"refresh session\") that tries to detect new window, checks all invariants, re-layouts windows, etc.The \"refresh session\" performs all the mentioned steps regardless of the user input nature (it doesn&#x27;t matter whether the window is moved, or a new app is launched)I believe that this architecture may lose windows only if the macOS API returns invalid data.I have been using AeroSpace for quite a while myself and I&#x27;m happy with it reply thelazyoxymoron 49 minutes agorootparentThe demo looks pretty nice! I&#x27;ll be trying this out over the weekend and report any issues. Thanks for building this! reply xwowsersx 8 hours agorootparentprevVery cool, looks great. Seems to hew pretty closely to i3 from what I could tell in the demo video. Will definitely give this a try. Thanks for your work on this! reply onelesd 18 hours agoparentprevtry hammerspoon. it isn&#x27;t a tiling window manager, per se - it&#x27;s more of an all-purpose desktop extension framework. it is fully customizable, has a well-documented API, and a large community.for window arrangement the hs.grid component is plenty for me. see an example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nRJ0477KFp8 reply zdragnar 18 hours agorootparentHammerspoon is literally the only thing I miss from leaving macOS.If I ever have to go back, it&#x27;ll be one of the first things I install again. reply pazimzadeh 16 hours agorootparentprevI use hammerspoon with the ShiftIt spoon, which works well:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;peterklijn&#x2F;hammerspoon-shiftitMy config file:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;pazimzadeh&#x2F;b1c70f5f205d0b63264e7c021... reply iLemming 17 hours agorootparentprevCheck out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;agzam&#x2F;spacehammer if you&#x27;re using Hammerspoon. reply vasac 16 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s also somewhat similar extension for Hammerspoon: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FryJay&#x2F;MenuHammer&#x2F; reply rufugee 12 hours agorootparentprevI use hammerspoon with https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;miromannino&#x2F;miro-windows-manager...it&#x27;s a great tiling experience. reply xwowsersx 14 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a config example I can look at that demonstrates how to set this up? reply daggersandscars 18 hours agoparentprevThis may not be what you’re looking for, but I use Mizage’s Divvy on Mac & Windows and configure Gnome to match on Linux. It can be keyboard or mouse driven — I exclusively use custom keyboard shortcuts. reply ebiester 18 hours agorootparentI used to use Divvy (and have a paid copy), but I&#x27;ve moved to Rectangle which also does everything I need and is open source. It doesn&#x27;t have the same \"drag\" mouse capabilities that Divvy does, but I don&#x27;t end up using that too often. reply marcomourao 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve also been using Divvy since as long as I can remember but it hasn&#x27;t been updated in 4 years, looks like abandonware. reply tfsh 17 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve used Yabai for about three years now, it generally only forgets windows or specifically their states if you use the swipe multi tasking features. However when this happens I have a keybind and Skhd command which quickly restarts the daemon [1] and fixes the windows.It takes a little while to get used it, but Yabai is now an app I can&#x27;t live without.1: launchctl kickstart -k \"gui&#x2F;${UID}&#x2F;homebrew.mxcl.yabai\" reply athorax 16 hours agorootparentI have the exact same setup, I have to maybe restart the service 2-3x a week. Unsurprisingly, outlook is often the culprit of needing to restart the service# Reload yabai ctrl + shift + alt -r : launchctl kickstart -k \"gui&#x2F;${UID}&#x2F;homebrew.mxcl.yabai\" reply psygn89 17 hours agoparentprevThat was my experience also especially the past year. I do programming and design and it seems many apps twist the ui api to do things that you can&#x27;t naturally do in the interface and so Yabai, completely oblivious to it, will try to manage it and you have elements disappearing or appearing too large&#x2F;small, behind other elements, etc. Even if you create exceptions, it seems things sometimes slip through the crack or start behaving unexpectedly. Flipping between native tabs for instance start throwing the tiling off for some apps that I use.Yabai used to be pretty solid and usable, but I think with the author not using a Mac for his daily and with all the updates to the OS that he has to keep track of (and how some windowing Mac api are still blackboxed or not reliant to build logic atop of) it&#x27;s only a matter of time before it gets into a poorer state. reply Difwif 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve certainly run into my problems with Yabai and have had to work through different versions to solve problems. It&#x27;s certainly not perfect still but I&#x27;ve found a pretty stable workflow for me. I would certainly recommend turning off anything that&#x27;s not nessiary like window borders.

I tried using yabai on a 13 inch m2 air, but I ended up going back to my normal workflow of just alt tabbing between windows. Most apps don’t let you see enough content when they are tiled (because of gui elements such as sidebar etc). I do love the “focus on hover” feature of yabai though. I wish macOS had that natively. reply hobofan 12 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve been using Amethyst for multiple years on only the builtin display as well.I think the key here is to use multiple desktops (or are they called workspaces?). If I&#x27;m working on a single screen I constantly have 10 desktops open, with a quite consistent setup between them (e.g. first desktop is fullscreen browser, second screen is 3-5 tiled terminals, ...). All the applications I&#x27;m \"actively\" using are usually on the first 2-4 desktops with a lot of screen real estate for each of them.What really helps here is assigning one of the screen corners as a hot corner that goes to Expose mode where you can switch between screens, as well as assigning shortcuts for switching between desktops and moving windows between them (the moving windows shortcuts are usually part of your window manager). Selecting \"Reduced Motion\" in the accessibility settings also helps by speeding up the desktop switching animations. reply wilsonnb3 4 hours agoparentprevI used to use i3 on a ThinkPad x220 and agree that they are less useful on small screens.My experience is that they are also just productivity theater.

Most people probably lose more time overall managing their config files and looking up the shortcuts they forgot. reply SamBam 18 hours agoparentprevI have the same problem.I would love a tiling manager that allowed you to \"full screen\" the app into the tile of your choice.By that, I mean the app would snap to the edges and lose all the chrome that is normal present.

In most cases I find it easier to just let windows overlap, which results in the same information visibility but lets windows retain proper sizing.I could see tiling working if I lived in minimal-chrome apps like Terminal and Sublime, but I don’t, and so floating with occasional tiling works better for me. reply shortrounddev2 17 hours agoparentprevDo you not use a monitor at a desk? reply Nevin1901 12 hours agorootparentNo, I work on an m2 MacBook Air with a trackpad and the built in keyboard reply caeruleus 15 hours agoprevI have been using Yabai for two years now and am very happy.

Personally I don&#x27;t really grasp it. If I work with a lot of papers and documents on a desk, I don&#x27;t \"tile\" them, I keep them sort of organically in front of me.And whatever app I need to use should ideally be straight in front of me. But that&#x27;s just me, maybe I haven&#x27;t had a proper tiling experience yet and thus I haven&#x27;t seen the light. reply beautron 2 hours agoparentFor me, it&#x27;s less that I want to \"tile\" windows, than that I want whichever one I&#x27;m using to be fullscreen and distraction-free.I don&#x27;t like visual clutter. If I&#x27;m using a program, I want it to be the only thing on my monitor. But sometimes I want to keep more than one program open, or even be switching between them. Tiling window managers let me give each program its own full screen, and quickly switch between them with a keyboard command. I love it.And then there&#x27;s the exception that proves the rule: Sometimes I do want to have two programs on the same screen, side-by-side. An example would be Vim in the left 2&#x2F;3rds of my screen (where I am programming), and then a browser with some documentation on the right 1&#x2F;3rd. Obviously tiling managers also support this case, and I prefer them here too vs. mousing around windows into place (which still tends to leave behind windowing chrome and other visual clutter).That reminds me of another reason: I prefer keyboard to mouse. I&#x27;ve learned good form and technique for keyboard use, which let me use it frequently and for long periods while avoiding injury. But I just can&#x27;t figure out a way to use a mouse or trackpad that isn&#x27;t harmful, were it repeated enough (a vertical mouse goes a long way though).Tiling managers let me do everything using keyboard (unless the \"tiled\" programs themselves require mouse), whereas traditional windowing managers pretty much require mouse. I find it both more ergonomic and much faster using the keyboard. reply certifiedloud 15 hours agoparentprevI switched to i3 years ago for the workspace management.

Its Aero Snap equivalent is optional and turned off by default too, which is great for me (I trigger Aero Snap’s proposed-window-resize animations unintentionally often enough that they get to be irritating).[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manytricks.com&#x2F;moom&#x2F; reply asenchi 16 hours agorootparentMoom is one of my main tools and I have used it for years.

Rectangle has the benefits of keeping the application-defined sizes (e.g. the terminal when opened up is 80x20 instead of whatever space is available on the screen) and playing nicely with the system defaults (like command-tab, command-~ to cycle through applications and windows). I find if I ever end up using a public or someone else&#x27;s device, it&#x27;s easier to cope; I&#x27;m not as helpless without rectangle as I was when I got used to a tiling WM muscle memory.And the name of Yabai -- which translates to \"danger\" -- never sounded appealing to me to introduce into my device. reply l2dy 17 hours agorootparentThe name Yabai can also be used in a positive sense to mean \"great\", and is particularly common among young people.

I wouldn&#x27;t use a mac without it.But I don&#x27;t use a mac anymore. I use linux desktops and there&#x27;s just nothing quite like Rectangle. For a long while, I used a tweaked fork of pygrid. These days I use wayland compositors and don&#x27;t have a good option. I&#x27;ve been meaning to hack something together to work with floating windows on Hyprland but I never get around to it.Someday I&#x27;d like to write something that does placement and sizing like Rectangle but snaps adjacent window edges together. Like if I have a bottom left window that&#x27;s 1&#x2F;3rd screen width and assign a new window to bottom right 1&#x2F;3rd width, the bottom left would get resized to 2&#x2F;3rd wide to fill the void. If I place a new window at bottom middle 1&#x2F;3rd, the bottom left would get resized back to 1&#x2F;3rd. If I resized bottom middle to 1&#x2F;2 width, then the bottom left and right would each be resized to 1&#x2F;4 width.Hyprland has a plugin system that I believe would let me do this (someone has created an i3-like tiling plugin) but I don&#x27;t have the skills or motivation to learn c++. reply wharvle 15 hours agorootparentI still just use Spectacle. Still works, has never in years given me any trouble whatsoever—zero jank, never crashes, just works—so haven’t bothered to switch. Being able to get its behavior with same key-combos on any other OS I might seriously use, with similar perfect levels of stability and reliability, is now table-stakes for me. reply poidos 16 hours agorootparentprevIf you’re willing to use GNOME (and, I believe, KDE Plasma) you can set up keybindings that are a reasonable approximation to Rectangle. That’s what I did before i3 or on machines that can’t have i3 for odd reasons. reply seemaze 13 hours agoparentprevThis is the feature that makes rectangle for me. 95% of my use case is just cycling windows sizes (1&#x2F;3 - 1&#x2F;2 - 2&#x2F;3) snapped to either side of my screen with &#x27;[&#x27; and &#x27;]&#x27; as shortcuts. Works wonderfully on both my ultrawide and 13\" mba screen. reply erybodyknows 13 hours agoparentprevI miss rectangle the most after switching from macOS to Linux. Ironically I end up using the mouse more on Linux because I haven’t found a similar solution for window sizing keyboard shortcuts. reply gigatexal 13 hours agorootparentsway, i3, bswm, awesomewm, so many tiling window managers on Linux that you don&#x27;t need the mouse for. There&#x27;s even tiling making it&#x27;s way into Gnome and KDE with the former having some good extensions and the latter just baking it in and getting better with every release. reply extr 15 hours agoparentprevOne thing I really don&#x27;t like about rectangle (and maybe MacOS in general) is that you can&#x27;t easily multi-key hotkeys with regular keys. So for example CMD + Right Arrow + Up Arrow for upper-right tiling. This is simple&#x2F;trivial with PowerToys on windows. But you can use Karabiner Elements to create a simulation of this using keypress delays. I use Karabiner + BetterTouchTools to accomplish the same functionality since I&#x27;m already running it for other reasons. reply dev_tty01 15 hours agorootparentDoesn&#x27;t this always force delays? If I have CMD + Right Arrow assigned to some other function, the system will have to wait to make sure the Up Arrow isn&#x27;t coming soon before dispatching the Right Arrow function. Of course we want the delay short, but that makes the multi-key shortcut less reliable.I haven&#x27;t tried it, but the tradeoffs don&#x27;t sound great to me. Only allowing multiple modifier keys avoids all of these timing issues. You seem to be comfortable with it, but I think most users would trigger a lot of spurious inputs. reply extr 9 hours agorootparentIt does force delays and your concerns are legitimate. All I will say is that in practice I&#x27;ve never actually noticed any kind of conflict or problem when the delay is on the order of 500ms. reply saagarjha 11 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not really an issue.

It&#x27;s just a little too buggy, a little too opinionated. I&#x27;ve never found a window management system I&#x27;ve actually truly liked. On Linux, I&#x27;ve tried em all, and though in theory I love tiling window managers, but for me automatic tiling with the option to go floating on a per-window basis just ultimately ends up annoying me -- I prefer the reverse. On Windows, PowerToys&#x2F;FancyZones is as close to my preferred method as possible, but then I&#x27;m, you know, using Windows.This past week I&#x27;ve come up with what is I think my perfect, dream solution:- Caps Lock is tapped for Escape, held for Cmd+Ctrl+Opt (i.e. \"Hyper\" or whatever). I&#x27;m a Neovim user, so Caps Lock has been mapped to Escape forever already.- Tapping both Shift keys simultaneously engages Caps Lock for the rare times in which I actually need it.- Window snapping is handled entirely with Hammerspoon. I have commands for absolute positions (e.g. half, one third, two thirds, quarters), but also can define grids and call them with key commands, and then use another command to snap all windows or just the focused window to the nearest grid box.It&#x27;s all defined with code, and thus lives with my dotfiles, and is just a `brew install` and symlink away from totally setting up on a brand new machine.Also, I set my tmux prefix to Control+p, which I map to Command in my iTerm profile. So, opening up a new tmux \"window\" (i.e. tab) is Command+t. Navigating to the next \"window\"&#x2F;tab is Control+Tab. And so on. Basically it just feels like a browser. This way, whether I switch terminals, or am ssh-ing into a machine, as long as I have my tmux config, those key commands are set.It&#x27;s an amazing setup, can&#x27;t recommend it enough. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "Accelerating Generative AI with PyTorch: Faster Text Generation with GPU Optimization",
    "originLink": "https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-generative-ai-2/",
    "originBody": "by Team PyTorch This post is the second part of a multi-series blog focused on how to accelerate generative AI models with pure, native PyTorch. We are excited to share a breadth of newly released PyTorch performance features alongside practical examples to see how far we can push PyTorch native performance. In part one, we showed how to accelerate Segment Anything over 8x using only pure, native PyTorch. In this blog we’ll focus on LLM optimization. Over the past year, generative AI use cases have exploded in popularity. Text generation has been one particularly popular area, with lots of innovation among open-source projects such as llama.cpp, vLLM, and MLC-LLM. While these projects are performant, they often come with tradeoffs in ease of use, such as requiring model conversion to specific formats or building and shipping new dependencies. This begs the question: how fast can we run transformer inference with only pure, native PyTorch? As announced during our recent PyTorch Developer Conference, the PyTorch team wrote a from-scratch LLM almost 10x faster than baseline, with no loss of accuracy, all using native PyTorch optimizations. We leverage a breadth of optimizations including: Torch.compile: A compiler for PyTorch models GPU quantization: Accelerate models with reduced precision operations Speculative Decoding: Accelerate LLMs using a small “draft” model to predict large “target” model’s output Tensor Parallelism: Accelerate models by running them across multiple devices. And, even better, we can do it in less than 1000 lines of native PyTorch code. If this excites you enough to jump straight into the code, check it out at https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast! Note: We will be focusing on latency (i.e. batch size=1) for all of these benchmarks. Unless otherwise specified, all benchmarks are run on an A100-80GB, power limited to 330W. Starting Point (25.5 tok/s) Let’s start off with an extremely basic and simple implementation. Sadly, this does not perform very well. But why? Looking at a trace reveals the answer - it’s heavily CPU overhead bound! What this means is that our CPU is not able to tell the GPU what to do fast enough for the GPU to be fully utilized. Imagine the GPU as this super massive factory with a ridiculous amount of compute available. Then, imagine the CPU as some messenger shuttling instructions back and forth to the GPU. Remember, in large scale deep learning systems, the GPU is responsible for doing 100% of the work! In such systems, the only role of the CPU is to tell the GPU what work it should be doing. So, the CPU runs over and tells the GPU to do an “add”, but by the time the CPU can give the GPU another chunk of work, the GPU has long finished the previous chunk of work. Despite the fact that the GPU needs to perform thousands of computations while the CPU only needs to do orchestration work, this is surprisingly common! There’s a variety of reasons for this, ranging from the fact that the CPU is likely running some single-threaded Python to the fact that GPUs are just incredibly fast nowadays. Regardless of the reason, we now find ourselves in the overhead-bound regime. So, what can we do? One, we could rewrite our implementation in C++, perhaps even eschew frameworks entirely and write raw CUDA. Or…. we could just send more work to the GPU at once. By just sending a massive chunk of work at once, we can keep our GPU busy! Although during training, this may just be accomplished by increasing your batch size, how do we do this during inference? Enter torch.compile. Step 1: Reducing CPU overhead through torch.compile and a static kv-cache (107.0 tok/s) Torch.compile allows us to capture a larger region into a single compiled region, and particularly when run with mode=”reduce-overhead”, is very effective at reducing CPU overhead. Here, we also specify fullgraph=True, which validates that there are no “graph breaks” in your model (i.e. portions that torch.compile cannot compile). In other words, it ensures that torch.compile is running to its fullest potential. To apply it, we simply wrap a function (or a module) with it. torch.compile(decode_one_token, mode=\"reduce-overhead\", fullgraph=True) However, there are a couple of nuances here that make it somewhat nontrivial for folks to get significant performance boosts from applying torch.compile to text generation. The first obstacle is the kv-cache. The kv-cache is an inference-time optimization that caches the activations computed for the previous tokens (see here for a more in-depth explanation). However, as we generate more tokens, the “logical length” of the kv-cache grows. This is problematic for two reasons. One is that reallocating (and copying!) the kv-cache every time the cache grows is simply expensive. The other one is that this dynamism makes it harder to reduce the overhead, as we are no longer able to leverage approaches like cudagraphs. To resolve this, we use a “static” kv-cache, which means that we statically allocate the maximum size of the kv-cache, and then mask out the unused values in the attention portion of the computation. The second obstacle is the prefill phase. Transformer text generation is best thought of as a two phase process: 1. The prefill where the entire prompt is processed, and 2. Decoding where each token is generated autoregressively. Although decoding can be made entirely static once the kv-cache is made static, the prefill stage still requires significantly more dynamism, due to having a variable prompt length. Thus, we actually need to compile the two stages with separate compilation strategies. Although these details are a bit tricky, the actual implementation is not very difficult at all (see gpt-fast)! And the performance boost is dramatic. All of a sudden, our performance improves by more than 4x! Such performance gains are often common when one’s workload is overhead bound. Sidenote: How is torch.compile helping? It is worth disentangling how exactly torch.compile is improving performance. There’s 2 main factors leading to torch.compile’s performance. The first factor, like mentioned above, is overhead reduction. Torch.compile is able to reduce overhead through a variety of optimizations, but one of the most effective ones is called CUDAGraphs. Although torch.compile applies this automatically for you when “reduce-overhead” is set, saving the extra work and code you need to write when doing this yourself manually without torch.compile. The second factor, however, is that torch.compile simply generates faster kernels. In the decoding benchmark above, torch.compile actually generates every single kernel from scratch, including both the matrix multiplications and the attention! And even cooler, these kernels are actually faster than the built in alternatives (CuBLAS and FlashAttention2)! This may sound implausible to many of you, considering how hard it is to write efficient matrix multiplication/attention kernels, and how much manpower has been put into CuBLAS and FlashAttention. The key here, however, is that transformer decoding has very unusual computational properties. In particular, because of the KV-cache, for BS=1 every single matrix multiplication in a transformer is actually a matrix vector multiplication. This means that the computations are completely memory-bandwidth bound, and as such, are well within the range of compilers to automatically generate. And in fact, when we benchmark torch.compile’s matrix-vector multiplications against CuBLAS, we find that torch.compile’s kernels are actually quite a bit faster! Step 2: Alleviating memory bandwidth bottleneck through int8 weight-only quantization (157.4 tok/s) So, given that we’ve already seen massive speedups from applying torch.compile, is it possible to do even better? One way to think about this problem is to compute how close we are to the theoretical peak. In this case, the largest bottleneck is the cost of loading the weights from GPU global memory to registers. In other words, each forward pass requires us to “touch” every single parameter on the GPU. So, how fast can we theoretically “touch” every single parameter in a model? To measure this, we can use Model Bandwidth Utilization (MBU). This measures what percentage of our memory bandwidth we’re able to use during inference. Computing it is pretty simple. We simply take the total size of our model (# params * bytes per param) and multiply it by the number of inferences we can do per second. Then, we divide this by the peak bandwidth of the GPU to get our MBU. For example, for our above case, we have a 7B parameter model. Each parameter is stored in fp16 (2 bytes per parameter), and we achieved 107 tokens/s. Finally, our A100-80GB has a theoretical 2 TB/s of memory bandwidth. Putting this all together, we get **72% MBU! **This is quite good, considering that even just copying memory struggles to break 85%. But… it does mean that we’re pretty close to the theoretical limit here, and that we’re clearly bottlenecked on just loading our weights from memory. It doesn’t matter what we do - without changing the problem statement in some manner, we might only be able to eek out another 10% in performance. Let’s take another look at the above equation. We can’t really change the number of parameters in our model. We can’t really change the memory bandwidth of our GPU (well, without paying more money). But, we can change how many bytes each parameter is stored in! Thus, we arrive at our next technique - int8 quantization. The idea here is simple. If loading our weights from memory is our main bottleneck, why don’t we just make the weights smaller? Note that this is quantizing only the weights - the computation itself is still done in bf16. This makes this form of quantization easy to apply with very little to no accuracy degradation. Moreover, torch.compile can also easily generate efficient code for int8 quantization. Let’s look again at the above benchmark, this time with int8 weight-only quantization included. As you can see from the dark blue line (torch.compile + int8), there is a significant performance improvement when using torch.compile + int8 weight-only quantization! Moreover, the light-blue line (no torch.compile + int8) is actually much worse than even the fp16 performance! This is because in order to take advantage of the perf benefits of int8 quantization, we need the kernels to be fused. This shows one of the benefits of torch.compile - these kernels can be automatically generated for the user! Applying int8 quantization to our model, we see a nice 50% performance improvement, bringing us up to 157.4 tokens/s! Step 3: Reframing the problem using speculative decoding Even after using techniques like quantization, we’re still faced with another problem. In order to generate 100 tokens, we must load our weights 100 times. Even if the weights are quantized, we still must load our weights over and over, once for each token we generate! Is there any way around this? At first glance, the answer might seem like no - there’s a strict serial dependency in our autoregressive generation. However, as it turns out, by utilizing speculative decoding, we’re able to break this strict serial dependency and obtain speedups! Imagine you had a senior engineer (called Verity), who makes the right technical decisions but is rather slow at writing code. However, you also have a junior engineer (called Drake), who doesn’t always make the right technical decisions but can write code much faster (and cheaper!) than Verity. How can we take advantage of Drake (the junior engineer) to write code faster while ensuring that we are still making the right technical decisions? First, Drake goes through the labor-intensive process of writing the code, making technical decisions along the way. Next, we give the code to Verity to review. Upon reviewing the code, Verity might decide that the first 3 technical decisions Drake made are correct, but the last 2 need to be redone. So, Drake goes back, throws away his last 2 decisions, and restarts coding from there. Notably, although Verity (the senior engineer) has only looked at the code once, we are able to generate 3 pieces of validated code identical to what she would have written! Thus, assuming Verity is able to review the code faster than it would have taken her to write those 3 pieces herself, this approach comes out ahead. In the context of transformer inference, Verity would be played by the role of the larger model whose outputs we want for our task, called the verifier model. Similarly, Drake would be played by a smaller model that’s able to generate text much faster than the larger model, called the draft model. So, we would generate 8 tokens using the draft model, and then process all eight tokens in parallel using the verifier model, throwing out the ones that don’t match. Like mentioned above, one crucial property of speculative decoding is that it does not change the quality of the output. As long as the time it takes for generating the tokens using the draft model + verifying the tokens is less than it would have taken to generate those tokens, we come out ahead. One of the great things about doing this all in native PyTorch is that this technique is actually really easy to implement! Here’s the entirety of the implementation, in about 50 lines of native PyTorch. Although speculative decoding guarantees that we have mathematically identical results compared to regular generation, it does have the property that the runtime performance varies depending on the generated text, as well as how aligned the draft and verifier model are. For example, when running CodeLlama-34B + CodeLlama-7B, we’re able to obtain a 2x boost in tokens/s for generating code. On the other hand, when using Llama-7B + TinyLlama-1B, we’re only able to obtain about a 1.3x boost in tokens/s. Sidenote: Running this on AMD Like mentioned above, every single kernel in decoding is generated from scratch by torch.compile, and is converted into OpenAI Triton. As AMD has a torch.compile backend (and also a Triton backend), we can simply go through all of the optimizations above… but on an AMD GPU! With int8 quantization, we’re able to achieve 102.5 tokens/s with one GCD (i.e. one half) of a MI250x! Step 4: Reducing the size of the weights even more with int4 quantization and GPTQ (202.1 tok/s) Of course, if reducing the weights down from 16 bits to 8 bits allows for speedups by reducing the number of bytes we need to load, reducing the weights down to 4 bits would result in even larger speedups! Unfortunately, when reducing weights down to 4-bits, the accuracy of the model starts to become a much larger concern. From our preliminary evals, we see that although using int8 weight-only quantization has no perceptible accuracy degradation, using int4 weight-only quantization does. There are 2 main tricks we can use to limit the accuracy degradation of int4 quantization. The first one is to have a more granular scaling factor. One way to think about the scaling factor is that when we have a quantized tensor representation, it is on a sliding scale between a floating point tensor (each value has a scaling factor) and an integer tensor (no values have a scaling factor). For example, with int8 quantization, we had one scaling factor per row. If we want higher accuracy, however, we can change that to “one scaling factor per 32 elements”. We choose a group size of 32 to minimize accuracy degradation, and this is also a common choice among the community. The other one is to use a more advanced quantization strategy than simply rounding the weights. For example, approaches like GPTQ leverage example data in order to calibrate the weights more accurately. In this case, we prototype an implementation of GPTQ in the repository based off of PyTorch’s recently released torch.export. In addition, we need kernels that fuse int4 dequantize with the matrix vector multiplication. In this case, torch.compile is unfortunately not able to generate these kernels from scratch, so we leverage some handwritten CUDA kernels in PyTorch. These techniques require some additional work, but putting them all together results in even better performance! Step 5: Combining everything together (244.7 tok/s) Finally, we can compose all of the techniques together to achieve even better performance! Step 6: Using Tensor Parallelism So far, we’ve been restricting ourselves to minimizing latency while on a single GPU. In many settings, however, we have access to multiple GPUs. This allows us to improve our latency further! To get an intuitive sense of why this would allow us to improve our latency, let’s take a look at the prior equation for MBU, particularly the denominator. Running on multiple GPUs gives us access to more memory bandwidth, and thus, higher potential performance. As for which parallelism strategy to pick, note that in order to reduce our latency for one example, we need to be able to leverage our memory bandwidth across more devices simultaneously. This means that we need to split the processing of one token across multiple devices. In other words, we need to use tensor parallelism. Luckily, PyTorch also provides low-level tools for tensor-parallelism that compose with torch.compile. We are also working on higher-level APIs for expressing tensor parallelism, stay tuned for those! However, even without a higher-level API, it’s actually still quite easy to add tensor parallelism. Our implementation comes in at 150 lines of code, and doesn’t require any model changes. We are still able to take advantage of all the optimizations mentioned previously, which all can continue to compose with tensor parallelism. Combining these together, we’re able to serve Llama-70B at 55 tokens/s with int8 quantization! Conclusion Let’s take a look at what we’re able to accomplish. Simplicity: Ignoring quantization, model.py (244 LOC) + generate.py (371 LOC) + tp.py (151 LOC) comes out to 766 LOC to implement fast inference + speculative decoding + tensor-parallelism. Performance: With Llama-7B, we’re able to use compile + int4 quant + speculative decoding to reach 241 tok/s. With llama-70B, we’re able to also throw in tensor-parallelism to reach 80 tok/s. These are both close to or surpassing SOTA performance numbers! PyTorch has always allowed for simplicity, ease of use, and flexibility. However, with torch.compile, we can throw in performance as well. The code can be found here: https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast. We hope that the community finds it useful. Our goal with this repo is not to provide another library or framework for people to import. Instead, we encourage users to copy-paste, fork, and modify the code in the repo.

Do you know if it&#x27;s possible to port this over to pytorch&#x27;s Apple Silicon&#x2F;MPS support? reply chillee 10 hours agorootparentUnfortunately it&#x27;s a little bit tricky today. The main issue is that we rely heavily on torch.compile + Triton for performance in this repo, and there isn&#x27;t an Apple Silicon backend either for torch.compile or Triton.For example, there&#x27;s an AMD backend for Triton (and it&#x27;s also integrated into torch.compile), which is why we can mostly do the same optimizations on Nvidia and AMD GPUs.Ideally, there&#x27;d be an Apple Silicon backend for Triton, and then this repo would mostly work out of the box :) reply Dowwie 13 hours agoparentprevWhat kind of workstation would you build&#x2F;buy for local GPT development with a budget of $3000? Is remote dev a viable alternative to local workstations? reply ftufek 13 hours agorootparentLocal workstation is much cheaper in the long run.Even ignoring that, most of the development is running experiments. You&#x27;re gonna be hesitant to run lots of experiments if they each cost money whereas when you pay upfront for the hardware, you&#x27;re gonna have the incentive to fully utilize it with lots of experiments.I&#x27;d go with rtx 4090 and deal with memory limitation through software tricks. It&#x27;s an underrated card that&#x27;s as performant as cards that are magnitude pricier. It&#x27;s great way to get started with that budget. reply biddit 12 hours agorootparentI agree with you but right now RTX 4090 cards are pushing $2000, which doesn&#x27;t leave much budget left. I&#x27;d suggest picking up a used 3090 card from eBay, which are currently around $800. This will still give 24gb of VRAM like the 4090. reply RockyMcNuts 9 hours agorootparenti&#x27;ve seen some blog posts saying if you buy a used 3090 that has been used for bitcoin mining then there is a risk of thermal throttling because the thermal paste on the vram is not great and worse if it was run hot for a long time.any recommendations on how to buy one? e.g. 24GB model, any particular model to run LLMs? what is the biggest baddest LLM you can run on a single card?have been thinking about it but was sticking with cloud&#x2F;colab for experiments so far. reply dharmab 9 hours agorootparentThe good deals are gonna be on local ads. Facebook Marketplace in most of the US. reply two_in_one 8 hours agorootparentprevI remember videos (on youtube likely) of thermal paste replacement, that was upgrade to stock card. So, average person should be able to do it. It&#x27;ll cost a few $$ for the paste. I would go with local workstation, then don&#x27;t have to think much about while running stable diffusion. Plus, if it&#x27;s used from ebay, prices cannot go much lower, you&#x27;ll get something back at the end. Also, for image things training dataset can be quite big for network transfers. reply icelancer 12 hours agorootparentprevStrong endorse here. I pick up used RTX 3090s from Facebook Marketplace and eBay at $800 maximum. Can usually find them locally for $700-750, and typically can test them too, which is fine (though I&#x27;ve had no issues yet). reply Philpax 12 hours agorootparentprevDepending on what you&#x27;re doing, 2x used 3090s are the same price and offer you more VRAM. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m planning on doing, in any case - being able to run 70B LLMs entirely on the GPU is more useful than being able to run 34B faster. reply icelancer 12 hours agorootparentYeah multiple 3090s is the best budget way to go for sure. Also older server boards with tons of PCIe lanes if you can swing rack mounted hardware and have some technical skills. reply biddit 12 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. I recently completed a new build with two 3090 GPUs and really appreciate being able to run 70b models. reply Dowwie 12 hours agorootparentwhich cpu did you go with? reply biddit 11 hours agorootparenti7-14700kz790 chipset w&#x2F; mobo that supports x8&#x2F;x8 bifurcation96gb ddr5 @5600mhz replyleobg 13 hours agorootparentprevNot OP, but I asked myself that same question two years ago. Then I looked at the energy prices in Germany and knew I had no chance against cloud GPUs. Maybe you live in a country with lower energy prices, like Bermuda (or any other country on earth), in which case this may not be as important to you. A side benefit of going cloud that you can pick and choose the right GPU for whatever project you’re working on, and you’re really just paying while you’re running them. Also, no hardware or Cuda drivers that may divert your attention. reply woodson 13 hours agorootparentprevI’d go with a remote dev solution. Training&#x2F;finetuning of large models requires much more resources anyway, so the GPUs in the local machine would be unused most of the time. reply modeless 12 hours agorootparentprevI got a 13900k + 4090 workstation for ~$3500. But I hear what people are doing is getting 2x (or more) 3090s instead, because they are cheap used, and having more VRAM and VRAM bandwidth is the important thing at the moment, even if it is split between cards.I&#x27;m happy with my 4090 though. Dealing with splitting between GPUs sounds like a chore and also I like the gaming abilities of the 4090. reply icelancer 12 hours agorootparentprevI would do remote dev using vast.ai and other cheap cloud computing resources to ensure you want to do this and have utility for it, then build your own. 3090s are typically the most budget friendly, and if you have any IT chops (and tolerance for noise), then server rack-mounted hardware, PSUs, and riser cables tend to be the most efficient with tons of PCIe lanes (which is a hidden issue people have with consumer-grade gaming PCs as they scale). reply dharmab 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m using an AMD 6900XT with ROCm and it&#x27;s fast enough ti be usable, for a fraction of the price of a 3090 or 4090. reply sp332 7 hours agorootparentprevJust make sure you’re buying something with a warranty. Hardware failures during training are quite common. reply jokethrowaway 1 hour agorootparentprevI made a custom pc in May with a 4090 for playing around. It&#x27;s good and fast but for production workload or serious training you want more ram. It was less than ~3k in components (~2k after considering removing vat and expending it &#x2F; depreciating it in a limited company)If you also want a Mac consider an m3 MacBook with maxed ram. reply LoganDark 6 hours agorootparentprevA regular gaming PC will do, about a grand, then slot in a 3090 or something off eBay. Congratulations, you&#x27;re a grand under-budget, but already have a viable development machine. reply toxik 3 hours agoparentprevFantastic article, great job.

We didn&#x27;t compare explicitly to Huggingface TGI but I think you should be able to compare the tokens&#x2F;s achieved.One note is that this release is optimized for latency, while I think HF TGI might be more optimized for throughput. reply deepGem 6 hours agoprev\"This may sound implausible to many of you, considering how hard it is to write efficient matrix multiplication&#x2F;attention kernels, and how much manpower has been put into CuBLAS and FlashAttention. The key here, however, is that transformer decoding has very unusual computational properties. In particular, because of the KV-cache, for BS=1 every single matrix multiplication in a transformer is actually a matrix vector multiplication.\"How did they unlock this key ? In retrospect it seems so simple, but without the KV-cache this possibility would not have emerged at all. Hats off ! reply cztomsik 34 minutes agoparentBS=1 also means you can only decode one token. This is not always what you want, and then you&#x27;re back to matrix-matrix multiply again. Most of the from-scratch llama implementations start with matrix-vector because it&#x27;s simpler & easier. But eventually, you will want to serve multiple users, or compute multiple beams together... reply kosolam 1 hour agoprevHey we are exactly dealing now with all that is related to the performance of running models from HF. Yesterday we ran vicuna-13b-q8-gguf using llamacpp on a vast.ai A40 45GB VRAM It gave us 4 tokens&#x2F;s generation rate. This seems a bit slow for that GPU and a 13b model. Does anyone know where the problem could be in llamacpp, gpu, the model, something else?Also… where are all the people like us that work on applications on top of HF models congregate? reply andy99 14 hours agoprevThis is a great article. Regarding> While these projects are performant, they often come with tradeoffs in ease of use, such as requiring model conversion to specific formats or building and shipping new dependencies.I think it should be acknowledged that (at least IMO) pytorch model formats are not very portable and this is a big part of the problem. It would be nice to see industry move towards a better format (gguf?) that can easily be ported between frameworks and not leave you stuck using torch to load it. Likewise, pytorch is a massive dependency to include with a project, especially for simple inference, so while other projects have new dependencies, they can often be a lot lighter than for a pytorch model, again particularly for inference code. reply chillee 14 hours agoparentYeah, for sure. I think for deployment purposes, many times these model conversions are necessary (such as if you don&#x27;t want to use Python).However, I do think these model conversions are often a significant pain for users.So, in some sense, the goal here is to show that the performance component and the \"convert your model for deployment\" component can be disentangled.We also have work on allowing you to \"export\" an AOT-compiled version of your model with torch.compile, and that should allow you to deploy your models to run in other settings. reply andy99 13 hours agorootparentThanks for the reply. \"show that the performance component and the \"convert your model for deployment\" component can be disentangled\" makes sense.Also, I liked the part of the article about torch.compile producing faster matrix-vector multiplication than cublas. I&#x27;ve seen the same thing on CPU, that it&#x27;s way faster to just write and manually optimize a loop over a bunch of dot products than it is to use BLAS routines because of how simple the \"matmul\" actually is. I don&#x27;t know how widely known that is. reply sva_ 10 hours agoprevOfftopic, but what software do they use to create the benchmark flamegraphs?

At some level they each allow you to start a new generation while in the middle of one or more previous generations.Is that possible with \"just\" pytorch? Could it be added to gpt-fast? reply chillee 11 hours agoparentYeah it&#x27;s certainly possible, but it&#x27;s not the focus of this implementation, which is more latency focused (so BS=1). reply lmeyerov 1 hour agorootparentyeah i&#x27;m curious how this would stack up to vllm in a batch settinglong-term, bodes well as both methodologies should be combineable, just curious for current point-in-time wrt being relevant for production use reply chillee 1 hour agorootparentI wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for a batch serving setting today. One crucial optimization for batched serving (which you need if you have a large number of requests) is continual batching, which this implementation doesn&#x27;t have. reply dnnssl2 14 hours agoprevWhat are some of the better use cases of fast inference? From my experience using ChatGPT, I don&#x27;t need it to generate faster than I can read, but waiting for code generation is painful because I&#x27;m waiting for the whole code block to format correctly, be available to copy or execute (in the case of code interpreter). Anything else fall under this pattern? reply lmeyerov 6 hours agoparentMost LLM model use shouldn&#x27;t be &#x27;raw&#x27; but as part of a smart & iterative pipeline. Ex:* reading: If you want it to do inference over a lot of context, you&#x27;ll need to do multiple inferences. If each inference is faster, you can &#x27;read&#x27; more in the same time on the same hardware* thinking: a lot of analytical approaches essentially use writing as both memory & thinking. Imagine iterative summarization, or automatically iteratively refining code until it&#x27;s rightFor louie.ai sessions, that&#x27;s meant a fascinating trade-off here when doing the above:* We can use smarter models like gpt-4 to do fewer iterations...* ... or a faster but dumber model to get more iterations in the same amount of timeIt&#x27;s entirely not obvious. For example, the humaneval leaderboard has gpt4 for code being beat by gpt 3.5 for code when run by a LATS agent: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paperswithcode.com&#x2F;sota&#x2F;code-generation-on-humaneval . This highlights that the agent framework is the one really responsible for final result quality, so their ability to run many iterations in the same time window matters. reply rfw300 13 hours agoparentprevThe main thing is chat is just one application of LLMs. Other applications are much more latency sensitive. Imagine, for instance, an LLM-powered realtime grammar checker in an editor. reply jasonjmcghee 13 hours agoparentprevProgrammatic and multi-step use cases. If you need chain-of-thought or similar, tool use, etc. Generating data.Most use cases outside of classic chat.For example, I made an on-demand educational video project, and the slowest part was by far the content generation. RAG, TTS, Image generation, text rendering, and video processing were all a drop in the bucket, in comparison.It would be an even wider gap now, and TTS is super-realtime, and image generation can be single step. reply ClarityJones 13 hours agoparentprevPerhaps this is naive, but in my mind it can be useful for learning.- Hook LLM to VMs- Ask for code that [counts to 10]- Run code on VM- Ask different LLM to Evaluate Results.- Repeat for sufficient volume.- Train.The faster it can generate results the faster those results can be tested against the real world, e.g. a VM, users on X, other models with known accuracies. reply wedn3sday 14 hours agoparentprevOne obvious use case is that it makes per-token generation much cheaper. reply dnnssl2 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not so much a use case, but I get what you&#x27;re saying. It&#x27;s nice that you can find optimizations to shift down the pareto frontier of across the cost and latency dimension. The hard tradeoffs are for cases like inference batching where it&#x27;s cheaper and higher throughput but slower for the end consumer.What&#x27;s a good use case for an order of magnitude decrease in price per token? Web scale \"analysis\" or cleaning of unstructured data? reply dnnssl2 14 hours agoprevIf you were to serve this on a datacenter server, is the client to server roundtrip networking the slowest part of the inference? Curious if it would be faster to run this cloud GPUs on better hardware but farther compute, or locally with worse hardware. reply chillee 14 hours agoparentSurprisingly, no. And part of this is that text generation is really expensive. Unlike traditional ML inference (like with, resnets), you don&#x27;t just pass your data through your model once. You need to pass it over and over again (once for each token you generate).So, in practice, a full \"text completion request\" can often take on the order of seconds, which dwarfs the clientserver roundtrip. reply dnnssl2 14 hours agorootparentIs this still the case for sliding window attention&#x2F;streaming LLMs, where you have a fixed length attention window rather than infinitely passing in new tokens for quadratic scaling? You even get better performance due to purposely downsampling non-meaningful attention sink tokens. reply chillee 13 hours agorootparentI cover it a bit in the blog post, but unless you have a really long context length (like 32k+), your primary computational cost doesn&#x27;t come from attention but rather from loading your weights from VRAM into registers.I mean, practically speaking, completions from say, ChatGPT or Claude take seconds to finish :) reply dnnssl2 13 hours agoprevHow does one select a good candidate for the draft model in speculative decoding? I imagine that there&#x27;s some better intuition than just selecting the next parameter count down (i.e 70B -> 13B, 13B -> 7B).Also how does that interact with MoE models? Do you have a mini version of the MoE, with smaller experts? reply chillee 13 hours agoparentThis is indeed a bit of a dark art. Essentially, you want a balance between \"is significantly faster than base model\" and \"generates similar stuff to the base model\".Anecdotally, folks often seem to use say, 70B base + 7B as verifier. But I think there&#x27;s a lot of room for experimentation and improvement here.You could... say, take a 70B model and maybe just chop off the last 90% of layers and then fine-tune. Or perhaps you could use a model that&#x27;s trained to generate 8 tokens at once. Or perhaps you could just use statistical \"n-gram\" predictor. reply xmichael909 14 hours agoprevHoly hotdogs, this look amazing. So ahh.

Learn about Serious Eats' Editorial Process Published May 01, 2023 Trending Videos Serious Eats / Amanda Suarez In This Article Expand How to Shop for Avocados How to Know If an Avocado Is Ripe The Best Ways to Ripen Avocados: Tested How to Store Ripe Avocados for Later How to Prevent Avocados From Browning Avocados occupy an interesting place among commercially popular fruits. Unlike most other fruit, avocados do not ripen on the tree—they only begin ripening off the tree after reaching full maturity. But then the race to ripeness is off and running, and, in the case of avocados, that race is relatively quick, with limited opportunities for long-term storage. These two facts put the concerns of commercial avocado growers, shippers, and vendors exactly opposite of those of the home cook. Those in the avocado industry want to find as many ways as possible to delay ripening of the picked fruit for as long as possible, buying them as much time as possible to get the avocados from the filed to your kitchen counter in good condition. Through lots of study, they've become pretty good at that—by lowering temperatures, reducing environmental oxygen and boosting carbon dioxide, shrink-wrapping or waxing the fruit, and other techniques, the avocado industry can manage to keep the fruit in its mature-but-unripe state all the way to the point of sale, despite significant shipping distances and other challenges. The home cook, on the other hand, usually wants to know how the heck to speed up ripening so they can eat the darned thing. This can present a timing challenge when shopping for and eating avocados because, to put it bluntly, perfectly ripe avocados are a pain in the ass to find. The window of time in which they are absolutely perfect—soft and tender with no brown spots or streaks—is notoriously short. It can make planning an avocado-based party a harrowing experience. Will my avocados ripen in time for game day? What if they turn brown? Fortunately, there are a few ways to moderate the rate at which they ripen, and then there are some ways other articles on this topic recommend, but we don't. Read on for more. How to Choose a Quality Avocado When Shopping We've all seen those avocados that seem perfect on the outside, but once you cut into them, a series of deep brown stripes and striations appear. What's up with that? Unfortunately, it's not something that can be predicted or prevented. It's caused by uneven enzymatic action inside the avocado as it's developing and is exacerbated by extreme weather conditions and other seasonal, environmental, and agricultural factors. For Hass avocados, you can expect the likelihood of this phenomenon to increase starting in December and maxing out around February. (Ack, Super Bowl season!) Serious Eats / Amanda Suarez Another common flaw in some avocados are woody strings that stretch through the flesh. These strings are part of the plant's vascular strands, responsible for transporting nutrients into the fruit. They're actually always there, but they only become noticeably woody and stringy later in the season as the avocado becomes more mature. Unfortunately, just as with the brown spots, there's no way to predict which avocados will have these strands until you've cut into it, aside from knowing that the likelihood of encountering them goes up later in the growing season, with fruit harvested in the late summer and early fall (though this will vary depending on the avocado variety and growing region). How to Know If an Avocado Is Ripe While the color of the avocado's skin can change as ripening progresses, that is not a reliable way to determine perfect ripeness, since avocado skin color can vary from variety to variety and fruit to fruit. Better is to gauge ripeness by touch: Using your fingers, very gently press on the avocado near the stem end (that's where the avocado was once attached to the tree). You want to feel a slight tenderness and give. If the avocado is very firm, it's not ready; if it feels soft and mushy, it's gone too far. The Best Ways to Ripen Avocados: Tested Ripening in avocados and many other fruits is regulated by a gas called ethylene. It's produced naturally by the fruit itself and is intended to make sure that all the fruit in one area ripens at the same time. The higher the concentration of ethylene, the faster your fruit ripens. That's why you'll see instructions to leave underripe avocados or bananas in paper bags—it concentrates ethylene and causes fast ripening. Serious Eats / Amanda Suarez Left on its own, it generally takes an underripe avocado somewhere in the range of three-to-five days when stored in a paper bag at room temperature. If you need your avocados sooner, you will need to turn to other fruit. How to Ripen Avocados Quickly In side-by-side tests tests, avocados from the supermarket showing no softness at all take between three-to-five days to ripen in a brown paper bag. Throw a banana in there (an ethylene powerhouse), and you can bring that range down to two-to-three days. It's not instant, but it does give you a wider range of control over having a ripe avocado when you need it. Serious Eats / Amanda Suarez You could, for instance, buy several avocados, leaving some out in the open kitchen air, some in a brown paper bag, and yet a few more in a second brown paper bag with a banana added. By doing so, you'd stagger their ripeness-reaching days, with the banana-ripened avocados ready in a couple days, the paper bag ones a day or two after that, and the open-air ones ready right on the heels of those, assuming they all started at the same stage of un-ripeness. Can You Ripen an Avocado in the Microwave? This is one of those popular internet and social media tips that sound so good, we all just want to believe it's true. You can rapidly ripen an avocado in the microwave?! Thank you, TikTok! But we're sorry to say, having tried it ourselves, it's a terrible method. The truth is, using the microwave (or a low oven for that matter) does not ripen an avocado at all, it cooks it. Indeed, there are similarities between cooking and ripening: In both cases the fruit's flesh softens as cell walls weaken, leading to a more tender texture. On top of that, new flavors and aromas develop. But the way the texture changes, and the nature of the flavor and aroma changes are not comparable between ripening and (even very, very gentle) cooking. While a properly ripened avocado grows buttery and creamy as time passes, a microwaved one becomes slick and sweaty, and soft like a lit candle—overly mushy in the hotter spots and still too firm in others. The flavor of a microwaved avocado, though, is by far its greatest failing. We would describe it as re-warmed, undercooked chicken, a bizarre combination that somehow manages to smell simultaneously of the crudeness of raw poultry and stink of reheated poultry. A microwaved avocado might be easier to chew, but it's not easier to swallow. How to Store Ripe Avocados for Later Once ripened, an avocado will start to produce brown spots and streaks within about two days if left at room temperature. However, refrigerating a ripened avocado can increase that window up to around five days, though avocados are susceptible to chilling damage, so the will begin to show signs of browning if left too long. The best way to guarantee perfect avocados for a Sunday night game? Buy them the Monday before, ripen them at room temperature in a brown paper bag and refrigerate them as soon as they soften. How to Prevent Avocados From Browning What about leftover avocado? Any way to keep it from browning? Oxygen is the enemy of avocados—it's what causes them to turn that unsightly brown. Plastic wrap works alright on cut avocado halves, but even plastic wrap is oxygen-permeable. In our tests, avocados didn't last more than about eight hours wrapped in plastic before visible browning occurred. The old rub-with-oil-and-place-face-down-on-an-oiled-plate works fine if you've got a perfect half of an avocado with a smooth face, but it doesn't help if you've got, say, 3/4 or 1/4 of an avocado. Serious Eats / Amanda Suarez The better short-term solution in that situation? Just submerge the sucker in water. Simply put any unused avocado pieces in a container filled with water in the fridge to keep oxidation at bay, but do note you can't hold them there for long. After several hours, a ripe avocado will begin to grow mushy where water has managed to penetrate it. As for mashed avocado like guacamole, we think the best solution, aside from preparing it right before serving, is to press a double layer of plastic wrap directly against the surface of the avocado mixture. It's not a perfect solution—the avocado will still brown eventually—but you can mix in a minimal amount of browning such that diners won't know, buying yourself at least a few hours before it becomes a problem.

I buy a bag of green ones, and put them in the fridge. They stay green for a while in there but do start to slowly ripen. Before I put them in the fridge on day 0, I put one on the counter, and one in a brown bag. The brown bag is for day 2, the one on the counter is for day 3 (there is no day 1 after day 0, at first). On day 2, when I take the ripe one out of the bag, I take another out of the fridge and put it on the counter for day 4, and continue this process. When I take the last one out of the fridge, I have another bag ready to go in. With the right timing, this provides a perfectly ripe avocado per day.And for storing a cut avocado, the press & seal plastic wrap works wonders. The trick is to not let air touch the exposed bit. If it does, then just slicing a thin slice off the top exposes the green part again. (This also works for frozen loaves of bread that have been cut - just a thin slice off the end gets rid of the bit that was destroyed by ice.)My memoirs will include all my food storage tips for the perpetually single. reply 4death4 11 hours agoparentI find storing the avocados in the fridge causes them to brown without really ripening. I usually buy a bag of 5 and try to eat them over a 3 or 4 day period starting when the first one ripens. Fresh Direct also sells packs of 2 ripe avocados. So you can buy 2 ripe avocados and a bag of hard avocados, eat the ripe ones, and then the hard ones should be ripe enough to eat. reply kenhwang 11 hours agorootparentMy avocado tree usually drops a dozen or two avocados a week for most of the year, so I&#x27;ve had a lot of time and examples to experiment on for storage.Once they&#x27;re off the tree, ripen at room temperature for about a week.

The pit will stick in one half.Chop the pit with the knife (but not enough to cut it in half!) Twist to remove the pit.Or just search Youtube for \"pit avocado Martha Stewart\" who demonstrates this better than I can explain it in about 15s. reply mindslight 6 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve seen the technique of using the knife to rotate the pit, but I don&#x27;t really do it because I&#x27;m generally happy with radial pieces so cutting the pit half into quarters isn&#x27;t a problem. I also just generally have one avocado at a time, so I&#x27;m not going for speed (as one would say making guac).But my point was that unless you actually slice the pit in half, neither half is going to have a flat face that you can put on a plate of oil or whatever. Rather one half is going to have the pit sticking out, and the other half is going to have a pit shaped indentation that doesn&#x27;t touch the oil. reply planede 25 minutes agorootparentI guess the indentation only interacts with the little oxygen that is trapped there, which might not be enough to substantially brown it. replycrazygringo 16 hours agoprevTrying to change the rate at which avocados ripen is way beyond anything I would ever worry about. Because I can&#x27;t even tell when they&#x27;re ripe! The article is spot-on when it says (emphasis mine):> \"The window of time in which they are absolutely perfect—soft and tender with no brown spots or streaks—is notoriously short.\"But then it claims:> \"...gauge ripeness by touch: Using your fingers, very gently press on the avocado near the stem end (that&#x27;s where the avocado was once attached to the tree). You want to feel a slight tenderness and give. If the avocado is very firm, it&#x27;s not ready; if it feels soft and mushy, it&#x27;s gone too far.\"I have gotten this wrong so many times that it seems like useless advice. The skin of the avocado is so stiff and wrinkly by the stem end, you simply cannot tell. By the time you apply enough force to feel through the skin, you&#x27;re going to explode the avocado.But if you try pressing against the side, where you can sometimes feel the level of hardness&#x2F;softness more accurately (if it is a particularly thin-skinned one), you bruise it.I&#x27;m an expert in the kitchen at basically everything else, but trying to figure out if an avocado is ripe or not just absolutely defeats me. I&#x27;ve routinely cut into an avocado I thought was underripe, only to discover it&#x27;s so over-ripe it&#x27;s inedible, because the skin all over is so darn tough that the whole thing simply felt rock-hard all over. It&#x27;s like fossilized reptile skin.How does anyone do it? I&#x27;m talking about regular Hass avocados bought in the northeast US shipped from Mexico.At the end of the day, I just buy a few, wait 3 days, cut into one, and if it&#x27;s ripe I try to eat the rest quickly. If not, I throw it out, wait another couple days, and repeat. Ugh. reply hobofan 11 hours agoparentIf you want to go for a over-the-top techy solution you could do non-destructive testing with a near-infrared handheld spectrometer. It&#x27;s a pretty neat technique that can determine ripeness of a lot of fruits (and properties of other materials) if that can be detected via abundance of certain molecules.It looks though that Consumer Physics stopped selling their SCiO device that was ~$250 to consumers, and I don&#x27;t know if there is any equivalent current alternative. reply gorgoiler 6 hours agorootparentLots of consumer cameras have near infrared sensitivity, mostly 750nm but with a long exposure I can get photographs through a 900nm filter in my Fuji X-Pro. You lose at least four stops.Could the photography technique work to determine ripeness? Assuming the fruit is fairly motionless of course. reply hobofan 2 hours agorootparentI have to admit I&#x27;m not the biggest expert on it. I mainly know about it because my brother wrote his PhD thesis about using portable Vis&#x2F;NIR spectrometers as food checkers (verifying that they perform on par with expensive desktop spectrometers).He showed me the SCiO in person a few times, and IIRC always had to make direct contact with the solid probe, so I&#x27;d be surprised if a NIR photograph would be a suitable substitute. I think it also mainly measures the area of the fruit where you make contact, so to get an optimal picture about the ripeness of a single fruit it&#x27;s good to take multiple measurements. That also usually makes fruits with tick skins&#x2F;shells (e.g. melons) hard to measure.There seems to be a startup[0] aiming to bring suitable sensors to smartphones so that anyone has access to it - something that the food checker research literature has been hinting at for some time.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mantispectra.com reply gorgoiler 1 hour agorootparentThinking about it a little more, it might have some mileage. The IR spectrometer is just measuring the color of the avocado, albeit very precisely and under known lighting conditions.One of the reasons photographers enjoy infrared photography¹ is because foliage shows up brilliant white against pitch black² skies³. Photosynthesis is inhibited by both green and IR light so plants are bright in IR for the same reason our eyes see it as green.I absolutely think that you could get the same result with a flash photograph from a good modern camera and probably just using the green channel. One of the many things these cameras are designed to be good at is detecting minute subtleties in shades of green⁴.I’m looking forward to trying it on the weekend.―1. Traditionally done with a monochromatic black and white film where only deep, bright reds gave the negative any density, rendering as brightness in a positive print. This is in contrast to “panchro” black and white where a bright object of any color would print as white.2. Unlike blue light, the atmosphere disperses almost no infrared.3. A good example of all of the above is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fineartamerica.com&#x2F;featured&#x2F;infrared-willow-tree-stu...4. Our eye’s sensitive to green is partly why digital cameras have twice as many green sensors as they do red and blue.

That is several thousand avocados.I can say with absolute conviction that it isn&#x27;t the rind giving you trouble. I can pick every ripe Hass avocado out of a bin of 50, and never once be wrong. That said, there are a couple of stores in my current area that have garbage Hass avocados. The ones I buy from this store are consistently gross and fibrous, even when ripe, and have a very short window. I boycott these stores. They either have a second rate supplier, or else somehow ruin the product in transport.By the way, you need a gentle touch and the ability very slowly, smoothly increase pressure. You pick up the avocados that are not yet ripe, the moment one is on the threshold, such that there is a nearly imperceptible give which does not bounce back, you buy the avocado. It should not bruise the fruit, and you won&#x27;t be able to detect it when peeled. After this check, you can visually tell when it has fully ripened, ~1-2 days later.

If you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s impossible to tell by hardness then it wouldn&#x27;t work. But you might find that it&#x27;s more sensitive than your fingers and so it can work?I would be interested to know the result of a durometer test on your fruits because about 85% of consumers report firmness as a useful measure - a lot but certainly not everyone.

Currently, diffusion models have become the mainstream in visual generation research, owing to their robust generative capabilities. However, challenges persist in the realm of image-to-video, especially in character animation, where temporally maintaining consistency with detailed information from character remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we leverage the power of diffusion models and propose a novel framework tailored for character animation. To preserve consistency of intricate appearance features from reference image, we design ReferenceNet to merge detail features via spatial attention. To ensure controllability and continuity, we introduce an efficient pose guider to direct character's movements and employ an effective temporal modeling approach to ensure smooth inter-frame transitions between video frames. By expanding the training data, our approach can animate arbitrary characters, yielding superior results in character animation compared to other image-to-video methods. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on benchmarks for fashion video and human dance synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art results. Video Method The overview of our method. The pose sequence is initially encoded using Pose Guider and fused with multi-frame noise, followed by the Denoising UNet conducting the denoising process for video generation. The computational block of the Denoising UNet consists of Spatial-Attention, Cross-Attention, and Temporal-Attention, as illustrated in the dashed box on the right. The integration of reference image involves two aspects. Firstly, detailed features are extracted through ReferenceNet and utilized for Spatial-Attention. Secondly, semantic features are extracted through the CLIP image encoder for Cross-Attention. Temporal-Attention operates in the temporal dimension. Finally, the VAE decoder decodes the result into a video clip. Animating Various Characters Human Anime/Cartoon Humanoid Comparisons Fashion Video Synthesis Fashion Video Synthesis aims to turn fashion photographs into realistic, animated videos using a driving pose sequence. Experiments are conducted on the UBC fashion video dataset with same training data. Human Dance Generation Human Dance Generation focuses on animating images in real-world dance scenarios. Experiments are conducted on the TikTok dataset with same training data.

This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen AI generate convincing human movement. (And the folds of fabric in dresses seem to move realistically too!)Of course, the actual movement skeleton is coming from presumably real motion-capture, but still.I&#x27;m curious what the current state is of generating the movement skeletons, which obviously has a ton of relevance to video games. Where&#x27;s the progress in models where you can type \"a burly man stands with erect posture, then crouches down and sneaks five steps forward, then freezes in fear\" and output an appropriate movement skeleton? reply netruk44 11 hours agoparentThe input poses appear to be generated from OpenPose [0], which uses regular images as input. With the creation of stable diffusion video, you could theoretically prompt it to make a video of what you wanted, then run it through OpenPose.But I think the more realistic approach is to take a video of yourself doing the motions you want the AI to generate, and run that through OpenPose instead.Using just words leaves a lot to the model’s interpretation. I feel like you might wind up spending a lot of time manually fixing little things, similar to how you might infill the “wrong” parts of an AI generated image. It might be easier to just take a 15 second video to get the exact skeleton animation you want.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab&#x2F;openpose reply anonylizard 11 hours agoparentprevThis is already highly, highly relevant for 2d animation.Many complex moves (especially dancing) are filmed in video first, then the movement is traced over by hand. This is called Rotoscoping.This is basically auto-rotoscoping, and I expect it to see commercial usage within popular high budget projects within 2 years. Previously, even the highest budget anime couldn&#x27;t really afford 2d dance scenes due to the insane drawings required. reply Tanoc 7 hours agorootparentRotoscoping is directly tracing from film frame by frame. Most of the time animators instead use what are called reference key poses. For extremely stylized characters it can be difficult if not impossible to use rotoscoping for complex sequences because the proportions make the motions impossible. Instead specific frames where there&#x27;s resting motion in the sequence are pulled, and the animators translate the positions of the joints to the unusual silhouette of the character for the key frames. The Castlevania and Masters Of The Universe: Revelation series from Netflix use this quite a bit for realistic characters -- it was heavily used during the Trevor and Death fight and Skelegod versus Savage He-Man fight -- and Rise Of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and High Guardian Spice used it for their stylized characters for perspective and fight scenes.If this technology can instead be used to not only find the key poses but also roughly determine the inbetweens for a heavily stylized character like Rocko Wallaby or Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup then it is extremely useful. reply sircastor 9 hours agorootparentprevAs I recall, Ralph Bakshi used this to mixed effect back in the 70s with The Lord of The Rings animated films. reply COAGULOPATH 10 hours agoparentprevIt still doesn&#x27;t look ready for primetime to me. When the characters&#x27; hands move, they either gain a billion extra fingers or morph into fleshy shapeless clubs. It&#x27;s just hard to tell because the size of the video samples are small and poor quality. At 1080p, it would look extremely bad. reply sp0rk 8 hours agorootparentThe individual example videos are nearly 1080p (1024 height) and they look pretty good to me. There is some glitchiness on the hands but it&#x27;s very minor and could definitely be fixed easily in post-production or through further refinements. In fact, if you play the high resolution videos and pause at random points, it&#x27;s hard to even find a frame where there are extra fingers, though there are a few. reply lukew3 11 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think that text to movement will be desired. There is a lot of room for interpretation there, and if a creator already has a vision for movement, they would probably choose to have the model mimic a video of them acting rather than trying to get lucky and correctly describe a set of movements. reply crazygringo 10 hours agorootparentTo the contrary, I think text-to-movement is going to be huge for videogames especially.I don&#x27;t see any other way to smoothly link 1,000 possible movements to and from each other, including when there are various fixed distances between you and a ladder or ledge etc.I think models will learn \"movement personalities\" the same way they learn a particular celebrity&#x27;s voice -- everybody moves with different rhythms. So your big burly action-hero character will move with a totally different rhythm from your waif-thin ethereal elf.But there will still be a textual vocabluary that generates the motion -- \"stealthily creeps to the door 2.2 meters away, taking 6.3 seconds, and then suddenly and dramatically opens it with a flourish\". reply spookie 6 hours agorootparentInverse kinematics have been solving most of the animation blending you&#x27;re describing here for years. Not to dismiss completely the potential of this, but there already pretty good, reliable ways to solve these issues.

I do think that AI will be the end of animators who do nothing but inbetweens though. Considering the huge amount of skilled work involved and the low pay maybe that&#x27;s a good thing, but it could also make it harder to develop and discover amazing animators. reply tobr 12 hours agoprevThat’s quite astonishing.

Usually releasing Github hosted project page and a repository with the same information, then releasing the code on that repo afterwards at some point.I don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s an issue. A lot more people are able to see what&#x27;s happening on the bleeding edge than if they&#x27;d just release the paper without accompanying demo page, and faster than if they&#x27;d wait for the code to be ready for release?

Because of this, you will often find that Chinese citizens will use approved (or at least unrestricted) services like GitHub pages.Having worked closely with many businesses based in China due to my hobbies, I have noted that services like Google Docs and Drive are favored for this reason.I would guess there are ways to host content like this more easily on platforms that are only accessible within China or are not navigable without the user understanding Chinese language.I would also guess that this is part of the reason why services that target customers in China tend to become “super apps” that combine several services that non-Chinese users would expect to find on disparate sites. For example, services may combine a social media style newsfeed&#x2F;interaction API, banking, email, shopping, and food delivery into a single platform. reply nprateem 7 hours agorootparentAI-generated? reply octagons 4 hours agorootparentNope, but I can see why you’d think that. Honestly, I wanted to choose my words carefully because of the often politically charged tone that can often be interpreted&#x2F;intended when uttering the word “China.”I studied Chinese language, art, history, politics, and culture in university and lived in Shanghai after graduating. While I lived there, I helped some friends setup some domains for hosted GMail&#x2F;e-commerce and learned some interesting things about business there.I also spend some of my spare time finding vulnerabilities in hardware devices and building my own small electronics&#x2F;maker projects.

    "title": "Marker: Efficiently Convert PDF to Markdown with Higher Accuracy",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker",
    "originBody": "Marker Marker converts PDF, EPUB, and MOBI to markdown. It's 10x faster than nougat, more accurate on most documents, and has low hallucination risk. Support for a range of PDF documents (optimized for books and scientific papers) Removes headers/footers/other artifacts Converts most equations to latex Formats code blocks and tables Support for multiple languages (although most testing is done in English). See settings.py for a language list. Works on GPU, CPU, or MPS How it works Marker is a pipeline of deep learning models: Extract text, OCR if necessary (heuristics, tesseract) Detect page layout (layout segmenter, column detector) Clean and format each block (heuristics, nougat) Combine blocks and postprocess complete text (heuristics, pdf_postprocessor) Relying on autoregressive forward passes to generate text is slow and prone to hallucination/repetition. From the nougat paper: We observed [repetition] in 1.5% of pages in the test set, but the frequency increases for out-of-domain documents. In my anecdotal testing, repetitions happen on 5%+ of out-of-domain (non-arXiv) pages. Nougat is an amazing model, but I wanted a faster and more general purpose solution. Marker is 10x faster and has low hallucination risk because it only passes equation blocks through an LLM forward pass. Examples PDF Type Marker Nougat Think Python Textbook View View Think OS Textbook View View Switch Transformers arXiv paper View View Multi-column CNN arXiv paper View View Performance The above results are with marker and nougat setup so they each take ~3GB of VRAM on an A6000. See below for detailed speed and accuracy benchmarks, and instructions on how to run your own benchmarks. Installation This has been tested on Mac and Linux (Ubuntu and Debian). You'll need python 3.9+ and poetry. First, clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker.git cd marker Linux Install system requirements Optional: Install tesseract 5 by following these instructions or running scripts/install/tesseract_5_install.sh. Install ghostscript > 9.55 by following these instructions or running scripts/install/ghostscript_install.sh. Install other requirements with cat scripts/install/apt-requirements.txtxargs sudo apt-get install -y Set the tesseract data folder path Find the tesseract data folder tessdata with find / -name tessdata. Make sure to use the one corresponding to the latest tesseract version if you have multiple. Create a local.env file in the root marker folder with TESSDATA_PREFIX=/path/to/tessdata inside it Install python requirements poetry install poetry shell to activate your poetry venv Update pytorch since poetry doesn't play nicely with it GPU only: run pip install torch to install other torch dependencies. CPU only: Uninstall torch, then follow the CPU install instructions. Mac Install system requirements from scripts/install/brew-requirements.txt Set the tesseract data folder path Find the tesseract data folder tessdata with brew list tesseract Create a local.env file in the root marker folder with TESSDATA_PREFIX=/path/to/tessdata inside it Install python requirements poetry install poetry shell to activate your poetry venv Usage First, some configuration: Set your torch device in the local.env file. For example, TORCH_DEVICE=cuda or TORCH_DEVICE=mps. cpu is the default. If using GPU, set INFERENCE_RAM to your GPU VRAM (per GPU). For example, if you have 16 GB of VRAM, set INFERENCE_RAM=16. Depending on your document types, marker's average memory usage per task can vary slightly. You can configure VRAM_PER_TASK to adjust this if you notice tasks failing with GPU out of memory errors. By default, the final editor model is off. Turn it on with ENABLE_EDITOR_MODEL. Inspect the settings in marker/settings.py. You can override any settings in the local.env file, or by setting environment variables. Convert a single file Run convert_single.py, like this: python convert_single.py /path/to/file.pdf /path/to/output.md --parallel_factor 2 --max_pages 10 --parallel_factor is how much to increase batch size and parallel OCR workers by. Higher numbers will take more VRAM and CPU, but process faster. Set to 1 by default. --max_pages is the maximum number of pages to process. Omit this to convert the entire document. Make sure the DEFAULT_LANG setting is set appropriately for your document. Convert multiple files Run convert.py, like this: python convert.py /path/to/input/folder /path/to/output/folder --workers 10 --max 10 --metadata_file /path/to/metadata.json --min_length 10000 --workers is the number of pdfs to convert at once. This is set to 1 by default, but you can increase it to increase throughput, at the cost of more CPU/GPU usage. Parallelism will not increase beyond INFERENCE_RAM / VRAM_PER_TASK if you're using GPU. --max is the maximum number of pdfs to convert. Omit this to convert all pdfs in the folder. --metadata_file is an optional path to a json file with metadata about the pdfs. If you provide it, it will be used to set the language for each pdf. If not, DEFAULT_LANG will be used. The format is: --min_length is the minimum number of characters that need to be extracted from a pdf before it will be considered for processing. If you're processing a lot of pdfs, I recommend setting this to avoid OCRing pdfs that are mostly images. (slows everything down) { \"pdf1.pdf\": {\"language\": \"English\"}, \"pdf2.pdf\": {\"language\": \"Spanish\"}, ... } Convert multiple files on multiple GPUs Run chunk_convert.sh, like this: MIN_LENGTH=10000 METADATA_FILE=../pdf_meta.json NUM_DEVICES=4 NUM_WORKERS=15 bash chunk_convert.sh ../pdf_in ../md_out METADATA_FILE is an optional path to a json file with metadata about the pdfs. See above for the format. NUM_DEVICES is the number of GPUs to use. Should be 2 or greater. NUM_WORKERS is the number of parallel processes to run on each GPU. Per-GPU parallelism will not increase beyond INFERENCE_RAM / VRAM_PER_TASK. MIN_LENGTH is the minimum number of characters that need to be extracted from a pdf before it will be considered for processing. If you're processing a lot of pdfs, I recommend setting this to avoid OCRing pdfs that are mostly images. (slows everything down) Benchmarks Benchmarking PDF extraction quality is hard. I've created a test set by finding books and scientific papers that have a pdf version and a latex source. I convert the latex to text, and compare the reference to the output of text extraction methods. Benchmarks show that marker is 10x faster than nougat, and more accurate outside arXiv (nougat was trained on arXiv data). We show naive text extraction (pulling text out of the pdf with no processing) for comparison. Speed Method Average Score Time per page Time per document naive 0.350727 0.00152378 0.326524 marker 0.641062 0.360622 77.2762 nougat 0.629211 3.77259 808.413 Accuracy First 3 are non-arXiv books, last 3 are arXiv papers. Method switch_trans.pdf crowd.pdf multicolcnn.pdf thinkos.pdf thinkdsp.pdf thinkpython.pdf naive 0.244114 0.140669 0.0868221 0.366856 0.412521 0.468281 marker 0.482091 0.466882 0.537062 0.754347 0.78825 0.779536 nougat 0.696458 0.552337 0.735099 0.655002 0.645704 0.650282 Peak GPU memory usage during the benchmark is 3.3GB for nougat, and 3.1GB for marker. Benchmarks were run on an A6000. Throughput Marker takes about 2GB of VRAM on average per task, so you can convert 24 documents in parallel on an A6000. Running your own benchmarks You can benchmark the performance of marker on your machine. First, download the benchmark data here and unzip. Then run benchmark.py like this: python benchmark.py data/pdfs data/references report.json --nougat This will benchmark marker against other text extraction methods. It sets up batch sizes for nougat and marker to use a similar amount of GPU RAM for each. Omit --nougat to exclude nougat from the benchmark. I don't recommend running nougat on CPU, since it is very slow. Limitations PDF is a tricky format, so marker will not always work perfectly. Here are some known limitations that are on the roadmap to address: Marker will convert fewer equations to latex than nougat. This is because it has to first detect equations, then convert them without hallucation. Whitespace and indentations are not always respected. Not all lines/spans will be joined properly. Only languages similar to English (Spanish, French, German, Russian, etc) are supported. Languages with different character sets (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc) are not. This works best on digital PDFs that won't require a lot of OCR. It's optimized for speed, and limited OCR is used to fix errors. Commercial usage Due to the licensing of the underlying models like layoutlmv3 and nougat, this is only suitable for noncommercial usage. I'm building a version that can be used commercially, by stripping out the dependencies below. If you would like to get early access, email me at marker@vikas.sh. Here are the non-commercial/restrictive dependencies: LayoutLMv3: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 . Source Nougat: CC-BY-NC . Source PyMuPDF - GPL . Source Other dependencies/datasets are openly licensed (doclaynet, byt5), or used in a way that is compatible with commercial usage (ghostscript). Thanks This work would not have been possible without amazing open source models and datasets, including (but not limited to): Nougat from Meta Layoutlmv3 from Microsoft DocLayNet from IBM ByT5 from Google Thank you to the authors of these models and datasets for making them available to the community!",

(again, only complaining because it&#x27;s a model designed for academic documents).For anyone trying to do OCR on any pdf with math in it, definitely do try nougat. It&#x27;s very easy to install (just a python package), and extracts the math, text, tables and beyond (in a .mmd file) with a single command line command.

Schulze Buschoff, Elif Akata, Matthias Bethge, Eric Schulz Download PDF Abstract:A chief goal of artificial intelligence is to build machines that think like people. Yet it has been argued that deep neural network architectures fail to accomplish this. Researchers have asserted these models' limitations in the domains of causal reasoning, intuitive physics, and intuitive psychology. Yet recent advancements, namely the rise of large language models, particularly those designed for visual processing, have rekindled interest in the potential to emulate human-like cognitive abilities. This paper evaluates the current state of vision-based large language models in the domains of intuitive physics, causal reasoning, and intuitive psychology. Through a series of controlled experiments, we investigate the extent to which these modern models grasp complex physical interactions, causal relationships, and intuitive understanding of others' preferences. Our findings reveal that, while these models demonstrate a notable proficiency in processing and interpreting visual data, they still fall short of human capabilities in these areas. The models exhibit a rudimentary understanding of physical laws and causal relationships, but their performance is hindered by a lack of deeper insights-a key aspect of human cognition. Furthermore, in tasks requiring an intuitive theory of mind, the models fail altogether. Our results emphasize the need for integrating more robust mechanisms for understanding causality, physical dynamics, and social cognition into modern-day, vision-based language models, and point out the importance of cognitively-inspired benchmarks.

All these tests are simple single prompt experiments, so the LLM&#x27;s get no chance to reason about their responses. They&#x27;re just system 1 thinking, the equivalent of putting a gun to someone&#x27;s head and asking them to solve a large division in 2 seconds.I bet a lot of these experiments would already solvable by putting the LLM in a simple loop with some helper prompts that make it restructure and validate its answers, form theories and get to explore multiple lines of thought.If an LLM would be able to do that in a single prompt, without a loop (so the LLM always answers in a predictable amount of time), then it would mean its entire reasoning structure is repeated horizontally through the layers of its architecture. That would be both limiting (i.e. limit the depth of the reasoning to the width of the network) and very expensive to train. reply Androider 16 hours agoparentThe equivalent for a human would be an reflexive response to a question, the kind you could immediately answer after being woken up at 3am in the morning. That type of answer has been deeply trained into the human networks and also requires no deep insight.But if a human is allowed time and internal reasoning iterations, so should the LLM when determining if it has deep insight. Right now we&#x27;re simply observing input -> output of LLMs, the equivalent of snap answers from a human. But nothing says it couldn&#x27;t instead be an input -> extensive internal dialogue, maybe even between multiple expert models for seconds, minutes or hours, that are not at all visible to the prompter -> final insightful answer. Maybe future LLMs will say, \"let me get back to you on that\". reply lukev 13 hours agorootparentCompletely agree.From a computer science point of view: a single prompt&#x2F;response cycle from a LLM is equivalent to a pure function; the answer is a function of the prompt and the model weights and is fundamentally reducible to solving a big math equation (in which each model parameter is a term.)It seems almost self evident that \"reasoning\" worthy of the name would involve some sort of iterative&#x2F;recursive search process, invoking the model and storing&#x2F;reflecting&#x2F;improving on answers methodically.There&#x27;s been a lot of movement in this direction with tree-of-thought&#x2F;chain-of-thought&#x2F;graph-of-thought prompting, and I would bet that if&#x2F;when we get AGI, it&#x27;s a result of getting the right recursive prompting pattern + retrieval patterns + ensemble models figured out, not just making ever-more-powerful transformer models (thought that would certainly play a role too.)The LLM isn&#x27;t the whole brain. Just the area responsible for language and cultural memory. reply kaba0 13 hours agorootparentIdeally a recursive execution would also be a pure function - maybe a better way to put it about current LLMs is that they are a single mathematical expression being built up from a fix number of nodes and only addition and multiplication. reply lukev 12 hours agorootparentyes, except the \"reasoning\" process should also be able to look up facts (retrieval) and invoke external tools, making it non-pure. reply Scubabear68 9 hours agorootparentAgree. I am not an expert on AGI, but I suspect this route is a dead end because I believe true AGI requires interaction with an external environment to learn eg there needs to be a feedback loop to external things that it can interact with and learn from.“You learn best from your mistakes” comes to mind here.And not just shallow feedback loops but bigger, more profound ones eg “I didn’t go to work for a month and so I was fired and and now I have no money and it will now be hard to be hired again”. reply I_Am_Nous 14 hours agorootparentprevThis reminds me of The Last Question by Isaac Asimov. I also think if we stopped expecting all LLMs to have an immediate answer, it would be relatively easy to shim some kind of \"conscience\" to direct the output in different ways. Similar to the safeties already in place in LLMs, but instead of it just saying \"NO DON&#x27;T SAY THAT\" it can dialog internally to change what the output is until it reaches what it believes to be the agreed upon best answer. reply mr_toad 11 hours agorootparent> I also think if we stopped expecting all LLMs to have an immediate answer, it would be relatively easy to shim some kind of \"conscience\" to direct the output in different ways.If the shim was just another AI, then how do you align that AI?

A smaller AI with a rather limited parameter count could be trained for individual needs so some things (chat moderation) might be easier to do than other things (fact check peer reviewed papers in a verifiable way).

That&#x27;s why I described the extra bits as a \"conscience\" which could enforce the three laws. Maybe the three laws are the internal conscience&#x27;s context prompt while the main LLM is more able to think anything in general and then the output is tuned down by the conscience?Otherwise the laws will have to be implemented as weights or during training so the model explicitly knows the laws and would never even be capable of doing something against them. reply pixl97 13 hours agorootparentI mean, the whole purpose of the I, Robot story was to show you that the 3 laws didn&#x27;t work.

A rather general, smoothed out and still neurotic one probably. But still just like an LLM can&#x27;t be expected to have a specific knowledge of hydraulics, it also has read more hydraulics than even experts might be expected to. That&#x27;s the entire issue about it, right? This issue of \"is most of our mind basically just mixing and matching stuff we have seen, read, heard?\" Do humans have some magical theory of mind that somehow stands ASIDE from all the \"normal\" learned stuff?Of course, yes, we do know one thing that&#x27;s missing in LLMs, which is \"loop and helpers\" like you describe. Which I&#x27;m sure many people are currently hacking at - one way being for the LLM to talk to itself.But as for \"a theory of mind\", if enough writings served as input, then LLMs do have plenty of that.Another question is whether LLMs are raised to behave like humans (which might be where they most NEED some theory of mind). Of course not. The ones we know most about are only question answerers. The theory of mind they might have (that is not negated by the lack of loop and internal deliberation) may be overwhelmed by the pre- and post-processing: \"no sex, no murder plots, talk to the human like they are 5, bla bla bla\". And yet you can ask things like \"Tell it like you are speaking to 5 year olds who want to have a fun time\". Some theory of mind makes it through. reply lixy 14 hours agoparentprevYep, prototype exactly that this past week. With a strong instruction spec prompt from the start, you can have an AI come up with a much better answer by making sure it knows it has time to answer the questions and how it should approach the problem in stages.The great part is with clear enough directions it also knows how to evaluate whether its done or not. reply twobitshifter 13 hours agoparentprevThere are plenty of models that use introspection and check answers, that’s the idea behind let’s think about it step by step. reply tinco 13 hours agorootparentI feel the \"let&#x27;s think about it step by step\" is a bit of a hack. To circumvent the fact that there&#x27;s no external loop you use the fact that it gets re-run on every token so you can store a bit of state in the tokens that it&#x27;s already generated.Or am I misunderstanding something about that technique? reply twobitshifter 13 hours agorootparentYou are right, it’s sometimes called zero shot chain of thought, but it’s a way of getting the type of thing you are describing to happen. The LLMs somehow process things in a perceived step by step to get a much improved answer. Whether the external loop or an llm imposed internal loop, does it matter? Are our own minds looping or just adding tokens? reply tinco 12 hours agorootparentYeah that&#x27;s true, and I do believe there&#x27;s a good chance our minds are perpetually adding tokens. But our minds also have an efficient&#x2F;effective way of dealing with the context cut off. We don&#x27;t have (or we don&#x27;t experience) a hard cut off of our memory context. Instead the tokens are increasingly lossily compressed as they age out of our memory, the lossiness amount being based both on time passed but also on some fancy value function. And that combined with a \"system\" (or trained&#x2F;fine-tuned in) prompt that motivates the LLM to reason in a way that is conducive to working with that kind of memory would be a sort of single-shot AGI system. Where single-shot is lying a bit because it&#x27;s just infinitely looping.I guess from that perspective it might make sense to test if such a thing is already happening in current LLM&#x27;s and my dismissive attitude stems from the fact that I&#x27;ve played with them enough to know that they currently don&#x27;t. reply vidarh 11 hours agorootparentprevThe main thing that may matter, at least in the short run, is that an external loop allows us to inject additional steps by applying heuristics and allowing tool use. E.g. we can let the LLM \"realise\" there errors in its code and have it continue from an injected \"thought\" about making sure to fix the errors from the compiler before presenting it&#x27;s output, or \"remembering\" that it needs test cases etc.We can also potentially add longer term memory - summarise the context, and judge which parts are important and stuff them in a vector store, and now and again swap in similar pieces of past context.But of course it&#x27;s not either or - better prompting to get the LLMs to do better from the start doesn&#x27;t compete with then feeding that into an external loop as well. reply uoaei 16 hours agoparentprev> They&#x27;re just system 1 thinking, the equivalent of putting a gun to someone&#x27;s head and asking them to solve a large division in 2 seconds.No, it&#x27;s the equivalent of putting a gun to someone&#x27;s head and asking them \"what are my intentions?\" Which is readily available to any being with a theory of mind. reply choudharism 15 hours agorootparentI don’t think LLMs have theory of mind, but your point is not very strong.

A quantitative measure! Here&#x27;s our meal ticket to being recognized as a science instead of those quacks from Vienna\", with far too much at stake to either question the many assumptions at play or the inconsistent history of usage.Momentum takes hold and the public takes the word into its everyday vernacular, even while it&#x27;s still not a clear and sound concept in its technical domain. [Most of this is history is more academically covered in Danziger&#x27;s 1987 \"Naming the Mind\" which is excellent, and critical foundational reading to contextualize recent hot discussions in AI]The way you&#x27;re using it when you worry about \"super-intelligence\" is in the sense of intelligence being some universal, unbounded, quantitative independent variable along the lines of \"the more intelligent something is, the more cunningly it can pursue some rationalized goal\" -- some master strategist.That&#x27;s fine, and you&#x27;re not alone in that, but there&#x27;s not really any sound scientific groundwork to establish that there exists some quality of the world that scales like that. You&#x27;re fear, and what you try to distinguish conceptually from what the paper addresses, is an inductive leap made from highly unstable ground. It&#x27;s in the same invented, purely abstract idea-space of \"omnipotence\" or \"omniscience\" where one takes a practical idea like \"power to influence\" or \"ability to know fact\" and inductively draws a line from these practical senses towards some abstract infinite&#x2F;incomprehensible version of that thing. But that inductive leap a Platonic logician&#x27;s parlor trick and ends up raising all kinds of abstract paradoxes, as well countless physical impracticalities about how such things could exist.So a lot of people (academic and lay) just aren&#x27;t with you in taking that framing of intelligence very seriously. For many, an \"super-intelligent\" software whose \"motives\" we don&#x27;t understand is just a program that produces incorrect outputs and ought to be debugged or retired, and the more interesting questions around machine \"intelligence\" are practical ones like \"what tasks are these programs well-suited for\". Here, the authors point out that the current batch of programs are not good at tasks that benefit from a theory of mind.Knowing the answer to that kind of question reaches back to the earliest and least disputable sense of the word, where we saw that some new students and soldiers excelled at certain tasks and struggled with others, and wanted to understand how best to educated&#x2F;assign them. And likewise, as we look at these tools, the pressing question for engineers and businesses is \"what are they good for and what are they not good for\" rather than the fantastical \"what if we make a broken program and it wants to kill everyone and we don&#x27;t notice and forget to shut it off\" reply thewakalix 15 hours agorootparent> and it wants to kill everyoneIt wouldn&#x27;t have to want to kill everyone.

Moreover, it&#x27;s certainly true that \"AI safety analysts\" takes intelligence as a sort magic wand term and this seems to drive their arguments.All that said, since both computers and human brains are material artifacts, it doesn&#x27;t seem impossible to create a device that combines their properties. It seems plausible that such a thing could have a variety of dangers.For many, an \"super-intelligent\" software whose \"motives\" we don&#x27;t understand is just a program that produces incorrect outputs and ought to be debugged or retired, and the more interesting questions around machine \"intelligence\" are practical ones like \"what tasks are these programs well-suited for\".We saw early Bing Chat behave, not in ways we couldn&#x27;t understand but like a deranged and vengeful human. Certainly, it was merely simulating human behavior but if today&#x27;s methods produce artifacts that unselectively amplify human behaviors, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine problems appearing.We can hope that there&#x27;s a fundamental difference between programs that simulate human language and programs able to plan and carry out long term goals (and carrying out long term goals is something people do so there&#x27;s no good reason some kind of program couldn&#x27;t do that).I think you&#x27;re right that particular weirdness of the \"doomers\" makes some other portion of the population dismiss concerns. But that isn&#x27;t an argument that the doom isn&#x27;t possible - it should be an argument to clarify how we talk of computation and human capacities (see, I don&#x27;t to say \"intelligence\" unless I want to). reply kens 15 hours agorootparentprev> It [the word \"intelligence\"] doesn&#x27;t appear until the early 20th centuryI&#x27;m not sure what you mean here, since the word dates back to the late 14th century with roughly the same meaning as now.

It&#x27;s good for showing when a word was attested and where to start looking for an understanding of how it was used and considered.Where you say \"roughly the same meaning as now\" you seem to mean that \"the highest faculty of the mind, capacity for comprehending general truths;\" is how we think of intelligence now, but the meanings of \"mind\", \"truth\" \"comprehending\" and \"faculties of mind\" have all had their own radical shifts over the last 600 years. That quoted phrase conveys an entirely different perspective and set of assumptions&#x2F;implications in the context of its time, and is not at all analogous to how we read it today.Raymond Williams&#x27; \"Keywords\" collects a very interesting and accessible collection of examples of this phenomenon, although it focuses more on the language of politics and society more than the language of psychology.The modern use of intelligence, and the conceptual constellation it represents, is essentially isolated from what&#x27;s described in that article, but it&#x27;s re-introduction in modern psychology does borrow from its prior existence in the lexicon. reply og_kalu 15 hours agorootparentprevThere does seem to be a general factor of intelligence in humans though that is the single biggest indicator of performance.

Software, algorithms, digital data, optimization models. All well-defined (and comprehensible to an AGI, by definition) - unlike our own minds, which were not made by us but by a dumb, random process, and that the brains are made of stupidly complex nanotech instead of simple transistors is not helping.Also because the kind of models we&#x27;re now worried about gain capability through an optimization process that&#x27;s open-ended, and limited only by availability of training data and compute.

It&#x27;s a language problem that makes people like you think this way.The problem is consciousness is a vocabulary word that establishes a hard boundary where such a boundary doesn&#x27;t exit. The language makes you think either something is conscious or it is not when the reality is that these two concepts are actually extreme endpoints on a gradient.The vocabulary makes the concept seem binary and makes it seem more profound then it actually is.Thus we have no problem identifying things at the extreme. A rock is not conscious. That&#x27;s obvious. A human IS conscious, that&#x27;s also obvious. But only because these two objects are defined at the extremes of this gradient.For something fuzzy like chatGPT, we get confused. We think the problem is profound, but in actuality it&#x27;s just poorly defined vocabulary. The word consciousness, again, assumes the world is binary that something is either&#x2F;or, but, again, the reality is a gradient.When we have debates about whether something is \"conscious\" or not we are just arguing about where the line of demarcation is drawn along the gradient. Does it need a body to be conscious? Does it need to be able to do math? Where you draw this line is just a definition of vocabulary. So arguments about whether LLMs are conscious are arguments about vocabulary.We as humans are biased and we blindly allow the vocabulary to mold our thinking. Is chatGPT conscious? It&#x27;s a loaded question based on a world view manipulated by the vocabulary. It doesn&#x27;t even matter. That boundary is fuzzy, and any vocab attempting to describe this gradient is just arbitrary.But hear me out. chatGPT and DALL-E is NOT hype. Why? Because along that gradient it&#x27;s leaps and bounds further than anything we had just even a decade ago. It&#x27;s the closest we ever been to the extreme endpoint.

How about this -- I think we&#x27;ve already reached AGI. Let me know if this tracks: Pick a set of tasks that can be considered AGI tasks. Provided the task sequences can be compared as closer to AGI or further from AGI, we can create a reward model using the same techniques as were used by ChatGPT via RLHF. Thus, for any definition of AGI that is meaningful and selectable, even if subjectively selectable or arbitrarily preferential, we can create a reward model for it.You might say, well thats not AGI, AGI must also do such and such. Well, we can get arbitrarily close to that definition as well via RLHF.Another objection might be: well, if thats the definition of AGI, that seems really underwhelming compared to the hype train. This says nothing about autonomy, sentience, free will -- exactly. Those concepts can or should be orthogonal to doing productive work.l, IMHO.So, there it is. We can now make a reward model for folding socks, and use gradient descent with RL to do the motion planning.Maybe thats AGI and maybe its not, but I&#x27;d really love it if we had a golden period between now and total enshittification that involved laundry folding robots. reply pshc 10 hours agorootparentIt tends to boil down to semantics, but as I interpret it, a threshold for AGI has to involve some breakthrough in generalizable, adaptable intelligence. So, yeah, I would invoke the \"that&#x27;s not AGI\" move.An AGI should be able to solve any creative problem a human could, with drive and knowing purpose and coherent vision. The LLMs are still narrowly focused and require human supervision.We might well get there with chained AIs automatically training new reward models for each new problem, or by some other paradigm, but I don&#x27;t feel like we&#x27;re past the threshold yet. reply FrustratedMonky 12 hours agorootparentprevExactly. 5 years ago, we would have said what GPT-4 is doing now would be AGI.Now it is here and it&#x27;s like \"No, what we really meant is it has to be the next Einstein\".People are forgetting how stupid people are.GPT is already better than average human.Most people can&#x27;t do what we claim GPT must be capable of to qualify as AGI.The only logical conclusion is that many people are also not conscious and don&#x27;t qualify as being able to reason. reply krainboltgreene 12 hours agorootparent> Exactly. 5 years ago, we would have said what GPT-4 is doing now would be AGI.okay, and 500 years ago we would have said it was magic, that doesn&#x27;t make it magic. people who don&#x27;t understand the thing often are confused about the thing. as soon as you explain how the whole mechanism works it&#x27;s obvious that it&#x27;s not that thing.> People are forgetting how stupid people are.

A co-worker comes by and says \"How did your team do in the game yesterday?\". I say, \"Um, uh... sorry, my head&#x27;s not there right now.\" It takes us time to swap between mental \"spaces\".So, if I have an AGI (defined as having a trained model for almost everything, even if that turns out to be a large number of different models), if it has to load the right model before it can reason on that topic, then that&#x27;s pretty human-like. (As long as it can figure out which model to load...)The one thing missing is that (at least some) humans can figure out linkages between different mental \"spaces\", to turn them into a more coherent holistic mental space, even if they don&#x27;t have (all of) each space at front-of-mind at any moment. I&#x27;m not sure if this flavor of an AGI could do that - could see the connections between different models. reply pixl97 12 hours agorootparentThe power of analogy is one of the most important things that humans seem to have.Humans typically use the toolset they&#x27;ve seen along the way to solve problems (hence if you have a hammer all problems become nails statement).

A large part of meditation and “release of suffering” is learning to let your awareness lead your thinking rather than your thinking lead your awareness.To be clear, I think this is in fact a correct assessment of the architecture of intelligence. You can suspend thought and still function throughout your day in all ways. Discursive thought is entirely unnecessary, but it is often helpful for planning.My observation of LLMs in such a construction of intelligence is they are entirely the thinking mind - verbal, articulate, but unmoored. There is no, for lack of a better word, “soul,” or that internal awareness that underpins that discursive thinking mind. And because that underlying awareness is non articulate and not directly observable by our thinking and feeling mind, we really don’t understand it or have a science about it. To that end, it’s really hard to pin specifically what is missing in LLMs because we don’t really understand ourselves beyond our observable thinking and emotive minds.I look at what we are doing with LLMs and adjacent technologies and I wonder if this is sufficient, and building an AGI is perhaps not nearly as useful as we might think, if what we mean is build an awareness. Power tools of the thinking mind are amazingly powerful.

In animal&#x2F;insects we can see that thinking is not some binary function of on or off. It is an immense range of different electrical and chemical processes that involve everything from the brain and the nerves along with chemical signaling from cells. In things like plants and molds &#x27;thinking&#x27; doesn&#x27;t even involve nerves, it&#x27;s a chemical process.A good example of this at the human level is a reflex. Your hand didn&#x27;t go back to your brain to ask for instructions on how to get away from the fire. That&#x27;s encoded in the meat and nerves of your arm by systems that are much older than higher intelligence. All the systems for breath, drink, eat, procreate were in place long before high level intelligence existed. Intelligence just happens to be a new floor stacked hastily on top of these legacy systems that happened to be beneficial enough it didn&#x27;t go extinct.Awareness is another one of those very deep rabbit hole questions. There are &#x27;intelligent&#x27; animals without self awareness, but with awareness of the world around them. And they obviously have agency.

The brain will receive the input while the reflex is being carried out and the analysis of the signal takes place after the reflex action. reply TeMPOraL 11 hours agorootparentOne way of seeing a subset of reflex behavior is speculative execution - as in, you&#x27;ll start executing on stimulus before the brain has a chance to evaluate it, but when it eventually does, it may cancel the reflexive action. This is absurdly efficient if your reflexes are well-calibrated. reply danenania 16 hours agoparentprevAnother idea from Buddhism is that this core of awareness you&#x27;re talking about is nothingness. So when you stop all thought (if such a thing is really possible), you temporarily cease to exist as an individual consciousness. \"Awareness\" is when the thoughts come back online and you think \"whoa, I was just gone for a bit\".If that&#x27;s how it works, then the \"soul\" is more like an emergent phenomenon created by the interplay between the various layers of conscious thought and the base layer of nothingness when it&#x27;s all turned off. That architecture wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be so difficult to replicate in AI systems. reply fnordpiglet 12 hours agorootparentI think what you mean is that in Buddhism there is no self beyond the self implied by your thinking mind. The nothingness you refer to is the eschewing of attachment to what isn’t and being simply what is. It doesn’t mean a void, it means that all existence is within the awareness, which isn’t directly observable and is constantly changing. As such, it’s effectively nothing - except it is literally all you are. Your past and memories are just crude encodings, the future is a delusion. Your self identity has almost nothing to do with who you actually are right now. Your dissatisfaction with your situation isn’t meaningfully different from your delight in some experience - they’re both transient, and are just experiences of the present. You can avoid unpleasantness, and enjoy pleasure, but holding onto and seeking or avoiding entangles your awareness in what isn’t to the determinant of what is. As you continue releasing the various attachments and let the awareness take hold, and actions come naturally without thought or attachment, you cease suffering and cease causing suffering.But to my understanding the idea of nothingness being some objective in Buddhism isn’t the case - but it’s often described as such because that state of pure awareness without encumbering thought and attachment in many ways to an unpracticed person feels like nothingness. After all, the awareness is silent, even if it is where all thought and feeling spring from.Finally, awareness isn’t that moment you snap back to thought. You’re always aware. We just tend to be primarily aware of our thoughts and emotions. We walk around in a haze of the past and future and fiction as the world ticks by around us, and we tend to live in what isn’t rather than what is. You don’t disappear in the sense that you cease to be as an individual mind, you are always yourself - that’s a tautology. What you lose is the sense of some identity that’s separate from what you ARE in this very moment. You aren’t a programmer, you aren’t a Democrat, you aren’t a XYZ. You are what you are, and what that is changes constantly, so can’t be singularly defined or held onto as some consistent thing over time with labels and structure. You just simply are. reply danenania 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not an expert in Buddhism, but from what I&#x27;ve read I think your interpretation may be a bit reductive of the many strains of thought that exist within Buddhism.\"You don’t disappear in the sense that you cease to be as an individual mind, you are always yourself - that’s a tautology. What you lose is the sense of some identity that’s separate from what you ARE in this very moment.\"This assumes that there&#x27;s any concept of \"you\" that exists independent of your thoughts whatsoever. I think you&#x27;re right that some Buddhist thinkers believe in this kind of essential awareness underlying conscious thought that you&#x27;re describing, but others would say there is literally nothing underneath. \"The self is an illusion\", \"all is emptiness\", etc. If you believe in those ideas, then you have no awareness independent of conscious thought because there is no you independent of conscious thought. reply fnordpiglet 10 hours agorootparentNote, the interpretation I’m presenting is the Theravada Buddhism view interpreted into a western rational framework. There are indeed many forms of Buddhism and I’ll admit I’m unfamiliar with all of them other than Theravada Buddhism.The self as an illusion though refers to the concept that we as we exist now is ever changing and can’t be kept as some identity as that identity is necessarily not who you actually are. Our memories are not real - just shadows of an experience, and our aspirations are fiction. That does not however mean you don’t exist. You do exist, and as you move beyond the basics of mindfulness and releasing of attachments our role in a broader human experience becomes crucial - loving kindness (metta), and other aspects, are what are suppose to fill that void left by detaching from self and what isn’t. You move from being obsessed with self to becoming a force of goodness in the world by virtue of your existence. This couldn’t possibly be the case if the goal were nothingness and that’s it. This is where karma and other concepts come into play. reply nprateem 7 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;ve misunderstood. Awareness absolutely is not \"when thoughts come back online\".This is simple to experience for yourself since it&#x27;d mean we stop being aware when listening so intently thoughts stop.

Just like many people can’t close their eyes and see things while others can, many people don’t think in words.Second, you absolutely can suspend your thoughts. I do regularly. In fact the entire point of Buddhist meditation is to practice the act of suspending observable thoughts entirely in a controlled environment to carry the practice over into every day life. I like you didn’t think it was possible until after several years of practice I could. With that I lost my anxiety and depression, and found a way to be generally happy. I still think, but it’s in service towards a goal. Otherwise I let myself simply live. In so, I have a happy marriage and a successful career. Much more so than before.I don’t feel compelled to convince you I’m not lying or otherwise deluded if you choose to not believe me.Now, how do you choose to begin thinking again? The fact is you’re always thinking when you are conscious and aware, but it’s happening in an aspect of your mind you can’t perceive directly. While I’m not thinking I still make decisions and take actions and initiate things, even carry on conversations and form intentions. But they aren’t thoughts that are articulating in my mind like we typically think of as thinking. I usually drop into thinking when I need to analyze something rationally or methodically plan, particularly if it has to be verbalized or written in some way, or recorded on a schedule or something. How do I begin that? I can’t observe the process and isolate it as that’s just the way things are. I’m definitely aware of my intentions, but I’m not thinking about them or articulating some thoughts in my mind. They just flow naturally from the present. When my mind needs to think, it does. Because, my thinking facilities in my mind are merely a tool of my mind - the crucial insight is that we are not our tools.I don’t think any of this is mystical in the least. I think people who think their thoughts are really important are the mystical thinkers. We are meat brains, and our thinking facility is a late evolutionary feature that we’ve become ensnared in much to our own suffering as it distracts us from our more natural states of being because they’re so seductive in its constructs. I think Buddhism in its most raw form is almost entirely devoid of mystical thinking and most mysticism associated with it is an accretion of animistic and ancestor worship indigenous societies where it developed. reply akomtu 9 hours agorootparentprevThis looks like AI-buddhism, a \"fork\" of buddhism rewritten by an uber-LLM of the future, in which it will discard everything it cannot relate to. To such an AI, the only internal process is a sequence of words, and nothing is thinkable outside such a sequence.However, we can imagine images, shapes and sounds, indescribable in words, and even higher there are abstract ideas that can&#x27;t be expressed with images or sounds, let along with words.The \"thoughts from without\" may appear for a multitude of reasons, because our minds aren&#x27;t isolated systems. The source may be some sensory input that triggered a memory, and I wouldn&#x27;t even reject the possibility, that brains can react to background electromagnetic noise and form thoughts based on it. reply astrange 12 hours agorootparentprevThat seems like an unusually rude thing to say about Buddha. You might be experiencing dukkha. replyjacobsimon 16 hours agoparentprevThis is a profound question but I also wonder if this non-thinking “awareness” you’re referring to is largely defined by quieting the thinking mind and listening to the senses more directly. A lot of meditation is about tuning out thoughts and focusing on proprioception like breathing, the feelings of the body, etc. reply vjerancrnjak 16 hours agorootparentFundamentally, this \"awareness\" isn&#x27;t defined by quieting the thinking. It is a description of fundamental reality. No individual should be able to experience it, and the \"glimpses\" are just forms of brain dysfunction.Meditation techniques that focus on breath or the body are an attempt to make you do the breathing&#x2F;sensing consciously. If you film yourself and later look at what you did, you&#x27;ll notice you aren&#x27;t breathing well when you&#x27;re breathing consciously, so you&#x27;re probably depriving yourself of oxygen, lowering blood concentration in certain brain regions and you hope it will be the brain region associated with conceptualizing, language etc.You can do the same with sleep. You can try to consciously fall asleep, and just like breathing, you will have a hard time because there&#x27;s a reason why falling asleep is not conscious (or in other words it does not go through the regions of the brain that conceptualize). You can experience the balance center shutting down (feels like falling or turning) and you can go even deeper and feel the fear of the \"ego\" dying (temporarily). What remains is definitely much different than waking or dreaming state. But it is still not that \"awareness&#x2F;nothingness\". reply fnordpiglet 12 hours agorootparentI think this is entirely incorrect. Vipassana meditation, the type focused on breathing, require intense awareness of your breathing and physical body. It’s a similar state to when you intensely focus on what’s around you and everything gets brighter and more vibrant and you pick out a lot of details you normally don’t notice because you’re distracted by your thoughts.If you’re doing it the way intended you would 100% be aware of your irregular breath or pausing. In fact beginners vipassana often advises counting the breaths individually in a cycle 1..10, and resetting the count when you lose track of your breathing. You intensely focus on the sensation of the air moving through your nostrils, the muscles contracting, your clothing shifting.However it’s not about controlling your breathing, so it’s not the same as breathing consciously. It’s observing passively. Often you’ll notice that you are breathing irregularly, not because of the meditation, but because you typically are stressed and tight in your musculature due to the way you’re thinking. You can then loosen and reset your patterns of breath to be more natural, deep, and complete.A goal isn’t to stop with observing the breath though, and you work towards having a total awareness of the entire body at once, shifting your center of existence from your head to the rest of your body. You then incorporate sounds and events in your environment. This requires an intense amount of mental power, and is entirely different from your description of oxygen deprivation. Thought ceases because it interferes with being aware, not because you are experiencing brain death. reply vjerancrnjak 9 hours agorootparent> It’s observing passively.This is a byproduct of the process. You cannot observe passively if you still have a very strong imprint of a doer. When you start observing the tingles and the sensations, you still observe them from the center and there&#x27;s a distance from the center and the sensations. The only way this center disappears is if the regions of the brain that create imprints lower their activity.I&#x27;d say it is very easy to accomplish it when you&#x27;re sleepy (especially after you wake up during the night and go back to sleep). There&#x27;s no need to shut anything down through high focus, brain does it naturally to paralyze the body and lose the waking state.\"My Stroke of Insight\" by Jill Bolte Taylor goes through many side-effects experienced by the meditators, but through a lens of a brain stroke.> Thought ceases because it interferes with being aware, not because you are experiencing brain death.Not sure about that. The verbal&#x2F;visual thinking can be a strong feedback loop to the underlying unconscious processes. The only way I can see that it stops is if it is suppressed to unconscious, you&#x27;ve learned to not have it in focus. Also, many people have no visual and verbal thoughts. They don&#x27;t have an imprint of standard modes of thinking at all. I&#x27;d say the definition of thought needs to expand to sensing. Any sensation is a thought. Focus on verbal&#x2F;visual thoughts is misplaced.I do agree that people learn to eventually do this without the side effects of practice. They can probably transition to a different brain activity without dealing with the breath ever again.I think a much better standard for meditators is to ask them if they feel like their whole body is alien, or if they have something like alien hand syndrome. Losing thoughts, yet still being the body (or even the space around the body) is just another form of thoughts.The imprint of a doer gives you the feeling of someone controlling the body or doing the thinking. For example, I can get lost in thoughts so hard that I no longer have imprints of controlling the body. Somehow I leave the shower and dress myself yet I know I don&#x27;t remember doing any of it.To also move the conclusion further, it sounds like the ultimate goal is to feel like you&#x27;re not separate but that you&#x27;re whole, so in that case it must be that this body, from that perspective, is fully without individual imprint, behaving completely like an input&#x2F;output machine, no inner subjective experience present. reply sdwr 16 hours agoparentprevMaybe the soul is social, and oriented towards others?

It pays attention but does not dictate reply munificent 16 hours agorootparent> Maybe the soul is socialMy pet theory about human consciousness is that is that consciousness is simply recursive theory of mind. Theory of mind [1] is our ability to simulate and reason about the mental states of others. It&#x27;s how we predict what people are thinking and how they will react to our actions, which is critical for choosing how to act in a social environment.But when you&#x27;re thinking about what&#x27;s in someone&#x27;s head, one of the things might be them thinking about you. So now you&#x27;re imagining your own mind from the perspective of another mind. I believe that&#x27;s entirely what our sense of consciousness is. It&#x27;s our social reasoning applied to ourselves.If my pet theory is correct, it implies that the level of consciousness of any species would directly correlate to how social the species is. Solitary animals with little need for theory of mind would have no self awareness in the way that we experience it.

But cats didn&#x27;t have that pack structure, they&#x27;re not conscious at all.\" Or, \"this person has such severe autism that he cannot fundamentally understand others&#x27; minds or what others interpret his mind to be, so we&#x27;ve downgraded his classification to unconscious.

Well, we stop thinking about what others think we think, and we simply accept what they think about us.\" That doesn&#x27;t sound like any sleep I experience -- it might describe some of my dreams, but of course dreams are anomalous conscious experiences that happen during sleep so that also misses the mark. reply munificent 12 hours agorootparent\"Consciousness\" is one of those loaded words that means a few different things in different contexts. When I say consciousness is about recursive theory of mind, I&#x27;m not trying to say that when you&#x27;re asleep you&#x27;re unable to do social reasoning. That&#x27;s a different use of the same word.I mean \"conscious\" in the sense of self-awareness or sentience.I&#x27;m also not ascribing any moral or cognitive superiority or inferiority to different levels of it. The fact that a cat might be less self-aware of its suffering because it think about how it would explain its pain to other cats does mean imply that I&#x27;m saying it should be OK to torture cats.I&#x27;m just interested in what is going in human brains when we \"feel self-aware\". What are we doing when we&#x27;re thinking about what we&#x27;re doing? Where does that sense of perceptual distance come from when we are aware of ourselves?

Some eons later, it figured out modelling yourself (self &#x2F; agent) modelling the outside world is also helpful. In the outside world, we keep track of continuity of objects through a brain module which hones in on the essence of objects (e.g. tracking a prey or predator.) so that EXACT matching algorithms aren&#x27;t applied but ONLY approximate ones. As soon as a high enough approximate match (>95%) is found, we \"register\" it to be an exact match. i.e. the Brain bumps up the confidence level to 100%. This is also the reason why we consider our friend Bob to be the same childhood Bob even though he has different hairstyle, clothes, and other such properties. We don&#x27;t call Bob who looks different than yesterday as an Imposter. The damage to this brain module could lead us to call Bob today an imposter. This same module also tracks continuity of self in a similar manner. Even though our \"self\" changes from childhood to adult we \"register\" \"changing self\" to be the same thing. i.e. internally we bump up the confidence to 100% when memories, etc. match and provide a coherent picture of the self. A multiple personality disorder is just different stable states of neural attractor states. Continuity is local to a personality but not global and hence transient. This local continuity of information could link up globally, giving rise to coherent single personality.Capgras Syndrome :Ramachandran Capgras Delusion Case : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3xczrDAGfT4 reply ctoth 13 hours agorootparentprev> If you assume that \"the eyes are the window to the soul\", you notice some interesting properties.And people say LLM output is nonsense.I&#x27;m blind with glass eyeballs.
