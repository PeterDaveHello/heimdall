ORDERING SERVICES 2.1 Order Form. You may order the Services through an online registration or order form approved and authorized by Zoom (each an “Order Form”). Any order for the Services made pursuant to an Order Form is subject to the terms of this Agreement. An Order Form may contain additional or different terms, conditions, and information regarding the Services you are ordering as authorized and agreed to by Zoom. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and any Order Form authorized and agreed to by Zoom, the applicable Order Form controls and governs over this Agreement, to the extent necessary to resolve the particular conflict or inconsistency only. Zoom will provide the Services set forth in your Order Form and standard updates to the Services that we make generally available at no additional cost to similarly situated customers in the same geographic region during the applicable Initial Subscription Term or then-current Renewal Term. Zoom may, in its sole discretion, (i) discontinue the Services, or (ii) modify the features or functionality of the Services or Software. 2.2 Minimum Commitment. You will maintain your minimum quantity of the Services set forth on your Order Form for the duration of the applicable Initial Subscription Term or then-current Renewal Term. Any timely and contractually available modification to the Services set forth on your Order Form will be effective only upon the commencement of your next Renewal Term, unless you request an increase in the Services, which will take effect as indicated in the applicable Order Form. 2.3 Outstanding Balance; Late Payment. Without limiting our rights in this Agreement, including Sections 12.7 and 14.3, you acknowledge that Zoom is not required to provide any new Services set forth in an Order Form until all outstanding balances due and owing for existing Services are paid in full. ACCESS AND USE; SOFTWARE LICENSE 3.1 Access and Use; Software License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may access and use, during the Initial Subscription Term or then-current Renewal Term, the Services as set forth on each applicable Order Form. If access to or use of any portion of the Services requires or allows for you to download, use, or install Zoom software (“Software”), Zoom grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, and royalty-free license to use the Software in object code format on a compatible device for your internal use only, solely to access and use the Services during the applicable Initial Subscription Term or then-current Renewal Term. You acknowledge and agree that your access to and use of the Services and Software under this Section 3.1 (and as otherwise provided in this Agreement) is revocable in Zoom’s sole discretion. 3.2 Documentation License. Subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, Zoom grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, and royalty-free license for you to use Zoom-provided product and services documentation (“Documentation”) solely for your internal business purposes in connection with use of the Services or Software during the applicable Initial Subscription Term or then-current Renewal Term. 3.3 Ownership. You acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Services are provided to you on a subscription basis, and the Software and Documentation is provided to you under a limited license, and neither has been sold to you. You also acknowledge that you have neither obtained nor will obtain any ownership or other right, title, or interest in or to the Services, Software, or Documentation or any Proprietary Rights relating thereto. Any copies of Software will remain the exclusive property of Zoom. The Software may include code that is licensed to you under third party license agreements, including open source software made available or provided with the Software. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Zoom owns all right, title, and interest in and to all upgrades, enhancements, new releases, changes, and modifications to the Services or Software, together with all ideas, architecture, algorithms, models, processes, techniques, user interfaces, database design and architecture, and “know-how” embodying the Services and Software. Under no circumstances will you be deemed to receive, have, or be granted title to all or any portion of the Services, Software, or Documentation, title to which at all times vests exclusively in Zoom. None of the Services, Software, or Documentation, or any component thereof, is or shall be deemed to be a “work made for hire,” as that term is defined in 17 U.S.C. § 101. RESPONSIBILITY FOR USE AND END USERS 4.1 Use of the Services; End User Responsibility. You will, and you will cause your End Users to, abide by and ensure compliance with, all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Use of the Services is void where prohibited. You are responsible for your and your End Users’ access to and use of the Services and Software. You are responsible for the activities of all your End Users, including ensuring that all End Users will comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any applicable Zoom policies. You acknowledge that you remain liable for the acts and omissions of any third party that you allow, enable, or otherwise provide access to the Services or Software, whether or not such access was expressly permitted by Zoom. 4.2 Violations by End Users or Third Parties.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS; CHANGES Your use of the Services and Software requires one or more compatible devices, Internet access, and certain third-party software, and you may be required to obtain updates or upgrades from time to time for Software or third-party software, which may result in additional costs to you. Because use of the Services and Software involves hardware, software, and Internet access, your ability to access and use the Services and Software may be affected by the performance of the foregoing. High-speed Internet access is recommended.

You further acknowledge that any Customer Content provided, created, or made available to you by Zoom is for your or your End Users’ use solely in connection with use of the Services, and that you are solely responsible for Customer Content. 10.2 Service Generated Data; Consent to Use. Customer Content does not include any telemetry data, product usage data, diagnostic data, and similar content or data that Zoom collects or generates in connection with your or your End Users’ use of the Services or Software (“Service Generated Data”).

In furtherance of the foregoing, if, for any reason, there are any rights in such Service Generated Data which do not accrue to Zoom under this Section 10.2 or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you hereby unconditionally and irrevocably assign and agree to assign to Zoom on your behalf, and you shall cause your End Users to unconditionally and irrevocably assign and agree to assign to Zoom, all right, title, and interest in and to the Service Generated Data, including all Proprietary Rights relating thereto. 10.3 Permitted Use; Customer Content.

Under no circumstances will Zoom be liable in any way for (i) your Customer Content that is transmitted or viewed while using the Services, (ii) errors or omissions in the Customer Content, or (iii) any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of, access to, or denial of access to Customer Content. Zoom may delete any Customer Content, at any time without notice to you, if Zoom becomes aware that it violates any provision of this Agreement or any applicable Laws. As between you and Zoom, you retain all ownership rights in your Customer Content, subject to any license or other rights granted herein, and without limiting any of Zoom’s Proprietary Rights set forth herein. ELIGIBILITY; RESTRICTION ON USE BY CHILDREN 11.1 Eligibility. You affirm that you are of legal age to enter into this Agreement and to use the Services and Software. You affirm that you are otherwise fully able and competent to enter into and abide by the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in this Agreement. Your access may be terminated without warning if it comes to our attention that you are under the legal age to enter into this Agreement or are otherwise ineligible to enter into this Agreement or to use the Services and Software. 11.2 Restrictions on Use by Children. Zoom is not intended for use by individuals under the age of sixteen (16) years old, unless it is through a School Subscriber (as defined in the Zoom Services Description) using Zoom for Education (K-12). PAYMENTS AND CHARGES 12.1 Charges. You agree that Zoom may charge your credit card, debit card, or other payment mechanism selected by you and approved by Zoom (“Payment Method”) for all amounts due and owing in connection with your use of the Services, as set forth in the applicable Order Form or otherwise used or ordered by or for you through the Services, including set up fees, one-time fees, non-recurring fees, overages, per-use charges, subscription fees, recurring fees, and any other fees and charges associated with the Services or your account (“Charges”). As provided in Section 13, unless otherwise expressly specified an Order Form, all Charges are exclusive of Taxes and Fees. You agree to promptly update your Payment Method to allow for timely payment. Changes made to your Payment Method will not affect Charges that Zoom submits to your chosen Payment Method before Zoom could reasonably act on your changes. Additionally, you agree to permit Zoom to use any updated Payment Method information provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network and to charge your current primary Payment Method by using the details of such Payment Method saved in our system, even if such Payment Method is declined. Zoom further reserves the right to use your backup Payment Method to the extent one is provided. By adding a backup Payment Method, you authorize Zoom to process any applicable Charges on your backup Payment Method if your primary Payment Method is declined. 12.2 Non-Cancelable and Non-Refundable Charges. You agree that all payments are non-cancelable for the Initial Subscription Term or the then-current Renewal Term, as applicable, and are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise agreed to by Zoom, required by Law, or set forth in your Order Form. 12.3 Changes to Pricing. Zoom may change prices for the Services at any time, in its sole discretion. For changes to your Charges, Zoom will provide you with not less than (i) thirty (30) calendar days prior notice, or (ii) the time period prescribed by applicable Law (each, (i) and (ii), a “Rate Change Notice”). Unless prohibited by the terms of your Order Form, any changes to your Charges will be effective upon the commencement of your next Renewal Term or other date calculated in accordance with applicable Law. If you seek to terminate or modify the Services affected by a Rate Change Notice, then you must terminate or modify your affected Services within the applicable Rate Change Notice time period. If you do not terminate or modify the affected Services within the applicable Rate Change Notice time period, then you shall be deemed to have automatically accepted the change to your Charges, unless your affirmative, express consent to such change is required under applicable Law. If required by applicable Law, we will remind you of your termination and modification right, any applicable time-period, and the consequences of not terminating. 12.4 Promotional Rates and Discounts. Prices specified in an Order Form may include a promotional rate, discount, sale, or special offer, which may be temporary and may expire (i) per the terms of the offer, or (ii) upon the commencement of a Renewal Term. The expiration of the discount or promotional pricing may expire without additional notice to you, unless specified in an Order Form or as required by applicable Law. Zoom reserves the right to discontinue or modify any promotion, discount, sale, or special offer in its sole discretion. 12.5 Collection of Charges. You agree that if Zoom is unable to collect the Charges for the Services through your Payment Method, Zoom may, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, take any other steps it deems necessary to collect such Charges from you and that you will be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Zoom in connection with such collection activity, including collection fees, court costs, and attorneys’ fees. You further agree that, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, Zoom may collect interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the highest amount permitted by Law on any Charges not paid when due. 12.6 Support Services and Updates. Zoom will provide, at no additional costs, (i) standard support as set forth in our then-current Documentation (see Zoom Help Center), and (ii) standard updates to the Services and Software that are made generally available by Zoom to similarly situated customers in the same geographic region during the Initial Subscription Term or any applicable Renewal Term. In accordance with applicable Law and the terms of this Agreement, Zoom reserves the right to (a) modify its standard support and charge you for standard support and (b) charge you for any updates to the Services or for any premium features or functionality. 12.7 Termination or Suspension for Nonpayment. Without limiting our rights in any other section of this Agreement, including 14.3, if any failure to pay Charges continues for five (5) calendar days following the due date, Zoom may terminate, suspend, or disconnect your Services immediately and without prior notice. 12.8 Billing Communications. You agree that Zoom may contact you via email or otherwise at any time with information relevant to your use of the Services, including billing communications, regardless of whether you have opted out of receiving marketing communications or notices. 12.9 Withdrawal; Cooling-Off Period. If under applicable Law you have a time period to terminate your Services based on a right of withdrawal, or a cooling-off period, you may request to terminate the affected Services in accordance with applicable Law and, if applicable, receive a pro rata refund of any prepaid and unused Charges. If the Services begin before any withdrawal or cooling-off period, or you fail to terminate your Services during the right of withdrawal or cooling-off period, then you acknowledge that you lose any termination rights under this Section 12.9. Nothing in this Section 12.9 is intended to limit or exclude any of your rights that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable Law. TAXES 13.1 Taxes and Fees. Unless otherwise expressly specified by Zoom as required by applicable Law, all prices shown by Zoom and Charges for the Services on your account are exclusive of Taxes and Fees. Where applicable, Taxes and Fees will be charged on the invoices issued by Zoom in accordance with applicable Laws. Zoom, in its sole discretion, will (i) calculate the amount of Taxes and Fees due, and (ii) change such amounts without notice to you. 13.2 VAT Invoices. If required by Law, Zoom will issue a VAT invoice, or a document that the relevant taxing authority will treat as a VAT invoice, to you. You agree that this invoice may be issued electronically. 13.3 Tax exemptions. If you are exempt from any Taxes and Fees, you will provide Zoom with all appropriate tax exemption certificates, and/or other documentation satisfactory to the applicable taxing authorities, to substantiate such exemption status. Zoom reserves the right to review and validate tax exemption documentation. If the tax exemption documentation is not provided or not valid, Zoom reserves the right to charge applicable Taxes and Fees to you. 13.4 Payment of Taxes and Withholding. You will pay Zoom, and you are solely responsible for, any applicable Taxes and Fees. All payments made by you to us under this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding Taxes and Fees, as may be required by applicable Law. If any such deduction or withholding Taxes and Fees (including domestic or cross-border withholding taxes) are required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as necessary, such that the net amount received by us is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. We will provide you with such tax forms as reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement. You also agree to provide Zoom with withholding tax certificates, upon Zoom’s request, to the extent a withholding certificate is required to be sent to Zoom under applicable Law, and you agree that Zoom may provide your withholding tax certificate to the appropriate taxing authority without further notice to you. 13.5 Value-Added Tax – Customer Obligations. If Taxes and Fees are due towards the taxing authorities by you instead of Zoom, through the reverse charge or other similar mechanism, you will provide Zoom with all appropriate evidence for Zoom to demonstrate your business nature, such as a valid VAT registration number (or similar information required under the relevant VAT Laws). Zoom reserves the right to review and validate your VAT registration number. If the VAT registration number is not valid, Zoom reserves the right to nevertheless charge the applicable VAT to you. For the avoidance of doubt, if VAT is due by you to a taxing authority, through the reverse charge or other similar mechanism, you are solely responsible for paying those amounts to the relevant taxing authority, such that Zoom receives the full amount of payment required. 13.6 Tax Determination. Tax determination is principally based on the location where you have established your business based on your Customer Data, or if you are an individual, where you permanently reside. This location will be defined by Zoom as your ‘Sold To’ address. Zoom reserves the right to cross reference this location against other available evidence to validate whether your location is accurate. If your location is inaccurate, Zoom reserves the right to charge you any outstanding Taxes and Fees. 13.7 Use and Enjoyment. If you subscribe to any Services, and those Services are used and enjoyed by a subsidiary of you in a country that is different from your location as determined pursuant to Section 13.6, you confirm that, where required, you will treat this as a supply to your subsidiary. If you subscribe to the Services and those Services are used and enjoyed by a branch or individual in a country that is different to your location as determined pursuant to Section 13.6, you acknowledge that you will inform Zoom of the Services that have been allocated, and you acknowledge that Zoom reserves the right to charge Taxes and Fees based on the use and enjoyment of those Services. 13.8 Disclosures to Taxing Authorities. In accordance with applicable tax Law, and notwithstanding any of Zoom’s notice obligations that may arise under this Agreement, including but not limited to, Section 17.4 or pursuant to our Government Request Guide, we may disclose Customer information, including Customer Confidential Information, to a tax authority without notice to you before or after the disclosure. TERM; TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION 14.1 Term; Automatic Renewal. Each Order Form will specify your Initial Subscription Term and any applicable Renewal Term for the Services. Unless your Order Form expressly states otherwise or applicable Law prohibits automatic renewal, each Renewal Term for the Services will begin automatically at the end of the then-current Initial Subscription Term or Renewal Term, as the case may be, unless either party provides written notice of termination or modification of the Services provided under such Order Form (i) at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the commencement of the next Renewal Term, or (ii) within the notice period required by applicable Law (collectively, (i) and (ii), the “Renewal Notice Period”). In order to terminate or modify the affected Services, you must provide notice to Zoom, via the billing portal (if available for your account) or in an email to renewals@zoom.us, in accordance with the Renewal Notice Period. Any statutory rights you may have under the applicable Laws to terminate your Services at an earlier time during the Initial Subscription Term or any given Renewal Term remains unaffected by this clause, and, if required by applicable Law, we will send you a reminder notice prior to the commencement date of the Renewal Term (and in accordance with the notice periods specified in this Agreement or other such deadline set by applicable Law that may apply to you) reminding you of your right to terminate the affected Services and how to do so. 14.2 Customer Termination. You may find information on how to terminate your account and Services located here. If you have subscribed to one or more Services for a specific term, such termination will be effective as to each such Service on the last day of the then-current term for each applicable Service, provided that you provide proper and timely notice pursuant to Section 14.1. You may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of termination if Zoom has materially breached this Agreement and has not cured such material breach within thirty (30) business days of Zoom’s receipt of your written notice of such breach. Your notice shall state the specific provision in this Agreement that you contend Zoom has breached and set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances you allege provide the basis for such breach. 14.3 Zoom Termination Rights and Suspension. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any referenced policies, guides, notices, or statements, Zoom may (i) immediately suspend your access to the Services, or (ii) terminate this Agreement, effective immediately. If Zoom chooses to suspend your Services and the failure to comply continues, Zoom may exercise any or all of its termination rights in this Section 14.3. Additionally, Zoom may terminate this Agreement, for any reason or no reason, upon thirty (30) business days’ advance notice. 14.4 Effect of Termination or Suspension. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you must cease any further use of the Services and Software, except for any access rights granted in Section 14.5. No expiration or termination of this Agreement will affect your obligation to pay all Charges that may have become due before such expiration or termination, including that Zoom may retain any Charges previously paid by you if this Agreement is terminated, unless prohibited by applicable Law. If your Services are suspended for your failure to comply with this Agreement, you will be liable for all Charges due and owing during the period of suspension. 14.5 Deletion and Access to Customer Content After Termination. For thirty (30) calendar days following expiration or termination of this Agreement, Zoom will provide you access to retrieve your Customer Content, after which time your Customer Content will be deleted according to applicable Law, this Agreement, and our regularly scheduled deletion protocols, policies, and procedures.

When Changes are made, Zoom will indicate the effective date of the Changes at the top of the Terms of Service located here or in our Service Description located here.

CONFIDENTIALITY 17.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means: (i) with respect to Zoom, any information disclosed by, for, or on behalf of Zoom, directly or indirectly, to you or any End User in connection with this Agreement, the Services or Software, or learned or accessed by you or any End User in connection with the Services or Software, including business information, development plans, product roadmap details, systems, strategic plans, source code, services, products, pricing, methods, processes, financial data, programs, trade secrets, know-how, and marketing plans, however it is conveyed in any form or medium, together with all information derived from the foregoing, and any other information that is designated as being confidential (whether or not it is marked as “confidential”) or which is known by you or the End User or reasonably should be understood by you or the End User to be confidential (“Zoom Confidential Information”); and (ii) with respect to you, any information disclosed by you to Zoom that (a) must be kept confidential pursuant to applicable Law or (b) is sensitive security and technical information that is clearly and conspicuously marked as “confidential” by you (“Customer Confidential Information”). Customer Content is not Customer Confidential Information; however, Customer Content will be protected in accordance with Section 10.5. 17.2 Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is already rightfully known to the receiving party at the time it is received, free from any obligation to keep such information confidential; (ii) becomes publicly known or available through no act or omission of the receiving party or any third party; (iii) is rightfully received from a third party without restriction and without breach of this Agreement; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without the use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. 17.3 Obligation of Confidentiality. You and Zoom shall take reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of each other’s Confidential Information using measures that are at least as protective as those taken to protect its own information of a similar sensitivity, but in no event using less than a reasonable standard of care. Neither you nor Zoom will disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to any person or entity except to its employees, advisors, and attorneys who have a strict need to know the information in connection with this Agreement and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as the provisions herein. In addition to the foregoing permitted disclosures, Zoom also may disclose Customer Confidential Information to its consultants, contractors, service providers, subprocessors, and other third parties who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as the confidentiality provisions herein. 17.4 Permitted and Compelled Disclosures. Notwithstanding the restrictions in this Section 17 and without limiting any other rights of Zoom, including our disclosure rights without notice in Section 13.8, we may disclose Customer Confidential Information received in connection with this Agreement, the Services, or Software to the extent authorized in our Government Request Guide or as required by applicable Law; provided, however, that Zoom will first notify you, unless providing such notice or timely notice is: (i) prohibited by applicable Law; or (ii) determined by Zoom in its sole discretion to be (a) a risk or potential risk of harm to a person or to the health of a person, (b) a risk or potential risk of damage to property, (c) an emergency, or (d) a threat to the Services, Software, or Zoom’s rights or property.

You represent and warrant that you are either the author of all Customer Input to be provided under this Agreement or have obtained and hold all rights necessary to provide such Customer Input and receive all Customer Content in the form provided by Zoom, in connection with your or your End Users’ use of the Services or Software. Zoom may deny access to the Services to any End User who is alleged to infringe another person’s Proprietary Rights and may remove any stored Customer Content upon Zoom’s receipt of notice by the Proprietary Rights owner (e.g., a takedown request). Without limiting the foregoing, if you believe that any of your Proprietary Rights have been infringed in connection with the Services, notify Zoom as specified here.

NO HIGH RISK USE AND SAFE USE THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR USE IN HAZARDOUS OR HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE CONTROLS, INCLUDING OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT, COMBAT OPERATIONS, OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS. YOU SHALL NOT USE THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE FOR OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY HIGH-RISK ENVIRONMENT. YOU FURTHER AGREE NOT TO USE THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE IN AN UNSAFE MANNER, INCLUDING WHILE DRIVING, WALKING, OR OTHERWISE WITHOUT YOUR FULL ATTENTION WHERE RISK TO YOU, YOUR END USERS, OR OTHERS MAY ARISE OR RESULT. NO WARRANTIES YOU AGREE THAT THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ZOOM, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. ZOOM, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND LICENSORS MAKE NO GUARANTEE, PROMISE, WARRANTY, OR REPRESENTATION (i) REGARDING THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE, (ii) REGARDING THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE, OR (iii) THAT THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE WILL MEET ANY USER’S REQUIREMENTS, OR BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR FREE.

THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE REMAINS WITH YOU. ZOOM DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR RETENTION OF ANY DATA, INCLUDING CUSTOMER CONTENT AND CUSTOMER DATA, USER INFORMATION, OR COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN USERS. USE OF THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. INDEMNIFICATION To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Zoom and its affiliates and each of our licensors and suppliers (“Indemnified Parties”) harmless, including any officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, consultants, and agents of the Indemnified Parties, from any third party allegation, claim, proceeding, liability, damage, or cost (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to (i) your or your End User’s use of the Services or Software, (ii) your or your End User’s breach of this Agreement or violation of applicable Law, (iii) your or your End User’s infringement or violation of any Proprietary Rights or other right of any person or entity, (iv) your relationship with your End User or any dispute between you and your End User, or (v) a personal injury or property damage to a third party relating to your or your End User’s acts or omissions. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT LIMITS OUR LIABILITY TO YOU. ZOOM AND ITS AFFILIATES AND EACH OF THEIR LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY: SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY; UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, LOSS OF, DELETION OF, OR ALTERATION OF SYSTEM DATA, CUSTOMER CONTENT, OR CUSTOMER DATA; COSTS RELATED TO THE PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; TERMINATION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE, OR DISCONNECTION OF THE SERVICES; A FAILURE OF YOUR INTERNET SERVICES, DOWNTIME, OR MAINTENANCE; OUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL OR OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES; OR DAMAGES, IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICES (IF ANY) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIMS. THESE EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES AND LIMITATIONS ON AVAILABLE DAMAGES APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS, OBLIGATIONS, AND LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), STATUTE, CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ZOOM, ITS AFFILIATES, OR OUR LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU AND EVEN IF YOUR REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. BECAUSE SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES OR LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU TO THE EXTENT THAT THE EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES OR LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE NOT PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER You agree to resolve certain disputes with Zoom through binding arbitration (“Arbitration Agreement”). Arbitration means that an arbitrator, and not a judge or a jury, will decide the dispute. The parties expressly waive the right to bring or participate in any kind of class, collective, or mass action, private attorney general action, or any other representative action. This Arbitration Agreement supersedes all prior versions. 27.1 Covered Disputes. You and Zoom agree that any dispute or claim between you and Zoom arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services (a “Dispute”), including any related software, hardware, integrations, advertising or marketing communications, your account, or any aspects of your relationship or transactions with Zoom, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, a Dispute will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS HAVE BEEN FILED, OR MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD AFFECT YOU. YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT COULD AFFECT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THOSE ACTIONS. 27.2 Exceptions to Arbitration. This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims brought by either you or Zoom: (i) small claims court actions, if the requirements of the court are met and the claims are only on an individual basis; and (ii) claims pertaining to intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents. 27.3 Informal Dispute Resolution First. We want to address any Disputes without needing arbitration. If you have a Dispute with Zoom, prior to initiating arbitration, you agree to mail an individualized request (“Pre-Arbitration Demand”) to ATTN: Litigation Department, Zoom Video Communications, Inc., 55 Almaden Blvd., San Jose, CA 95113 so that we can work together to resolve the Dispute. A Pre-Arbitration Demand is only valid when it pertains to, and is on behalf of, a single individual. A Pre-Arbitration Demand brought on behalf of multiple individuals is invalid as to all. The Pre-Arbitration Demand must include: (i) your name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address associated with your account; (ii) the name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of your counsel, if any; (iii) a description of your Dispute; and (iv) your signature. Likewise, if Zoom has a Dispute with you, Zoom will send an email with its individualized Pre-Arbitration Demand, including the requirements listed above, to the email address associated with your Zoom account. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) calendar days of when either you or Zoom submitted a Pre-Arbitration Demand, an arbitration can be brought. If you or Zoom have a Dispute involving claims under the exception to arbitration in Section 27.2(2), then this Section 27.3 does not apply to such Dispute. You agree that compliance with this Section 27.3 is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures. 27.4 Arbitration Procedure. If, after completing the informal dispute resolution process set out in Section 27.3, either you or Zoom wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating party must serve the other party with a demand for arbitration. Any demand for arbitration by you shall be sent to the Zoom Litigation Department address in Section 27.3. Zoom will send any arbitration demand to the email address associated with your Zoom account or to your counsel, if any. You and Zoom agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs this Arbitration Agreement. If the FAA cannot apply for whatever reason, then the state laws governing arbitration procedures where you reside apply. The applicable arbitration provider depends on where you live. If you are a California resident, the arbitration shall be administered by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) under its Arbitration Rules, available at https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules. If you are not a California resident, the arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) under its operative Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms. This Agreement will govern to the extent it conflicts with the arbitration provider’s rules. If the applicable arbitration provider is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider. If the parties cannot agree on an appropriate alternative arbitration provider, then the parties will ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5. To the extent there is a dispute over which arbitration provider has jurisdiction, a NAM arbitrator shall be appointed to resolve that dispute. Arbitration hearings will take place through videoconferencing by default, unless you and Zoom agree upon another location in writing. A single arbitrator will be appointed. The arbitrator may award damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and recoverable costs. Any arbitration award may be enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction. An arbitration award shall have no preclusive effect in another arbitration or court proceeding involving Zoom and a different individual. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to resolve all threshold arbitrability issues, including whether this Agreement is applicable, unconscionable, or enforceable, as well as any defense to arbitration. However, a court has exclusive authority to rule on the Mass Action Waiver in Section 27.6, including any claim that the section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached. If a request to proceed in small claims court (see Section 27.2(1)), is made after an arbitration has been initiated, but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed. Any controversy over the small claims court’s jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court. If you or Zoom challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this Arbitration Agreement as to your Dispute. However, such court determination shall have no preclusive effect in another arbitration or court proceeding involving Zoom and a different individual. 27.5 Jury Trial Waiver. You and Zoom hereby waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. You and Zoom are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 27.2 above. Court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court. 27.6 Mass Action Waiver. You and Zoom agree that, except as specified in Section 27.7 below, each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis, and the parties hereby waive all rights to have any Dispute be brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section 27.6 are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Zoom agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and shall be pursued in the state or federal courts located in San Jose, California. This subsection does not prevent you or Zoom from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. 27.7 Bellwether Arbitrations. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Zoom agree that if there are fifty (50) or more individual arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature brought against either party by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations within a one hundred and eighty (180) day period (“Mass Filing”), the parties shall select sixteen (16) individual arbitration demands (eight (8) per side) for arbitration to proceed (“Bellwether Arbitrations”). Only those sixteen (16) arbitration demands shall be filed with the arbitration provider, and the parties shall hold in abeyance, and not file, the non-Bellwether Arbitrations. Zoom will pay the arbitration provider’s costs for the sixteen (16) Bellwether Arbitrations. The statutes of limitation, including the requirement to file within one (1) year in Section 27.10 below, shall remain tolled when non-Bellwether arbitration demands are held in abeyance. While the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, no other demand for arbitration that is part of the Mass Filing may be processed, administrated, or adjudicated, and no filing or other administrative costs for such a demand for arbitration shall be due from either party to the arbitration provider. If, contrary to this provision, a party prematurely files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance. All parties agree that arbitration demands are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. Any party may request that the arbitration provider appoint a sole standing administrative arbitrator (“Administrative Arbitrator”) to determine threshold questions such as (i) whether the Bellwether Arbitration process is applicable or enforceable, (ii) whether particular demand(s) are part of a Mass Filing, and (iii) whether demands within a Mass Filing were filed in accordance with this Agreement, including Section 27.3. In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree that the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s costs shall be paid by Zoom. The parties shall work in good faith with the arbitrator to complete each Bellwether Arbitration within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days of its initial pre-hearing conference. The parties agree that the Bellwether Arbitration process is designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving Mass Filings, including the claims of individuals who are not selected for a Bellwether Arbitration. Following resolution of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all remaining arbitration demands comprising the Mass Filing (“Global Mediation”). The Global Mediation shall be administered by the arbitration provider administering the Bellwether Arbitrations. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within thirty (30) calendar days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be filed and administered by the arbitration provider on an individual basis pursuant to the arbitration provider’s rules, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing. Any party may request that the arbitration provider appoint an Administrative Arbitrator to determine threshold questions regarding the newly filed demands. The parties agree to cooperate in good faith with the arbitration provider to implement the Bellwether Arbitration process, including the payment of filing and administrative costs for the Bellwether Arbitrations, deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Bellwether Arbitration Mass Filings until the Bellwether Arbitrations and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded, and cooperate on any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (i) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (ii) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Bellwether Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, or mass action of any kind, or an arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision. The statutes of limitation applicable to each arbitration demand within a Mass Filing, including the requirement to file within one (1) year in Section 27.10 below, shall remain tolled from the time a party makes a Pre-Arbitration Demand to the time when that party files the arbitration demand with the arbitration provider. 27.8 Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgment. At least ten (10) calendar days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, you or Zoom may serve a written offer of judgment upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitration provider, who shall enter judgment accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) calendar days after it is made, whichever occurs first, it shall be deemed withdrawn, and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration. If an offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover their post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer (which, solely for purposes of offers of judgment, may include reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent they are recoverable by statute, in an amount not to exceed the damages awarded). The parties agree that any disputes with respect to settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment in a Mass Filing are to be resolved by a single arbitrator to the extent such offers contain the same material terms. For arbitrations involving represented parties, the represented parties’ attorneys agree to communicate individual settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment to each and every arbitration claimant or respondent to whom such offers are extended. 27.9 Arbitration Costs. Except as provided for in a Mass Filing (see Section 27.7), your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative, and arbitrator costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules. If you have a gross monthly income of less than 300% of the federal poverty guidelines, you may be entitled to a waiver of certain arbitration costs. 27.10 Requirement to File Within One Year. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, and notwithstanding any other statute of limitations, any claim or cause of action under this Agreement (with the exception of disputes under Section 27.2(2)) must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be permanently barred. The statute of limitations and any arbitration cost deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by Section 27.3 above. 27.11 Opt-Out. You may reject this Arbitration Agreement and opt out of arbitration by sending an email to opt-out@zoom.us within (i) thirty (30) calendar days of April 1, 2023 if you are an existing user, or (ii) thirty (30) calendar days of the date you created your account if you are a new user. Your opt-out notice must be individualized and must be sent from the email address associated with your individual Zoom account. An opt-out notice that purports to opt out multiple parties will be invalid as to all such parties. No individual (or their agent or representative) may effectuate an opt out on behalf of other individuals. Your notice to opt-out must include your first and last name, address, the email address associated with your Zoom account, and an unequivocal statement that you decline this Arbitration Agreement. If you do decide to opt out, that opt out will apply to this Arbitration Agreement and all previous versions thereof, and neither party will have the right to compel the other to arbitrate any Dispute. However, all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply to you, and opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may enter into in the future with us. 27.12 Severability. Except as provided in Section 27.6 above, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision will be severed; however, the remaining provisions shall still apply and shall be interpreted to achieve the closest possible intent to the original intent of this section, inclusive of the severed provision. ANONYMIZED AND AGGREGATED DATA You agree that Zoom may obtain and aggregate technical and other data about your and your End Users use of the Services and Software on a de-identified or anonymized basis (“Aggregated Anonymous Data”), and Zoom may use the Aggregated Anonymous Data in accordance with applicable Law, including to analyze, develop, improve, support, and operate the Services and Software provided to you or other unrelated customers, during and after the term of this Agreement, including to generate industry benchmarks or best practices guidance, recommendations, or similar reports.

    "commentBody": "Zoom terms now allow training AI on user content with no opt outZoom terms now allow training AI on user content with no opt out (zoom.us) 1471 points by isodev 21 hours ago| 458 comments westcort Thankfully nothing like this is in Jitsi Meet’s TOS: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jitsi.org&#x2F;meet-jit-si-terms-of-service&#x2F;It never ceases to amaze me how companies choose the worst software! reply jonas21 1Section 4 of the Jitsi Meet ToS grants them similar rights. It&#x27;s just with mushier language.> You give 8×8 (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works..., communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute such content solely for the limited purpose of operating and enabling the Service to work as intended for You and for no other purposes.IANAL, but it seems like that would include training on your data as long as the model was used as part of their service.Everyone who operates a video conferencing service will have some sort of clause like this in their ToS. Zoom is being more explicit, which is generally a good thing. If Jitsi wanted to be equally explicit, they could add something clarifying that this does not include training AI models. reply gnicholas 1> solely for the limited purpose of operating and enabling the Service to work as intended for You and for no other purposes.To me (a former corporate lawyer) the \"for You\" qualifier would limit their ability to use content to train an AI for use by anyone other than \"You\". Is there an argument? Yes. But by that argument, they would also be allowed to \"publicly perform\" my videoconf calls for some flimsy reasons that don&#x27;t directly benefit me. reply johndhi 1I write these policies for my day job and I agree with this. reply oblio > I write these policies for my day jobMy regrets :-p reply zeusk 1it isn&#x27;t for you solely&#x2F;exclusively. If it \"improves\" the service for everyone - that includes \"you\". reply gnicholas 1Yep, I acknowledge that is a possibility, but it would also lead to them having permission to display literally the entirety of my videonconf calls to anyone, for advertising purposes or some other purpose that only incidentally benefits me. That would be a strained reading IMO. reply Guvante 1Additionally courts consider the fact that users have little if any say in the terms and thus tend to take the most restrictive but still reasonable view of any uncertainty in the terms.Basically \"if you wanted it you could have asked for it, if you didn&#x27;t then that is a problem\". reply gnicholas 1Yep, contracts of adhesion, and construing against the drafter: both favor the user here. reply turbojerry 1To misquote Bill Clinton, it depends on what the means of &#x27;you&#x27; is. reply benatkin 1More like a certainty :) reply crftr \"You\" is a defined term in Jitsi&#x27;s Terms of Service.>...any legal entity or business, such entity or business (collectively, “You” or “Your”) reply gnicholas In case this is meant to imply that perhaps my business and your business are both part of the same \"You\", they are not. They are each a party to a separate contract with Jitsi; we are not all party to one huge contract with each other (which would hypothetically allow Jitsi to do anything with our content for the purpose of helping them serve all of us). reply rapnie 1Self-hosting Jitsi is the better option. Or BigBlueButton, and there are more self-hosted open-source Zoom alternatives. reply samspenc 1Do you happen to know of others by any chance. For self-hosted video call solutions, looks like Jitsi and BigBlueButton (BBB) are the only decent options out there. reply esbeeb QOS (Quality-of-Service) rules might starve your traffic of bandwidth. Are you sure you have perfect \"Net Neutrality\" on your side?You would be well advised to use services where the traffic travels through https on port 443 on the server (because it&#x27;s been my experience that it tends to get pretty good QOS favorability). My own little rule of thumb: \"you can connect to any port you want, so long as it&#x27;s port 443 https.\" ;) reply David On the other hand, tls&#x2F;443 is pretty undesirable for media delivery in videoconferencing because a) it&#x27;s tcp-based and the required ACKs mean a big reduction in throughput and increase in latency, especially in the presence of packet loss, and b) most video services these days (and open source servers) use webrtc which encrypts the data in transit already--so the tls encryption is a waste of resourcesThough tls&#x2F;443 is usually still supported because it&#x27;s most often allowed by even restrictive firewalls and networks reply jfkimmes 1There&#x27;s now also https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-call.They have SFU support as of recently, so it should scale similarly to Jitsi et al. reply nemoniac 1Wait, what is \"the service\" here?As I understand it, it refers to using meet.jitsi.si, not \"another service\" someone might provide by downloading the Jitsi software and running it on their own server.Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong since this would give me cause to reconsider running a Jitsi server. reply unnah 1It&#x27;s \"the Service\" with capital S, indicating that it is a term specifically defined in the contract. Here \"the Service\" is defined as \"the meet.jit.si service, including related software applications\". If that&#x27;s not vague enough, article 2 gives 8x8 the right to change, modify, etc. the Service at any time without any notice.The guys at 8x8 may be well intentioned, but their lawyers have done their best to not give the customer any basis to sue the company in any foreseeable circumstances. That is what company lawyers do, for better or worse.Regardless, it appears that at present time jitsi is not including AI training in their service, and there is no explicit carve-out in their terms for AI training. However, by article 2 they do have the right to store user content, which might become a problem in the future. reply r2b2 1Jitsi App Privacy:→ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;jitsi-meet&#x2F;id1165103905And Zoom:→ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;id546505307Looks like one company likes to gobble data more than the other even if both privacy policies are gobble-open. reply PeterisP 1For various reasons I have a bunch of different groups where I use different videocall software for regular meetings - Zoom, Jitsi, Teams, Skype, Google Meet and Webex.Out of all those, Jitsi is the only one where I can&#x27;t rely on the core functionality - video calls and screensharing for small meetings (5-6 people); I have had multiple cases when we&#x27;ve had to switch to something else because the video&#x2F;audio quality simply wasn&#x27;t sufficient, but a different tool worked just fine for the same people&#x2F;computers&#x2F;network.Like, I fully understand the benefits of having a solution that&#x27;s self-hosted and controlled, so we do keep using self-hosted Jitsi in some cases for all these reasons, but for whatever reason the core functionality performs significantly worse than the competitors. Like, I hate MS Teams due to all kinds of flaws it has, but when I am on a Teams meeting with many others, at least I don&#x27;t have to worry if they will be able to hear me and see the data I&#x27;m showing. reply nicoco 1Bigger servers? reply smarx007 Won&#x27;t help. I&#x27;ve had multiple callers encounter trouble with what I guess WebRTC traffic due to browser extensions, \"anti\" virus software, VPN policies etc. Zoom etc. works fine. They usually fixed it by switching to a personal phone instead of a work laptop but in general, the situation is not tenable. reply bob-09 1Not sure there would be a decent enough return on investment, especially if the other tools they regularly use provide more reliable service at no additional cost. reply ebiester 1How does Jitsi handle 500-person+ conference calls these days? This is the killer zoom feature - it looks like Jitsi can handle up to 500 now. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jaas.8x8.vc&#x2F;#&#x2F;comparison .That&#x27;s personally not enough for many remote companies. So if we&#x27;re going to have to have Zoom on our machines anyway (to handle an all-company meeting), why not just use it for the rest? reply donalhunt 1Are 500-person conference calls actually productive? Surely the number of speakers in any such meeting will be a small percentage of listeners? reply CorpOverreach 1It&#x27;s useful.It&#x27;s more of a large-scale broadcast situation. Think of large corporate town halls, town council meetings, etc. reply Gasp0de 1You can just have a conference call with the 5-10 speakers and use broadcasting software to stream it to the audience, why do they need to be in the conference? reply dcow 1Why setup a separate broadcast when listeners can just join the meeting room? reply Gasp0de 1Yes, I know it&#x27;s more comfortable that way, but if you have to decide between giving all your data from all your meetings to a random US company and a slight annoyance whenever you do conferences with more than 500(!) participants, the choice is pretty simple to me.Giving all the data to zoom probably means also giving it to most US law enforcement agencies (should they request it), that would be a big no no for me. reply AshamedCaptain 1Not to mention that until very recently even MS Teams sent you to a different product when you wanted to stream to 500 people. Even if it&#x27;s now integrated, it&#x27;s still a different product inside (and e.g. you could for example open a new window when you were in a 500 people \"meeting\" at the time when you still could not do so for a regular meeting). reply lukeschlather You say \"just more comfortable\" but if you have two streams and one of them is on a channel you know to be unreliable (Jitsi) it&#x27;s pretty guaranteed the unreliable stream is going to be down a significant percentage of the time. If you&#x27;re a company with 500 people this isn&#x27;t a comfort question, you&#x27;re wasting probably hundreds of hours of your employees&#x27; time. reply Gasp0de I think we&#x27;re not on the same page about Jitsi being unreliable. In fact, it has been more reliable for me than Zoom in the past. Maybe due to the fact that I&#x27;m running Linux, I don&#x27;t know, I haven&#x27;t tried either on Windows. reply ebiester 1For the corporate or training use case, this is not a problem. If you are worried about US law agencies, you shouldn&#x27;t be using any system that isn&#x27;t rooted in face to face communication for anything sensitive. (And even that is suspect with as small as bugged devices are today.) reply Gasp0de There is a huge difference between requesting data that has already been collected and requesting Zoom&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;Google to record future data. The latter probably requires some serious intent. And of course, if I would want to be entirely safe from US law enforcement espionage then I would need to not use computers but whose use case is that? reply geysersam 1Because then you have the option to use less specialized software (not Zoom). reply pclmulqdq 1Live Q&A is a nice feature. reply dotnet00 1Conference for the speakers + unlisted livestream on YouTube could handle that, using chat for Q&A. reply ebiester 1So, then... you&#x27;re bound by youtube&#x27;s TOS, you can&#x27;t prevent people from getting in (usually via login), and Zoom makes it a nice experience instead of a hack.Oh, and you can also do sub-rooms with Zoom, which has some applications in these types of meetings. reply geysersam 1They don&#x27;t actually suggest using YouTube. The point is just to illustrate that this is a very common and relatively simple concept. There are tons of tools able to accomplish this. reply yeputons 1Chat lags for 5-120 seconds depending on livestream settings, writing is much slower than speaking, does not always convey the question as well as sound, and is close to impossible to do on the go. reply namibj They allow substantially less than 5. Tho trying is indeed slower for most people. reply SAI_Peregrinus 1For the Q&A section that comes at the end, usually. reply hk__2 1You don’t need to be in the videocall to ask a question; you can do it via chat. reply hot_gril 1Zoom has a mode that basically does this for you, which I assume is how they support >500 users. reply barbazoo 1At some point though why not just collect questions beforehand, record the whole thing and let people watch it on their own time. At that scale there&#x27;ll be no interactivity during the meeting anyway. reply max51 1Because that&#x27;s how you end up with projects that take 3 years to plan instead of 3 months. A live Q&A where all of the experts who can answer questions and everyone interested in the subject who may have questions are in the same room (live or virtual) is a lot more productive compared to what you are suggesting.If something they said in the main presentation was missing important details that you need to do you work, why do you need to wait days&#x2F;weeks for them to gather all the questions, find all the answers, and publish a video, when they could just answer it live in a few seconds?! reply brightlancer 1Having 500+ people on a project is how something takes 3 years to plan.\"At that scale there&#x27;ll be no interactivity during the meeting anyway.\" reply ebiester 1You&#x27;d be surprised how much chat happens as a side channel. Further, collecting questions means that the presentation material would have to be out there first, and that misses the point of the town halls, where financials and other initiatives are often first presented to the larger organization. reply barbazoo 1Out town halls usually ask for questions beforehand and that works quite well. reply realo 1Very... Particularly when the CEO announces half of those present are sacked... reply stavros 1So it only needs to support 250 participants, really. reply itissid 1City wide Town halls where every one can listen in but pre-registered people can ask questions are a productive usecase for public information. Those buildings can&#x27;t accommodate 500 people. reply j45 1For real, theres no 500 person conference calls, just mostly a one way broadcast with a stream of questions. reply jabradoodle 1Specifically because of the discussed TOS. reply mistrial9 1> 500-person+that is called broadcast media -- it was actually better thirty years ago than it is now. If you want conversation then you make a panel, and have a single microphone for the rest. reply bitcharmer 1Come on, 500+ calls are a very niche use case. With plenty of alternatives at that reply arun-mani-j +1 for Jitsi. They are awesome, lightweight, and just work with the least hassle.Pretty bad that many nontechnical users are not aware of it compared to Google Meet or Teams. reply chii 1This is just a marketing problem aint it?Unfortunately, one big marketing resource is also owned by said competitor...opps. So where are those antitrust laws again? reply catlover76 1A lot of us technical users have never heard of it either lol reply wkat4242 1It&#x27;s also much more responsive than teams. They seem to optimize frame rate over resolution and teams seems to do the opposite.Having used both I find the framerate more important as it&#x27;s much easier to interpret quick facial expressions. But teams looks glossier which makes it easier to sell I guess. reply Tokumei-no-hito 1Have you experienced anything like this other commenter mentioned?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37022878 reply wkat4242 17 Nope it works great for me, we always use it with the ham radio club and it performs admirably. reply justinsaccount 1For faces that might be true. I&#x27;ve had issues with different tools when sharing a full desktop session on a 4k monitor. reply Knee_Pain 1lightweight? they are literally the only video chatting service I use that makes my laptop fans spin up. reply acidburnNSA 1I tried it at the beginning of the pandemic and my siblings phones all drained during the hour long call. reply beebeepka 1I am yet to find a modern video chat that isn&#x27;t draining the battery of any laptop. From old Xeons, to fairly recent Ryzen and even M1&#x2F;2 Macs.It&#x27;s a bit puzzling, actually. I don&#x27;t think Skype and TeamSpeak had the same effect on computers back in the day. Just how much local processing are they doing these days? It&#x27;s crazy reply vorticalbox 1It&#x27;s most likely due to the fact they are all electron apps rather than they are doing \"something\". reply Sunspark 1Hardware decoding is also an issue.. as in, not being used. Old webcams used to do h.264 encoding in hardware. Encoding has since now moved to the CPU which may or may not be fine.. the next issue becomes the codec chosen.. most stuff all has h.264 decoding in hardware.. but it&#x27;s not being used anymore.. instead they&#x27;re trying to use vp09 or h.265 or av1 which in many cases requires CPU-based software encoding and decoding.. so the fans rev up like turbines.I feel certain the reason this is happening is because some middle-manager terrorist in a boardroom said \"use this codec it won&#x27;t require as much network data usage! value for the shareholder!\" without asking first whether hardware encoding is beneficial even if there&#x27;s a bit more network traffic with the older codecs.Really burns me up. I do not want to use software encoding&#x2F;decoding if I have hardware support. reply David Bandwidth is the limiting factor in a lot of circumstances, and networks are very challenging to manage. Especially with an increasing number of users on mobile connections, reducing network usage can be the right call.But performance matters, too, of course. It&#x27;s tricky to balance them. reply hot_gril 1I think Google Meet uses VP9, which is really annoying. reply qwytw 1> electron appsWhich only adds limited overhead to certain cases. Unless they are encoding&#x2F;decoding video directly in JS... reply paulmd Correct, teams doesn’t use videotoolbox so it’s software encoding. Probably not directly in javascript per se, it’s probably calling a native library, but it’s hot because teams doesn’t use hardware encoding. reply David Video encoding and decoding is expensive! Especially as cameras improve and users&#x27; expectations of quality increase. reply hot_gril 1Zoom is reasonably light and uses hardware acceleration on anything modern (e.g. my 2015 MBP). reply boredumb 1I started using matrix internally (with element as a client) which uses jitsi under the hood for video&#x2F;voice chat. Quality is amazing. reply mrd3v0 1Element Call is going to be pretty great once it is production-ready and has E2EE enabled by default (a branch of it already has it on.) reply wkat4242 1Not anymore actually.

Zoom has the lower barrier to entry for normal users (who far outnumber us nerdy type) than any other app in it&#x27;s class. Worst for privacy, best for usability, many argue. reply api 1Worst for privacy best for usability is the norm. Most B2C stuff is almost predatory.

Not if you self-host Jitsi on your own server (which you should if you&#x27;re a medium-large company, for data protection and all that) reply lucb1e Of course. If you run it yourself, you&#x27;re free to train your neural nets on your users, if that&#x27;s something you want to doFor restrictions on what you can do with the code, you&#x27;ll need to check the code&#x27;s license, not the hosted-service&#x27;s terms of use reply wkat4242 1Also jitsi can easily be self hosted which means no information will leak altogether.I&#x27;ve refused to install zoom since they installed a Mac backdoor and refused to remove it until Apple took a stand and marked them as malware until they removed it.

In never ceases to amaze me that this community is so out of touch with the general populace. reply danShumway 1Tangentially related, but a number of telehealth operations with hospitals&#x2F;therapists&#x2F;etc... use Zoom -- I suspect because their clients can connect without an app or an account over a browser.When you join a Zoom session over the browser, you don&#x27;t sign a TOS. And I assume that actual licensed medical establishments are under their own TOS provisions that are compatible with HIPPA requirements. Training on voice-to-text transcription, etc... would be a pretty huge privacy violation particularly in the scope of services like therapy. Both because there are demonstrable attacks on AIs to get training data out of them, and because presumably that data would then be accessible to employees&#x2F;contractors who were validating that it was fit for training.Out of curiosity, has anyone using telehealth checked with their doctor&#x2F;therapist to see what Zoom&#x27;s privacy policies are for them? reply johndhi 1Looks like they have a separate offering, Zoom for Healthcare that presumably has different terms and conditions.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.zoom.us&#x2F;answering-questions-about-zoom-healthca... reply NeverFade What if you discuss sensitive health-related details with someone other than your doctor, for example your attorney?The privacy issues here are bottomless, and so are the legal issues. reply johndhi The law doesn&#x27;t protect it. HIPAA doesn&#x27;t apply in that setting.Attorney client privilege is an interesting case.\"Privacy issues\" is a meaningless phrase to me when divorced from the law. Do you mean, like, ethically concerning? This term in the contract is neither uncommon nor illegal. reply whatatita I know that many smaller therapists use Zoom for exactly the reasons you mentioned above - ease of use. They often don&#x27;t have the technical know-how to assess the technology they&#x27;re using.The UK, for example, has hundreds of private mental health practitioners (therapists, psychologists, etc.) that provice their services directly to clients. They almost universally use off-the-shelf technology for video calling, messaging, and reporting. reply kkylin Related to this, anyone know if Zoom has a separate offering for education (universities, schools, etc)? I teach at a university, and not only do we use Zoom for lectures etc, but also for office hours, meetings, etc, where potentially sensitive student information may be discussed. I&#x27;m probably not searching for the right thing; all I found was this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explore.zoom.us&#x2F;docs&#x2F;doc&#x2F;FERPA%20Guide.pdf(FERPA is to higher ed in the US what HIPAA is to healthcare.) reply armchairhacker Both my undergraduate and universities have free Zoom under .zoom.us, so I assume it&#x27;s separate reply haldujai IANAL but “Zoom for Healthcare” is a business associate under HIPAA and treated as an extension of the provider with some added restrictions.Covered entities (including the EMR and hospital itself) can use protected health information for quality improvement without patient consent and deidentified data freely.Where this gets messy is that deidentification isn’t always perfect even if you think you’re doing it right (especially if via software) and reidentification risk is a real problem.To my understanding business associates can train on deidentified transcripts all they want as the contracts generally limit use to what a covered entity would be allowed to do (I haven’t seen Zoom’s). I know that most health AI companies from chatbots to image analysis do this. Now if their model leaks data that’s subsequently reidentified this is a big problem.Most institutions therefore have policies more stringent than HIPAA and treat software deidentified data as PHI. Stanford for example won’t allow disclosure of models trained on deidentified patient data, including on credentialed access sources like physionet, unless each sample was manually verified which isn’t feasible on the scale required for DL.Edit: Zoom’s BAA: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explore.zoom.us&#x2F;docs&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;baa.html“Limitations on Use and Disclosure. Zoom shall not Use and&#x2F;or Disclose the Protected Health Information except as otherwise limited in this Agreement or by application of 42 C.F.R. Part 2 with respect to Part 2 Patient Identifying Information, for the proper management and administration of Zoom…”“Management, Administration, and Legal Responsibilities. Except as otherwise limited in this BAA, Zoom may Use and Disclose Protected Health Information for the proper management and administration of Zoom…”Not sure if “proper management and administration” has a specific legal definition or would include product development.Edit 2: My non-expert reading of this legal article suggests they can. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.morganlewis.com&#x2F;-&#x2F;media&#x2F;files&#x2F;publication&#x2F;outsid...“But how should a business associate interpret these rules when effective management of its business requires data mining? What if data mining of customer data is necessary in order to develop the next iteration of the business associate’s product or service? … These uses of big data are not strictly necessary in order for the business associate to provide the contracted service to a HIPAA-covered entity, but they may very well be critical to management and administration of the business associate’s enterprise and providing value to customers through improved products and services.In the absence of interpretive guidance from the OCR on the meaning of ‘management and administration’, a business associate must rely almost entirely on the plain meaning of those terms, which are open to interpretation.” reply johndhi Haha wow this is a great post. I am a lawyer and you may have solved a problem I recently encountered. So you think this is saying that generic language in the Zoom BAA constitutes permission to de-identify?Are there examples of healthcare ai chatbots trained on de-id data btw?

I am a lawyer and you may have solved a problem I recently encountered.

Patient have no responsibility to ensure the tech used by their care provider is secure or that their medical records don&#x27;t wind up on Twitter. HIPAA dictates that the care providers ensure that happens by placing both civil and sometimes criminal liability on the provider for not going to great lengths here.In practice, this means lawyers working with the care providers have companies sign legal contracts ensuring the business associate is in compliance with HIPAA, and are following all of the same rules as HIPAA (search: HIPAA BAA).Additionally, you can be in compliance with HIPAA and still fax someone&#x27;s medical records. reply IG_Semmelweiss Healthcare professionals still use fax precisely because of this.Analog line fax is HIPAA compliant because it is not \"stored\"Using a cloud fax provider will inmediately put you out of compliance for this reason, unless you have a HIPAA compliant cloud fax service, which are rare. reply haldujai I don’t think the question is about Zoom’s safeguards which are audited, and as you say almost certainly stronger than HIPAA requirements, but rather whether they can use the stored PHI for product development where the law appears ambiguous. reply johndhi Imo the law basically says you can do this with PHI:-De-identify it then do whatever you want with it -use it to provide some service for the covered entity, but not for anyone else -enter a special research contract if you want to use it slightly de-identified for some other specific purpose reply haldujai One note is that the act of deidentification itself requires accessing PHI when done retroactively, this may be institutional policy or specific to covered entities but per the privacy office lawyers such access (apart from a small dataset) requires a permitted use to be accessible in order to then deidentify and use freely.As with all things HIPAA, this only becomes a problem when HHS starts looking and I’m sure in practice many people ignore this tidbit (if in fact this is the law and not Stanford policy). replyjxf 1edit: I&#x27;m retracting my earlier comment.

A call recording stored to your zoom cloud can be a form of service generated data from calls.And sounds like it include transcripts of live audio could also function as service generated data (was the audio clear? Could ai convert speech to text?)The statistics of calls could turn into the wavelengths of the audio and video in real time.

They abandonded all the equipment and expertiese a few years ago in favor of Zoom. For all its faults, it&#x27;s just so much easier for users. They probably saved 10 or more minutes per meeting of \"Can you hear me? Can you see us? Can you see my screen?\" BS at the start of each meeting.I guess it also helps that these days most people are working with phones or laptops that have integrated and well supported cameras and microphones, vs. then when that stuff would have been external peripherals and required installation of the proper drivers. reply TheRealPomax 1Odds of any company spending the millions of dollars required to do that poorly, let alone going the extra distance to do it right: about zero. reply musha68k 1I don’t know, we might be closer to quality of service parity than we think.Even without taking into account “costs” of blatant privacy disregard &#x2F; violation, data theft, potential industrial espionage, etc.If the tools continue to get better at the current rate; then the SREs you have to hire anyways will probably be able to deliver about equal results (while staying in control of the data).I’m thinking about those GPU “coops” we heard about emerging, shared between SV startups.And then think about what Oxide are doing.Then binding all of those trends together through the promise of Kubernetes and its inherent complexity finally getting realized &#x2F; becoming “worth it” at some point.Multi cluster, multi region - multi office attached server rooms across CO’s locations? Everything old could be new again. Wireguard enabled service meshes, Cluster API, etc. We will get there at some point probably sooner than later.Then you “just install” the fault tolerant Jitsi helm chart across that infra… with all the usual caveats of maintenance taken into account of course. Again hassles will be reduced on all fronts and SREs needed anyways.I do lots of terraform and k8s in my day job but at this point I deem any work that isn’t directly related to k8s as some kind of semi (at best) vendor specific dead weight knowledge.

Everyone else will just need to be extra careful what they say in the event that the AI accidentally leaks something. reply naillo 1Their mouths must be watering at this thought but the legal repercussions are obviously company destroying reply j45 1It wouldn’t be surprising.Gotta make sure audio is clear on calls.How?We run randomly less random speech to text to make sure words are being said.Which words? Well if any are on this list of words we might think have to tell someone. reply hammock 1Isn&#x27;t that what \"Customer Content\" is? reply LinuxBender 1It is, though I suspect there may be some expectation that voice-to-text transcription only occurs when one clicks a button to make it so. reply hammock 1I just like how everyone is up in arms over the use of your meetings for AI training specifically, when the ToS clearly says all \"Customer Content&#x2F;Customer Input\" AKA your words, text, voice, face, etc can be used for \"Product and Services Development\" which could as easily be a facial recognition database, a corporate espionage service, a direct competitor to whatever company you work for, or literally anything else before it&#x27;s an AI lol. reply zakember 1This is not new. These terms were quietly updated on 1st April 2023.

I&#x27;ll move on to using a different video chat service...They&#x27;re a dime-a-dozen. Good job tanking your reputation and business, zoom! reply imiric I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll miss your business, but this change will hardly impact their bottom line. Most users will continue to use it, even if they&#x27;re aware of and are concerned by this, as the cost and inconvenience of switching is too high. reply s5ma6n 1I am really puzzled how are they able to \"quietly\" update the terms without notifying their users? Everybody was joking about the emails (We have updated our terms...) raining from every company when GDPR et al. got introduced. What changed? reply greyface- Section 15 of the agreement (\"MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT\") allows for Zoom to unilaterally change the terms without providing notice other than updating them on the website. reply SamuelAdams You really ought to read “No Filter” by Sarah Frier. She talks about exactly this, except with Apple and iTunes in 2001. Apple’s biggest change wasn’t “digitizing music”, it was enabling a system that allows arbitrary changes to terms and conditions for services they offered. Apparently if you presented a digital copy of a TOS and users clicked one button, it was legally binding. Other companies caught on and started doing it, and well that’s how Zoom is able to do this - people don’t bother to read what they’re agreeing to so legally it’s the user’s fault if the software does something they don’t like. reply esperent 1Possibly they&#x27;ve done something illegal here. Let&#x27;s wait and see (or, if you&#x27;re in the EU, take action and report it to your data protection authority and NOYB). reply AlecSchueler 1I thought those emails were a form of protest, like complying in the most annoying way possible just to make a point. reply isodev 10.2 … You agree that Zoom compiles and may compile Service Generated Data based on Customer Content and use of the Services and Software. You consent to Zoom’s access, use, collection, creation, modification, distribution, processing, sharing, maintenance, and storage of Service Generated Data for any purpose, to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable Law, including for the purpose of product and service development, marketing, analytics, quality assurance, machine learning or artificial intelligence (including for the purposes of training and tuning of algorithms and models), training, testing, improvement of the Services, Software, or Zoom’s other products, services, and software, or any combination thereof, and as otherwise provided in this Agreement reply asplake Before that:> Customer Content does not include any telemetry data, product usage data, diagnostic data, and similar content or data that Zoom collects or generates in connection with your or your End Users’ use of the Services or Software (“Service Generated Data”).I could be wrong, but my take is that there is not all that much to see here reply smt88 1Zoom is giving itself the right to collect video and audio of you that could be used today to deepfake your voice in a convincing way.It won&#x27;t be long before the video deepfakes are convincing too.This is absolutely awful and terrifying. reply geysersam 1> does not include ... product usage data, diagnostic data, and similar content or data that Zoom collects or generates in connection with your ... use of the ServicesDid you not read the quote? Or are you telling me this still might include video and audio data? I feel like an medieval illiterate farmer reading latin... reply smt88 1The scope of content used for AI training seems (to me) like it only includes video and audio data.The list you reproduced above sounds like it&#x27;s just metadata, like IP addresses, authentication logs, click tracking, etc. reply calibas 1It&#x27;s section 10.4 that says they can use \"Customer Content\" for AI training. reply isodev 1It&#x27;s hard to understand what they mean. I understand it as they&#x27;re free to generate \"Service Generated Data\" based on “Customer Content”. So for example, a compressed rendition of a call recording would be \"Service Generated Data\" and thus they will be free to do whatever they want with it (improve their caption generation models ... or sell it to someone?). reply chrisjj 1> It&#x27;s hard to understand what they mean.Working as designed, surely. reply j45 1A recording of your call can be generated data based on their service recording it. reply AdieuToLogic 1After that, section 10.4:> 10.4 Customer License Grant. You agree to grant and hereby grant Zoom a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license and all other rights required or necessary to redistribute, publish, import, access, use, store, transmit, review, disclose, preserve, extract, modify, reproduce, share, use, display, copy, distribute, translate, transcribe, create derivative works, and process Customer Content and to perform all acts with respect to the Customer Content: ... (ii) for the purpose of product and service development, marketing, analytics, quality assurance, machine learning, artificial intelligence, ...I believe this might be the wording the submission references. reply pteraspidomorph 1There is also a provision for letting them train AI on Customer Content (10.4: machine learning, artificial intelligence, training) so the distinction probably doesn&#x27;t matter in this case? reply sjmulder \"..for any purpose\", how is this ever supposed to fly in the EU or UK? Should be opt-in, not in the small print, and entirely optional. reply jsnell 1You&#x27;re both misquoting and misunderstanding. Misquoting in that you clipped out the \"to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable Law\". And misunderstanding since the text was talking \"service generated data\", not about \"customer data\". That&#x27;s basically data generated by their system (e.g. debug logs). It&#x27;s not the data you entered into the system (contact information), the calls you made, the chats you sent, etc.Also, the linked document is effectively a license for the intellectual property rights. The data protection side of things would be covered by the privacy policy[0]. This all seems pretty standard?[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explore.zoom.us&#x2F;en&#x2F;privacy&#x2F; reply AdieuToLogic 1> And misunderstanding since the text was talking \"service generated data\", not about \"customer data\".Isn&#x27;t that what section 10.4 covers and ultimately grants liberal rights to Zoom?> 10.4 Customer License Grant.

It doesn&#x27;t create any kind of end-run around the GDPR, and wouldn&#x27;t e.g. count as consent for GDPR purposes. reply GuB-42 1Furthermore, as far as I know, the \"to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable Law\" part is just a reminder. Laws always have priority over contracts, and any part of a contract that goes against the law can simply be ignored. reply a2128 1I don&#x27;t think they carved themselves out this permission for the purpose of training an AI on debug logs. For all we know \"Zoom compiles Service Generated Data based on Customer Content\" may include them compiling an mp4 of your call. That would seem to fall under the part of the definition that says \"data that Zoom collects or generates in connection with your or your End Users’ use of the Services or Software\" reply sjmulder 1You&#x27;re right, I was too quick to judge. Sorry. reply jodrellblank 1“…for any purpose, to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable Law” reply imiric 1This is very much like the Black Mirror episode Joan Is Awful.By using modern services we consent to our data, including our likeness, being used in any way the service can extract value from it. User data is such a gold mine that most services should be paying their users instead. Even giving the service away for \"free\" doesn&#x27;t come close to making this a fair exchange.Not to sound pessimistic, but we are already living in a dystopia, and it will only get much, much worse. Governments are way behind in regulating Big Tech, which in most cases they have no desire in since they&#x27;re in a symbiotic relationship. It&#x27;s FUBAR. reply cade Enjoyed the Black Mirror reference, and will hopefully add to the pop culture enjoyable cross linking with https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;HumancentiPad.> WHY WON’T IT READ?! reply yosito 1Balaji talks a lot about the state losing power in the future, but I don&#x27;t think this is how he was envisioning it. reply wwweston As far as I can tell he&#x27;s not only pretty sure he&#x27;ll be part of the class that holds power like this without accountability to any state, he consistently makes manipulative statements which function to move things in that direction. reply zmmmmm This seems a subtle shift in general with AI is people feel entitled to treat it as an end in itself or a black box. The agreement says they can use \"User Content\" for:> the purpose of product and service development, marketing, analytics, quality assurance, machine learning, artificial intelligence, training, testing, improvement of the Services, SoftwareSo notice most of these are somehow qualified to the service they are providing you, but the AI part stands alone. If it was to improve the service to me, that would be pretty reasonable, but here it says they can use it for AI as an end unto itself.Something about the inscrutability of modern AI (nobody knows how it really works, what the limits of its capabilities are etc.) seems to lend itself to this kind of open ended vagueness. If they just wrote \"we can use your user generated content for anything we like\" it would almost amount to the same thing but people would be outraged. But when they say \"it&#x27;s for AI\" everyone nods their head as if it&#x27;s somehow different to that. reply buildbuildbuild 1How to enable end to end encryption in Zoom: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.zoom.us&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;360048660871-End-t...(Presuming of course that their closed source software really E2E encrypts without a backdoor) reply gumballindie 1Why not simply use a product that doesnt steal your meeting content? reply hot_gril 1Cause Zoom works well for a lot of people, or you have no choice in the matter. reply ta1243 1\"I am altering the deal.

This is my employers problem, not mine.Where it actually starts to bother me is when I need to use a platform like Zoom for a job interview. Now I&#x27;m forced to download this spyware onto my personal computer and forced to consent to a whole bunch of things I would rather not consent to, as a private individual, rather than as a representative of my employer. reply unnouinceput 1That&#x27;s a question for you company&#x27;s legal department, not HN reply abecedarius Why not switch? I&#x27;ve had good experiences with competitors. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re as nice for mass meetings instead of one-to-one or small groups, but at least for the chats I&#x27;ve had, there&#x27;s never been any reason to go to Zoom.(I care more about spyware, privacy, and user sovereignty than AI training.) reply lucb1e 1> I&#x27;ve had good experiences with competitorsThat&#x27;s flipped for me: I&#x27;ve had good experiences with zoom on occasion.The only time we use Zoom is with US customers, so a handful of times per year I&#x27;d estimate. Before covid, I only ever heard of Zoom in the context of laughably bad vulnerabilities; then during covid, suddenly it was a new verb used online to mean video calls. In a world where there are many established players (until 2019-12-31, I had already used: skype&#x2F;lync, jitsi, discord, signal, whatsapp, wire, telegram, hangouts, webex, jami&#x2F;ring, and gotomeeting) are already established players, why in the world would anyone ever choose to go with specifically the company that we all laughed at? I don&#x27;t get it, and it seems most of our customers (mostly european) either reply hot_gril 1Zoom is the only thing that&#x27;s worked reliably in conferences for me. Some of those apps work for small calls but aren&#x27;t made for work meetings.Our university had premium GSuite accounts for every student beforehand and STILL moved all its classes onto Zoom in 2020, because Meet&#x2F;Hangouts was (and still is) far behind. Aside from lacking some of Zoom&#x27;s important features and always having random issues with joining meetings, it totally hogs your CPU to the point of it actually impacting meetings, probably cause it uses VP9 which doesn&#x27;t have hardware accel on most machines. reply nerdponx When it comes to ridiculous EULA provisions like in this thread, are any of those competitors any better? Of course the open source ones are, but do people actually use those? Maybe they&#x27;re popular in Europe, but I certainly won&#x27;t be able to convince a potential American employer to interview me over Jitsi any time soon. reply qingcharles 1There are situations where it is impossible to switch. For instance, practically all courts use Zoom for remote hearings. When I was in jail Zoom was used for remote visits. reply abecedarius 1That&#x27;s so absurd. Whatever punishment might have been merited, it shouldn&#x27;t include CCP spyware. reply jimmaswell 1I&#x27;d take Zoom over Teams any day. Multiple times lately Teams has completely crashed trying to view a screen share, and viewing a screen share has taken 3 attempts sometimes, or works then breaks if I maximize the window and the presenter has to stop and start &#x2F;again&#x2F;. Zoom never gave me these problems. reply abecedarius 1I haven&#x27;t tried the Microsoft thing -- sounds like a pain. Elsewhere in these threads there are some recommendations that match my experience. reply stubish Both ends need to switch, and Zoom has become entrenched and that won&#x27;t happen without legislation or enforcement of existing legislation that makes recording calls illegal in many jurisdictions (user agreements don&#x27;t make many illegal things legal). reply landgenoot Because \"company policies\" reply hiepph 1This. I personally can switch but how do I communicate with my other colleagues? It&#x27;s hard to convey people to move into a whole new stack without significant effort. reply abecedarius 1FWIW it&#x27;s gone all right with Google Meet as the usual suggestion from me -- though as I said, it&#x27;s been only small-group chats. Most of my colleagues have Chrome.If really necessary for some particular chat I can use Zoom&#x27;s in-browser page, ignoring its ridiculous auto-download of the native client. (I didn&#x27;t even know a page could do that, before.) reply ta1243 1Presumably Microsoft does the same with Teams reply e40 1Or worse. Skype tos were changed to allow eavesdropping for quality control purposes, some time after the purchase. reply jamesgill 1It seems to me that every ‘AI’ effort I see today utterly depends on circumventing or ignoring privacy. reply TheRealPomax 1I like the part where the reason the US keeps allowing it is that \"if we don&#x27;t, China will\", as if China has access to the same flood of data that US FAANG companies and contenders like Zoom have access to every second of every day.Sure, at the government level it has access to the same data as everyone else, but that firewall&#x27;s still there, can&#x27;t have an AI trained on data that might give a more worldly view on matters the party doesn&#x27;t want citizens exposed to. A Chinese AI will be pretty useless for western audiences, so best they can do is make the hardware.Which they already do. reply duccinator 1China might not be as successful as the west(yet) but they have their own ecosystem and have alternatives for most tech products.All the tech companies in China are practically under the control of the party. China also has a billion+ people, even the market is smaller than the west, I think they will manage.Not to mention the difference in privacy laws and a higher number of stem grads to throw at the problem. reply TheRealPomax 1So we agree: that was my point. China is not a competitor for western markets, meaning the argument that \"If we don&#x27;t do it, China will\" is fucking ridiculous, as China doesn&#x27;t have access to the data necessary to make things that WORK for the western market. reply gumballindie 1Even china isnt silly enough to record people’s conversations to “train” ais. Corporate dictatorships have truly overtaken communist dictatorships. reply iaw 1> Even china isnt silly enough to record people’s conversations to “train” ais.China has a social credit score with facial recognition on their network of security cameras in public settings....Recording peoples conversations to monitor for undesirable terms (likely with AI) is almost a certainty... reply gumballindie 1Correct, but they are not yet recording in order to augment their own citizens. reply TheRealPomax 1....what? Which century are you living in that China does record people&#x27;s conversations? reply gumballindie Not for ai training though. reply TheRealPomax Yeah oh absolutely the party will only use data for a single purpose, they&#x27;ll never go \"hey all these AI chips we&#x27;re exporting maybe we can-\".oh wait. replyicco 1Definitely, but so does every advertising play. While AI companies are more egregious, this isn&#x27;t anything new. reply TheRealPomax 1That seems an intentionally blind take on the matter. That&#x27;s like saying that because you&#x27;ve seen a kid shoplift a pack of gum at a gas station, an organized crime outfit stealing entire ATMs from every gas station in a 200 mile radius isn&#x27;t anything new.Scale matters. reply gumballindie 1Since there’s no intelligence in ai stealing people’s work is the only way to “train” them. reply barbariangrunge 1And the copyright of individuals reply nemoniac Can anyone point to a short overview of the various online video meeting platforms and their terms regarding AI training, eavesdropping for QC or otherwise and claims of E2E encryption? reply aparnabzoom Hi there - this is Aparna from Zoom, our Chief Operating Officer. Thank you for your care and concern for our customers - we are grateful for the opportunity to double click on how we treat customer content.To clarify, Zoom customers decide whether to enable generative AI features (recently launched on a free trial basis) and separately whether to share customer content with Zoom for product improvement purposes.Also, Zoom participants receive an in-meeting notice or a Chat Compose pop-up when these features are enabled through our UI, and they will definitely know their data may be used for product improvement purposes. reply webmink Thanks for commenting. The issue is not with using AI features though - it is with the Terms granting you unrestricted and eternal use to our conversations to train your AI and potentially disclose our work to your other customers. reply jonReadingNews I can’t help but notice the distinction between between customers _deciding_ and participants being _informed_. Can participants not also decide? Can the decisions not be mutual and decided per-session?My child uses zoom for school and our family for healthcare - both of those scenarios make us participants. It sounds like we are beholden to the decisions of your customer, the institutions.I am extremely concerned and intending to initiate discussions and suggesting alternatives promptly this week. reply tailspin2019 When you say “Zoom customers decide … whether to share customer content with Zoom”…Can you elaborate on whether this is opt-out or opt-in? Does a new user who starts to use Zoom today have this turned on by default?Usually when companies say things like “customers decide” it can gloss over a lot of detail like hidden settings that default to “on” or other potentially misleading &#x2F; dark patterns.Given the obvious interest in the finite details being discussed in this thread, and your legal background, it would be good to hear a bit more of a comprehensive response if you can provide it. reply aparnabzoom Hi there - this is opt in. A new user starting to use Zoom today does not have this turned on by default. reply tailspin2019 Thanks for participating in the discussion here, it’s helpful.Clause 10.4 in your terms seems to grant you rights to do pretty much anything with “Customer Content” (including the AI training specifically being talked about).So I’m still a bit confused because regardless of any opt in mechanism in your product, these usage terms don’t seem to be predicated on the user having done anything to opt in other than ostensibly agreeing to your terms of service?In other words, as a Zoom user who has deliberately NOT opted in to anything, I still don’t have a lot of confidence in the rights being granted to you via your standard terms over my content.The wording of the terms imply that you don’t actually need me to opt in for you to have these rights over my data? reply206 more comments...",

You can’t develop a product for people to use behind closed doors, because you run the risk of building the wrong product. Conversely, if it’s too out in the open then anyone and their parents might have suggestions to improve which will drag you away from the core thesis of your product&#x2F;PMF.I guess another way to ask my question is - is the aforementioned sequence of steps (please add X, string of +1s, PRs welcome, etc) a bad thing? reply monk1 > I’m curious about what’s the best way to go about gathering user feedback and feature requests.IMO, building in the open is still the best way. But to ensure that you don&#x27;t end up with a mongrel of a thing that tries to do every single thing requested by everybody, It does help to have a rigid set of goals about what we want to build. And the courage to say NO to feature requests that stray too far from the original design goals. reply H8crilA The answer is you grow up, make decisions \"behind closed doors\" and live with the consequences. replyjfoutz 1this is still my favorite. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oimo.io&#x2F;works&#x2F;life&#x2F; That dev has a bunch of cool projects. reply mmwelt 18 The clock is also pretty cool: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oimo.io&#x2F;works&#x2F;clock&#x2F; reply data-ottawa Wow, that is so cool!

It keeps moving forever. A bucket of water would stand still after a few minutes.Edit: Seems to lack simulation of friction between water particles? reply nwoli Funnily this is usually something you need to fix in water simulations like this one since a lot of solutions have artificial too rapid energy loss. So the fact that it acts this way is sign of more mastery rather than less (it’s trivial to reduce energy faster). reply sdwr Came here with the same nitpick. It settles down too slowly. Also takes too long to start moving after changing angle. So it&#x27;s in this weird spot where it&#x27;s both more + less reactive than real water. reply owlninja Just seems like some fun art to me, could have been named anything. reply galaxyLogic It may be some special water or water in special circumstances.Could it be that in space or low gravity water behaves more like this? reply rexspex Nope, in space&#x2F;low grav you would still have the friction between the water molecules. Additionally, in space&#x2F;low grav the water would want to clump. reply eichin how about: it&#x27;s a 2d simulation, not a slice through a 3d one, so you should probably not expect any intuition to apply? (Fun to watch, though!) reply m101 I looks like it is more compressible and elastic than normal water which may cause the behaviour shown. If I&#x27;m not mistaken normal water is very hard to compress. reply EchoReflection It does calm down, but never stills. But the ocean never stills, so I would still give this full credit&#x2F;an A+ reply squeaky-clean Would be neat if it simulated the air too. As-is, you can open up bubbles in the middle of the volume of water. Still a fun project. reply anotheraccount9 It could be water, under different pressure and gravity.

I understand it was impressive 15 years ago, but I don&#x27;t get why is so impressive today. Again, I don&#x27;t pretend to be rude, just to understand why is people so impressed by this. reply pygy_ The beer thing was a glorified level app.This one has a fluid dynamics simulation. reply tudorw Also guessing this is cross platform and runs in the browser :) reply phkahler My dad worked on the Apollo program In The 60s. They were using analog computers to simulate fuel slosh in the tanks. He also had a flight sim display that allegedly could go from space (earth as a circle?) To low level horizon and grid. I never saw either but am about to toss schematics for the later with the rest of his stuff. Personal note - he died in &#x27;03 and I&#x27;m done hanging on to stuff. :-) reply HWR_14 If you are planning to toss schematics used in the Apollo program, I would love to frame something and put it on the wall. I understand the weight of historically significant junk (and I don&#x27;t think I would want to have tons of it myself), but that&#x27;s very different from a piece of engineering history. reply OJFord I don&#x27;t have the domain expertise or interest to know what&#x27;s important or rare, and I can completely understand not wanting to hang on to it personally any longer, but that sounds like something a lot of people might be interested in, that ought to be exhibited somewhere, if (as it sounds like) it&#x27;s work-oriented and not too personal. reply mietek You should upload them to the Internet Archive. reply jmholla And&#x2F;or donate them to somewhere that&#x27;d be interested in preserving them. reply iancmceachern My grandfather did also.Please don&#x27;t trash them, I will take them and pay you for shipping and your time. My email is in my bio.I understand why you don&#x27;t want to hang onto them, no judgement. reply Reticularas Don&#x27;t toss those- they belong in a museum reply lordnacho I opened it on my laptop, which doesn&#x27;t have any motion sensitive device on it.Where does the left-right asymmetry arise from? reply comment_ran Well, it looks like something, but if you&#x27;re not talking to me that it&#x27;s water, I can not say. I just have a strange feeling about it. It&#x27;s not water, it&#x27;s something different. I don&#x27;t know why, maybe it&#x27;s the way you visualize, or maybe it&#x27;s just the two-dimensional nature of the simulation. Or maybe it&#x27;s the reflection, maybe it&#x27;s the post-processing procedure. We don&#x27;t have some ray tracing, we don&#x27;t have those normal calculations, reflection index, all those crazy stuff. reply mNovak This actually strikes me as a good example (analogy?) to illustrate quantum effects -- if you let it sit it mostly approaches a flat average level, but there&#x27;s still occasional \"random\" splashes that can reach much higher than you&#x27;d expect. Makes me think of things like electron tunnelingDon&#x27;t know if that makes sense to anyone else reply godelski This should make a lot of sense. Quantum is particles acting like waves. Then remember that absolute zero was originally formulated as the impossible state of no particles moving. But I&#x27;d also be careful taking this as a great analogy to quantum because really what you&#x27;re just seeing is wave effects (which is really important to quantum) but not seeing some of the other effects. Especially the weird ones.At first I thought this was SPH (smooth particle hydrodynamics) but the site says it is PIC (particle in cell).[0][0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yzhu.io&#x2F;publication&#x2F;mpmmls2018siggraph&#x2F; reply fanmail https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brownian_motion might interest you reply Scubabear68 1Wow, very cool. Works best if you lock your phone to not rotate views as you rotate your phone. reply erlich When people talk about us living in a simulation...you have to wonder if they have ever tried to simulate real liquids (e.g. computation fluid dynamics).Computer graphics in films gives people an unrealistic expectation of what we can do. I would think a lot of people look at this CGI and then think such things are possible in real-time gaming&#x2F;simulation. reply mcny 1How come on the iPhone I get a prompt saying \" would like to access motion and orientation\" but not on Android? reply brucethemoose2 1The motion doesn&#x27;t even work running Bromite on Android, presumably because of the fingerprinting protection.Its crazy how our phones have all these sophisticated sensors, yet they are mostly used for something related to tracking for ads. So much so that I don&#x27;t notice when its blocked. reply layer8 1Chrome on Android allows it by default. You have to got to Site Settings to disable it. Safari on iOS prompts the user before allowing it. reply afavour It used to be available as standard on both but iOS locked it down after some truly insane demos showing how it could be used for fingerprinting or (IIRC) even detecting what users were typing.This is why we can’t have good things. reply KomoD 1Are you using the same browser on both...? reply cmeacham98 1They cannot be, because all browsers on iOS are reskinned Safari (due to Apple&#x27;s App Store policies), and Safari is not on Android. reply mcny Good point, I was using Firefox on both but as you said Firefox on iOS is just Safari. To be fair to Mozilla, I am running Firefox nightly on Android. reply athesyn I&#x27;m confused by the labelling, normally \"super\" implies speed but here the interaction gets slower while the pixels increase. Maybe Max is a better descriptor? reply drewtato In video game terminology, higher rank words mean more graphical fidelity. Normally this is \"Ultra\" but \"Super\" is also common. reply layer8 1I get the feeling it’s missing an implementation of surface tension. reply ivan_gammel 1Looks like coordinates are inverted on my iPad (landscape mode). The water is falling to the higher part of the screen. reply grumblepeet On mine too. iPad is locked into place on the Magic Keyboard. ‘Water’ goes to the top of the screen. reply LorenDB I&#x27;ve realized that every few months somebody posts a link to one of the many (cool) things on oimo.io.

Cool to see it move with my phone. I would like to see more love on the CSS of the selection radios though. Surely you can do better. My phone lost 35% of its battery on this. Happily lost. reply alberth While very cool, what&#x27;s not realistic is the liquid coming to a rest.Even 5+ minutes after resting my phone against the wall (to ensure no vibrations), there were still sizable currents. reply dorkwood I thought the same thing when looking at the ocean the other day.

That happens in countries I have not yet visited.It’s weird. Most of my time at work I deal with pretty mundane things. And if I am thirsty, water is always available.Water simulations are extra interesting to me now, because I am realising that in the future maybe I can help bring water to places where people are struggling because of unreliable access to water.I think it would be very nice to be able to help other people on that way. reply megalodon parent [–] This makes no sense. reply codetrotter parent [–] Ok reply",

Supabase keeps on delivering things that I need.I am regularly surprised how bad the tooling is for SQL&#x2F;databases. Especially that there is no decent formatter that supports plpgsql, and doesn&#x27;t absolutely mangle your queries (sometimes actually breaking your queries..).Best options atm are imo TablePlus and DataGrip, I have tried a bunch of options in vscode and although there are useful tools, it&#x27;s all not really there.(Also excited to see what else they will release this launch week!) reply pjmlp 43 Tooling is quite good on comercial space, now on free beer side, it is another matter. reply bob1029 1> I am regularly surprised how bad the tooling is for SQL&#x2F;databasesAgreed. Even when using something open like SQLite, you will find a lot of difficulty in answering simple (to me) questions like \"how do I parse this command text into an AST\". reply cpursley Agree, would love to see this built into TablePlus.What I really want is a state-based way to define my database. EdgeDB & Prism have made some progress here but they really only handle table changes. Really wish this were built into Postgres somehow (or any solid migration story).I want to be able to define my tables, views, functions and everything and the engine behind it automatically figures out all the necessary changes. For example, change a table (add a column or something) and it is smart enough to update any dependent views and functions. Including handling of data migrations. reply kiwicopple 1fwiw, I personally am interested in this approach too[0]. I keep running into roadblocks around the ordering of events and some of the hairy issues around \"destructive\" actions (eg: renaming columns). i think we can get there, especially once we make progress with this LSP.There are other notable mentions in this space:Reshape: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fabianlindfors.se&#x2F;blog&#x2F;schema-migrations-in-postgres...Atlas: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlasgo.io&#x2F;A \"custom\" example on GitLab: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;delibrium&#x2F;delibrium-postgrest&#x2F;-&#x2F;tree&#x2F;mast...[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kiwicopple&#x2F;declarative-schemas reply rotemtam 1Thanks for the mention of AtlasI am regularly surprised how bad the tooling is for SQL&#x2F;databases.This.

Psql is great, but lacks autocompletion in several places.That said, a big shoutout to pspg (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;okbob&#x2F;pspg) - an excellent pager for psql (also for general csvs). reply epgui It has tons of annoying quirks, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine running a DBT project without it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sqlfluff&#x2F;sqlfluff reply kshahkshah Check out Beekeeper Studio reply codeptualize 1Will try!It looks quite similar to table plus, any killer features I’m overlooking? reply rapind 1A monthly fee? No thanks. reply kshahkshah 1Sheesh.

I&#x27;m the bootstrapped, non VC backed creator of Beekeeper Studio. My open source version is good, probably too good, lol.Thanks for the mention! reply spiderice > probably too good, lolLol, this is too true. I use Beekeeper Studio every day. Every once in a while I think to myself, \"I should see if the full version is worth paying for yet\". Then I check out the features and, while they look great, the free version has absolutely everything I need.Thanks for such a great product. I&#x27;ll stop freeloading eventually! reply mkl 1Please make your screenshot carousel stop automatically rotating after it is interacted with; it&#x27;s really hard to take in the details of the screenshots. reply rathboma Good idea, I&#x27;ll do that, thanks! reply gabereiser 1Sadly, this is why this space has laggard for so long. Devs don’t want to pay for tooling but expect others to pay for their product. reply Xymist 1There is an important differentiator, though. I&#x27;m happy to pay _once_ for tooling as a product, and potentially for subsequent major versions. I am not, however, willing to be a source of MRR. reply gabereiser I generally agree with this. There’s only one or two tools I’ll begrudgingly subscribe to with this model. I would be way more inclined to use the tools if it were a single purchase and I’ll upgrade when I feel like it. I’m looking at you JetBrains and Adobe… reply rapind 1The pricing looks like SaaS only. I&#x27;m happy to pay a one-time fee for software (even when it doesn&#x27;t include future versions), but not a subscription, unless of course there is a common sense benefit to a subscription (like paying for additional support on top of the fixed price).Anyways, once taking the time to re-read the pricing screen subtleties it is sort of a one-time fee (billed as one year of subscription to gain indefinite use), so kudos to the developer, but I have to say it&#x27;s really non-obvious to me at least.Also the availability of a community edition is great, but again non-obvious. reply fragmede 1The stereotype of software devs being the absolute cheapest bastards, despite being well paid, lives on. These people put time and effort into building a thing, and giving them money for it is reprehensible? reply VincentEvans 1I’m not the people you are responding to, but I’ll share my take as a dev who buys some tools and turns my nose at the others.The difference is - whether it’s a purchase or a subscription.I’ll happily buy a tool, and happily will buy upgrades every so often.I will absolutely resist paying for subscriptions unless you are delivering some sort of continuous service and I won’t be fooled by gimmicky cloud integrations just to make that claim. reply thiht 1Same for me, I avoid subscriptions as much as possible.I’m ok with the model of TablePlus however: pay for a license, it’s valid for a year, and at the end of the year you keep the current version available forever but no more updates. And you get a discount if you decide to renew your license reply VincentEvans Agreed, a subscription model where you end up “owning” a particular version after reaching some milestone is ok with me. Sort of like a payment plan.I’ve been a happy subscriber to Jetbrains Toolbox that has a similar model for many years now, and have interrupted and later resumed my subscription while being able to use the software in between.100% against a subscription where you no longer able to use the software the moment you cancel your subscription after paying for years. Looking at you Adobe. replybbkane 1Love Beekeeper Studio! reply j45 1SequelPro is quite decent for MySql.Tooling for Postgres seems to be more for the technical who prefer command line than not. reply jonquest 1Sequel Ace is the forked and actively developed version of Sequel Pro. I don&#x27;t think the owners of Sequel Pro ever announced it was abandoned, but the GitHub repo&#x27;s lack of what appears to be any real development activity certainly suggests it is. reply j45 1That&#x27;s great to know, thanks, I&#x27;ll try it out.At this point my muscle memory is on the Sequel Pro shortcut keys, except I&#x27;m finding myself around Postgres more and more. reply lfittl 1Excited to see this - and excellent use case for libpg_query (I&#x27;m the original author and still help maintain it together with the rest of the team) and appreciate the shout out to pganalyze!If anyone else has a use case for using the Postgres parser outside the server, we have a healthy ecosystem of libraries that build on the core C library (we maintain bindings for Ruby, Go and Rust ourselves), as well as various projects using it (e.g. sqlc uses it for a type-safe way for using hand-written SQL in Go): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pganalyze&#x2F;libpg_query#resources reply derefr 1With all the various systems making use of Postgres&#x27;s parser, is there a reason that the Postgres team haven&#x27;t \"seen the writing on the wall\" about the demand for their parser, and so extracted their parser into a standalone library?I imagine that Postgres itself would then consume the parser library as a — possibly regularly-snapshot-vendored — static library dependency; while other applications and wrapper libraries would be free to consume it as a dynamic shared library; and it could be freely independently distro-packaged; and so forth. In other words, it would become a de-facto \"libxml for SQL\" — the kind of venerable C lib that you expect everything else to just be a wrapper around.Is it just that doing this would involve making functions with internal linkage into functions with external linkage, and thereby preventing some WPO opportunities when compiling Postgres itself? reply lfittl 1Generally I agree that this would be great to have, and Postgres does have a set of libraries it already maintains as part of the main source tree (i.e. libpq, etc), and there is a shared set of code between the backend and the \"frontend\" (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;postgres&#x2F;postgres&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;common). So theoretically you could imagine the parser moving into that shared code portion, sharing code but not necessarily requiring linking to a library from the backend.However, the challenge from what I&#x27;ve understood from past conversations with some folks working on Postgres core is that the parser is currently heavily tied into the backend - note the parser isn&#x27;t just the scan.l&#x2F;gram.y file, but also the raw parse node structs that it outputs. You can see how many files we pull in from the main tree that are prefixed with \"src_backend\": https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pganalyze&#x2F;libpg_query&#x2F;tree&#x2F;15-latest&#x2F;src&#x2F;...Further, there isn&#x27;t a canonical way to output node trees into a text format today in core, besides the rather hard to work with output of debug_print_parse - there have been discussions on -hackers to potentially utilize JSON here, which may make this a bit easier. Note that in libpg_query we currently use Protobuf (but used to use JSON), which does have the benefit of getting auto-generated structs in the language bindings - but Protobuf is not used in core Postgres at all today.All in all, I think there is some upstream interest, but its not clear that this is a good idea from a maintainability perspective. reply runeks IMHO having an SQL language server they does only parsing, ie. validates only syntax, is a bit like a Java language server that does parsing only — ie. does not check whether e.g. a given variable&#x2F;method actually exists or whether types match.The schema is so integral to SQL — since it defines precisely the valid names and types — that a language server that isn&#x27;t aware of this is of limited use in practice. reply ComputerGuru 1What kind of support do we have editor-side for swapping between \"LSP contexts\" automatically? If I&#x27;m editing a .cs file and my editor is using the C# LSP, then start something that a pluginrecognizes as entering into an SQL mode as I type `foo(\"SELECT ..` can that somehow trigger the pgsql LSP too?(I&#x27;m a vim user but I&#x27;ll accept a VS Code answer since that&#x27;s basically \"state of the art\" when it comes to LSP and where most others get their inspiration from.) reply phil294 To add to the correct IntelliJ answer: VSCode, on the other hand, does not allow for multiple language services or servers to handle the same file at the same time. Instead, any language support (always by means of extension, either built-in or external) has to individually add support for embedded languages, either using language services or request forwarding [1]. For example, the built-in HTML plugin includes JS support insidetags by simply spinning up its own tsserver [2].This seems to have been a design decision from the very start, but I have a hard time understanding why. It seems like a conceptual mistake to me. It also eats up system resources like crazy, but that&#x27;s a lost cause anyway. Instead of harnessing the capabilities of existing implementations, every \"wrapper\" kind of language needs to build its own solution, which leads to these solutions often not being great. For example, said HTML&#x2F;JS solution has issues with external dependencies [3]. Or, I&#x27;ve been trying to enable support for CoffeeScript or Elm inside Vue Single File Component files, but I couldn&#x27;t so far, even though I&#x27;m the author of the CoffeeScript extension. [4][5]Any source file always has exactly one language type assigned to it (possibly auto-detected), so no, dynamically \"switching\" is not possible without manually changing it for the entire file. For things like SQL inside PHP, Jetbrains products really are superior.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;api&#x2F;language-extensions&#x2F;embedd...

This is already done for syntax highlighting, nvim could check the syntax from a string after a specific pattern, like gql`` in Typescript.This should be configured by the user, idk if a default implementation could work correctly in all cases. reply swader999 1Neovim does this. For example, if you have two lsp configured in nvm-lspconfig.lua as follows, it will use a specific lsp tailored to either SQL or ruby:-- Initialization of Neovim&#x27;s LSP client local nvim_lsp = require(&#x27;lspconfig&#x27;)-- Setup for the Ruby LSP nvim_lsp.solargraph.setup {}-- Setup for an SQL LSP (assuming one exists with the name &#x27;sql_lsp&#x27; in this example) nvim_lsp.sql_lsp.setup {} reply NilsIRL 1I think what parent comment is asking for is the ability switch between languages withing a single file. I don&#x27;t think this will work with the setup you described. reply swader999 No, it would not. reply petrzjunior 1JetBrains&#x27;s IntelliJ and friends do that with language plugins. They detect the language according to keywords and patterns and are able to do highlighting and intellisense for multiple languages in a single file. I have not tried this with LSP though, because LSP support landed just in the last version. reply ComputerGuru 1Yeah, (neo)vim can do that for non-lsp with a filetype like html.css or similar whichbloads both syntax rules possibly with customizations to determine when it switches into which of the two modes. But again, I don’t know how that works with lsp. reply isodev 2This is very cool! Does it also support extensions? For example, would it be aware of additional functions and handling of geometries if PostGIS is installed? reply kiwicopple 2that&#x27;s theoretically possible, but beyond the scope of the work we have planned in the near feature.it&#x27;s a great idea though - I will add it to the \"Discussions\" to track for the future. I can personally see the benefit of PostGIS support reply yard2010 1Are you looking for contributions? Can I join the party? reply kiwicopple 1yes, we&#x27;d love more contributors reply ptrwis I also wanted to ask about extensions. How does it work internally? Does it ask the database for parsing or does it have its own syntax analyzer? reply steinroe 1we are using the actual Postgres server source to parse the sql file(s) into both an abstract- and a concrete syntax tree. Its bundled with the language server and therefore works standalone. We will add the option to connect to a database, but only to enable features such as autocompletion and code actions a la „Execute the statement under the cursor“. reply koolba 2Does it connect to your actual database as well to get the list of tables, columns, etc? Or just leverage the same code base to be able to parse the raw text without any data dictionary information into a parse tree? reply kiwicopple 2it leverages your code-base, rather than connecting to your database. it uses to libpg_query (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pganalyze&#x2F;libpg_query) to construct the syntax tree which can then be used to for the LSP features reply continuational 2Ah, does that mean autocompletion for fields is off the table? reply steinroe It will definitely be supported at some point. We will have some features that require a db connection, eg autocompletion or code actions such as „Execute the current statement“. But always as an opt in. reply yrashk 1Great project that helps creating better DX for Postgres!At Omnigres [1] we also use libpg_query for programmatic query manipulations as libpg_query has a deparser and that allows one to manipulate AST and output the text representation back.I&#x27;m trying to find time to contribute Postgres 16 support to it![1] Omnigres: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;omnigres&#x2F;omnigres reply lfittl 1Thanks Yuri - and appreciate your contributions to libpg_query!We at pganalyze have plans to add Postgres 16 support to libpg_query sometime between the RC1 and the final release - mostly to watch out for the rare case where a feature gets reverted during the beta releases.If you&#x27;d like to have a go at it before then definitely welcome (here is some context on the extraction process using libclang: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pganalyze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;pg-query-2-0-postgres-query-parse...), and we&#x27;ll also need people to test the PR once available. reply avg_dev Thanks, looks very interesting.I have a couple of questions:1. Will I be able to use this in my IDE (say JetBrains or VSCode) alongside the programming language’s LSP? So that this project would only be in effect for the Pg SQL bits?2. I am a Rust newbie but I’m an experienced developer. Is there any room for someone like me to contribute to the project? reply cube2222 I think paid jetbrains IDEs already do this on their own, as they embed datagrip, no?It checks the syntax, gives you autocomplete based on the databases you are connected to, it even supports string language injection, so you&#x27;ll get SQL autocomplete and checking for strings containing SQL in your code.I&#x27;d love to understand what the advantages here are, other than the obvious one of being available for many editors as a language server. reply michaelcampbell 1I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m a power user enough to notice a difference but I&#x27;ve had tremendous luck with jetbrains datagrip (standalone and embedded) when dealing with PG syntax. The highlight and formatting work a treat. reply TkTech 1Yes, the jetbrains already have all these features and more (such as reflecting pg functions, tables, columns, schemas, etc).You wouldn&#x27;t really notice a difference using this, except your general autocompletes would get worse, and very complex sql might get more correct (I break datagrip&#x27;s parser occasionally) reply kiwicopple 1. yes this is possible, although it depends on your IDE. Here is a relevant discussion for eclipse (which also links to the VSCode implementation): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eclipse&#x2F;che&#x2F;issues&#x2F;4609. Note: i also didn&#x27;t know how this worked, so I learned something today too.2. Yes, absolutely. Feel free to reach out to me directly, or just start contributing directly if you want reply kyrra 1) looks like intelliJ paid versions support (or will support) LSPs soon. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.jetbrains.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;lsp-for-plugin-d...> Starting with the 2023.2 release cycle, the LSP API is publicly available as part of the IntelliJ Platform in the following IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm Professional, DataSpell, RubyMine, CLion, Aqua, DataGrip, GoLand, Rider reply SpaghettiCthulu > 1. Will I be able to use this in my IDE (say JetBrains or VSCode) alongside the programming language’s LSP? So that this project would only be in effect for the Pg SQL bits?I think that would depend on IDE support. For example, JetBrains IDEs have a feature for this. reply michaelcampbell 1> Not SQL with flavors, just Postgres.I like the focus on this. reply lovasoa 1I am very curious to see how it develops. I&#x27;m currently working on multiple SQLPage [1] websites, and getting a better IDE experience would be awesome. Writing only SQL is refreshing compared to all the boilerplate required in traditional web dev, but the developer experience is not yet as polished as in, let&#x27;s say, typescript.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sql.ophir.dev reply steinroe 1this is exactly the reason why I started this project. every singe line of code is business logic if you write parts of your backend directly within the database. plus zero latency and no extra servers. I want to make this approach more accessible with this project. reply JohnBooty next [–]every singe line of code is business logic if you write parts of your backend directly within the database. plus zero latency and no extra servers. I want to make this approach more accessible with this project.thank you thank you thank you.I feel that this approach, while unfashionable, is actually pretty excellent most of the time. reply radicalriddler Nice. I&#x27;ve been thinking about writing a more \"general\" sql lsp using rust so I might have a read of how they&#x27;re doing this. reply radicalriddler It looks very barebones at the moment. Looks like they&#x27;ve just pulled down a tower-lsp boilerplate, the parser crate has a little bit more in it. reply peter_l_downs 1Out of curiosity, how has it been working with the pganalyze team? It seems like Supabase has been able to collaborate really effectively with other teams in the Postgres space (including pgAdmin and pgmigra, for the `diff` migrations tooling), and it&#x27;s wonderful to see! reply peferron 1> It seems like Supabase has been able to collaborate really effectively with other teams in the Postgres space (including pgAdmin and pgmigra, for the `diff` migrations tooling)I&#x27;m thankful to Supabase for their efforts, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pick pgAdmin and migra as examples of \"really effective\" collaboration with other teams: as far as I know, pgAdmin&#x27;s CLI feature wasn&#x27;t merged upstream and sits in an outdated Supabase fork of pgAdmin which doesn&#x27;t fully support Postgres 15, and migra (which has been abandoned for a while) was just used as-is. reply kiwicopple 1fwiw, pgadmin was not for a lack of trying: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redmine.postgresql.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;6304. I won&#x27;t have many details about migra form the CLI team until they come online, but no doubt we&#x27;ll pick up the migra support if it has been abandoned.(but I agree with the sentiment: we can always find ways to be more collaborative) reply peferron Thank you for sharing that! It&#x27;s unfortunate that the pgAdmin devs weren&#x27;t interested, although I understand them wanting to keep it focused on being a GUI. reply kiwicopple I agree. We&#x27;ve been on the other side of pull requests like this and I know how hard it can be to say \"no, we need to stay focused\". I appreciate their clear comms reply kiwicopple 1actually I forgot to mention this one to Lukas in all the chaos leading up to our Launch Week. I will do it nowwe talked in the past about using their library to extend some of Dan Lynch&#x27;s work (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pyramation&#x2F;postgres-ast-deparser) to create a sort of \"postgres package registry\" with dynamic DDL introspection. No progress on that one yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful that we&#x27;ll find the bandwidth for it one day. reply iddan 2This is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using DataGrip for working with Postgres in the past year and a half but I would much instead use VSCode for complex queries. I love how DB languages become more and more first-class citizens in the editor and LSP worlds instead of a special type of language with specialised tooling. reply nonethewiser The vscode-postgres extension is pretty good for crafting queries.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Borvik&#x2F;vscode-postgres reply steinroe agreed! especially for smaller teams and startups it can make a lot of sense to push more logic in the database, and I hope to make this a bit more approachable with this project. reply srivmutk 1Always wondered why something like this wasn&#x27;t made earlier. Either way I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s being made now, writing SQL in an IDE like this should be easier reply Exuma Can you try to get it added to Mason so people don&#x27;t have to try and do a custom install?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mason-org&#x2F;mason-registry&#x2F; reply steinroe 1I will add it to mason once it’s in an usable state. Feel free to open a discussion or issue to keep track of the lsp registries. reply psibi This looks nice!As someone interested in developing a client for it, I&#x27;m interested in couple of things: what are the features supported by it currently, the tweak-able configuration that can be passed to it and the various code action available. I like the way nil language server has documented it (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oxalica&#x2F;nil&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs). Is there something equivalent available for this ? reply kiwicopple it&#x27;s very much still a \"POC\" to verify that the libpg_query approach works - perhaps I should have made that more clear from the description. We have a PR open which adds source code generation to the Rust crate which is close to merging.your comment is useful and why we submitted this to ShowHN - it&#x27;s easier to get these sort of early feature requests than in 3 months once we&#x27;ve implemented more functionality. I&#x27;ll drop a note in GitHub Discussions to investigate the Nil approach. reply timcobb 1> A Language Server for Postgres. Not SQL with flavors, just Postgres.My heroes, thank you for working on this. reply Exuma Man I was just looking for this forever, you rock. reply tacone 1Very nice. Hope to see something along the lines of Prettier for SQL, one day. That&#x27;s sorely needed. reply freedomben 1I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this recently, and there are actually quite a few options. Unfortunately, they can only handle files up to a particular size. My use case is to pretty up a huge SQL dump so that I can grab it. Every existing tool tries to read the entire thing into memory, and ends up crashing. reply steinroe 1the language server protocol supports range operations, although I don’t know how many editors enable it. plus it’s arguably harder to implement. I will add benchmarks once the server is ready, and we can see how far we can get from there. thanks for the feedback! reply steinroe 1it’s on the roadmap! once the parser is stable and an advanced and scalable data model is implemented, features like this will hopefully be quite straightforward to implement. reply Sparkyte I will have to test this. reply toasted-subs 1It’s surprising how powerful Postgres is and seeing tools to make it easier seems extremely nice! reply dgdosen 1This should work fine with vim-dadbod and vim-dadbod-ui... Right? reply anotherevan I would love to see Dbeaver integrate this! reply TekMol I am confused what this does.Is it that I type in my IDE \"SEL\" and is suggests \"SELECT\"?In which situation would this be useful? reply kiwicopple it would also be able to suggest columns&#x2F;fields from your database, as well as picking up errors. for example, given this table: create table profiles ( id serial primary key, first_name text, last_name text );and this query: select id, firstname from profiles;it would then help to detect if you had an error in your select query (in this case, \"firstname\" should be \"first_name\"), and your code editor would show a warning, even before you try to run the code inside your database reply lovasoa 1I don&#x27;t think it connects to a database, so it cannot suggest field names yet. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. reply steinroe 1not yet, but we will add this. As of now, the project is just a poc to show that the approach of using libg_query to parse the source works. Most of the work is still ahead. reply Hendrikto Essentially, LSPs are generic implementations of features like autocomplete, expand selection, refactor, etc., with a standardized API.Different editors and IDEs can use the same LSP, without the need to reinvent&#x2F;reimplement the wheel. reply Wonnk13 1would love to take this for a spin in Emacs. I always lsp support for sql was lacking. reply pama 1Looks great. Has anyone tried an integration with Emacs? reply mkl > Optionated Code Formatting\"Optionated\"? Opinionated or optional? Or both? reply kiwicopple sorry, I believe Philipp meant that you can \"configure it\" - similar to Prettier: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prettier.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;en&#x2F;configuration.htmlI&#x27;ve updated the Readme reply gfody 1I liked “optionated” it’s like opinionated but with BYO opinions reply 2[deleted] spapas82 1prev [–] The libpg query library has a very important problem: It does not work on windows https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pganalyze&#x2F;libpg_query&#x2F;issues&#x2F;44I&#x27;d recommend starting with fixing that instead. It would be much more helpful for the community. reply Operyl 1parent [–] Sounds like they’d love your contribution. I hate when people prescribe tasks to others like this. reply kiwicopple 1parent [–] yes, we (and I assume the pganalyze team) would always appreciate contributionsfwiw, we know of this limitation and decided the acceptable workaround for Windows devs is simply to host the language server and they can connect to it via TCP. reply spapas82 1parent [–] Can&#x27;t you just give some love to the issue https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pganalyze&#x2F;libpg_query&#x2F;issues&#x2F;44 instead ? As I said before this would be very helpful for the community because there are a lot of libraries that use libpg_query and cannot be used on windows (f.e see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lelit&#x2F;pglast&#x2F;issues&#x2F;7).It seems that the only problem for fixing the problem is:> Thanks for the offer, but the problem is our team being time limited &#x2F; having an engineer with a Windows machine ready to take this on, not that we wouldn&#x27;t want to pay someone to work on it :)(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pganalyze&#x2F;libpg_query&#x2F;issues&#x2F;44#issuecomm...)Hosting the LSP elsewhere is not really needed since if people wanted to go that way they could use Remote ssh (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;remote&#x2F;ssh) to host the whole dev environment on linux and connect to it.Thank you reply lfittl 1We at pganalyze would definitely welcome help here - and if anyone would like to give this a try - feel free to email me, happy to talk this through, email is in my profile.Postgres itself supports Windows, the main challenge is identifying the relevant files to pull in (since we use a subset of the full source code), and testing the changes. It should be fairly quick for someone who has C development experience on Windows, with a working development environment. reply kiwicopple 1cool, we’ll look into helping at an appropriate time. Since we are still developing the LSP, this issue isn’t affecting anyone> the only problem for fixing the problem isHopefully it’s as easy as you make it sound! reply macintux 1After 5 years of spinning wheels, maybe it’s time to accept that Windows is a second-class citizen. That’s why WSL exists, after all.(Speaking as someone who dreaded the “inevitable” victory of Windows on the desktop in the 90s I might be a little biased&#x2F;overjoyed.) reply bavell 1prev [–] Just use a serious development OS instead;) reply",

Went to our local dentist who mostly had a wait and see opinion. But then calls a day later and says they’ve decided they should just come out. Two top front teeth. Would have no top front teeth for years.I went into engineer mode and while I acknowledged I didn’t have domain expertise, I asked questions and probed the whole situation. Very unsatisfactory, meandering answers.This was a deeply distressing experience. For the first time ever I did the “call in a personal favour” thing and asked my dad to reach out a family friend, a former cosmetic dentist and former head of the province’s dental association for a second opinion.He saw my son a few hours later and he was just livid about the diagnosis. That it was possible they’d have to come out but it’s impossible to know this for at least a few more weeks or more.In a few months the teeth returned 100% to normal and firmed right up as the ligaments healed.I’m not a conspiracy nut. I believe in listening to experts (but ultimately making an informed decision). I believe in modern medicine. But that experience shook me and forever changed my trust in the dental industry.My feeling is that the nature of dentistry leaves a lot of room for subjectivity and COVID left a lot of dental chairs empty. reply basisword 1>> I’m not a conspiracy nut. I believe in listening to experts (but ultimately making an informed decision). I believe in modern medicine. But that experience shook me and forever changed my trust in the dental industry.Ask anybody who’s experienced a “chronic” illness about the “experts” and they’ll tell you a tale or two. The experts are great until they have a case that is unusual. The don’t have the time or knowledge to treat you properly. You get passed from “expert” to “expert” each time having your hopes dashed. You start feeling like a conspiracy nut chatting with other patients online sharing what’s anecdotally helped. After running into this issue more than once I’ve lost all blind trust in medical experts. I’ll verify what they tell me as best I can and get second opinions if necessary. In one case I was passed up the chain of experts until I finally found the right one myself after a year, and it still blows my mind that this wasn’t the first referral. The system is at the same time incredible and awful. reply pfisherman One thing that I think people need to understand is the distinction between science and the practice of medicine.The practice of medicine is not science. The practice of medicine can be informed by science - to a degree that is almost entirely up to the practitioner. ; but it remains more art than science. The distinction is similar to that between an aviation maintenance and aerospace engineering.Sometimes doctors are just out of their depth. reply mpsprd Doctors are technicians. Technicians with a large toolkit, but technicians nonetheless.When you compare their behaviors to IT it all starts making sense. reply matheusmoreira Being a doctor is like debugging a unique humongous software application with thousands of years of organic patchwork added by a godlike AI which just generates random code and watches the failed experiments die, no source code to any of it just the final binary, no debugger that lets you kill the process and dump its memory or trace its execution, just a bunch of test cases that cost lots of money to run and may yield false positives and false negatives making every bug some sort of heisenbug which may or may not show up when you try to reproduce it and reduces you to guessing with some percentage of certainty fuzzy logic, and even if you do manage to figure anything out in your desperate attempt to fix it you&#x27;re reduced to essentially inserting event objects into the software&#x27;s internal event system and hoping it produces the desired effects as it circulates throughout the entire system while hoping it won&#x27;t adversely affect anything else and it&#x27;s not even guaranteed to make anything better, or alternatively you pry the program open very carefully while it&#x27;s running and cut code sections which grew tumorous or stitch together other sections which are leaking precious data or remodel the pipes so the data flows more efficiently, all to hopefully fix the problem while praying to god your attempt to fix it didn&#x27;t actually make it worse because some malware randomly made it into the program while you worked on it. reply quickthrower2 Not only that but you need to provide expertise more on the timelines of a customer support agent rather than a software developer or researcher. reply matheusmoreira Yeah. It&#x27;s like a never ending stream of bug reports coming in constantly and you have like ten minutes to make sense of each and every one amidst that chaos and do something about all of it because if you don&#x27;t there isn&#x27;t gonna be enough time to see them all and the godlike AI&#x27;s operating system is gonna start killing the buggiest of the processes assigned to you before you&#x27;ve even figured out what&#x27;s wrong and when that happens the report is closed forever and there&#x27;s nothing you can do anymore. The same bugs show up in the programs over and over again every single day and there&#x27;s no permanent solution, no permanent fix at the source code level that would end the suffering of all of those programs. Just constant swimming against the current. You don&#x27;t even fully understand the system you&#x27;re trying to fix, it&#x27;s like ancient technology left to you by a long gone alien civilization and the best you can do is reverse engineer bits and pieces of it from the outside in and top down so you can do some very educated guesswork based on research that&#x27;s way too expensive to be reproduced or replicated in any way, research that doesn&#x27;t produce exact predictions like physics but rather purely statistical statements like \"in case of A associated with conditions B if you do C you&#x27;ll fix D% of the programs\". Everything is framed like this, everything, you&#x27;re never fully certain, everything has risk, there&#x27;s even a chance the research you&#x27;re basing all of this on is just completely made up or tainted by conflicts of interest or something equally stupid. reply Lutger 53 And if you make a mistake that other people feel you really shouldn&#x27;t have and it damages the thing, you get sued into oblivion. reply taberiand And much like software development, it will all soon be done by ChatGPT. reply sethammons 43 ChatGPT correctly identified my wife&#x27;s condition in a couple seconds when a dozen doctors failed to for over a decade. Less than half a percent of people suffer from this condition, but enough do that doctors should have thought about it. All I did was write down the symptoms and poof. It was actually really frustrating that doctors were mystified but this tech gave us a new (and ultimately correct) path of inquiry. I felt robbed of all that time. My trust in doctors is at an all-time low, but her medication is effective, so something in the system works. reply matheusmoreira Local models integrated into EMR systems could be a great tool for doctors but not ChatGPT. I really don&#x27;t recommend feeding confidential medical information into a corporation&#x27;s computer. At least doctors are ethically obligated to maintain confidentiality. reply talonx Add to that the fact that experience matters a lot too. The more variety of cases a doctor sees, the more the chances are that their diagnosis is going to be useful. reply Turskarama Yes and no, the more a doctor sees a particular diagnosis the less likely they are to consider anything else.Honestly of all the professions that could be enhanced by AI, medicine has the most to gain. An AI can remember a much larger data set than any human and look for correlations among many more dimensions. reply xbmcuser Yes that&#x27;s what I think as well. And it&#x27;s sad that medical data being weaponized against you is the thing that takes more sound bytes than how medical data collection can improve diagnosis and healthcare. But with the way medical industry, insurance industry etc are we cant blame people for worrying about data collection specially in a country like the US where you can become destitute without medical insurance reply wpietri For sure. A friend of mine went to med school and chose the general practitioner path. One time I was hanging out at their place, so I leafed through some of the GP journals on the coffee table. It seemed much more akin to car repair than to science. reply Firmwarrior yeah, I was just thinking about this today. Doctors seem less like engineers and more like QA testers or PMs trying to fix bugs since there&#x27;s nobody better suited to the job available.Hopefully medical science will keep advancing rapidly here.. reply josephg I doubt doctors will get better at this in our lifetimes. As we discover ever more about the human body, how are doctors expected to keep up with the research on top of everything else?I’m hoping AI systems can help. A good medical AI should be able to stay abreast of all the research, know your personal medical history and suggest and evaluate any and all medical tests that are needed. Doctors will hate it, but I expect AIs will give much more accurate diagnoses than humans before long. reply com Just some statistics can help. My family doctor has some kind of awful green screen practice software but amazingly it has prognosis statistics for certain lab diagnostic results. Makes for better discussion about treatment plans. reply kzrdude Do doctors know this? We need to tell them they need to practice at the art, to get better at it. reply KRAKRISMOTT They are bound by regulations and liability, your typical GPs and even the specialists can&#x27;t greenlight experiments outside of big research hospitals. Medicine and clinical diagnosis are heavily regulated. That&#x27;s also why you rarely see single author papers in practical clinical medicine. Doctors are busy people, with horrendous work life balance. Most software engineers have it way easier, you get to choose your tools and you get to choose where you want to work. In the business of software engineering, a sufficiently senior engineer can get away with a lot of nonsense without risk of lawsuits. reply Cpoll > aviation maintenance and aerospace engineeringWhich is which though? As I understand it, aviation maintenance is quite rigorous, systematic, and informed by and taking into account every mistake made in the past. reply jasonwatkinspdx 1This is very true. I had a SO with severe chronic gastric pain and they got passed around by doctors for years. One jerk wrote \"drug seeking behavior\" into her file and that made things even worse. Finally someone took her seriously, got imagery done, and discovered surgery was necessary.In US healthcare you have to be your own advocate and be willing to push. The system breaks down if you don&#x27;t have a routine and obvious illness. reply smsm42 1It&#x27;s not specific to the US. It&#x27;s the problem of doctors seeing every particular patient for literally minutes and having zero incentive to dig deeper. 90% of the problems are of the nature that is either covered by standard remedies or will pass by itself with time. If you have one of the 10%, you need to have good luck to encounter an extra-ordinary doctor that would take personal interest in your problem, usually while all incentives point to \"give the standard answer and move on\" behavior. reply TheOtherHobbes 1I once had extended work done at a dentist. It took a few hours, some of which involved sitting around and waiting for things to happen.It gave me a new perspective on that kind of work. From my&#x2F;our point of view, I was the most important person in the room and my problems really really matter.From the doctor or dentists POV, I&#x27;m one a long long list of people they&#x27;re seeing that day. It&#x27;s a health care production line, and even if they have the inclination to be equally caring about everyone - which is a rare quality, because a good medical professionals are only in it for the money - they just don&#x27;t have the time.This is not an excuse unprofessional behaviour. But it made me realise that self-advocacy works because you&#x27;re asking - maybe demanding - more than the production line gives you by default.Also, medicine is incredibly complicated. And the research is often very low quality.And that&#x27;s not taking into account Big Pharma trying to tout its products, whether or not they&#x27;re suitable or effective.The most depressing thing recently has been the professional response to Covid. In the UK countless doctors have aggressively given up masking, even in settings with immunocompromised patients.It&#x27;s really made it obvious that some doctors are just in it for the money, a good few are phoning it in, surprisingly many have quite irrational beliefs, and the caring expert professionals are much rarer than they should be. reply chmod600 While there&#x27;s some truth here, medical diagnosis and treatment can be really hard.People have weird habits, weird diets, are exposed to weird chemicals in small amounts over extended periods of time, etc. There are all kinds of genetic factors where something can be really minor for most people and debilitating for others. There are all kinds or problems or diseases that people can have, and there can be weird combinations that interact or provide an overall confusing array of symptoms. And it&#x27;s all mixed up with the patient&#x27;s brain, which may be exacerbating or compensating in all kinds of ways (psychologically or through behaviors that the patient develops). reply kortilla >extra-ordinaryIt’s just “extraordinary”. reply danielfoster 1How is this problem specific to the US? I live in Germany and hear exactly the same problem of needing to be your own advocate in northern Europe. reply emerongi 1Also in Europe and most doctors just want to get you out of the office. I&#x27;ve met only a few doctors who actually care and will work with you to figure out the issue. The equivalent in software engineering would be waiting for my client to tell me what line to change in what file.To be fair, doctors are usually overworked and on a human level I understand that the system is a bit broken, but it&#x27;s still infuriating when it&#x27;s your health that is suffering. reply KineticLensman I had this when I got shingles on my neck. I hadn’t even got through the door when the doctor had made the diagnosis based on eyeballing my obvious visual symptoms. She was right as it happened but it was my fastest ever doctors visit reply NovaDudely 1The internal term is \"Treat and street\". Get them out on the street as quick as possible . reply jahewson I moved from the U.K. to the US and the situation is even worse in the UK. Unless you’re bleeding or have cancer it’s basically “please go away”. reply spoiler As of recently, doctors refuse to see you in person even when you tell them you&#x27;re chronically having abdominal pains. They&#x27;re doing this telephone medicine now. They kept prescribing PPIs and insisting its indigestion (it wasn&#x27;t).Not sure if this practice is just shit or if all of them are. They then have the audacity to strike too. I&#x27;ve had absolutely zero sympathy for them since the months long ordeal of being in pain and taking pills that made me feel worse rather than better. Fucking disgraceful is what it has become. reply no_butterscotch So much he said she said is the UK better than us with healthcare or not?! reply Turskarama It&#x27;s better in that it&#x27;s free, but it&#x27;s been defunded so much that it&#x27;s beginning to fall apart.Private healthcare is basically broken out the gate, public healthcare can be much better but it still does need to be funded. reply jl6 If it were possible to answer that with a simple yes or a no, it wouldn’t be such a perennial debate.Clearly both systems have benefits and drawbacks. reply webmobdev That sounds very much like someone I know. She had pain in her stomach that doctors in the US just refused to examine in depth. One prescribed her pain-killers and another steroid. She asked more tests but they declined. Her father is a doctor in India and when she finally told him (after a few months of suffering) about her ordeal, he asked her to come immediately to India. After some reluctance, she flew down, and the first thing they did after reviewing her reports was a simple ultrasound. They discovered a tumour in her stomach. Operated and removed it and luckily it was not cancerous. The irony is that when her father asked her to come down to India, she refused initially arguing that the US was at the forefront of medical science in the world. She now understands that doctors matter too. (And unfortunately doctor behaviour in the US is very much influenced by insurance provider policies). reply Sai_ 100%. I’m in India now after years in the US. Indian doctors I’ve interacted with (for my kid) are just better at empathy and analysis.It may be because they see a wider range of illnesses and this empathy&#x2F;awareness might not work well with the patients are of varying ethnicity and race but they’re pretty good if you look past the exterior - shabby offices, gruff manner. reply WWLink That&#x27;s pretty funny because every time I&#x27;ve interacted with a stomach doctor, it pretty much went from introducing themselves to the patient (one time myself) to \"let&#x27;s get you scheduled for an EGD and&#x2F;or a colonoscopy!\"That&#x27;s with 3 different people and a handful of different doctors. They are actually pretty eager to look inside your stomach out here heheh. I&#x27;m really sorry to hear that happened to your friend though! I hope they&#x27;re doing better now! reply formerly_proven 1> In US healthcare you have to be your own advocate and be willing to push. The system breaks down if you don&#x27;t have a routine and obvious illness.100% the same thing on this side of the pond, US healthcare isn’t special here. reply Etrnl_President 1Now imagine doing this on Canadian healthcare, having to wait months or years for each appointment, and nowadays they try to talk you into MAID to save resources… reply UncleMeat I live in the US. I am a software engineer making more than a half a million annually. I have access to tremendous resources and can advocate for myself and my family. I live in a college town because of my wife&#x27;s career. It is not a big city, but is also not rural middle of nowhere.Getting a routine gynecological appointment for my wife any time in the next six months is impossible. I gave up on trying to get an appointment with an allergist for myself, even after getting a referral. What you describe is common in the US too, even for those with means. I cannot imagine what it is like for somebody who doesn&#x27;t have money and insurance. reply nunez Preach.I wanted to get a sleep study done to get to the bottom of my occasional insomnia. My PCP at the time put in the pulmonologist referral (because this hospital network required a referral to get a sleep study done, which is insane in its own right, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there).This was in January. His next available appointment? March! For a friggin sleep study! And I have a HDHP + HSA and was going to pay full boat!(He also prescribed me with an antipsychotic that can double as a sleep aid at low dosages, which I didn&#x27;t take because five minutes of research into it made it obvious that taking that for extended periods of time is bad news bears. I stopped seeing him after that.)(For those looking for answers like I was, I eventually stumbled upon Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, or CBT-I. It&#x27;s essentially a rigid sliding window-style sleep schedule plus challenge therapy to make you rethink how you approach sleep. I&#x27;ve been doing this for six months now and it has been transformational. Best part? No meds!) reply Firmwarrior FYI: I&#x27;m not a doctor and this isn&#x27;t medical advice, but you can buy an APAP machine over the counter with money in your HSA, then hack around in it to figure out if you have sleep apnea and how bad it is if so reply mikeyouse 1I know HN is a privileged place but people should recognize that the “worst case” of Canadian&#x2F;European healthcare wait times is already the reality for many if not most Americans.. You shouldn’t base your understanding of American health care on personal experience if you work for a big company that provides a nice health insurance plan. reply ROTMetro 1I have jank government insurance and this is not true. When I got out of prison and had no insurance I went to the city&#x27;s clinics. Wait times have never been an issue (at most was two weeks for specialist). The doctors in the clinic were also friggin amazing doctors&#x2F;people. I had a ton of shame around getting out of prison, some much shame about needing to get tests ran for HIV&#x2F;Hep from being in prison but they were so good about it all (all came out negative so woohoo).Now dentists...when we had money we went to a family friend. He still totally f&#x27;d us and did unnecessary work. It&#x27;s only now that I have a cash only country dentist that I trust my dentist again. Crazy part is the cash only dentist ends up being cheaper than my previous copay&#x2F;premiums insurance dentists. reply tyg13 1I&#x27;m always surprised when people leave comments like these, based on nothing but N=1 anecdata. You don&#x27;t have any authority to say something like \"this is not true\" with regards to the whole of the American healthcare experience. Compared to my own personal experience, yours was uncommonly-good. Wait times for specialists for my SO&#x27;s heart condition are routinely several months out. reply zdragnar What this demonstrates is that wait times are widely variable by specialty and region. Arguments like \"for most Americans\" are wrong on their face, because most Americans don&#x27;t live in the same area or have the same issues.My wife and I have both had to see various specialists. Some had very long wait times, many didn&#x27;t, and of those that did, we were (fortunately) able to call around to different clinics to find one that wasn&#x27;t too bad. reply giantg2 To be fair, their statement of n=1 is more evidence than the other person posted (comment without any evidence). Although both are weak. reply wredue 1This is not true.I mean, the wait times sometimes are, but they vary by province. More conservative provinces have worse wait times. That is not surprising given that the provincial conservative government are all actively attempting to sabotage public healthcare so we can move to an American style system. A system where we will all pay more, and still see similar wait times anyway.MAID is not actively proposed as a way to save resources. reply bennettnate5 > More conservative provinces have worse wait times.This feels like a pretty glaring generalization. If we look at the actual data, the story becomes a little more nuanced [1]. \"Conservative\" provinces have wait times that are a couple of days to a couple of weeks higher than national average (assuming we call BC, AB, SK and MB \"conservative\" [2]), but then again almost all of the maritimes provinces (which are considered strongly liberal-leaning) have abysmally bad wait times relative to the average (10-20 weeks worse).Overall, the average is ~half a year anyways, which is pretty rough regardless.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fraserinstitute.org&#x2F;file&#x2F;waiting-your-turn-2021-...

For those who had the luck to lose their family doctor (mine through retirement), it is impossible to find one that takes new patients. Many retired during covid, many more only work part time. The Canadian health care is a disaster at this point, and those who have a family doctor have no clue how awful this is. reply smsm42 1In the US it&#x27;s not easy to find a primary care provider also. When we moved couple of years ago and called a local medical center to establish a primary care provider, we were given answers like \"we have the nearest appointments in 6-8 months\". If you have something urgent, there&#x27;s telemedicine line where you can talk to advice nurse or if there&#x27;s something really urgent, get an appointment with an urgent care doctor. But all primary care providers seem to be booked solid for months. And given how many patients they&#x27;d have and how often they see each one, establishing any kind of personal care relationship is out of the question. How personal can it be if you can see you doctor twice a year for 20 minutes? I think the only solution is go get rich enough so you can afford personal concierge doctors or however it is called (no idea since I&#x27;m not rich enough). reply mynameishere 1rich enough so you can afford personal conciergeA few minutes research suggests it&#x27;s not that expensive. (As little as ~2000&#x2F;year). reply smsm42 What I can find around me with a quick look sounds like about ~$400&#x2F;m, or $4800&#x2F;yr - which I could handle if I had to, but it would sting (especially as I still would have to pay my regular health insurance, of course). And there doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that much choice - at least in places where I know to look. reply 20after4 For most people, that&#x27;s expensive. reply mynameishere No, it isn&#x27;t. Most people pay about that much for their cable. For the bottom 20 percent, yes, it is a budget-buster.However, that is beside the point. Believe me, I hate explaining simple, simple things--but the person I was responding to is probably comfortably middle or upper-middle class and could afford a miserable 2000&#x2F;year on a doctor. He doesn&#x27;t have to become \"rich enough\", and almost 100 percent of the people in this thread don&#x27;t have to either. replyjasonwatkinspdx 1Yeah that&#x27;s a hyperbolic exaggeration. reply vkou If you think waiting for months is a Canada-only problem, you clearly haven&#x27;t tried to get a specialist appointment[1] in much of the US. And that&#x27;s with good insurance.[1] Or shit, even a PCP that accepts new patients. reply littlestymaar Favorably comparing the US health system to the Canadian one is an interesting take indeed… reply kbutler I know people in Canada who come to the US for healthcare (better care for specialties, shorter wait times).I&#x27;m not aware of the reverse (admittedly, that would require more than just $$). reply chrismarlow9 1Same experience here. My analysis is it&#x27;s a money milking scheme between groups of doctors. Pass you around so everyone gets a cut and they cross refer people to scratch each other&#x27;s backs. Surgeon refers you to pain management and pain management refers you to surgeon. Add in a physical therapist, testing facility, and chiropractor and you got a pretty lucrative meshnet of referrals going. reply basisword 1Tbf in my case this was NHS so no money to be made by referrals afaik. It mostly seems to be a lack of up-to date knowledge paired with a reluctance to take the initiative and research the latest information for a specific case. As a substitute they refer you up the chain where the same problem also exists. reply wizofaus 1> NHS so no money to be made by referrals afaikI wouldn&#x27;t assume that - just because the money isn&#x27;t coming from your pocket directly, it&#x27;s inevitable there are doctors that milk the system. But you&#x27;d think bureaucrats whose job it is to assess the legitimacy of requests to the NHS (or equivalent institution in your own country) for payment might be harder to swindle than your typical patient. reply selcuka > My analysis is it&#x27;s a money milking scheme between groups of doctors. Pass you around so everyone gets a cut and they cross refer people to scratch each other&#x27;s backs.This is accurate. Years ago I had a kidney stone and the GP asked for an IVU (Intravenous urography) image to make sure about the size. The report prepared by the radiologist had the statement \"operation is required\".When I got back to my GP just laughed sarcastically and told me that it was nothing to be worried of. He also said \"the radiologist just wanted to return the favor, in case the GP wanted to operate\". He was sick of this scheme too, but there was nothing he could do. reply prawn Most of the complaints I read in this conversation have been about people NOT getting referred for scans when they&#x27;ve reported discomfort! reply maeil 1While this might happen, it&#x27;s certainly a tiny minority of cases. In most cases it&#x27;s just too big of an ego to admit that they really don&#x27;t know, and not willing (private practice) or unable to (employed by a big hospital) spend the large amount of time needed to raise the chance of finding the cause from 0% to maybe 2%.Truth is that modern medicine still knows much less than is often assumed, let alone individual doctors. There&#x27;s an absurd amount of potential for LLMs here. reply newaccount74 1I was with you until the last sentence:> There&#x27;s an absurd amount of potential for LLMs here.The problem is not that doctors are stupid, the problem is that a lot of ailments are just not easily diagnosed. Even if the doctor has one (or more) suspicions what the red rash on your skin is, there just aren&#x27;t any tests for many conditions.

It would be too expensive to test you, especially for something that will probably go away on its own. reply prawn If various scans were more readily available, quick and cheap, I wonder how far these guesswork scenarios would be improved?

Glad you’re alive, by the way. reply matheusmoreira Yeah. There&#x27;s a finite amount of resources and a literally never ending avalanche of patients. At some point they&#x27;re going to have to make a cold calculation.I don&#x27;t really know how it works in the US but here in Brazil it&#x27;s actually pretty easy to order laboratory tests and imaging studies. There&#x27;s taxpayer funded public health care but it can&#x27;t handle the demands of the entire population so people would rather pay for the ultrasound or CT scan than wait two years for the government to provide it. An ultrasound costs about $30, an MRI costs about $150 and the price of a CT scan is somewhere between those two. reply hutzlibu \"The experts are great until they have a case that is unusual.\"Also the very standard cases, they can mess up very badly.\"The system is at the same time incredible and awful.\"The science behind the medicine is awesome, but the standard implementation is horrible and not up to at all, where we could be. reply rawbert Yes, wanted to write the same.

If you find one of these, stick to them. reply idopmstuff This is the place where I&#x27;m really hopeful that AI can help people sooner rather than later. A lot of these diagnoses just involve large-scale, complex pattern matching - the problem is that docs don&#x27;t know what pattern to look for because the diagnoses are rare, and they&#x27;re often not asking the right questions for the same reason. I knew someone who had an extremely rare genetic disorder (her family represents about half the people diagnosed) and just by sheer, dumb luck, her doctor happened to know the single doctor at NIH who specialized in it.It&#x27;s a really ideal use case for AI - not only figuring these things out but also doing things like clinical trial and research matching. reply JenrHywy I had a neurologist tell me that the scans he&#x27;d performed proved that there was nothing wrong with my wife, and he didn&#x27;t know why she was choosing to act as though she had a neurological issue.In neurology at least, I think a lot of the problem is that everyone is hyper-specialized. Luckily for us, my wife&#x27;s insurance company convinced a generalist neurologist to come out of retirement and examine her, which put us on the path to effective treatment. But yes, that whole experience completely soured me on blind trust in the medical profession reply yoz It&#x27;s particularly bad when it comes to treating women.Doctors tend to believe that female patients exaggerate pain in comparison to male patients, in accordance with stereotypes that portray men as \"stoic\" and women as \"emotional\". The bias is systemic, with female doctors often assuming the stereotype too[1].You can trace this bias back through medical literature which (often subconsciously) reiterates these stereotypes[2]. It shows up in many statistics, such as the difference in wait times for analgesics: women reporting pain had to wait an average of 30% longer than men.[3]But a key cause of the problem is worse than just assumption of stereotypes: it&#x27;s that modern medicine still knows far more about men than it does women. For centuries, the primary medical research and literature was done by men, about men, for the treatment of men. Most of the clinical trials performed in the 20th century enrolled far fewer women than men, and often _none at all_.[4]Of course, gender is not the only bias that shows up in medicine. Age, race, (dis)ability, body shape, and economic&#x2F;social status are all useful factors to keep in mind when considering why certain people, even entire sectors of society, aren&#x27;t getting the treatment they should.- [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dovepress.com&#x2F;the-roles-of-gender-and-profession... - [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5845507&#x2F; - [3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1553-2712... - [4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;lifeandstyle&#x2F;2019&#x2F;nov&#x2F;13&#x2F;the-fem... reply woliveirajr This.

Calling people conspiracy nuts for looking behind curtains they shouldn&#x27;t was a good tactic by various entities to cover up secrets and misdeeds, but it has spilled over into the non political arena and poisoned everything.Humans don&#x27;t have a full understanding of everything, and in fact it&#x27;s quite the opposite, in that we don&#x27;t understand almost everything. Almost all paths are untrodden. It&#x27;s fine to look where others haven&#x27;t and come up with your own theories and ideas, as long as you retain a healthy skepticism and back things up with data as much as you can.Science and exploration should not use fear of social reprisal as a guide. reply ryandrake 1I’m torn about this now. I used to cautiously support the practice of double checking your doc, but not wholeheartedly because of all the various quacks: essential oil moms, natural&#x2F;spiritual healers, psychics, supplement sellers, crystal therapists, “old school” (pre-COVID) antivaxers and so on, muddying the water.Until COVID came around and unearthed the absolute hoards of dO yOuR oWn ReSeArCh imbeciles. Now the sensible practice of getting a second opinion and exploring other options&#x2F;doctors has been mixed up with the kooks: extreme politics and actual conspiracy theories, to the point where it’s hard to take any of it seriously.When someone now says they don’t trust doctors, you have to dig deeper to understand if it’s someone genuinely seeking out other options, or if it’s one of Those People who’ve gone off the deep end. reply felipeerias 1The pandemic revealed the degree to which any respectable field can harbour extremely dangerous kookery without realising it.For example, Western health authorities used to be absolutely certain that viruses could not be airborne (outside of very specific medical procedures), even though they did not have any good reason or evidence to back that up: it was just an old idea that happened to fit in with their priors, so generations of experts kept parroting it until horror unfolded. reply lowkey I don’t think it is possible to end the derogatory use of the term conspiracy theorist universally, but I do have some hope that we can put a stop to it’s use as an ad hominem here on Hacker News.It is never used in the spirit of promoting insightful discussion.Instead it is used to shut down a line of inquiry in its tracks. It’s like calling someone an anti-semite.It is used as a soft form of censorship, to disqualify the mere idea of engaging in the specifics of an argument.If someone dismisses a comment by implying it is a conspiracy instead of offering a substantive rebuttal of why the comment is mistaken, it reduces the quality of the entire community.I think we can do better, but more people need to call out this bad behavior. reply wredue 1The earth is not 6000 years oldGod didn’t do itGravity is the curvature of spacetimeThings are not attracted to the planet through static electricityCovid is realVaccines workRich mother fuckers do NOT have our best interests at heartIntelligent aliens have not visited earthPeople are called conspiracy nuts for being conspiracy nuts.

Very bad advice is often given.I can&#x27;t really common about the US, but here in the UK the quality of healthcare is shocking bad. Although we may have the opposite problem, where instead of doing unnecessary procedures to increase costs, the NHS generally tries to avoid doing anything unless you&#x27;re dying.I had some pain in my abdomen a few years back and had persistently elevated liver enzymes. My doctor told continuously told me not worry about it and would say the pain was probably because I was sitting funny and other nonsense. In their opinion I was too young to have liver problems so there was no point in doing any further tests.Fed up, I decided to do my own research and pay for my own tests. From this I found out that I have a fairly rare generic condition which makes me highly predisposed to liver disease and NAFLD. Certainly not the end of the world, but it pissed me off a bit because the disease could have progressed had I taken their advice and simply ignored it.Around this time I also had a family friend who was the same age as me. She went to the doctors repeatedly over the course of a year describing several symptoms she was experiencing just to be dismissed. Turns out she actually had cervical cancer, but they never ran any tests and kept telling her it was probably nothing to worry about. By the time she found out she had cancer it was stage four and she died a few weeks later. She was 28 and had two kids.Like you I believe in listening to experts. Most experts know what they&#x27;re talking about and generally give good advice, but it&#x27;s important to keep in mind the conditions experts operate in. Here in the UK the NHS has neither the time or money to give you high quality healthcare. It doesn&#x27;t really matter if you see the best doctor in the world, if they can&#x27;t spent the time and money running the tests you need you&#x27;re not going to get a good diagnosis. reply iancmceachern 1>The same is true for healthcare generally in my experience.

You need to be confident in this knowledge enough to challenge them and walk out to receive better care at any moment. This is why people say that healthcare us such a trap in the US particularly. If you are injured and incapacitated you can&#x27;t advocate for yourself, and if you don&#x27;t have the support infrastructure in place in your personal life we are just one medical event away from financial and physical ruin. reply tonyarkles 1[Canadian here, for context]> The only way though the mine field is to take personal ownership over your HealthcareShortly after graduating from university, when I no longer had access to student health, I started hunting for a regular family physician.

My staff here is great, but things happen. Maybe they call you with test results and you miss the voicemail. Maybe the lab forgets to send the results.

There are plenty of problems with their public healthcare system that pretty much mirror any country with a troubled economy, but one day a work colleague recommended I visit the Favoloro Institute. I’ve never seen such an impressive healthcare organization in my life.They time their appointments ever 2 minutes so you’re expected to arrive early. Once you start, they wiz you around to about a dozen tests including getting hooked up to electrodes while running on a treadmill. After less than an hour you see a doctor who goes through everything for about 15 very detailed and thoughtful minutes.The entire thing is FREE! Completely publicly funded.I don’t know much about healthcare but this type of thing always struck me as a missing apparatus of healthcare in the US. Although apparently Favoloro (who invented some kind of bypass surgery) founded the Institute after being inspired by the Cleveland Clinic.Would love to hear other people’s thoughts on this because I tell that story all the time! reply culiao 1Interesting. I too lived abroad in argentina for a few years... the healthcare there is actually pretty impressive.

We often don&#x27;t know. reply midoridensha This sounds much like the annual health check-ups that are done here in Japan.

The difference between the rushed 10mins you get with the NHS and the considered 30mins you get private is amazing. You leave feeling like you’ve been taken care of and all your questions have been answered. It’s only when you see this you can see just how bad the quality of care in the NHS is at the moment. We need to stop equating the NHS with the people that work for it and start calling it out for how god awful it is. We’ve made it a dirty that can’t be criticised properly when it sorely needs to be. reply noelwelsh 1I believe the NHS is seriously under-funded, the Tory government is responsible, and healthcare is suffering as a result.However, I do want to provide an anecdote to illustrate that private healthcare is not perfect. I had some persistent pain in my foot. Realized I wouldn&#x27;t get anywhere with the NHS so I went private. The person I saw had an excellent manner. They suggested some fairly gnarly surgery. Said I should think about it and in the meantime they gave me an anti-inflammatory injection. My problem cleared up in about two weeks. What was wrong: I have really really wide feet (seriously; they are wider than the widest setting on the foot measuring device they use at shoe shops.) I didn&#x27;t know this. I was wearing Chuck Taylors, which are very narrow, and they were pinching my feet. I didn&#x27;t wear my Chucks over the two weeks and I figured out what was wrong in that time. What I learned: everyone has a toolbox they want to reach into. In this case I was seen by a surgeon so they of course turned to surgery as solution. Always be your own advocate, to the best of your ability, in healthcare. (I thought the surgeon might have said something about the width of my feet given they spent so much time looking at feet.) reply thefaux Long ago I broke my collarbone in a bicycle race. It&#x27;s a common injury in the sport so I got a referral to a surgeon from another racer who&#x27;d had a fracture of his own surgically repaired. To my surprise, she took a very conservative course of action. The clavicle had broken pretty cleanly in half and the outer half had settled in about an inch inward underneath the inner half. You might think that would be a good candidate for surgery so the bone could have been moved back into the old position with the help of a plate. But she thought it would be best if I came back in a few weeks and see if it had healed on its own. To my amazement, it did heal so that now I have a weird knob in my clavicle but the bone feels as strong as the never broken side. The recovery was tough though and took years. At times I wished I&#x27;d had it surgically repaired but now I admire my surgeon&#x27;s restraint. She correctly diagnosed that I didn&#x27;t need surgery to recover even though she had no personal relationship to me and a financial incentive to operate. But I also saw that since she operated on my friend that she would operate if she deemed it necessary. Thus I believe that she actually evaluated each case carefully on its own. Unfortunately, the tendency towards pushing patients into lucrative active interventions (like surgeries) does seem common even if it isn&#x27;t the rule. reply Scoundreller My Canadian experience with that injury was basically the surgeon would operate on me if I wanted, and that would get me back to 100% faster, but it&#x27;s more invasive and largely unnecessary unless your everyday life required faster healing (e.g. you job depends on it). Which it didn&#x27;t because I had a desk job.There might be an age component to it: the risk of it not healing correctly increases with age. reply segh As a percentage of GDP, the UK has the 6th highest healthcare spending of OECD countries, on par with Switzerland.

No different than if you ask a software developer if you should hire them to automate some process. A true pro may say \"nah it&#x27;s not worth it for you\" but that&#x27;s rare...It&#x27;s fashionable to dunk on folks who \"do their own research\" but I admire that more than those who are proud of unquestionably taking direction from vested parties. reply Waterluvian 1I think the “do your own research” label conflates two categories: people who are shopping for a comforting answer, and people who want to be informed and make conscious decisions. I don’t have to be a dental expert to know that something isn’t adding up and to seek a second opinion. reply steveBK123 1It strikes me as unfortunate that for a lot of things like home repairs&#x2F;renovations its pretty normal to get 3+ different opinions&#x2F;bids.. but for our health its usually your regular doctor, and at most a 2nd opinion in some cases.We&#x27;ll make life changing decisions based on the opinion&#x2F;advice of 1 individual, while shopping around on a home project or car repair that&#x27;s +&#x2F;- $5k.It seems again like a combination of shortage of medical workers and the indirect nature of medical payment. If I knew up front that walking in and getting 3 medical opinions would cost me X, and I didn&#x27;t need any pre-approval from insurance, or risk denials.. I&#x27;d just go do it more. But the system is so opaque that I don&#x27;t know I can get those answers readily, or believe the numbers are real and won&#x27;t result in random bills later.Further, the next step after figuring out the cost of getting options would then e getting a quote for the actual resulting medical care recommends is opaque due to differing payment %s & co-pays by procedure, etc. reply ryandrake 1> Further, the next step after figuring out the cost of getting options would then e getting a quote for the actual resulting medical care recommends is opaque due to differing payment %s & co-pays by procedure, etc.There’s nothing more quintessentially American than “not knowing how much you are going to pay for something until you owe it.” You go for a hospital visit and nobody has even a remote, order-of-magnitude idea of what you are going to pay. But you have to sign a doc right away that says “you agree to pay whatever number we eventually come up with!” And then you slowly get dozens of bills from individual doctors and hospital workers over the next 4 months. It’s absurd. reply pathartl 1Something your comment overlooked is the overall availability and the required timeline for something health related is usually quite different than home maintenance or car troubles.I had a really bad sprain about two years ago to the point where my partner had to help me on and off the toilet. Eventually I took off work, went to urgent care, and paid $200 for them to basically say \"well it&#x27;s not broken, we could do an MRI otherwise we don&#x27;t know what you want us to do\". Booking an appointment with a GP would have taken around a month. They won&#x27;t be able to do anything long term but will recommend a physical therapist. All said and done it&#x27;s probably a $5-10k ordeal and weeks until I could actually see any progress, plus work time missed. Big surprise, I didn&#x27;t actually end up going to see a doctor. Recovery sucked and some movements still aren&#x27;t quite right. reply tyrfing 1In an ideal world, what would you say should have happened? reply bombcar 1My go-to question isn’t “should I do X” but more like “would you do X if this was you” - with good providers it gets closer to the heart of the matter. reply hunson_abadeer 1I think it&#x27;s easy to come up with such delineation after the fact, but OP was looking for a more comforting answer. By the sound of it, they just didn&#x27;t like the implications of the initial diagnosis. It wasn&#x27;t about facts not adding up.The reality is that modern medicine is absolutely amazing, but there are also many interventions backed by shoddy science or no science at all. Sometimes, \"doing your own research\" exposes such lapses. Sometimes, it sends you off the deep end and you end up chasing ghosts. To allow the former, you need to tolerate some of the latter.And yeah, sometimes the shoddy science involves interventions so basic and so common that you&#x27;d think they&#x27;re sorted out. Consider that Europe and the US take wildly divergent views on topics such as wisdom teeth, colonoscopies, or the value of flu vaccines.\"Science literacy\" doesn&#x27;t shield you from being wrong. Maybe it helps, but there&#x27;s no shortage of Nobel laureates who believe in conspiracy theories or promote dubious medical treatments. Talking about \"science literacy\" is usually just how geeks convince themselves that their beliefs can&#x27;t be wrong. reply Waterluvian 1It’s funny how every generation of modern medicine acts like this time they know 100% what the correct answers are while we all scoff at how wrong they got it just a few decades ago.Every generation the advice on which way to put your kid to sleep flip flops.It would be shamefully foolish to disregard all the incredible advances and technologies that modern medicine offers. It would be equally shamefully foolish to think it’s not still deeply flawed. reply bombcar 1This is true across more domains than medicine - especially in IT, the absolute assurance that those idiots 5 years ago were brain dead but now we’ve solved all the things. reply Al-Khwarizmi 1> I always point out to my wife that an expert with a financial benefit in the advice they are giving you is potentially more dangerous than an amateur.Indeed. In my country we have a public healthcare system. I also have private insurance, which I use sometimes because you can get consultations and tests much faster; but I wouldn&#x27;t do anything invasive with the private insurance before getting an opinion from a public doctor first. The incentives aren&#x27;t well aligned in private healthcare. For me, the combo (trust diganoses from the public system more, but use private when convenient) seems to work well.Public healthcare doesn&#x27;t cover dentists, though, and to be honest, from other people&#x27;s experience, I don&#x27;t trust them much. I haven&#x27;t visited one in over 20 years, and so far I haven&#x27;t experienced pain or any other annoying symptoms other than some slight gum bleeding once per year or so which seems to resolve by itself by brushing and flossing more thoroughly than normal for a few days. I know it&#x27;s risky and this may come to bite me later. Fingers crossed. reply phpisthebest 1>>I believe in listening to experts (but ultimately making an informed decision).The problem for the most part in all industries is we have moved from a system of experts to a system of credentials. Now one would say that in order to get a credential in something one must be an \"expert\" but this is far far from the truth, there are all kinds of competing incentives to ensure an ever increasing supply of \"credentialed\" professionals that have nothing to do with validation of their expertise in a given field or subject.It does not matter if it something like an electrician, or brain surgeon, from teaching, to physics, and everything in between including medicine, we favor credentials now not expertiseLargely the consumer public simply looks to see if this person as the correct credential. license, etc for the given job...

I have no clue how to check the expertise of my dentist, apart from using my own mental bullshit detector (of limited use here) and reading reviews by others (also of questionable use, because who reviews their dentist? And where?).The analogous problem exists for certain kinds of expensive products with the property that they usually work well, but sometimes become flaky. Think a washing machine. Who posts a review about their washing machine four years post-date that it&#x27;s still going strong? And absence of base rate information makes absolute numbers of bad reviews mostly meaningless. reply phpisthebest 1>>expensive products with the property that they usually work well, but sometimes become flaky.

There used to be several media companies that focused on long term durability of \"durable goods\" like washing machines and suchBut today most people buy new appliances not when they fail but when they need to upgrade to the latest technology, or because new government regulations makes them unfeasible to use &#x2F; service, or because the Calendar function on their smart fridge does not work with google cloud anymore (true story), etc... reply gorbachev 1That may be true for a lot of folks, but that&#x27;s not the only issue.From my experience, the biggest issue is that a lot of the appliances and other gadgets we have these days are very complex. You have to be an electrical engineers, software engineer and a mechanical engineer, or a big service company that employs all three, to be able to fix anything.Additionally it&#x27;s sometimes really difficult to find service manuals for a lot of these things. If your doodat is flashing error code E-71-X1-C and the user manual you have just says \"call for service\", what are you going to do about it? You typically need pretty serious google-fu magic to find enough information to start figuring out what&#x27;s wrong.When my dryer broke several years ago I think I found the proper service manual for it on a site that looked exactly like a SEO spam site and seriously sketchy.

Not that MDs are immune to the above but it feels to me like it’s not as bad as in dentistry. reply gochi 1I don&#x27;t feel the same, a lot of other medical professions are very similar to dentistry. Deal with a chronic plantar fasciitis and you&#x27;ll see exactly what I mean, clueless experts everywhere with nowhere near the amount of rigor you would expect.Anyways beyond that, dentistry sits in a very interesting position where there isn&#x27;t a whole lot that can be done (without major breakthrough). It&#x27;s why so much is based on preventative measure. It&#x27;s also why the field feels \"antiquated\" in a way, we&#x27;re still using simple instruments to scrape the teeth (or inside the tooth when it comes to root canals), or yanking the entire tooth out. We haven&#x27;t got much farther than cavemen using stones to clean plaque in that way, besides the pain mitigation.It&#x27;s the one field that is ripe for revolutionary improvements if it weren&#x27;t for corporations constantly pushing their garbage studies. reply goostavos Invisalign works pretty well, though.

I had some messed up teeth. 12 months of trays later and I my teeth are more or less in the right place now. reply ornornor What bothers me is that it’s a commercial product that is pushed very hard and where dentists have a financial incentive in you getting the treatment they’re recommending.It might work, but the conflict of interest is there and you’ll never know if there wasn’t a superior&#x2F;cheaper&#x2F;more suitable alternative.Ditto Oral B toothbrushes. Or Pedigree Pal at vets. reply AQuantized 1I saw a private dentist for the first time roughly a year ago. I was under the impression that I had 10+ fillings, and prior to lockdowns a dentist had told me I needed at least 2 more, which I assumed would still be the case.He said he could see no indication of decay that would need treatment, and all the &#x27;fillings&#x27; I had were more like sealants in the enamel, none of which reached the dentin, and any of them could have been avoided by a more wait and see approach.I saw 5+ dentists on the public health system that all had the same cavalier approach, and it&#x27;s hard to assume it wasn&#x27;t to line their own pockets. reply dublo7 1My kids had insurance through their mom, because she made shitty pay, but good benefits. She lost her job and put them on state medicaid plan. Suddenly my son who has never had a cavity in his life needed 6 fillings.I took him to my dentist who found a single tooth that may have a cavity but it&#x27;s too early to be sure. A year later he&#x27;s had one filling. And that one was not any of the teeth the other dentist wanted to drill. He flosses in public bathrooms.They obviously was a cash grab and were going to just drill the fuck out of his mouth to maximize medicaid payments. reply whynotminot Was military in the past, so on tricare. Base dentist was busy so they referred me off base to a local dental clinic for my regular cleaning.That local dentist I guess saw a blank check when I walked in the door and tried to convince me I had 5 cavities that needed filling. I told him to finish just the cleaning and I’d check back in with my military dentist.Military dentist later looked me over again and said I had one slowly developing potential cavity to keep an eye on. That’s it.A lot of dentists are apparently unethical hack shops. reply wouldbecouldbe 1I have learned from personal experience to never take healthcare medicals for their words.Always do your own research. Ask them consequences and how sure they are.And take into consideration the impact of treatments and diagnosis to the life quality of yourself or loved ones. At times can be hard for doctors and others to look beyond their own worldview.Personally I’ve had this eczema where I found the correct cream by reading the research on it, and later found out this is also the official advice. Most doctors here just prescribe an old cream out of habit, that contains hormones and often creates worse side effects.But a bigger diagnosis mistake was a close family member diagnosed with a very bad gen defect that would cause liver failure within a few years. He wanted the kid to start taking unpleasant medicines to be sure. He told us to get bloodwork done (without mentioning the costs) but in the end couldn’t find enough genes that had the mistakes. He wanted to do even more bloodwork being convinced there needed to be 2 genes with the defect, but I clearly told him he was going in uncharted territory, after doing the extra bloodwork he had to come back and agree he was wrong.One defect gene was found and in extreme health circumstances liver values were found that matched the pattern of a certain disease. Which is why he was convinced it was wrong.He was a well intentioned doctor, but these academics doctors get obsessed with analysing and diagnosis without always understanding the costs for the patients. Although they try to. In the meantime our family thought the kid was going to die for months and made significant unnecessary costs. reply NovaDudely 1Oh yeah I had really bad skin flaking, they would orescibe all kinds of hormone or steroid based creams that would next to nothing.One search on Reddit and many people just said to use petrolium gel. Bam fixed it up in two days! Costs me about $3 a year to control this now. reply Scoundreller petrolatum is underappreciated as a moisturizer imo. Too cheap for a good marketing budget.Most of the expensive moisturizers is going to be 80-90% petrolatum and a bunch of crap that&#x27;s more likely to irritate than help (but smells nice!).Don&#x27;t get me started on \"non-greasy\" formulations... it&#x27;s the greasiness that makes it work!Pro-tip: put your moisturizer on just after washing. You want to trap in all that water! reply kelnos > I believe in modern medicine.It&#x27;s completely reasonable to believe in modern medicine, but also to remember that humans are imperfect and have all sorts of biases and limitations when practicing modern medicine. Add on top of that how most health care systems make things much more difficult than they need to be, for both the doctor and the patient. reply gcanyon I was probably four when I fell against the sandbox in the playground and knocked one of my top front teeth right out. I carried it inside to the teacher, who had me bite on a paper towel to stop the bleeding and sent me home with the tooth wrapped in another paper towel in my pocket.About a week later I fell against a large wooden block in the classroom and knocked the other top front tooth clean out.I went for something over a year without top front teeth, but my adult teeth came in early, so it wasn&#x27;t 2 or 3 years like it might have been.This was a long time ago, and I still have both the adult teeth, although one of them died when I got hit in the face with a football in the third grade.All to say that n=1 but it likely wouldn&#x27;t have been the worst thing if the two teeth had come out. reply guythedudebro You need a mouth guard reply matheusmoreira > I believe in listening to experts (but ultimately making an informed decision).The whole point of consulting a professional is so they can provide you with the necessary information to make important decisions. It&#x27;s up to them to explain things to you so that you understand well enough to make an informed decision.Unsatisfactory, meandering answers means you aren&#x27;t getting the information you need to decide and you should absolutely seek another professional until you find one you trust. In fact, when we don&#x27;t know something, the professional thing to do is to admit it and refer you to another professional who does. reply j-krieger 1Similar story here. I went to a dentist, who with a sad look told me that all my wisdom teeth needed pulling. She recommended me to an oral surgeon who agreed and wanted to do the surgery, but not without first handing me a letter to sign which stated that I would not sue her if I lost feelings in my face or developed some kind of permanent pain.Seemed fine to me, but my father insisted to ask a friend of his who is a dentist. Turns out my wisdom teeth were completely fine and none needed pulling. My pain just stemmed from me grinding my teeth at night. reply cies 1> grinding my teethFor which magnesium (try different types of Mg-salts) helps many! (never heard that from a dentist, again, possssibllyy because the solution is not sold in their shop) reply dham Everyone made fun of people that said, \"I did my own research\" during Covid, but if you&#x27;ve been failed by the medical system once, you&#x27;re used to this. reply ekianjo > I’m not a conspiracy nut. I believe in listening to experts (but ultimately making an informed decision). I believe in modern medicine. But that experience shook me and forever changed my trust in the dental industry.This is the same thing with doctors for any difficult disease to treat. You will tons of different opinions based on the same facts that are available to them.It makes you seriously wonder what kind of expertise is that in the end? reply manicennui Believing that absolutely everything in the US, including medicine and food, is negatively impacted by the drive for more profit, does not make you a conspiracy nut; it is the defining characteristic of the US economy. reply janmo Same experience when I was a kid. I fell and had a milk teeth that was completely lose. The dentist just said to leave it as is.It fixed itself as well. reply dsugarman 1I think in general it&#x27;s safe to take a cynical view on every vendors aptitude. Many, if not most, people are terrible at their jobs and it&#x27;s your job to find the good ones and hold onto them reply slim 1the whole discipline is based on interpretation of symptoms. the job of a doctor is exactly like debugging a live system except when it crashes you don&#x27;t get to restart it. they actually investigate by testing their suspected diagnostic on you. they literally give you a medicine and don&#x27;t know if it will work. that&#x27;s their normal process.I think what happened to that dentist is he changed his diagnostic because of an external factor, like realising that removing the teeth is less risky with regards to getting sued by you. reply ArisakaDJB 1I&#x27;m not from the U.S. but I was that kid. I broke my teeth when I was 6. My dad took me to the local dentist who told me to \"leave him as it is\" for a decade.Except my teeth were my second teeth, and they were half broken. I was walking around with half-blackened by the rot teeth, which caused all sorts of health problems on top of all the bullying and the first kiss kids tend to take came to me after I fixed the teeth.And don&#x27;t get me started with my chronic illness that I&#x27;ve been looking for diagnosis for the last 10+ years. reply cies 1I have a tooth with a root-canal treatment that I dont trust. But several dentists say all is fine. reply redeeman 1the dentist regularly examined you and doubled down on \"leave him as it is\" thoughout a decade?while a dentist should of course make sure to double check if its the permanent teeth and all that, I feel that your dad did not really fulfill his role as a proper parent here reply svara 1> I’m not a conspiracy nut. I believe in listening to experts (but ultimately making an informed decision). I believe in modern medicine. But that experience shook me and forever changed my trust in the dental industry.To be fair, in your story the \"former head of the province’s dental association\" apparently did know his craft, indicating that competence is rewarded in dentistry also...There are a lot of doctors and dentists, and as in any field, mastership of a profession is rare. So you did the obvious and correct thing of finding someone more competent when you had doubts.That would honestly have reinforced my trust in medicine more than do the opposite... reply seanmcdirmid 1Did you consider seeing a doctor? Dentists are sort of doctors, but MDs with teeth specialties could be better, I’m sure your GP could have given you a rec.(Edit: it turns out orthodontist is not like ophthalmologist). reply calderwoodra 1Where did you hear that? Most Orthodontists do not have MDs...Did you mean an oral surgeon? reply seanmcdirmid 1Ugh, probably. reply joe5150 1All of the orthodontists I quickly searched in my area have DMDs from dental schools. reply throwaway290 1Once I had bad pain and went to a dentist, he pulled out a tooth. Later I heard it&#x27;s absolutely last ditch and replacement teeth are finicky and will make your life much more problematic.Thankfully it&#x27;s just enough to the side to not be visible so I am getting away without one. (Though I think it&#x27;s also problematic long term, because remaining teeth would shift.)Never again to trust a dentist, no matter if it&#x27;s a private clinic in developed country with supposedly great healthcare. Always talk, discuss and research and ask around enough to make own judgement... reply nick__m 1Dental implant while costly are wonderful if you have sufficiently dense jawbone, they feel like a real teeth.My dentist also told me that tooth extraction is a last-ditch effort. But that come sooner than you would like; after one rounds of antibiotics, if the pain come back but there are no apparent mechanical defect in the tooth yet the roots are blurry on the x-rays, the probability that a root canal treatment would be successful is quite small and extraction followed by an implant is your best bet. reply throwaway290 1Thank you for insight. Perhaps I heard or understood wrong. Almost sure I was not prescribed antibiotics before extraction that time but to be fair I may be forgetting, it was 4-5 years ago. I guess an implant becomes difficult after so long but I should look it up and see what dentists around say probably. reply dawnerd 1I’m missing quite a few teeth not mostly biologically but had two that grew in weird and had to be extracted. Found an amazing dentist that’s on the local board and they’re not pushy about implants but does say don’t wait too long since it’ll end up costing more if the other teeth move. He’s also managed to save a tooth my last dentist absolutely demolished trying to put a crown on it.It’s hard to shop around for dentists but when you find a good one it’s life changing. reply rmbyrro > COVID left a lot of dental chairs emptyWhy? reply varjag 1D students have to work somewhere too. reply neycoda Seems like the dentist could have just searched Google for how bent teeth work. reply megablast How did he eat with bent teeth? reply NullPrefix 1>For the first time ever I did the “call in a personal favour” thing and asked my dad to reach out a family friend, a former cosmetic dentist and former head of the province’s dental association for a second opinion.Why aren&#x27;t you using connections on a daily basis to get reliable services? reply lowkey 1> I’m not a conspiracy nutI think that term has lost all meaning. A more appropriate term for someone who no longer blindly trusts expert consensus without question is an inquisitive skeptic who takes in expert opinions and applies reason, judgement, analysis and data to determine a course of action.It’s becoming more and more recognized that expert consensus has become highly politicized and that the problem with blindly following the science is that science often follows the money. reply jokethrowaway 1My son had cavities at 3, likely resulting from a lack of minerals and breastfeeding until 3.UK NHS diagnosis was to pull 4 front top teeth out. I asked a relative (a doctor working in a public hospital but not a dentist) who advised to absolutely don&#x27;t do that without even seeing him in person (COVID lockdown BS).A local private dentist agreed and wanted 5k to fix his teeth (remove cavities, put fillings under general anesthetics).In the end we went to Russia and got it done for 1k.That&#x27;s public healthcare for you!His teeth have been fine for years, not long until he loses them naturally. reply EGreg 1If you realized this about the dental industry, just wait until you learn about the psychiatry industry. They overdiagnose so many disorders… antidepressants (1 in 5 middle aged women) opiates (mostly an epidemic for men) amphetamines for ADHD (adderal, ritalin) autism (this increase may actually be the most legit) gender dysphoria (5% of young adults now)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;short-reads&#x2F;2022&#x2F;06&#x2F;07&#x2F;about-5-o...DSM-5 has made it easier to diagnose someone with these things, boosting recurring revenues for the psychiatry and pharma industry.And then look at the Tax Preparation industry, which always lobbies to keep things complex and perpetuate the individual income tax. If there was ever something that marched Graeber’s Bullshit Jobs essay, it’s that. reply chpatrick 1What&#x27;s the right level of diagnosis for these? reply Waterluvian 1I think that’s part of the problem. Because of long-standing systemic issues with statistical medicine, it’s all but impossible to say “that number is too high or low.” The tail can wag the dog if it so chooses. reply creata 1> gender dysphoria (5% of young adults now)In no country is it true that 5% of young adults have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The Pew Research article that you linked only looks at how people identify themselves. reply EGreg 1Right, but why has it been normalized? This is a disorder according to DSM V, and the word “dysphoria” also suggests profound discomfort and unease. Like “body dysmorphic disorders” like anorexia (another issue for young girls).Perhaps people are trivializing the actual affliction and are “appropriating” the identity the way it has been done with blackface or wearing drag for the fun of it etc. I actually hope so since the opposite would imply a lot of psychological torment. But regardless, we must once again look at society and upstream issues.For example, if a girl preferred traditionally male activities, today that is 1 of 2 criteria she needs to be considered as having gender dysphoria, while in the past she’d be called a Tomboy before. That was a normal acceptable category for explaining her tendencies. It didn’t come with an assumption that she is “REALLY” a boy inside and should make a decision on whether to take advantage of the latest technology to physically transition her gender before she hits puberty. And to be fair, the amount of people undergoing hormone blockers or surgeries is still low compared to the number of young kids who identify as trans. But if the capitalist psych and pharma industries have their way, they’ll push it to increase.Most tomboys eventually changed as they got older, it was a phase, and it was contextualized differently by society. Also they had a mom at home, raising them, etc. Today both parents are away. School administrators cover their butt and say the parents can’t be notified and even if they do, they have no say. A lot of the industry increasingly is pushing ONE interpretation on all cases. An interpretstion that didn’t exist even 10 years ago. This is an experiment in novel interpretations and it’s not working well so far in terms of mental health outcomes.Many times throughout history we had such interpretations (eg Hysteria for women, or chemical castration for gays) it turned out that the problem was societal. reply creata > For example, if a girl preferred traditionally male activities, today that is 1 of 2 criteria she needs to be considered as having gender dysphoria, while in the past she’d be called a Tomboy before.Sorry, I don&#x27;t have the energy to respond to the other stuff, but I really think you&#x27;re mixing together the criteria for adults with the criteria for children. reply tfro Yes, it&#x27;s a very conservative ideology masquerading as progressivism. reply x86x87 1I know at least a handful of people that ended up gaining weight and developing diabetes (or they are close to diabetes) as a result of antidepressants. It&#x27;s super depressing: you are trying to cure one thing and trigger another one. This is double bad in cases where you didn&#x27;t need the pills in the first place. reply gochi 1Curious why you feel autism is the most legit here when it&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s been expanded on the most due to the DSM. They all make statistical sense to me given the rising acceptance of mental health being a real thing in the first place, no longer dismissed as \"just work harder\". reply EGreg 1I could be wrong. There has been an uptick in all of them, but I thought autism had less of an uptick, and there have been new biological environmental factors that may make autism something from birth, whether heritable or not.Whereas something like, say, gender dysphoria has positively exploded in diagnoses. It’s a worrying disorder, which (eg unlike autism) studies show leads 30-50% to attempt suicide. So any increase in its prevalence to 5% of the emerging US population is worrying. If this was, say, a coronavirus with that kind of risk to life, we’d all be worried.I want to be clear - I am not saying that the symptoms aren’t real and that “this is all in their head”, or that we need “conversion therapy” or something. I an saying the major systemic problems are upstream and by changing THE SYSTEM we will reduce the incidence instead of only focusing on medical interventions downstream as bandaids.As an analogy — if we addressed antibiotic overuse on factory farms and sugar and high fructose corn syrup and pink slime, fast foods etc. we could address the epidemics of obesity and diabetes, including in children. But instead we focus on inventing new ways to medicate them!And when the coronavirus comes around, instead of recognizing that these very same factors (obesity and diabtetes) are highly correlated with morbidity and mortality with that virus, we once again look for vaccines against the virus and once it subsides we continue to IGNORE all the systemic upstream factors in the underlying chronic epidemics in USA.Autism could very well be yet another one, maybe it is like autoimmune diseases that are related to microplastics, maybe they affect hormones like aestrogen and testosterone. We need to LOOK UPSTREAM. reply mrwnmonm 1I read a book by psychiatrist, can&#x27;t remember it&#x27;s name now... he was saying, I explained the serotonin reuptake process to one of my patients, then the patient said... great, but how do you know that this applies to me personally?... he said I couldn&#x27;t respond.Also, there are many antidepressants... I don&#x27;t think there is a solid ground for why they describe a specific one for certain patients.Check these too:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcache.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;search?q=cache:https%...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcache.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;search?q=cache:https%... reply darkclouds On the topic of antidepressants, there is som",

    "title": "Replace peer review with “peer replication” (2021)",
    "originLink": "https://blog.everydayscientist.com/replace-peer-review-with-peer-replication/",
    "originBody": "Everyday Scientist remarking on the unremarkable Science Blog About Shop Replace Peer Review with “Peer Replication” October 13, 2021 at 1:35 pmsamliterature, science and the public, science community, scientific integrity As I’ve posted before and many others have noted, there is a serious problem with lack of adequate replication in many fields of science. The current peer review process is a dreadful combination of being both very fallible and also a huge hurdle to communicating important science. Instead of waiting for a few experts in the field to read and apply their stamp of approval to a manuscript, the real test of a paper should be the ability to reproduce its findings in the real world. (As Andy York has pointed out, the best test of a new method is not a peer reviewing your paper, but a peer actually using your technique.) But almost no published papers are subsequently replicated by independent labs, because there is very little incentive for anyone to spend time and resources testing an already published finding. That is precisely the opposite of how science should ideally operate. Let’s Replace Traditional Peer Review with “Peer Replication” Instead of sending out a manuscript to anonymous referees to read and review, preprints should be sent to other labs to actually replicate the findings. Once the key findings are replicated, the manuscript would be accepted and published. (Of course, as many of us do with preprints, authors can solicit comments from colleagues and revise a manuscript based on that feedback. The difference is that editors would neither seek such feedback nor require revisions.) Along with the original data, the results of the attempted replication would be presented, for example as a table that includes which reagents/techniques were identical. The more parameters that are different between the original experiment and the replication, the more robust the ultimate finding if the referees get similar results. A purely hypothetical example of the findings after referees attempt to replicate. Of course in reality, my results would always have green checkmarks. Incentives What incentive would any professor have to volunteer their time (or their trainees’ time) to try to reproduce someone else’s experiment? Simple: credit. Traditional peer review requires a lot of time and effort to do well, but with zero reward except a warm fuzzy feeling (if that). For papers published after peer replication, the names of researchers who undertook the replication work will be included in the published paper (on a separate line). Unlike peer review, the referees will actually receive compensation for their work in the form of citations and another paper to include on their CV. Why would authors be willing to have their precious findings put through the wringer of real-world replication? First and foremost, because most scientists value finding truth, and would love to show that their findings hold up even after rigorous testing. Secondly, the process should actually be more rewarding than traditional peer review, which puts a huge burden on the authors to perform additional experiments and defend their work against armchair reviewers. Peer replication turns the process on its head: the referees would do the work of defending the manuscript’s findings. Feasible Experiments There are serious impediments to actually reproducing a lot of findings that use seriously advanced scientific techniques or require long times or a lot of resources (e.g. mouse work). It will be the job of editors—in collaboration with the authors and referees—to determine the set of experiments that will be undertaken, balancing rigor and feasibility. Of course, this might leave some of the most complex experiments unreplicated, but then it would be up to the readers to decide for themselves how to judge the paper as a whole. What if all the experiments in the paper are too complicated to replicate? Then you can submit to JOOT. Ancillary Benefits Peer replication transforms the adversarial process of peer review into a cooperation among colleagues to seek the truth. Another set of eyes and brains on an experiment could introduce additional controls or alternative experimental approaches that would bolster the original finding. This approach also encourages sharing experimental procedures among labs in a manner that can foster future collaborations, inspire novel approaches, and train students and postdocs in a wider range of techniques. Too often, valuable hands-on knowledge is sequestered in individual labs; peer replication would offer an avenue to disseminate those skills. Peer replication would reduce fraud. Often, the other authors on an ultimately retracted paper only later discover that their coworker fabricated data. It would be nearly impossible for a researcher to pass off fabricated data or manipulated images as real if other researchers actually attempt to reproduce the experimental results.  Potential Problems One serious problem with peer replication is the additional time it may take between submission and ultimate publication. On the other hand, it often takes many months to go through the traditional peer review process, and replicating experiments may not actually add any time in many cases. Still this could be mitigated by authors submitting segments of stories as they go. Instead of waiting until the entire manuscript is polished, authors or editors could start arranging replications while the manuscript is still in preparation. Ideally, there would even be a  journal-blind mechanism (like ReviewCommons) to arrange reproducing these piecewise findings. Another problem is what to do when the replications fail. There would still need to be a judgement call as to whether the failed replication is essential to the manuscript and/or if the attempt at replication was adequately undertaken. Going a second round at attempting a replication may be warranted, but editors would have to be wary of just repeating until something works and then stopping. Pre-registering the replication plan could help with that. Also, including details of the failed replications in the published paper would be a must. Finally, there would still be the problem of authors “shopping” their manuscript. If the replications fail and the manuscript is rejected, the authors could simply submit to another journal. I think the rejected papers would need to be archived in some fashion to maintain transparency and accountability. This would also allow some mechanism for the peer replicators to get credit for their efforts. Summary of Roles: Editor: Screen submissions and reject manuscripts with obviously flawed science, experiments not worth replicating, essential controls missing, or seriously boring results. Find appropriate referees. With authors and referees, collaboratively decide which experiments the referees should attempt to replicate and how. Ultimately conclude, in consultation with referees, whether the findings in the papers are sufficiently reproducible to warrant full publication. Authors: Write the manuscript, seek feedback (e.g. via bioRxiv), and make revisions before submitting to the journal. Assist referees with experimental design, reagents, and even access to personnel or specialized equipment if necessary. Referees: Faithfully attempt to reproduce the experimental results core to the manuscript. Optional: Perform any necessary additional experiments or controls to close any substantial flaws in the work. Collate results. Readers: Read the published paper and decide for themselves if the evidence supports the claims, with the confidence that the key experiments have been independently replicated by another lab. Cite reproducible science. How to Get Started While it would be great if a journal like eLife simply piloted a peer replication pathway, I don’t think we can wait for Big Publication to initiate the shift away from traditional peer review. Maybe the quickest route would be for an organization like Review Commons to organize a trial of this new approach. They could identify some good candidates from bioRxiv and, with the authors, recruit referees to undertake the replications. Then the entire package could be shopped to journals. I suspect that once scientists see peer replication in print, it will be hard to take seriously papers vetted only by peer review. Better science will outcompete unreproduced findings.

A geologist may spend weeks to months making observations in the field and then write up a paper interpreting what they have seen. Should another geologist make a second map of the same area?

You save some time compared to the original as you don&#x27;t have to repeat the dead ends and you might receive some samples and can skip parts of the preparation that way. But properly replicating a paper will still be a lot of effort, especially when there are any issues and it doesn&#x27;t work on the first try. Then you have to troubleshoot your experiments and make sure that no mistakes were made. That can add a lot of time to the process.This is also all work that doesn&#x27;t benefit the scientists replicating the paper. It only costs them money and time.If someone cares enough about the work to build on it, they will replicate it anyway. And in that case they have a good incentive to spend the effort. If that works this will indirectly support the original paper even if the following papers don&#x27;t specifically replicate the original results. Though this part is much more problematic if the following experiments fail, then this will likely remain entirely unpublished. But the solution here unfortunately isn&#x27;t as simple as just publishing negative results, it take far more work to create a solid negative result than just trying the experiments and abandoning them if they&#x27;re not promising. reply kergonath 1> I don&#x27;t see how this could ever work, and non-scientists seem to often dramatically underestimate the amount of work it would be to replicate every published paper.They also tend to over-estimate the effect of peer review (often equating peer review with validity).> If someone cares enough about the work to build on it, they will replicate it anyway.

If that works this will indirectly support the original paper even if the following papers don&#x27;t specifically replicate the original results. Though this part is much more problematic if the following experiments fail, then this will likely remain entirely unpublished.It can also remain unpublished if other things did not work out, even if the results could be replicated. A half-fictional example: a team is working on a revolutionary new material to solve complicated engineering problems. They found a material that was synthesised by someone in the 1980s, published once and never reproduced, which they think could have the specific property they are after. So they synthesise it, and it turns out that the material exists, with the expected structure but not with the property they hoped. They aren’t going to write it up and publish it; they’re just going to scrap it and move on to the next candidate. Different teams might be doing the same thing at the same time, and nobody coming after them will have a clue. reply techdragon 1This waste of effort by way of duplicating unpublished negative results is a big factor in why replicated results deserve to be rated more highly than results that have not been replicated regardless of the prestige of the researchers or the institutions involved… if no one can prove your work work was correct… how much can anyone trust your work…I have gone down the rabbit hole of engineering research before and 90% of the time I’ve managed to find an anecdote or subsequent research footnotes or actual subsequent research publications, that substantially invalidated the lofty claims of the engineers in the 70s or 80s (which is amazing still despite this, a genuine treasure trove of research unused and sometimes useful aerospace engineering research and development) and unfortunately outside the few proper publications, a lot of the invalidations are not properly reverse cited research material and I could have spent a week cross referencing before I spot the link and realise the unnamed work they are saying they are proving wrong is actually some footnotes containing the only published data (before their new paper) on some old work that has a bad scan copy on the NASA NTRS server under some obscure title and no related keywords to the topic the research is notionally about…Academic research can genuinely suck sometimes… particularly when you want to actually apply it. reply godelski 42 Alternatively, maybe researchers should be encouraged to publish all kinds of results and not just \"novel\" work. Successes, failures, insights, etc. This idea of how we evaluate researchers is often silly. We&#x27;re asking people to push the bounds of knowledge and we don&#x27;t know what will come from it or how long it will take. But we are hyper focused on this short term evaluation. reply aeternum Publishing positive&#x2F;noteworth results only does seem like an embarrassingly obvious major flaw in academia and the greater scientific community.A research assistant would quickly be thrown out if he&#x2F;she refused to record negative experimental results, yet we somehow decide that is fine when operating as a collective. reply vibrio 1“They also tend to over-estimate the effect of peer review (often equating peer review with validity).“In my experience, scientists ate comfortably cynical about peer review- even those that serve as reviewers and editors- except maybe junior scientists that haven’t gotten burned yet. reply godelski 36 It&#x27;s because we all know it is a con to just get money from universities and governments. We had a long time without this system and we perverted it from its original intent. 3-4 people reading a paper are incapable of proving something is valid (the inverse is true, but also remember there&#x27;s 3 options: true, false, indeterminate). It&#x27;s even more silly that we think we can rank them (i.e. top tier venues). Rejection rate isn&#x27;t a ranking, and it is silly to think it could be (way too easy to hack). We just go with the momentum and because that&#x27;s what the admins require of us. Otherwise, let&#x27;s me honest, we&#x27;re all communicating our work outside the structure of journals and conferences (at least they offer meetups). It&#x27;s very hard for me to justify their existence if we&#x27;re being honest. And honestly, I don&#x27;t see how abandoning these systems wouldn&#x27;t just save us time and money. Like god, the number of hours I spend reworking things which got no actionable feedback from the previous round, is insane. It is just too easy to get non-actionable rejections and that just wastes everybody&#x27;s time and money, and frankly holds back science. reply jakear 1It&#x27;s the general public that equates \"peer reviewed\" with \"definitely correct, does not need to be questioned\". reply kibibu There is genuine merit in peer review though. A lot of the marketing \"papers\" from OpenAI and Google would benefit from going through a peer review process instead of scholarwashing and uploading straight to Arxiv.One simple example, (from memory) the Bard paper doesn&#x27;t include results for experiments in which GPT-4 outperforms it. As a result, people come away from these works with an inflated understanding of their capabilities. This wouldn&#x27;t pass peer review. reply somenameforme You can often see a p-hacked study from a mile away because they measure large numbers of unnecessary variables. They then pick those 4 variables that yield a probably false signal and publish on it. One would think these would never pass peer review, but they&#x27;re regularly peer reviewed, published, and then, shockingly enough, fail to replicate. Hypothesizing after the results are known falls in the same bucket here. This is why pre-publishing kicked off, yet it&#x27;s also hardly a savior.The point I make is that peer review can not be guaranteed to &#x27;fix&#x27; science in any way we might like. The Sokal Affair [1] has now been replicated repeatedly, including in peer reviewed journals. The most recent one even got quite cheeky and published it under the names \"Sage Owens, Kal Avers-Lynde III\" - Sokal III. [2] It always preys on the same weakness - bias confirmation.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sokal_affair[2] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalreview.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;academic-journal-publish... reply kjkjadksj What is honestly a lot more compelling than peer review is multiple supporting pieces of evidence from different sources. One result might be spurious, but if you can find a couple independent studies showing as much its probably a real phenomenon. reply jakear Industry doesn&#x27;t need peer review. The proof of the pudding is in the sales. reply kibibu Then why does it dress its marketing up in academic paper format? reply jakear In want of sales. reply ModernMech This is the final stage of capitalism, where market success is conflated with scientific rigor. reply jakear Engineering, not scientific.High Sales = A large number of people can attest to the engineered good or service being of high enough quality that they will exchange hard earned money for the ability to use it.Peer Review = Some folks who derive self-worth from citations ask you to add a citation to their work and you do it because you&#x27;ll probably need to ask them for the same some time later. reply depereo This doesn&#x27;t really account for fraud or abuse. Plenty of profitable companies whose product is a scam, or has other factors that make it successful.Market success isn&#x27;t the same thing as validity. reply tsimionescu A quick trip around audiophile companies should quickly disabuse you of the notion that high sales implies any kind of worth to a product. There are several companies making lots of money on selling gold HDMI, ethernet etc cables \"to improve sound quality\", and plenty of rubes buying them and \"hearing the difference\". reply memefrog Real Hi-Fi companies like Sennheiser and Bose make far more money than people selling gold HDMI cables. And they&#x27;ve been making much more money for decades and will continue to make money for decades.Grifters don&#x27;t win in the long-term. reply optionalsquid You frequently see this kind of reasoning in medical quackery:> Butt-candling[1] must work, just look all these happy customers!But history is replete with ineffective or downright harmful treatments being popular long after the evidence showed them to be ineffective or harmful. Homeopathy is a prime example of this, seeing as those concoctions contain either no active ingredients or (in cases of low dilutions still labeled \"homeopathic\") contain ingredients picked based on notions of sympathetic magic (\"like cures like\").[1] A hopefully fictional example. replyPaulHoule Except for the ones that conclude it is all a scam. reply kergonath 1Yes, because we know how the metaphorical sausage is made: with unpaid reviewers who have many other, more interesting things to do and often an axe to grind. That is, if they don’t delegate the review to one of their post-docs. reply godelski 32 > with unpaid reviewers who have many other, more interesting things to doIt&#x27;s kinda funny. A journal doesn&#x27;t make the product it sells (the papers that it copywrites). It doesn&#x27;t pay for the service it performs (\"vetting\" and editing). And both of these would be done regardless of their existence. I can understand distribution, but that hasn&#x27;t been useful for over a decade now. What even do these things do anymore?(btw, I&#x27;ve seen profs delegate to undergrads. And it is quite common for post-docs AND grad students to be reviewers. Trust me, I am one) reply aftoprokrustes 1Post doc? In what kind of utopian field did you work? In my former institute virtually all papers were written by PhD candidates, and reviewed by PhD candidates. With the expected effect on quality (due to lack of experience and impostor-syndrome-induced \"how can I propose to reject? They are likely better than me\"). But the Prof-to-postdoc-to-PhD-ratio was particularly bad (1-2-15). reply godelski 27 > \"how can I propose to reject? They are likely better than me\"Funny enough, I see exactly the opposite. I&#x27;ve seen this in both reviews I&#x27;ve done and reviews I&#x27;ve received. Just this week I reviewed and saw one of my fellow reviewers write in their justifications: I am not familiar with X, but I am skeptical that the method can scale to a more complex application. Their weaknesses section was extremely generic and it was very clear they didn&#x27;t understand the work. They gave a weak reject. In fact, when I first started reviewing, I was explicitly told to _only_ accept if I was confident that the work was good. So in my experience, the bias goes the other way that you are proposing.Btw, I&#x27;ve even seen undergrads acting as reviewers. I was asked to review in in my first year of grad school. I don&#x27;t think I was qualified then, but I was always a junior reviewer rather than a full so idk. reply kelipso I was reviewing papers starting second semester of grad school with my advisor just signing off on it, so not even PhD candidates, and it was the same for my lab mates too.Initially we spent probably a few hours on a paper for peer review because we were relatively unfamiliar with the field but eventually I spent maybe a couple of hours doing the review. Wouldn&#x27;t say peer review is a joke but it&#x27;s definitely overrated by the public. reply renonce I don&#x27;t know how scientists handle peer review but aren&#x27;t they fighting with peer review to get their papers published and apply for PhD and tenure and grants etc with these publications? reply sebzim4500 1>I don&#x27;t see how this could ever work, and non-scientists seem to often dramatically underestimate the amount of work it would be to replicate every published paper.I think it would be fine to half the productivity of these fields, if it means that you can reasonably expect papers to be accurate. reply dmarchand90 1I believe that, contrary to popular belief, the implementation of this system would lead to a substantial increase in productivity in the long run. Here&#x27;s why:Currently, a significant proportion of research results in various fields cannot be reproduced. This essentially means that a lot of work turns out to be flawed, leading to wasted efforts (you can refer to the &#x27;reproducibility crisis&#x27; for more context). Moreover, future research often builds upon this erroneous information, wasting even more resources. As a result, academic journals get cluttered with substandard work, making them increasingly difficult to monitor and comprehend. Additionally, the overall quality of written communication deteriorates as emphasis shifts from the accurate transfer and reproduction of knowledge to the inflated portrayal of novelty.Now consider a scenario where 50% of all research is dedicated to reproduction. Although this may seem to decelerate progress in the short term, it ensures a more consistent and reliable advancement in the long term. The quality of writing would likely improve to facilitate replication. Furthermore, research methodology would be disseminated more quickly, enhancing overall research effectiveness. reply matthewdgreen 1In the current system scientists allocate reproduction efforts to results that they intend to build on. So if you’ve claimed a breakthrough technique for levitating widgets — and I think this widget technique can be used to build spacecraft (or if I think your technique is wrong) — then I will allocate precious time and resources to reproducing your work. By contrast if I don’t think your work is significant and worth following up on, then I allocate my efforts somewhere else. The advantage is that more apparently-significant results (“might cure cancer”) tend to get a bigger slice of very limited resources, while dead-end or useless results (“might slightly reduce flatulence in cats”) don’t. This distributed entrepreneurial approach isn’t perfect, but it works better than central planning. By contrast you could adopt a Soviet-like approach where cat farts and cancer both share replication resources, but this seems like it would be bad for everyone (except the cats.) reply GravelRocks \"Cat fart\" research might also be incredibly expensive to replicate compared to the \"might cure cancer\" research. In that case it would effectively get a bigger slice of resources because we&#x27;re treating all research the same! reply crote 19 Where are you going to get the budget to build a second LHC solely for replication? How are you going to replicate a long-term medical cohort study which has been running for thirty years? What about a paper describing a one-off astronomical event, like the \"Wow!\" signal? What if you research the long-term impact of high-dose radiation exposure during Chernobyl?There is plenty of science out there which financially, practically, or ethically simply by definition cannot be replicated. That doesn&#x27;t mean their results should not be published. If peer review shows that their methods and analysis are sound, there is no reason to doubt the results. reply advisedwang 1It would be more than just half productivity. Not only do you have to do the work twice, but you add the delay of someone else replicating before something can be published and built upon by others. If you are developer, imagine how much your productivity would drop going from a 3 minute build to a 1 day build. reply wilde You can easily look up non peer reviewed papers on arxiv. Why would this be different with replication? reply orangepurple 1Terrible analogy. It might take months to come up with an idea but another should be able to follow your method and implement it much more quickly than it took you to come up with the concept and implement it. reply cycomanic 1I think you don&#x27;t understand how much work is involved in just building the techniques and expertise to pull some experiments off (let&#x27;s not even talk about the equipment).Even if someone meticulously documents their process, it could still take months to replicate the results.I&#x27;m familiar with lithography&#x2F;nanofabrication and I know that it is typically the case that a process developed in one clean-room can not be directly applied to a different clean room and instead one has to develop a new process based on what the other results.Even in the same lab it can often happen that if you come back to a process after a longer time, that things don&#x27;t work out anymore and quite a bit of troubleshooting ensues (maybe a supplier for some chemical changed and even though it should be the same formula it behaves slightly different). reply RoyalHenOil 1Months. Haha.I previously worked in agricultural research (in the private sector), and we spent YEARS trying to replicate some published research from overseas. And that was research that had previously been successfully replicated, and we even flew in the original scientists and borrowed a number of their PhD students for several months, year after year, to help us try to make it work.We never did get it to fully replicate in our country. We ended up having to make some pretty extreme changes to the research to get similar (albeit less reliable) results here.We never did figure out why it worked in one part of the world but not another, since we controlled for every other factor we could think of (including literally importing the original team&#x27;s lab supplies at great expense, just in case there was some trace contaminant on locally sourced materials). reply hnfong > We never did figure out why it worked in one part of the world but not anotherDoesn&#x27;t that indicate further research is needed? It sounds fascinating to me. (I know it isn&#x27;t interesting for the people who couldn&#x27;t get it working.) It also might indicate that the original research was incomplete in the sense that it might be a fluke due to specific conditions in the original country which isn&#x27;t universal. reply faeriechangling You are making an argument for replication not against it by stressing how meticulously documenting your process is an “if”, strewing how things like a supplier for a chemical can change and render reproduction impossible, and even if an observation can only be replicated in one clean room that means you effectively only have as long as that clean room remains opens to replicate it.You are almost stressing all the ways we are producing garbage rendered non-reproducible with deficient documentation of processes, changes in supply, and changes in the environment. All three can be minimized through peer replication. reply evandrofisico 1Usually coming up with a idea is the easy part. For example, in my PhD project, i started with an idea from my advisor that he had in the early 2000.Implementing the code for the simulation and analysis of the data? four months, at most. Running the simulation? almost three years until I had data with good enough resolution for publishing. reply tnecniv 1It’s also very easy to come up with bad ideas — I did plenty of that and I still do, albeit less than I used to. Finding an idea that is novel, interesting, and tractable given your time, skills, resources, and knowledge of the literature is hard, and maybe the most important skill you develop as a researcher.For a reductive example, the idea to solve P vs NP is a great one, but I’m not going to do that any time soon! reply PaulHoule I&#x27;d say it is a bad idea because you&#x27;re not going to succeed at it. reply tnecniv Sure because that’s an easy example and kind of my point. When you’re starting your PhD, it can be hard to determine what questions you can and cannot answer given your skills and surrounding literature. That comes from experience and trying (and failing) a lot. reply magimas 1horrible take. Taking the LK99 situation as an example: simply copying and adapting a well described growth recipee to your own setup and lab conditions may take weeks. And how would you address situations where measurement setups only exist once on the earth? How would you do peer replication of LHC measurements? Wait for 50 years till the next super-collider is built and someone else can finally verify the results? On a smaller scale: If you need measurements at a synchrotron radiation source to replicate a measurement, is someone supposed to give up his precious measurement time to replicate a paper he isn&#x27;t interested in? And is the original author of a paper that&#x27;s in the queue for peer replication supposed to wait for a year or two till the reviewer gets a beamtime on an appropriate measurement station? Even smaller: I did my PhD in a lab with a specific setup that only a single other group in the world had an equivalent to. You simply would not be able to replicate these results.Peer replication is completely unfeasible in experimental fields of science. The current process of peer review is alright, people just need to learn that single papers standing by themselves don&#x27;t mean too much. The \"peer replication\" happens over time anyway when others use the same tools, samples, techniques on related problems and find results in agreement with earlier papers. reply mapt We could easily 10x the funding and 5x the manpower we throw at STEM research if we actually cared what they produced.NSF grants distribute 8.5 billion dollars a year, which is less than Major League Baseball (and its Congressionally granted monopoly) makes. The US Congress has directed 75 billion dollars in aid to Ukraine to date. reply dkqmduems That would be reasonable, which isn&#x27;t the point. reply harimau777 1The issue that I see is: even if halving productivity is acceptable to the field as a whole; how do you incentivize a given scientist to put in the effort?This seems particularly problematic because it is already notoriously hard to get tenure and academia is already notoriously unrewarding to researchers who don&#x27;t have tenure. reply hoosieree 1Half is wildly optimistic. reply ImPostingOnHN 1half would only be possible if, for every single paper published by a given team, there exists a second team just as talented as the original team, skilled in that specific package of techniques, just waiting to replicate that paper reply sqrt_1 1FYI there is a at least one science journal that only publishes reproduced research:Organic Syntheses \"A unique feature of the review process is that all of the data and experiments reported in an article must be successfully repeated in the laboratory of a member of the editorial board as a check for reproducibility prior to publication\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Organic_Syntheses reply jamesash 54 Started in 1924 and still going strong 100 years later. The gold standard for organic chemistry procedures.\"If you can&#x27;t reproduce a procedure in Org Syn, it&#x27;s YOUR fault\" - my PhD supervisor reply ebiester 1It&#x27;s simple but not easy: You create another path to tenure which is based on replication, or on equal terms as a part of a tenure package. (For example, x fewer papers but x number of replications, and you are expected to have x replications in your specialty.) You also create a grant funding section for replication which is then passed on to these independent systems. (You would have to have some sort of randomization handled as well.) Replication has to be considered at the same value as original research.And maybe smaller faculties at R2s pivot to replication hubs. And maybe this is easier for some sections of biology, chemistry and psychology than it is for particle physics. We could start where cost of replication is relatively low and work out the details.It&#x27;s completely doable in some cases. (It may never be doable in some areas either.) reply tnecniv 1Your proposal has a whole slew of issues.First, people that want to be professors normally do so because they want to steer their research agenda, not repeat what other people are doing without contribution. Second, who works in their lab? Most of the people doing the leg work in a lab are PhD students, and, to graduate, they need to do something novel to write up in their dissertation. Thus, they can’t just replicate three experiments and get a doctorate. Third, you underestimate how specialized lab groups are — both in terms of the incredibly expensive equipment it is equipped with and the expertise within the lab. Even folks in the same subfield (or even in the same research group!) often don’t have much in common when it comes to interests, experience, and practical skills.For every lab doing new work, you’d basically need a clone of that lab to replicate their work. reply majormajor > First, people that want to be professors normally do so because they want to steer their research agenda, not repeat what other people are doing without contribution.If we&#x27;re talking about weird incentives and academia you hit on one of the worst ones right here, I think, since nothing there is very closely connected to helping students learn.I know that&#x27;s a dead horse, but it&#x27;s VERY easy to find reasons that we shouldn&#x27;t be too closely attached to the status quo.> For every lab doing new work, you’d basically need a clone of that lab to replicate their work.Hell, that&#x27;s how startup funding works, or market economies in general. Top-down, non-redundant systems are way more fragile than distributed ecosystems. If you don&#x27;t have the competition and the complete disconnection, you so much more easily fall into political games of \"how do we get this published even if it ain&#x27;t great\" vs \"how do we find shit that will survive the competition\" reply rapjr9 1Another approach I&#x27;ve seen actually used in Computer Science and Physics is to make replication a part of teaching to undergrads and masters candidates. The students learn how to do the science, and they get a paper out of replicating the work (which may or may not support the original results), and the field benefits from the replication. reply harimau777 1I think that there&#x27;s also a lot of psychological&#x2F;cultural&#x2F;political issues that work also need to be worked out:If someone wins the Nobel Prize, do the people who replicated their work also win it? When the history books are written do the replicators get equal billing to the people who made the discovery?When selecting candidates for prestigious positions, are they really going to consider a replicator equal to an original researcher? reply Eddy_Viscosity2 1It&#x27;s not easy because it isn&#x27;t simple. How do get all of the universities to change their incentives to back this? reply ebiester 1We agree - the \"simple not easy\" turn of phrase is speaking to that point. It is easy once implemented, but it isn&#x27;t easy to transition. (I am academia-adjacent by marriage but closer to the humanities, so I understand the amount of work it would take to perform the transition.) reply MichaelZuo 1This isn&#x27;t just not easy, it would probably be extremely political to change the structure of the NSF, National Labs, all universities and colleges, etc., so dramatically. reply SkyMarshal 1> x fewer papers but x number of replications, and you are expected to have x replications in your specialty.Could it be simplified it even further to say x number of papers, but they only count if they’re replicated by others in the field? reply nine_k 1No, the idea is that the same researcher should produce k papers and n replications, instead of just k + n published papers.I&#x27;d argue that since replication is somehow faster than original research, the requirement would count a replication somewhat lower than an original paper (say, at 0.75). reply ebiester 1That is my idea... If we opened it up, there&#x27;s probably more interesting iterations, such as requiring pre-registration for all papers, having papers with pre-registration count as some portion of a full paper even if they fail so long as the pre-registration passed scrutiny, having non-replicated papers count as some portion of a fully replicated paper, and having replication as a separate category such that there is a minimum k, a minimum n, and a minimum k+n.The non-easy part of this is once we start making changes to the criteria for tenure, this opens up people trying to stuff all the solutions for all of the problems that everyone knows already. (See Above.) Would some one try to stuff code-available for CS conference papers, for example? What does it mean for a poster session? At what point are papers released for pre-print? What does it mean for the tenure clock or the Ph.D clock? Does it mean that pre-tenure can&#x27;t depend on studies that take time to replicate? What do we do with longitudinal studies?I think you&#x27;re looking at a 50 year transition where you would have to start simple and iterate. reply harimau777 1Is tenure really as mechanical as \"publish this many papers and you get it\"? My impression was that it took into account things like impact factor and was much more subjective. If that were the case, then wouldn&#x27;t you run into problems with whoever decides tenure paying lip service to counting replication or failed pre-registered papers but in practice being biased in favor of original research? replyjustinpombrio 1> If someone cares enough about the work to build on it, they will replicate it anyway.Well, the trouble is that hasn&#x27;t been the case in practice. A lot of the replication crisis was attempting for the first time to replicate a foundational paper that dozens of other papers took as true and built on top of, and then seeing said foundational paper fail to replicate. The incentives point toward doing new research instead of replication, and that needs to change. reply p1esk 1It is the case in my field (ML): if I care enough about a published result I try to replicate it. reply tnecniv This is something very sensible in ML since, you likely want to use that algorithm for something else (or to extend &#x2F; modify it), so you need to get it working in your pipeline and verify it works by comparing with the published result.In something like psychology that is likely harder, since the experiment you want to do might be related to but differ significantly from the prior work. I am no psychologist, but I’d like to think that they don’t take one study as ground truth for that reason but try to understand causal mechanisms with multiple studies as data points. If the hypothesis is correct, it will likely present in multiple ways. reply johnnyworker 1> If someone cares enough about the work to build on it, they will replicate it anyway.Does it really deserve to be called work if it doesn&#x27;t include the a full, working set of instructions that if followed to a T allow it to be replicated? To me that&#x27;s more like pollution, making it someone else&#x27;s problem. I certainly don&#x27;t see how \"we did this, just trust us\" can even be considered science, and that&#x27;s not because I don&#x27;t understand the scientific method, that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t make a living with it, and have no incentive to not rock the boat. reply MrJohz 1I work with code, which is about as reproducible as it is possible to get - the artifacts I produce are literally just instructions on how to reproduce the work I&#x27;ve done again, and again, and again. And still people come to me with some bug that they&#x27;ve experienced on their machine, that I cannot reproduce on my machine, despite the two environments being as identical as I can possibly make them.I agree that reproduction in scientific work is important, but it is also apparently impossible in the best possible circumstances. When dealing with physical materials, inexact measurements, margins of error, etc, I think we have to accept that there is no set of instructions that, if followed to a T, will ever ensure perfect replication. reply johnnyworker 1> And still people come to me with some bug that they&#x27;ve experienced on their machine, that I cannot reproduce on my machineBut this is the other way around. Have you ever written a program that doesn&#x27;t run anywhere except a single machine of yours? Would you release it and advertise it and encourage other people to use it as dependency in their software?If it only runs on one machine of yours, you don&#x27;t even know if your code is doing something, or something else in the machine&#x2F;OS. Or in terms of science, whether the research says something about the world, or just about the research setup. reply MrJohz 1I think you misunderstand the point of scientific publication here (at least in theory, perhaps less so in practice). The purpose of a paper is typically to say \"I have achieved these results in this environment (as far as I can tell)\", and encourages reproduction. But the original result is useful in its own right - it tells us that there may be something worth exploring. Yes, it may just be a measurement error (I remember the magic faster than light neutrinos), but if it is exciting enough, and lots of eyes end up looking, then flaws are typically found fairly quickly.And yes, there are often overly excited press releases that accompany it - the \"advertise it and encourage others to us it as a dependency\" part of it analogy - but this is typically just noise in the context of scientific research. If that is your main problem with scientific publishing, you may want to be more critical of science journalism instead.Fwiw, yes of course I&#x27;ve written code that only runs on my machine. I imagine everyone has, typically accidentally. You do it, you realise your mistake, you learn something from it. Which is exactly what we expect from scientific papers that can&#x27;t be reproduced. reply johnnyworker 1> But the original result is useful in its own right - it tells us that there may be something worth exploring.I disagree. It shows that when someone writes something in a text editor and publishes it, others can read the words they wrote. That&#x27;s all it shows, by itself. Just like someone writing something on the web only tells us that a textarea accepts just about any input.And even if it did show more than that, when someone \"explores\" it, is the result is more of that, something that might be true, might not be, but \"is worth exploring\"? Then at what point does falsifiability enter into it? Why not right away? To me it&#x27;s just another variation of making it someone else&#x27;s problem, kicking the can down the road.> if it is exciting enough, and lots of eyes end up looking, then flaws are typically found fairly quickly.If that was true, there wouldn&#x27;t even be a replication issue, much less a replication crisis. It&#x27;s like saying open source means a lot of people look at the code, if it&#x27;s important enough. Time and time again that&#x27;s proven wrong, e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;open-source-software-security-...> yes of course I&#x27;ve written code that only runs on my machine. I imagine everyone hasI wouldn&#x27;t even know how to go about doing that. Can you post something that only runs on one of your machines, and you don&#x27;t know why? Note I didn&#x27;t say your machine, I said one machine of yours. Would you publish something that runs on one machine of yours but not a single other one, other than to ask \"can anyone tell me why this only runs on this machine\"? I doubt it. reply MrJohz I think you may be seeing the purpose of these papers differently to me, which may be the cause of this confusion.The way you&#x27;re describing a scientific publication is as if it were the end result of the scientific act. To use the software analogy, you&#x27;re describing publication like a software release: all tests have been performed, all CI workflows have passed, QA have checked everything, and the result is about to be shipped to customers.But talking to researchers, they see publishing more like making a new branch in a repository. There is no expectation that the code in that branch already be perfect (hence why it might only run on one machine, or not even run at all, because sometimes even something that doesn&#x27;t work is still worth committing and exploring later).And just like in software, where you might eventually merge those branches and create a release out of it, in the scientific world you have metastudies or other forms of analysis and literature reviews that attempt to glean a consensus out of what has been published so far. And typically in the scientific world, this is what happens. However, in journalism, this isn&#x27;t usually what happens, and one person&#x27;s experimental, \"I&#x27;ve only tested this on my machine\" research is often treated as equivalent to another person&#x27;s \"release branch\" paper evaluating the state of a field and identifying which findings are likely to represent real, universal truths.Which isn&#x27;t to say that journalists are the only ones at fault here - universities that evaluate researchers primarily on getting papers into journals, and prestige systems that make it hard to go against conventional wisdom in the field both cause similar problems by conflating different levels of research or adding competing incentives to researchers&#x27; work. But I don&#x27;t think that invalidates the basic idea of published research: to present a found result (or non-really), provide as much information as possible about how to replicate the result again, and then let other people use that information to inform their work. It just requires us to be mindful of how we let that research inform us. reply johnnyworker > But talking to researchers, they see publishing more like making a new branch in a repository.Well some do, others don&#x27;t. Like the one who wrote the article this is a discussion of.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Replication_crisis> Replication is one of the central issues in any empirical science. To confirm results or hypotheses by a repetition procedure is at the basis of any scientific conception. A replication experiment to demonstrate that the same findings can be obtained in any other place by any other researcher is conceived as an operationalization of objectivity. It is the proof that the experiment reflects knowledge that can be separated from the specific circumstances (such as time, place, or persons) under which it was gained.Or, in short, \"one is none\". One might turn into more than one, it might not. Until it does, it&#x27;s not real.more snippets from the above WP article:> This experiment was part of a series of three studies that had been widely cited throughout the years, was regularly taught in university courses> what the community found particularly upsetting was that many of the flawed procedures and statistical tools used in Bem’s studies were part of common research practice in psychology.> alarmingly low replication rates (11-20%) of landmark findings in preclinical oncological research> A 2019 study in Scientific Data estimated with 95% confidence that of 1,989 articles on water resources and management published in 2017, study results might be reproduced for only 0.6% to 6.8%, even if each of these articles were to provide sufficient information that allowed for replicationI&#x27;m not saying it couldn&#x27;t be fine to just publish things because they \"could be interesting\". But the overall situation seems like quite the dumpster fire to me. As does software, FWIW. reply varjag > Note I didn&#x27;t say your machine, I said one machine of yours.This thread discusses peer replication, this is not even an analogy. reply johnnyworker If you can&#x27;t even replicate it yourself, what makes you think peers could? We are talking about something not being replicated, not even by the original author. The most extreme version would be something that you could only get to run once on the same machine, and never on any other machine. replydavidktr 1You just described the majority of scientific papers. A \"working set of instructions\" is not really feasible in most cases. You can&#x27;t include every piece of hard- and software required to replicate your own setup. reply johnnyworker 1Then don&#x27;t call it science, since it doesn&#x27;t contribute anything to the body of human knowledge.I think it&#x27;s fascinating that we can at the same time hold things like \"one is none\" to be true, or that you should write tests first, but with science we already got so used to a lack of discipline that we just declare it fine.It&#x27;s not hard to not climb a tower you can&#x27;t get down from. It&#x27;s the default, actually. You start with something small where you can describe everything that goes into replicating it. Then you replicate it yourself, based on your own instructions. Before that, you don&#x27;t bother anyone else with it. Once that is done, and others can replicate as well, it \"actually exists\".And if that means the majority of stuff has to be thrown out, I&#x27;d suggest doing that sooner rather than later, instead of just accumulating scientific debt. reply cycomanic 1This is a very simplistic view. Why do believe QC departments exist? Even in an industrial setting, companies make the same thing at the same place on the same equipment after sometimes years of process optimisation of well understood technology. This is essentially a best case scenario and still results fail to reproduce. How are scientists who work at the cutting edge of technology with much smaller budgets supposed to give instructions that can be easily reproduced on first go? Moreover how are they supposed to easily reproduce other results?That is not to say that scientist should not document the process to their best ability so it can be reproduced in principle. I&#x27;m just arguing that it is impossible to easily reproduce other people&#x27;s results. Again when chemical&#x2F;manufacturing companies open another location they often spend months to years to make the process work in the new factory. reply johnnyworker 1> companies make the same thing at the same place on the same equipment after sometimes years of process optimisation of well understood technology. This is essentially a best case scenario and still results fail to reproduce.We&#x27;re not talking about 1 of 10 reproduction attempts failing, we&#x27;re talking about 100%. And no, companies don&#x27;t time and time again try to reproduce something that has never been reproduced and fail, to then try again, endlessly. That&#x27;s just not a thing.> it is impossible to easily reproduce other people&#x27;s resultsWe&#x27;re also not talking about \"easily\" reproducing something, but at all. And in principle doesn&#x27;t cut it, it needs to be reproduced in practice. reply davidktr 1Imagine two scientists, Bob and Alice. Bob has spent the last 5 years examining a theory thoroughly. Now he can explain down to the last detail why the theory does not hold water, and why generations of researchers have been wrong about the issue. Unfortunately, he cannot offer an alternative, and nobody else can follow his long winded arguments anyway.Meanwhile, Alice has spent the last 5 years making the best possible use of the flawed theory, and published a lot of original research. Sure, many of her publications are rubbish, but a few contain interesting results. Contrary to Bob, Alice can show actual results and has publications.Who do you believe will remain in academia? And, according to public perception, will seem more like an actual scientist? reply tnecniv Then Bob has failed.Academic science isn’t just the doing science part but the articulation and presentation of your work to the broader community. If Bob knows this space so well, he should be able to clearly communicate the issue and, ideally, present an easily understandable counter example to the existing theory.Technical folks undervalue presentation when writing articles and presenting at conferences. The burden of proof is on the presenter, and, unless there’s some incredible demonstration at the end, most researchers won’t have the time or attention to slog through your mess of a paper to decipher it. There’s only so much time in the day and too many papers to read.In my experience, the best researchers are also the best presenters. I’ve been to great talks out of my domain that I left feeling like I understood the importance of their work despite not understanding the details. I’ve also seen many talks in my field that I thought were awful because the presentation was convoluted or they didn’t motivate the importance of their problem &#x2F; why their work addressed it reply johnnyworker 1I disagree that Bob doesn&#x27;t produce actual results, or that something that is mostly rubbish, but partly \"interesting\" is an actual result. We know the current incentives are all sorts of broken, across the board. Goodhart&#x27;s law and all that. To me the question isn&#x27;t who remains in academia given the current broken model, but who would remain in academia in one that isn&#x27;t as broken.To put a point on it, if public distrust of science becomes big enough, it all can go away before you can say \"cultural revolution\" or \"fascist strongman\". Then there&#x27;d be no more academia, and its shell would be inhabited by party members, so to speak. I&#x27;d gladly sacrifice the ability of Alice and others like her to live off producing \"mostly rubbish\" to at least have a chance to save science itself. reply lliamander 1Sounds like a problem worth solving. reply johngladtj 1You should. reply RugnirViking 1lets be brutally honest with ourselves.99% of all papers mean nothing. They add nothing to the collective knowledge of humanity. In my field of robotics there are SOOO many papers that are basically taking three or four established algorithms&#x2F;machine learning models, and applying them to off-the-shelf hardware. The kind of thing any person educated in the field could almost guess the results exactly. Hundreds of such iterations for any reasonably popular problems space (prosthetics, drones for wildfires, museum guide robot) etc every month. Far more than could possibly be useful to anyone.There should probably be some sort of separate process for things that actually claim to make important discoveries. I don&#x27;t know what or how that should work. In all honesty maybe there should just be less papers, however that could be achieved. reply indymike 1> 99% of all papers mean nothing. They add nothing to the collective knowledge of humanity.A lot of papers are done as a part of the process of getting a degree or keeping or getting job. The value is mostly the candidate showing they have the acumen to produce a paper of such quality that meets the publisher and peer review requirements. In some cases, it is to show a future employer some level of accomplishment or renown. The knowledge for humanity is mostly the authors ability to get published. reply RugnirViking 1well yes. But these should go somewhere else than the papers that may actually contain significant results. The problem we have here is that there is an enormous quantity of such useless papers mixed in with the ones actually trying to do science.I understand that part of the reason for that is that people need to appear as though they are part of the \"actually trying\" crowd to get the desired job effects. But it is nonetheless a problem, and a large one very worth at least trying to solve. reply indymike > I understand that part of the reason for that is that people need to appear as though they are part of the \"actually trying\" crowd to get the desired job effectsThere&#x27;s another less obvious problem: we don&#x27;t always know what is groundbreaking and what is not until something is published and is accepted at large as being a really big deal. reply staunton 199% of science is a waste of time, not just the papers. We just don&#x27;t know which 1% will turn out not to be. The point is that this is making progress. As such, these 99% definitely are adding to the collective knowledge. Maybe they add very little and maybe it&#x27;s not worth the effort but it&#x27;s not nothing. I think one of the effects of AI progress will be allowing to extract much more of the little value such publications have (the 99% of papers might not be worth reading but are good enough for feeding the AI). reply LBTables > In my field of robotics there are SOOO many papers that are basically taking three or four established algorithms&#x2F;machine learning models, and applying them to off-the-shelf hardware.This is a direct result of the aggressive \"publish or perish\" system. I worked as an aide in an autonomous vehicles lab for a year and a half during my undergrad, and while the actual work we were doing was really cool cutting edge stuff, it was absolutely maddening the amount of time we wasted blatantly pulling bullshit nothing papers exactly like you describe out of our asses to satisfy the constant chewing out we got that \"your lab has only published X papers this month\". reply jimkoen Thank you. Not even saying this to shit on academia, but modern scientific publishing follows the same governing rules as publishing a YouTube video (in principle).> There should probably be some sort of separate process for things that actually claim to make important discoveries.This used to be Springer Nature and the likes, but they&#x27;ve had so many retractions in the past years + they broke their integrity in the Schoen scandal, allowing lenience in the review process to secure a prestigious publication in their journal.In reality, I mean you&#x27;re probably my academic senior: How does true advancement get publicized these days? You post a YouTube video somewhere. See LK99. No peer review, no fancy stuff, a YouTube video was enough to get Argonne National lab on the case. reply PaulHoule 99% is bombastic. What I would say is that the median scientific paper is wrong and back that up with a very long list of things that could make a paper \"wrong\" or \"not even wrong\". In the case of physics, everything about string theory may be one day considered \"wrong\". In the case of medicine all the studies where N I don&#x27;t see how this could ever work, and non-scientists seem to often dramatically underestimate the amount of work it would be to replicate every published paper.Then perhaps those papers shouldn&#x27;t be published? Or held in any higher esteem than a blog post by the same authors? reply gus_massa An arXiv preprint is like a blog post.A paper in a peer review journal is like posting a request for reproduction in a heavily moderated mailing list.A paper in a predatory journal is like the \"You are the best ___\" price that you get if you pay to go to the \"congress\" invitation in spam.Neither of them guaranty that the result is true. The publication in some peer review journals give a minimal guaranty that the paper is not horribly bad, but I&#x27;ve seen too much crap there too.I know a few journals and author in my area that are serious and I can guess the result will hold, but I find very difficult to evaluate journals and authors in other areas. reply majormajor I think the current system is just measuring entirely the wrong thing. Yes, fewer papers would be published. But today&#x27;s goal is \"publish papers\" not \"learn and disseminate truly useful and novel things\", and while this doesn&#x27;t solve it entirely, it pushes incentives further away from \"publish whatever pure crap you can get away with.\" You get what you measure -> sometimes you need to change what&#x2F;how you measure.> If someone cares enough about the work to build on it, they will replicate it anyway.That&#x27;s duplicative at the \"oh maybe this will be useful to me\" stage, with N different people trying to replicate. And with replication not a first-class part of the system, the effort of replication (e_R) is high. For appealing things, N is probably > 2. So N X e_R total effort.If you move the burden at the \"replicate to publish\" stage, you can fix the number of replicas needed so N=2 (or whatever) and you incentive the orginal researchers to make e_R lower (which will improve the quality of their research even before the submit-for-publication stage).I&#x27;ve been in the system, I spent a year or two chasing the tail of rewrites, submissions, etc, for something that was detectable as low-effect-size in the first place but I was told would still be publishable. I found out as part of that that it would only sometimes yield a good p-value! And everything in the system incentivized me to hide that for as long as possible, instead of incentivizing me to look for something else or make it easy for others to replicate and judge for themselves.Hell, do something like \"give undergrads the opportunity to earn Master&#x27;s on top of their BSes, say, by replicating (or blowing holes in) other people&#x27;s submissions.\" I would&#x27;ve eaten up an opportunity like that to go really really deep* in some specialized area in exchange for a masters degree in a less-structured way than \"just take a bunch more courses.\" reply faeriechangling In some fields research can’t be replicated later. Much of all autism research will NEVER be replicated because the population of those considered autistic is not stable over time.Other research proves impossible to replicate because whatever experiment was not described in enough detail to actually replicate it, which should be grounds to immediately dismiss the research before publishing, but which can’t truly be caught if you don’t actually try to reproduce.Finally these practical concerns don’t even touch on the biggest benefit of reproduction as standard which is that almost nobody wants to reproduce research as they are not rewarded for doing so. This would give somebody, namely those who want to publish something, a strong impetus to get that reproduction done which wouldn’t otherwise exist. reply mattkrause 1Longer, even!Some experiments that study biological development or trained animals can take a year or more of fairly intense effort to start generating data. reply Maxion 1A year? some data sets take decades to build up before significant papers can be published on their data. Replication of the dataset is just not feasible.This whole thread just shows how little the average HNer knows about the academic sciences. reply tnecniv 1I know people that had to take a 6+ month trip to Antarctica for part of their work and others that had to share time on a piece of experimental equipment with a whole department — they got a few weeks per year to run their experiment and had to milk that for all it’s worth. Even if they had funding, that machine required large amounts of space and staff to keep it running and they aren’t off the shelf products — only a few exist at large research centers. reply throwaway4aday 1What&#x27;s the value in publishing something that is never replicated? If no one ever reproduces the experiment and gets the same results then you don&#x27;t know if any interpretations based on that experiment are valid. It would also mean that whatever practical applications could have come from the experiment are never realized. It makes the entire pursuit seem completely useless. reply wizofaus 1> What&#x27;s the value in publishing something that is never replicated?Because it presents an experimental result to other scientists that they may consider worth trying to replicate? reply dongping 1Then those unconfirmed results are better put on arxiv, instead of being used to evaluate the performance of scientists. Tenure and grant committees should only consider replicated work. reply geysersam I don&#x27;t agree. A published article should not be taken for Gods Truth no matter if it&#x27;s replicated or peer reviewed.Lots of \"replicated\" \"peer-reviewed\" research have been found to be wrong. That&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s part of the process of discovery.A paper should be taken for what it is: a piece of scientific work, a part of a puzzle. reply geysersam It still has value if we assume the experiment was done by competent honest people who are unlikely to try to fool us on purpose and unlikely do have made errors.It would be even better if it was replicated of course.Depending on what certainty you need you might have to wait for the result of one or several replications, but that is application dependent. reply kshahkshah 1When I looked into this, more than 15 years ago, I thought the difficult portion wasn&#x27;t sharing the recipe, but the ingredients, if you will - granted I was in a molecular biology lab. Effectively the Material Transfer Agreements between Universities all trying to protect their IP made working with each other unbelievably inefficient.You&#x27;d have no idea if you were going down a well trodden path which would yield no success because you have no idea it was well trod. No one publishes negative results, etc. reply boxed 1> I don&#x27;t see how this could ever work, and non-scientists seem to often dramatically underestimate the amount of work it would be to replicate every published paper.I don&#x27;t see how the current system works really either. Fraud is rampant, and replication crisis is the most common state of most fields.Basically the current system is failing at finding out what is true. Which is the entire point. That&#x27;s pretty damn bad. reply tptacek 1Fraud seems rampant because you hear about cases of fraud, but not about the tens of thousands of research labs plugging away day after day. reply lliamander 1I agree that most labs are probably not out to defraud people. But without replication I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to have much confidence in what is published. reply magimas 1replication happens over time. For example, when I did my PhD I wanted to grow TaS2 monolayers on a graphene layer on an Iridium crystal. So I took published growth recipees of related materials, adapted them to our setup and then finetuned the recipee for TaS2. This way I basically \"peer replicated\" the growth of the original paper. I then took those samples to a measurement device and modified the sample in-situ by evaporating Li atoms on top (which was the actual paper but I needed a sample to modify first). I published the paper with the growth recipee and the modification procedure and other colleagues then took those instructions to grow their own samples for their own studies (I think it was MoS2 on Graphene on Cobalt that they grew).This way papers are peer replicated in an emerging manner because the knowledge is passed from one group to another and they use parts of that knowledge to then apply it to their own research. You have to see this from a more holistic picture. Individual papers don&#x27;t mean too much, it&#x27;s their overlap that generates scientific consesus.In contrast, requiring some random reviewer to instead replicate my full paper would be an impossible task. He&#x2F;she would not have the required equipment (because there&#x27;s only 2 lab setups in the whole world with the necessary equipment), he&#x2F;she would probably not have the required knowledge (because mine and his research only partially overlap - e.g. we&#x27;re researching the same materials but I use angle-resolved photoemission experiments and he&#x27;s doing electronic transport) and he&#x2F;she would need to spend weeks first adapting the growth recipee to the point where his sample quality is the same as mine. reply tptacek 1That&#x27;s not what publication is about. Publication is a conversation with other researchers; it is part of the process of reaching the truth, not its endpoint. reply cpach 1People in general (at least on da Internetz) seem to focus way to much on single studies, and way too little on meta-studies.AFAICT meta-studies is the level where we as a society really can try to say something intelligent about how stuff works. If an important question is not included in a meta-study, we (i.e. universities and research labs) probably need to do more research on that topic before we really can say that much about it. reply lliamander 1Sure, and scientists need a place to have such conversations.But publication is not a closed system. The \"published, peer-reviewed paper\" is frequently an artifact used to decide practical policy matters in many institutions both public and private. To the extent that Science (as an institution in its own right) wants to influence policy, that influence needs to be grounded in reproducible results.Also, I would not be surprised if stronger emphasis on reproducibility improved the quality of conversation among scientists. reply vladms 1Maybe replication should (and probably does) happen when the published thing is relevant to some entity and also interesting.I never seen papers as \"truth\", but more as \"possibilities\". After many other \"proofs\" (products, papers, demos, etc.) you can assign some concepts&#x2F;ideas the label \"truth\" but one&#x2F;two papers from the same group is definitely not enough. reply tnecniv Yeah passing peer review doesn’t mean that the article is perfect and to be taken as truth now (and remember, to err is human; any coder on here has had some long standing bug that went mostly unnoticed in their code base). It means it passed the journal’s standards for novelty, interest, and rigor based on the described methods as a retained by the editor &#x2F; area chair and peer reviewers that are selected for being knowledgeable on the topic.Implicit in this process is that the authors are acting in good faith. To treat the authors as hostile is both demoralizing for the reviewers (who wants to be that cynical about their field) and would require extensive verification of each statement well beyond what is required to return the review in a timely manner.Unless your paper has mathematical theory (and mistakes do slip through), a publication should not be taken as proof of something on its own, but a data point. Over time and with enough data points, a field builds evidence to turn a hypothesis into a scientific theory. reply mike_hearn 1Unfortunately there&#x27;s a lot of evidence that fraud really is very prevalent and we don&#x27;t hear about it anywhere near enough. It depends a lot on the field though.One piece of evidence comes from software like GRIM and SPRITE. GRIM was run over psychology papers and found around 50% had impossible means in them (that could not be arrived at by any combination of allowed inputs) [1]. The authors generally did not cooperate to help uncover the sources of the problems.Yet another comes from estimates by editors of well known journals. For example Richard Horton at the Lancet is no stranger to fraud, having published and promoted the Surgisphere paper. He estimates that maybe 50% of medical papers are making untrue claims, which is interesting in that this intuition matches the number obtained in a different field by a more rigorous method. The former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine stated that it was \"no longer possible to believe much of the medical research that is published\".50%+ is a number that crops up frequently in medicine. The famous Ioannidis paper, \"Why most published research findings are false\" (2005) has been cited over 12,000 times.Marc Andreessen has said in an interview that he talked to the head of a very large government grant agency, and asked him whether it could really be true that half of all biomedical research claims were fake? The guy laughed and said no it&#x27;s not true, it&#x27;s more like 90%. [2]Elizabeth Bik uncovers a lot of fraud. Her work is behind the recent resignation of the head of Stanford University for example. Years ago she said, \"Science has a huge problem: 100s (1000s?) of science papers with obvious photoshops that have been reported, but that are all swept under the proverbial rug, with no action or only an author-friendly correction … There are dozens of examples where journals rather accept a clean (better photoshopped?) figure redo than asking the authors for a thorough explanation.\" In reality there seem to be far more than mere thousands, as there are companies that specialize in professionally producing fake scientific papers, and whole markets where they are bought and sold.So you have people who are running the scientific system saying, on the record, that they think science is overrun with fake results. And there is some quantitive data to support this. And it seems to happen quite often now that presidents of entire universities are being caught having engaged in or having signed off on rule breaking behavior, like image manipulation or plagiarism, implying that this behavior is at least rewarded or possibly just very common.There are also whole fields in which the underlying premises are known to be false so arguably that&#x27;s also pretty deceptive (e.g. \"bot studies\"). If you include those then it&#x27;s quite likely indeed that most published research is simply untrue.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peerj.com&#x2F;preprints&#x2F;2064v1&#x2F;[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.richardhanania.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;flying-x-wings-into-the-dea... reply dongping 1While it is a lot of work, I tend to think that one can then always publish preprints if they can&#x27;t wait for the replication. I don&#x27;t understand why a published paper should count as an achievement (against tenure or funding) at all before the work is replicated. The current model just creates perverse incentives to encourage lying, P-hacking, and cherry-picking. This would at least work for fields like machine learning.This is, of course, a naive proposal without too much thought into it. But I was wondering what I would have missed here. reply i_no_can_eat 1and in this proposal, who will be tasked with replicating the work? reply dongping 1In some fields, replication is already the prerequisite to benchmark the SoTA. So the incentives boil down to publishing them along with negative results. Or as some have suggested, make it mandatory for PHD candidates to replicate.Though, it seems that it is possible to game the system, by creating positive&#x2F;negative replication intentionally, to collude with&#x2F;harm the author. reply DoctorOetker 1> [...] non-scientists seem to often dramatically underestimate the amount of work it would be to replicate every published paperEither \"peer reviewed\" articles describe progress of promising results, or they don&#x27;t. If they don&#x27;t the research is effectively ignored (at least until someone finds it promising). So let&#x27;s consider specifically output that described promising results.After \"peer review\" any apparently promising results prompt other groups to build on them by utilizing it as a step or building block.It can take many failed attempts by independent groups before anyone dares publish the absence of the proclaimed observations, since they may try it over multiple times thinking they must have botched it somewhere.On paper it sounds more expensive to require independent replication, but only because the costs of replication attempts are hidden until its typically rather late.Is it really more expensive if the replication attempts are in some sense mandatory?Or is it perhaps more expensive to pretend science has found a one-shot \"peer reviewed\" method, resulting in uncoordinated independent reproduction attempts that may go unannounced before, or even after failed replications?The pseudo-final word, end of line?What about the \"in some sense mandatory\" replication? Perhaps roll provable dice for each article, and in-domain sortition to randomly assign replicators. So every scientist would be spending a certain fraction of their time replicating the research of others. The types of acceptable excuses to derelict these duties should be scrutinized and controlled. But some excuses should be very valid, for example conscientious objection. If you are tasked to reproduce some of Dr. Mengele&#x27;s works, you can cop out on condition that you thoroughly motivate your ethical concerns and objections. This could also bring a lot of healthy criticism to a lot of practices, which is otherwise just ignored an glossed over for fear of future career opportunities. reply chmod600 Please excuse my ignorance, but I&#x27;m not convinced.What are we supposed to do in a hundred years when the scientists of today are dead and we have a bunch of results with important implications that aren&#x27;t documented well enough to replicate? reply iamthemonster My Master&#x27;s thesis was basically taking a purely theoretical paper and \"replicating\" it, by which I mean taking the formulae and just writing the software to run them. It sounds trivial to an outsider but even that was I guess 300 hours of work.In general I think undergraduate projects are a great space to attempt to replicate findings, but it heavily depends on the field. Fundamental physics experiments can be expensive and require equipment that&#x27;s outside the reach of undergrads. But one thing I love about engineering as an academic field, by comparison, is that anything you research tends to be more achievable for others to replicate because as your end goal you are aiming for something that&#x27;s practical in the field. reply throwawaymaths 1> I don&#x27;t see how this could ever work,http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orgsyn.org&#x2F;> All procedures and characterization data in OrgSyn are peer-reviewed and checked for reproducibility in the laboratory of a member of the Board of EditorsNever is a strong word. reply brightball 1> I don&#x27;t see how this could ever work, and non-scientists seem to often dramatically underestimate the amount of work it would be to replicate every published paper.The alternative is a bunch of stuff being published which people belief as \"science\" that doesn&#x27;t hold up under scrutiny, which undermines the reliability of science itself. The current approach simply gives people reason to be skeptical. reply ImPostingOnHN 1I&#x27;m not convinced this proposed alternative is better than the status quo. It&#x27;s simply not feasible, no matter how many benefits one might imagine.the concern about skepticism is not irrelevant, but many of these skeptics also are skeptical of the earth being round, or older than a few thousand years, or not created by an omnipotent skylord, and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s actually a significant concern given the current number and expertise of those who are skepticalso, we can hear their arguments for their skepticism, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the arguments are valid to warrant the skepticism exhibited. And in the end, that&#x27;s what matters: skepticism warranted by valid arguments, not just any Cletus McCletus&#x27;s skepticism of heliocentrism, as if his opinion is equal to that of an astrophysicist (it isn&#x27;t). And you know what? It isn&#x27;t necessary to convince a ditch digger that the earth goes around the sun, if they feel like arguing about it. reply brightball > skeptical of the earth being roundI’m skeptical that these people truly exist outside of the internet wanting it to be true. reply ImPostingOnHN > I’m skeptical that these people truly exist outside of the internet wanting it to be trueI&#x27;m not, just like I&#x27;m not skeptical that climate change denialists truly exist outside of the internetthere&#x27;s simply no valid argument to warrant skepticism of either, given the ease of locating evidence that both do reply brightball Sure there is. Ease of proof.I can walk outside and prove gravity.I can find a million pictures of the earth taken from space, look at a globe and view trade routes that circumnavigate it. I can also look to the sky and see the sun and moon are clearly circular which makes a pretty good case for a pattern.Climate change or the age of the earth are based on a whole lot more interconnected bits of science that even if you studied your entire life you could not truly say that you understand. You’re putting your trust in layers of science that add up to a certain conclusion (which is good). When people are given good reasons to believe that science and peer reviews aren’t always legitimate it undermines that process of trust building on trust.Modern aviation is layer upon layer of science building on each other, but I can easily watch a plane takeoff to validate all of those processes.That’s it in a nutshell. If you can easily replicate it, it’s easy to trust. If you can’t, it’s not…especially when it’s used to drive politics. replyomgwtfbyobbq 1What about a system where peer replication is required if the number of citations exceeds some threshold? reply p1esk 1Who will be replicating it? Why would I want to set aside my own research to replicate some claim someone made? How would this help my career? reply omgwtfbyobbq 1I dunno. Offhand, I guess whoever is citing the work would need to replicate it, but only if it&#x27;s cited sufficiently (overall number of citations, considered foundational, etc...)This could help your career by increasing the probability that the work you&#x27;re citing is more likely accurate, and as a result, your work is also likely more accurate. reply RoyalHenOil A typical paper may cite dozens or hundreds of other papers. This does not sound feasible. It honestly seems like it would worsen the existing problem and force scientists to focus even more on their own original research in isolation from others, to avoid the expense of running myriad replication experiments that they likely don&#x27;t have the funding and personnel to do. reply Knee_Pain 1Academia&#x27;s values are not objective. Why is it that replicating or refuting a study is not seen on par as being a co-author of said study? There is nothing set in stone preventing this, only the current academic culture. reply p1esk 1Because I want to do original research, and be known for doing original research. Only if I fail at that, I might settle for being a guy who reproduces others’ work (which basically means the transition from a researcher to an engineer). reply omgwtfbyobbq 1Whether or not you would be doing original research depends on whether the cited work can be replicated.If the cited work is unable to be replicated, and you try to replicate but get different results, then you would be doing original research, and then you can base further work on your initial original study that came to a different result.On the flip side, if you are able to replicate it, then you are doing extra work initially, but after replicating the work you&#x27;ve cited, the work you&#x27;ve done is more likely to be reproducible by someone else.The amount of citations needed to require replication could itself be a function of how easy it is to replicate work across an entire field.A field where there&#x27;s a high rate of success in replicating work could have a higher threshold for requiring replication compared to a field where it&#x27;s difficult to replicate work. reply Knee_Pain So you want to be known for original results, which cannot be confirmed to be true? So what kind of results are they?Also your mentality is exactly part of the problem: you arrogantly believe that replication work is beneath you and that originality is all that matters. reply vkou If what the parent poster discovers is interesting, and other people consider it to be valuable, they will replicate their results in the process of building on top of it.High-impact work that people care about gets built on, and replicated. Low impact work does not. replybacktoyoujim 1Yes it would indeed mean slowing down and having more scientists.It would mean disruption is no longer a useful tool for human development. reply ebiester 1I don&#x27;t necessarily think it would mean more scientists, but it would mean more expense. You have a moderate number of low impact papers that people are doing for tenure today - papers for the purpose of cranking out papers. We are talking about redirecting efforts but increasing quality of what you have. reply brnaftr361 1It may not be. I would be willing to argue that there was a tipping point and we&#x27;ve long exceeded its boundary - progress and disruption now is just making finding an equilibrium in the future increasingly difficult.So entering into a paradigm where we test the known space - especially presently - would 1) help reduce cruft; 2) abate undersirable forward progress; 3) train the next generation(s) of scientists to be more diligent and better custodians of the domain. reply techas 1Well, you could put incentives to make replication attractive. Give credit for replication. Give money to the researchers doing the replication&#x2F;review. Today we pay an average of 2000€ per article, reviewers get 0€ and the editorial keeps all for putting a pdf online. I would say there is margin there to invest in improving the review process. reply mandmandam 1It&#x27;s wild to me that although we know that it was Ghislaine Maxwell&#x27;s daddy who started this incredibly corrupt system, people hardly mention this fact.The US system, and others, even attack people who dare to try and make science more open. RIP Aaron Swartz, and long live Alexandra Elbakyan. reply indymike 1> This is also all work that doesn&#x27;t benefit the scientists replicating the paper. It only costs them money and time.Maybe this is what needs to change. If we only reward discovery and success, then the incentive is to only produce discovery and success. reply wilde The pressure to replicate would make folks publish things in forms that are easier to replicate. This cost would go down over time. reply coding123 1Maybe doing an experiment twice, even with a cost that is double, makes more sense so that we don&#x27;t all throw away our coffee when coffee is bad, or throw away our gluten when gluten is bad, etc... (those are trivial examples) basically the cost to perform the science in many cases is so minuscule in scale to how it could affect society. reply pvaldes One. Doing experiments is yet enough difficult and painful.Two. This drain of resources can&#x27;t be done for free. Somebody will need to pay twice for half of the research [1], and faster. Peers will need to be hired and paid, maybe by the writer&#x27;s grants. Researchers cant justify to give their own funds to other teams without a profound change in regulation and even in that case would be harming their own projects.[1] as the valuable experts are now stuck validating things instead doing their own jobWould open also a door for foul play. Blocking competitors teams in molasses just trowing them secondary silly problems that they know that are a dead end, while the other team work in the real deal, and take the advantage to win the patent. reply jononomo If it is not replicated it shouldn&#x27;t be published, other than as a provisional draft. I don&#x27;t care if it hurts your feelings. reply matthewdgreen 1The purpose of science publications is to share new results with other scientists, so others can build on or verify the correctness of the work. There has always been an element of “receiving credit” to this, but the communication aspect is what actually matters from the perspective of maximizing scientific progress.In the distant past, publication was an informal process that mostly involved mailing around letters, or for a major result, self-publishing a book. Eventually publishers began to devise formal journals for this purpose, and some of those journals began to receive more submissions than it was feasible to publish or verify just by reputation. Some of the more popular journals hit upon the idea of applying basic editorial standards to reject badly-written papers and obvious spam. Since the journal editors weren’t experts in all fields of science, they asked for volunteers to help with this process. That’s what peer review is.Eventually bureaucrats (inside and largely outside of the scientific community) demanded a technique for measuring the productivity of a scientist, so they could allocate budgets or promotions. They hit on the idea of using publications in a few prestigious journals as a metric, which turned a useful process (sharing results with other scientists) into [from an outsider perspective] a process of receiving “academic points”, where the publication of a result appears to be the end-goal and not just an intermediate point in the validation of a result.Still other outsiders, who misunderstand the entire process, are upset that intermediate results are sometimes incorrect. This confuses them, and they’re angry that the process sometimes assigns “points” to people who they perceive as undeserving. So instead of simply accepting that sharing results widely to maximize the chance of verification is the whole point of the publication process, or coming up with a better set of promotion metrics, they want to gum up the essential sharing process to make it much less efficient and reduce the fan-out degree and rate of publication. This whole mess seems like it could be handled a lot more intelligently. reply sebastos 1Very well put. This is the clearest way of looking at it in my view.I’ll pile on to say that you also have the variable of how the non-scientist public gleans information from the academics. Academia used to be a more insular cadre of people seeking knowledge for its own sake, so this was less relevant. What’s new here is that our society has fixated on the idea that matters of state and administration should be significantly guided by the results and opinions of academia. Our enthusiasm for science-guided policy is a triple whammy, because 1. Knowing that the results of your study have the potential to affect policy creates incentives that may change how the underlying science is performed 2. Knowing that results of academia have outside influence may change WHICH science is performed, and draw in less-than-impartial actors to perform it 3. The outsized potential impact invites the uninformed public to peer into the world of academia and draw half-baked conclusions from results that are still preliminary or unreplicated. Relatively narrow or specious studies can gain a lot of undue traction if their conclusions appear, to the untrained eye, to provide a good bat to hit your opponent with. reply Maxion 1A significant problem we face today is the way research, especially in academia, gets spotlighted in the media. They often hyper-focus on single studies, which can give a skewed representation of scientific progress.The reality is that science isn&#x27;t about isolated findings; it&#x27;s a cumulative effort. One paper might suggest a conclusion, but it&#x27;s the collective weight of multiple studies that provides a more rounded understanding. Media&#x27;s tendency to cherry-pick results often distorts this nuanced process.It&#x27;s also worth noting the trend of prioritizing certain studies, like large RCTs or systematic reviews, while overlooking smaller ones, especially pilot studies. Pilot studies are foundational—they often act as the preliminary research needed before larger studies can even be considered or funded. By sidelining or dismissing these smaller, exploratory studies, we risk undermining the very foundation that bigger, more definitive research efforts are built on. If we consistently ignore or undervalue pilot studies, the bigger and often more impactful studies may never even see the light of day. reply casualscience 1Most of this is very legit, but this> Still other outsiders, who misunderstand the entire process, are upset that intermediate results are sometimes incorrect. This confuses them, and they’re angry that the process sometimes assigns “points” to people who they perceive as undeserving. So instead of simply accepting that sharing results widely to maximize the chance of verification is the whole point of the publication process, or coming up with a better set of promotion metrics, they want to gum up the essential sharing process to make it much less efficient and reduce the fan-out degree and rate of publication.Does not represent my experience in the academy at all. There is a ton of gamesmanship in publishing. That is ultimately the yardstick academics are measured against, whether we like it or not. No one misunderstands that IMO, the issue is that it&#x27;s a poor incentive. I think creating a new class of publication, one that requires replication, could be workable in some fields (e.g. optics&#x2F;photonics), but probably is totally impossible in others (e.g. experimental particle physics).For purely intellectual fields like mathematics, theoretical physics, philosophy, you probably don&#x27;t need this at all. Then there are &#x27;in the middle fields&#x27; like machine learning which in theory would be easy to replicate, but also would be prohibitively expensive for, e.g. baseline training of LLMs. reply Maxion 1And on the extreme end you have the multi-decade longitudinal studies in epidemiology &#x2F; biomedicine that would be more-or-less impossible to replicate. reply tnecniv I remember reading that some epidemiologists saw the wealth of new data from CoVID as a silver lining because of how few events there are at that scale. Apparently it’s not uncommon to still use the Spanish Flu data which is spotty at best because it might be the only thing available at the scale you’re interested in reply nine_k 1For sharing results widely, there&#x27;s arxiv. The problem is that the fanout is now overwhelming.The public perception of a publication in a prestigious journal as the established truth does not help, too. reply isaacremuant 1> The public perception of a publication in a prestigious journal as the established truth does not help, too.it&#x27;s not so much the public perception but what govs&#x2F;media&#x2F;tech and other institutions have pushed down so that the public doesn&#x27;t question whatever resulting policy they&#x27;re trying to put forth.\"Trust the science\" means \"Thou shalt not question us, simply obey\".Anyone with eyes who has worked in institutions knows that bureocracy, careerism and corruption are intrinsic to them. reply dmbche 1Your analysis seems to portray all scientists as pure hearted. May I remind you of the latest Stanford scandal where the president of Stanford was found to have manipulated data?Today, publications do not serve the same purpose as they did before the internet. It is trivial today to write a convincing paper without research and getting that published(www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;new-sokal-hoax&#x2F;572212&#x2F;&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjnp5mRtsiAAxVwF1kFHesBDC8QFnoECAkQAg&usg=AOvVaw0t_Bo31BrT5D9zHBdmNAqi). reply matthewdgreen 1No subset of humanity is “pure hearted.” Fraud and malice will exist in everything people do. Fortunately these fraudulent incidents seem relatively rare, when one compares the number of reported incidents to the number of publications and scientists. But this doesn’t change anything. The benefit of scientific publication is to make it easier to detect and verify incorrect results, which is exactly what happened in this case.I understand that it’s frustrating it didn’t happen instantly. And I also understand that it’s deeply frustrating that some undeserving person accumulated status points with non-scientists based on fraud, and that let them take a high-status position outside of their field. (I think maybe you should assign some blame to the Stanford Trustees for this, but that’s up to you.) None of this means we’d be better off making publication more difficult: it means the metrics are bad.PS When a TFA raises something like “the replication crisis” and then entangles it with accusations of deliberate fraud (high profile but exceedingly rare) it’s like trying to have a serious conversation about automobile accidents, but spending half the conversation on a handful of rare incidents of intentional vehicular homicide. You’re not going to get useful solutions out of this conversation, because it’s (perhaps deliberately) misunderstanding the impact and causes of the problem. reply dmbche 1For your analogy on car accidents - a notable difference between both is that in the case of car accidents, we are able to get numbers on when, how and why they happen and then make conclusions from that.In this case, we are not even aware of most events of fraud&#x2F;\"bad papers\"&#x2F;manipulation - the \"crisis\" is that we are losing faith in the science we are doing - results that were cornerstones of entire fields are found to be nonreproducible, making all the work built on top of it pointless.(psychology, cancer, economics, etc - I&#x27;m being very broad)At this point, we don&#x27;t know how deep the rot goes. We are at the point of recognizing that it&#x27;s real, and looking for solutions. For car accidents, we&#x27;re past that - we&#x27;re just arguing about what are the best solutions. For the replication crisis, we&#x27;re trying to find a way forward.Like that scene in The Thing, where they test the blood? We&#x27;re at the point where we don&#x27;t know who to trust.Ps: what&#x27;s a tfa? reply mike_hearn 1Fraud isn&#x27;t exceedingly rare :( It only seems that way because academia doesn&#x27;t pay anyone to find it, reacts to volunteer reports by ignoring it, and the media generally isn&#x27;t interested.Fraud is so frequent and easy to find that there are volunteers who in their spare time manage to routinely uncover not just individual instances of fraud but entire companies whose sole purpose is to generate and sell fake papers on an industrial scale.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-023-01780-wFraud is so easy and common that there are a steady stream of journals which publish entire editions consisting of nothing but AI generated articles!https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-021-03035-yDespite being written as a joke over a decade ago, you can page through an endless stream of papers that were generated by SciGen - a Perl script - and yet they are getting published:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubpeer.com&#x2F;search?q=scigenThe problem is so prevalent that some people created the Problematic Paper Screener, a tool that automatically locates articles that contain text indicative of auto-generation.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dbrech.irit.fr&#x2F;pls&#x2F;apex&#x2F;f?p=9999:1::::::This is all pre-ChatGPT, and is just the researchers who can&#x27;t be bothered writing a paper at all. The more serious problem is all the human written fraudulent papers with bad data and bad methodologies that are never detected, or only detected by randos with blogs or Twitter accounts that you never hear around. reply matthewdgreen The wonderful thing about the western world is that most countries value freedom of the press. The dark side of this is that you can spin up your own “scientific journal” and charge people to publish in it, game the rankings like any common SEO scam, and nobody will stop you because (especially here in the US) you’re exercising your first amendment rights. Then people can fill it with nonsense and even script-generated fake papers. People outside the scientific community can also scam more “legitimate” for-profit journals in various ways, resulting in more silly publications that the actual scientific community has to filter out. It’s very annoying.None of this has any more bearing on fraud by professional scientists than, say, the existence of some garbage-filled Wikimedia server or a badly-edited Wikipedia page means that the Wikipedia editors themselves are fraudsters. reply mike_hearn With respect, I think you should research the topic more deeply before assuming that this is some sort of fringe problem that doesn&#x27;t exist in the \"actual\" scientific community. The second link I provided is by Nature News and states specifically that the problem affects \"prestigious journals\" (their words).Auto-generated papers have been published in journals from the IEEE, Elsevier, Springer Nature and other well known publishing houses. These papers have supposedly passed peer review in western journals that have been around for decades, and have been signed off by professional academics. Invariably no satisfactory explanation for how this happens is provided, with \"we got hacked\" being a remarkably common claim. Quite how you publish an entire magazine full of fraudulent articles due to one person getting hacked is unclear; actual newspapers and magazines don&#x27;t ever have this problem.Here&#x27;s an example. The Springer Nature journal \"Personal and Ubiquitous Computing\" was established in 1997 and has its own Wikipedia page:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Personal_and_Ubiquitous_Comput...The Editor-In-Chief is a British academic, who also has his own Wikipedia page. So these aren&#x27;t fly-by-night no-brand nobodies. Yet this journal somehow managed to publish dozens of obviously auto-generated papers, like this one:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static-content.springer.com&#x2F;esm&#x2F;art%3A10.1007%2Fs007...\"The conversion of traditional arts and crafts to modern art design under the background of 5G mobile communication network\"orhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;static-content.springer.com&#x2F;esm&#x2F;art%3A10.1007%2Fs007...\"The application of twin network target tracking and support tensor machine in the evaluation of orienteering teaching\"The papers are just template paragraphs from totally unrelated topics spliced together. Nobody noticed this had happened until months after publication, strongly implying that this journal has no readers at all (this is a common theme in all these stories, they never seem to notice themselves). The editor agreed the papers were nonsense (his words), but blamed peer reviewers. Yet this journal claims to have a large editorial board with over 40 people on it, mostly from universities in the Europe, USA and China.What&#x27;s amazing is that this exact same \"attack\" had happened before. The previous year Springer Nature had to retract over 400 papers which were auto-generated in the exact same way. They learned nothing and appear to treat the problem as a similar level of severity to filtering email spam.And in the last six months alone we&#x27;ve seen major fraud scandals impacting Stanford (the President no less), Harvard and Yale. These are supposedly elite universities and researchers. Francesca Gino was earning over $1M a year. Yet their fraud is being uncovered by motivated volunteers, not any kind of systematic well funded science police.So all the signs here point towards fraud being incredibly easy to get away with. Whole journals have literally no readers at all, academia relies on Scooby-Doo levels of policing, and supposedly prestigious brands are constantly having fraud uncovered by random tweeters, undergrads doing journalism as a hobby etc. reply jltsiren 25 As far as research is concerned, the names you mentioned are not prestigious brands. Universities are organizations that provide facilities and services in exchange for their share of grant money. Publishers publish whatever people are willing to pay for. Prominent mentions of supposedly prestigious institutions are a red flag in science reporting. Very often, either the writer is trying to promote something, or they don&#x27;t know what they are talking about.There are two parallel academias. There is the reputable high-trust one, where it&#x27;s easy to get away with fraud, because people generally don&#x27;t commit it.

Memoir JULY 12, 2023 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn LANA HALL Lana Hall is a Toronto-based journalist with a particular interest in urban affairs. Her work has been published—or is forthcoming in—The Globe and... Zoë Van Dijk I’ll tell you a secret about working in a massage parlour: it’s a lot of waiting around, usually late at night. We’d wait, half a dozen of us, in the dressing room as the evening wore on. On edge and exhausted in equal parts, we perched on the low-slung couch, adjusted the straps of our babydolls, listlessly fluffed our hair, ready to spring into action. Girl, I’m going insane. Oh please, I’m already there. Then, we’d hear the front door open, the low murmur of a man’s voice, the chirp of the receptionist from the parlour’s reception desk. Some of us would circle the dressing room door, ready in case he wanted to see the lineup, curious if he had booked someone specific. Then, the methodical thwack of the receptionist’s pumps would sound down the long hallway as the girls swivelled towards her from their respective stations—pulling towels from the dryer, applying lipstick at the vanity, melting into the couch in a cloud of cigarettes and Pink Sugar perfume. The receptionist would thrust four twenty-dollar bills into someone’s hand; maybe mine, maybe not. “You’re up. Sixty minutes in room four.” For the rest of the girls, the night wore on, dark and still. Honestly, that’s most of working in a massage parlour: waiting around, wondering how much money you will—or won’t— make on any given shift. I know because I made my living that way for five years. * I was a university dropout in my early twenties when I started that gig, struggling to find my place in Toronto, a city where squalor and decadence collided behind the glass and steel of the downtown skyline. To get by, I took a job at a massage parlour in the northwest corner of the city, a place where factories stretched several blocks, separated by the odd strip mall full of nail salons, carpet dealers, banquet halls that morphed into after-hours clubs if you knew the right people. The garish yellow “M” of McDonald’s arched high over everything, like a gateway to another world. Because of the way Toronto zoning bylaws work, most body rub parlours are relegated to this part of the city, and after dark, “massage” signs wink and flash from almost every corner. Finch Alley, some people call it. My regular shift at the parlour ran from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m., and I worked anywhere between three and six shifts a week, depending on how the cash was flowing. It was a job that was unbearably tangible at times, an onslaught of surgical scars and sun-damaged chests I rubbed oil over, the soft pallor of flesh under my hands that rarely saw the light of day. Yet it was also predicated on a precariously suspended reality, one I had to maintain with absolute precision to do my job well, to pretend that a profound mutual desire could be found for the low, low price of $80 in a strip mall off a freeway. In real life I wouldn’t dare be so giving. I can’t say I was particularly good at any of this by the time 2 a.m. rolled around, makeup melting off my face, puffiness blooming under my eyes, a rapidly dwindling patience for the reassurance some men desperately sought: So, how was it for you? The rabbit warren of hallways and thinly-walled rooms felt insular at that hour, the click of stilettos on laminate less urgent than during the day. A dampness I always associated with the night shift hung in the air, mingling with the smell of smoke and coconut air freshener. Night shift did not discriminate, and the men who wandered in after dark were as varied as they come: they were travelling on business or headed home from factory shifts, students taking a break from all-nighters, bros on their way back from the bar. They were tall and short and young and old, of every race and cultural background imaginable. You could never predict who would come in, except to say with certainty that they would want a level of womanly validation I was simply too tired to give. Half-dressed and exhausted, I often didn’t have the patience for their hands on me, the array of intimate requests they crept in seeking—touch me, kiss me, make me an entirely different world than the one outside these doors—when all I craved was the privacy of my own bed. My world outside the parlour was small—just a ground floor apartment in midtown Toronto that overlooked an alley, while a radiator clanked and hissed at all hours of the night and day. But it was a place where my thoughts, and my body, were my own. Despite the demands of the job, there was a stillness to the nights I found alluring. There was a poise to the velvety darkness of parking lots, the soft buzz of neon lights shaped like palm trees, as if they were also waiting at attention for the inevitable flurry of activity that punctuated those long periods of quiet. People’s needs at 2 a.m. are equal parts fervent and fundamental, somehow stripped of all pretense by the cover of darkness. What do you need if you’re out seeking services at night? Food, sex, shelter. The staunch of a wound. Being part of that felt like a reprieve from the day’s complexities, a world which launched a steady barrage of information and demanded endless analyses, caring little for our overstimulated brains. The days were full of subway delays and deferred student loan payments, of agonizing small talk and headlines about inflation. At night we’re just animals, I was reminded. The clients, yes, seeking release they couldn’t admit during daylight hours, but also the workers who manned the various portions of the strip mall after dark. The way we cared for each other, sometimes more in silent gestures than anything else, felt connected to our deepest instincts as pack animals. No matter how much I wanted to go home, there was some comfort in the simplicity of that connection. * Memory has a way of smoothing jagged edges, leaving us with a haze of nostalgia that overlooks the most painful parts of our past lives, so I can’t be sure how much I really miss the nights themselves and how much my brain is playing tricks on me. It defies logic that any part of me longs for the precarious earnings and long hours of massage parlour work, the exhaustive level of physical and emotional intimacy required, the shame that grew exponentially the farther away I slipped from what was once a promising journalism career. I do, however, know I miss the community it gave me membership to, the pack we inadvertently travelled in. I miss the silent language we developed, the way nothing was asked of me by other night shift workers, the sense that I was enough just by showing up. Cab drivers—who are also paid in cash and depend on volume for their livelihood—would pick me up at the end of shift and commiserate, rosary beads swinging from their rearview mirrors as we pulled onto dark freeways. How was work? Busy? They would ask. No, not really, I would say. You? As the cab whizzed down an eerily empty Gardiner Expressway, we’d laugh, try to unpack what made a slow shift or a busy one, what made people need us—or not. A dearth of sports games. The end of the month. Tax refund season. Inertia. Once, a cab broke down in a snowstorm on the highway while taking me home and the driver immediately phoned his friend, another driver, and gently walked me over to his cab, parked farther down the highway when it arrived. Snow hurled sideways at us, my driver’s tie flapping in the squall, his bare forearms braced against the cold. Get home safe, he told me, please. Women filled my Styrofoam cup at the twenty-four-seven coffee shop across the street from the parlour, glancing wordlessly at the strip of bare skin between my coat and the tops of my stockings, but still making sure my cup was full to the top, passing me extra packets of sugar, sometimes a muffin from the day-old basket. Kids in their early twenties manned the counter at all-night fast-food joints, where I’d go between clients on slow shifts, needing something to wake up my neurons: salt, heat, grease. The shock of cold air on my legs at midnight. We knew so little about each other’s lives—how could we?—but forced into this strange cohort of ragged work hours, I felt we sometimes shared a look of recognition: of people whittling time away as we tended to the incessant hungers of others. * When I finally did leave the sex trade after finishing my bachelor’s degree as a mature student, I spent seven years working in “good” jobs in the corporate sector. This meant, as I understood it, that I didn’t work nights, that I was a salaried employee, and that I had dental benefits. I had a shiny access card that opened doors—to a gleaming, marble elevator bank, to planters full of plastic ferns, to blocks of cubicles illuminated by fluorescent lighting, a land of perpetual daytime. Unlike sex work, my “good” jobs didn’t threaten to overthrow traditional power structures. Many sex workers, including myself, have long hypothesized that the reason so many people in power work to keep the commercial sex trade marginalized is because they’re threatened by it—by the idea that it’s the only field where women outearn men, that it’s an industry where women get to call the shots, and that women profit off something that men have been told they’re entitled to for free: sex and attention in equal parts. In my experience of the corporate landscape, there was none of this radical power structure, only an upholding of the traditional: men talking and women listening, men in powerful positions getting both credit and profit for the labour of women beneath them. Is this what I worked so hard for? I wondered daily. As I moved through this new world, merging into the throng of daytime professionals that swelled throughout the downtown core, absorbed by their smartphone screens, and proffering the barest morsels of small talk, I felt little of the camaraderie I once did while working night shifts. I’m unsure why I felt this dissonance, and it occurs to me now that it could have been more self-imposed than anything. Perhaps my experience in the parlours of Finch Alley felt so removed from what I perceived as the experience of my corporate colleagues and their “good life choices” that I created that distance myself, imposter syndrome as thick as the steam that rose from the downtown subway grates during the winter. When I was assigned a crisis communications task, which was often part of my job, I would try to cheer myself up by silently joking that after everything, my livelihood somehow still depended on men employing bad judgement. But there was nobody around who would understand, so the joke fell flat, even in my head. Sometimes when I headed home from the office, stuffed onto a packed streetcar, I remembered nights when our strip mall felt like a kingdom, where we scurried from block to block like savvy woodland creatures, coats zipped over our lingerie, faces alight under the weak yellow streetlamps, dispatching coffee orders or supplies from clerks at the late-night convenience stores. Condoms. Baby oil. Hot Cheetos. “We know where she works,” their faces said, but it felt less like a judgement and more like an acknowledgement. We were in it together; an ecosystem of tending to each other’s needs, brazen and intimate at the same time. Once I sat on the leather couch in the dressing room, which was just an extension built onto the massage parlour that housed an industrial-sized washer and dryer, a makeup table, and a precarious utility shelf crammed with supplies: towels, mineral oil, rubbing alcohol, Kleenex. Nursing a black tea, I steeled myself before my last appointment of the night. It was booked as an hour-long shower session, which I hated. Sixty minutes with a regular who would never say a word to me, who just wanted to touch my breasts as we slowly turned to prunes under the tepid water, while I tried to make each stifled yawn look like it was, in fact, a shiver of ecstasy. “I don’t know if I can make it,” I said, half joking but half imploring the five other girls who sat wedged on the couch with me, or sprawled on threadbare Ikea chairs. “Baby, come sit by me,” said Cheryl, an attendant from Newfoundland in her early fifties with sun-crinkled skin the colour of almonds and a voice like gravel. I plodded over to where she sat at the makeup table and pulled up a stool. “At least let me fix your hair,” she said. I complied. Cheryl brushed my hair extensions out with her fingers, acrylic nails flashing, pink as Malibu. Then she took out a wide-barrel curling iron and meticulously worked my unruly hair into waves, smiling and humming periodically at her handiwork. “There,” she said when she was finished. “So pretty.” I felt so much care in that moment I could barely breathe, and it occurred to me that I’d never had a woman, before or since, handle my hair so tenderly. Once, the fire alarm went off in the office tower where I worked downtown. We crammed into the stairwell, lurching down dozens of flights. It was the most unscripted moment I had encountered since starting that office job and for a moment I marvelled at the chaos of it all: the unvarnished panic and confusion on people’s faces, the small gesture of kindness when I dropped my elevator card and someone picked it up for me. Maybe this is it, I thought. Maybe this is when the adrenaline and uncertainty give way to something more human, where we seek relief in collective company. Maybe we’ll all go out for a drink and watch the fire trucks tend to the real emergency. But when the final door banged open on ground level, spitting us out into the alley behind a steakhouse, everyone dispersed in separate directions, scattering as far as the eye could see. * Last year, New York mayor Eric Adams was quoted referring to cooks, fast-food workers, dishwashers and messengers as “low-skill workers,” proclaiming they simply don’t have the skills to “sit in a corner office.” Like Toronto, New York relies on a variety of minimum wage and night shift workers to keep its culture “vibrant”—a term often used in city-building and real estate circles—or at least convenient. In fact, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than fifteen million Americans work night shifts. In Canada, it’s closer to 1.8 million, or 12 percent of the working population. Could not a single one of those people have the “skills” to work in a corner office? When I read Adams’ quote, I was back, for the briefest of seconds, in that dark parking lot under a red-lit “massage” sign, watching the outline of a coffee shop server across the street as she wiped down the midnight counter, over and over. I thought of her thankless work and the comfort she provided to so many people moving through that transient space, the way she may have wanted to do something—anything—else with her time, but perhaps was not afforded the opportunity to. What a world in which her labour went unvalued, perhaps unnoticed altogether. Adams’ comments ricocheted through social media for months, at one point resulting in a tweet about how most corner office professionals wouldn’t be able to handle even one overnight shift at Waffle House. But Adams isn’t alone in his simplistic view; many of the jobs that require overnight shifts are considered “low skill” roles by those in power, regardless of how essential they might be. How quickly the discourse moves from “frontline workers” to “low-skilled labourers” as soon as the concepts of unions or minimum wage increase make an appearance. This idea of night shift jobs being less desirable, work people do because they “have to,” not because they want to, is true sometimes. It was obvious to me that many in my night shift network were working gigs as a stopgap on the way to something else, but to me that never made any of us less deserving. In reality, I thought of us as some of the strongest, the most resourceful, the most skilled at defusing confrontations that often come with late-night interactions. “You’re better than this job,” clients sometimes said to me while I was working nights. Often they’d say it in the awkward and delicate moments immediately after a session, as we towelled off together and I stripped the massage table—moments where men were often fraught with shame, resignation, and satiation in equal parts, and words tumbled clumsily from their mouths. They meant it as a compliment, but it was a sentiment I hated. You’re better than this. As though somewhere, there was a woman who wasn’t. I’ve seen security guards diffuse a knife fight. I once watched a fast-food server placate a violent customer with nothing more than her voice and a stale honey cruller at her disposal. I’ve met few professionals since who I think could handle those wearying hours and even fewer who could still react with tact and effectiveness under pressure, especially considering the low, precarious wages these gigs often pay. Plus, there’s a danger to working jobs with these hours and demands on a long-term basis. Statistics have long shown that people who work night shifts are more likely to battle stress, illness, even premature death. Whether those late-night needs—for food, for sex—are real or perceived, as long as there’s a demand, profit-driven businesses will want to capitalize on it, perhaps at the very expense of the workers who take those shifts. The price we pay to keep cities thrumming and hungers satiated at all hours of the night and day is steep. * It’s been years since I held a job requiring those kinds of late-night shifts. I woke recently at exactly 2 a.m., as I often do, pulled from slumber by some unnameable cue. I poured a glass of water and stood at my apartment window, suspended high above a ribbon of expressway. From behind the glass, everything was hushed at that hour. Then I reminded myself that an entire ecosystem still hums and clanks and keeps the world stitched together quietly: the municipal salt truck scattering brine down the street. The yellow sign of the twenty-four-seven grocery down the block advertising milk, bread, cigarettes. The wink of a red taillight as it trails across the expressway and flashes out of sight. I can’t, of course, know who it might be; perhaps another aimless man not ready to go home yet, rootless and restless and looking for validation in all the wrong places; perhaps another night shift worker on her way home, forming an unspoken understanding with her cab driver. Sometimes I think I have nothing to show for those years spent tending to people’s needs after hours, a period of my life as brief and transient as the red glow of that receding taillight. But I know the stories of the city after dark, and I keep those with me, always.

Yes she’s talking about her perceptions born from her clients and years worked. That’s an absolute right for all of us, right? To simply relate the experiences we’ve had.She’s definitely seen a side of humanity that, while seen by many, doesn’t quite often get public visibility-sunlight. And lo and behold, it’s a kind of grungy crudeness-but still human and shared.Personally, I’ve worked in retail and in corporate in major casinos. People will assume they’re better than you and treat you as something like a servant simply because you’re the one taking their money for a thing. Or just because you “work here” as was the case in both retail and casino. That dynamic even exists in organizations between divisions and teams within the same organization. Ask yourself how that would change in the authors situation?I don’t have a thesis. May this serve as a good reminder to treat all people with decency and an amount of respect if not kindness. There’s exactly one right way to treat a person, as a person-an end unto his&#x2F;it&#x2F;herself. reply iamnotsure No disrespect, but I am not sure if casinos are in the business of helping mankind. Therefore, it is not only the casino clients that behave badly. The fact that money changes hands means nothing. reply beebmam Humans have some deeply self-destructive tendencies. It&#x27;s not just a predator&#x2F;prey or an oppressor&#x2F;oppressed relationship. I&#x27;m not sure that if we ban all outlets for self-destructive behavior that something good will come of it. Offering some amount of consentual self-destruction is absolutely in the business of helping mankind, in my opinion. reply chongli Humans evolved over millions of years in an environment without casinos, addictive drugs, fast food, or any of this other stuff surrounding us in modernity. The fact that a bunch of these things hack into people’s natural blind spots is not evidence of “self-destructive tendencies.” These are exploits of people’s psychology, every bit as bad as fraud, but run by powerful, politically entrenched people.These are extremely toxic and antisocial industries and they make society much worse off. reply sparrowInHand Im gonna jump on that mamoth with a spear- watch me, and if you want steak worship me. reply wiseowise Ludomania is not “outlet for self-destructive behavior” it’s a decease. Those parasites should be highly moderated, at the very least. reply throwaway22044 >Offering some amount of consentual self-destruction is absolutely in the business of helping mankind,Prostitution, substance abuse, suicide, and other self-destructive acts, are the only measure that is available to us for enforcing that Leviathan keeps its end of the social contract: that our bodies and minds are first and foremost our own, and only when we infringe on others&#x27; freedom may ours be curtailed.The day one becomes unable to destroy oneself is is the day freedom becomes permanently unattainable. reply vacuity Suicide is an expression of one&#x27;s ultimate freedom to one&#x27;s body, but these acts can have consequences beyond oneself. That goes from \"oh well, it&#x27;s your choice\" to \"don&#x27;t drag other people down with you\". What of a child born from a prostitute? What of others&#x27; safety when driving drunk? What of friends and family who expend mental energy and money? Cut yourself away absolutely or not at all, or perhaps in a more measured action, but don&#x27;t just sink the ship and not care of the people scrambling for safety. reply askonomm Yeah, that&#x27;s something a rational person should do. Self destruction hardly ever is rational however, and it&#x27;s near impossible to see all of the collateral damage you make when destroying yourself. reply mensetmanusman In my opinion, humanity would be better off fighting our self destructive tendencies instead of letting those with power take advantage of their situation and squeezing the ignorant dry. reply dotnet00 Fighting them means offering less destructive ways to release those urges, and for the vast majority of people, that&#x27;s what casinos are.If we&#x27;re talking about destructive urges, another popular one would be alcohol, and yet we have many many examples of how it needs to be accessible to an extent to serve as a release, even if sometimes it still causes serious damage. reply Kiro What are those examples? reply dotnet00 In the US, famously the prohibition era, and there are similar cases all over the world, eg cases in Iran of people getting ethanol poisoning from homebrewed alcohol, and very common similar occurances in various states of India, where the government sometimes spuriously decides to temporarily ban alcohol consumption.Put differently, the societal cost of outright banning some self-destructive things ends up being higher than just regulating them because a ban doesn&#x27;t actually stop much.We even seem to be heading towards a similar realization for many drugs (eg Marijuana). replylmm > I don’t see the negatives other commenters are pointing out. Yes she’s talking about her perceptions born from her clients and years worked. That’s an absolute right for all of us, right? To simply relate the experiences we’ve had.She&#x27;s not \"simply relating experiences\" though. She goes beyond that, turning them into a general sociopolitical claim:> Unlike sex work, my “good” jobs didn’t threaten to overthrow traditional power structures. Many sex workers, including myself, have long hypothesized that the reason so many people in power work to keep the commercial sex trade marginalized is because they’re threatened by it—by the idea that it’s the only field where women outearn men, that it’s an industry where women get to call the shots, and that women profit off something that men have been told they’re entitled to for free: sex and attention in equal parts. reply raincole Have men been told they&#x27;re entitled to sex and attention for free tho? I kinda feel it&#x27;s the exact opposite. Men are told they need to pay for meals, rooms, travel, and housing and custody later. Men are told they should be the proactive side and take the risk of being rejected. I&#x27;d even say (at least in TV shows and movies) men are expected to be the funny ones and provide entertaining values in a relationship.I&#x27;m not saying that intrinsitically wrong or right. I just like to know in which culture men are told these. reply mise_en_place I think this is accurate. Men are often ridiculed for thinking they are entitled anything. But especially so for sex and female attention. reply ianai It’s all accurate and inaccurate because people are all very different and come to different positions differently. Some believe they can “sin” under the cover of night and still keep their comfortable places in society as their sins weren’t seen nor known. Secrets and all that. Imagine how such a person would treat a sex worker. Could be very starkly different than what they’d expose the rest of the time.You’ll notice I’m not working in absolutes here. She may have, but working the night she saw things that led her to draw certain conclusions from the things she saw and experienced.I’d venture that she would be able to admit her experiences weren’t the end all be all of humanity though. But still very informative of the people in that space.Edit-In my experience, whether someone is told explicitly that they can exploit another or not is irrelevant. The exploitive figure that out on their own often enough. reply imtringued 53 She only has experience with customers who seek her out though.What about the type of men who would never ask for her services? She knows nothing about them. reply dullcrisp You’re saying that like you disagree reply scns > Men are told they should be the proactive side and take the risk of being rejected.Walking up to a woman takes courage, which is a desirable quality. Why should a woman wan&#x27;t a man, that lacks the balls to talk to her? The mating dance of many species has rules they have to follow. Complaining about them does zero for your dating success. The female decides if his display is good enough for her.The App Bumble has women message first and it is strange for them. reply srean 45 The point that the OP was speaking to (refuting) is that men expect favors for free. OP&#x27;s point is that they are not free at all and earned by subjecting oneself to risk and absorbing the adverse consequences of taking that risk. reply bell-cot 8 hours ago[flagged]| next [6 more] > Have men been told they&#x27;re entitled...Well...it is nice that you seem unaware of Andrew Tate, and the millions of boys and men who are eager followers of him and similar creeps... reply lmm I&#x27;ve literally only ever seen him mentioned for the sake of ridiculing him. I&#x27;m sure some followers of him exist just as I&#x27;m sure some neo-nazis exist, but is it anything other than a tiny fringe of irrelevant weirdos? reply gzer0 Interestingly enough, I had assumed the same thing. That, it was perhaps some cult-like very limited and extremist following limited to a select few.My eyes were opened when I visited the Toronto area recently. From my (limited) anecdotal experience, there seems to be a fervent, messiah like following of Tate and the things he says. It was so bizarre to me.P.S. not saying anything bad about Toronto! Just that it was my experience there. Please take things you read on the internet with a (bucket) of salt, and healthy skepticism! reply lll-o-lll No, he seems to have been able to effectively hack the social media algorithms and make himself an extremely prevalent voice. The mind virus definitely spread and touched millions, if not 10s of millions.Young men are desperate for men they can look up to, to emulate. Rich, exciting, powerful, desired; this was Andrew Tate the image. Of course he was going to be popular! Mainstream media and the chattering classes are utterly powerless against this, we must elevate men of integrity so that young men do not throw their lives away. Black men, rich white men, Jordan Peterson if he cuts through, but men with integrity. Deconstruct society too much and you will just be left with the swirling entropy of nothingness. Socrates understood this, and we are fools to forget. reply flangola7 His YouTube channel alone had millions of subscribers. reply imtringued 51 The only thing I know about Andrew Tate is from this video (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=93i7xJDgUxQ) and I have come to the conclusion that he is hardly a person to aspire to. reply XorNot > Have men been told they&#x27;re entitled to sex and attention for free tho? I kinda feel it&#x27;s the exact opposite. Men are told they need to pay for meals, rooms, travel, and housing and custody later. Men are told they should be the proactive side and take the risk of being rejected. I&#x27;d even say (at least in TV shows and movies) men are expected to be the funny ones and provide entertaining values in a relationship.Do you think in providing those things, men then become entitled to sex or attention?Which is to say you&#x27;ve listed a large number of material things, or fictional things (TV sitcoms have never been reality, but boy did they do a lot of damage to millenials), absent one core element: actually being a pleasant person. Or providing emotional support. Or empathy (I also note that excluded is \"be attractive to the other person in some way\").Basically: your list entirely excludes the right of the other person to...be a person. To have any independent agency or preferences. reply blq10 The list of things the commenter you&#x27;re replying to brought up, in addition to \"be attractive\", is table stakes for receiving an iota of romantic attention from women.We talk a ton about unrealistic beauty standards, \"men talking, women listening\", etc - but I have to wonder, maybe the world where women marry people one income decide above them is almost guaranteed to be a world where men are just more competitive in the workplace, even at the expense of running over their female colleagues. The incentives curve says that to expect anything at all of women, you have to be successful, ideally wealthy. So, you get the behavior the incentives curve tells people to enact.An incentives curve that is set, ironically, by women reply johnny22 > The list of things the commenter you&#x27;re replying to brought up, in addition to \"be attractive\", is table stakes for receiving an iota of romantic attention from women.that&#x27;s not true though. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not great to be \"ugly\" (for some definition of the word) but you don&#x27;t have to attractive. Heck, you can even be pretty poor, but as long as you you&#x27;re a decent person to be around, it&#x27;s not that hard. reply raincole Please read my comment in context. I was responding to this quote from the article:> it’s an industry where women get to call the shots, and that women profit off something that men have been told they’re entitled to for free: sex and attention in equal parts.The article says for free. It doesn&#x27;t say \"for just being an attractive guy\" or \"for just being a nice person\". For FREE. That&#x27;s what the article says, not my word.Also your comment is just appending more things to the list of things that men are expected to do... reply trealira I have to admit I&#x27;m a bit tired and don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re going with this. They&#x27;re not saying that making the first move entitles one to sex; they&#x27;re saying the standards are higher for men.I do think that there are a lot of men who feel bitter that they&#x27;ll never have sex with a woman, but I don&#x27;t think anything in mainstream society condones such feelings. It&#x27;s more of a subculture of lonely men turning misogynistic. reply XorNot The article on question here is literally about prostitution. Sex can be bought for resources, people are selling it - the world&#x27;s oldest profession.It is also cheap.So the notion that the problem is \"men who will never have sex\" is fairly obviously false. reply wiseowise When people say they’ll “never have sex”, it means they’ll never have sex with a romantic partner that wants them as much they do. reply strken The \"for free\" part is what I disagree with because it&#x27;s almost totally the opposite of what I&#x27;ve seen.Men are taught that their work is valuable but they are not; they feel entitled after putting in work, even if it&#x27;s work that nobody asked for, like going to the gym a lot or chatting up strangers at bus stops. No, they&#x27;re not actually entitled to sex and attention, but the entire problem is that men feel like they paid and should therefore receive. \"Free\" is a complete reversal of the thought process of the entitled man. reply imtringued 13 Your comment is complete nonsense.Men go to the gym for themselves and secondarily, because it raises their attractiveness and confidence in front of everyone, not just women. They chat up strangers at bus stops, because dating is a literal lottery for the guy. reply BlargMcLarg >men feel like they paid and should therefore receiveWay to simplify something very complex. What do you expect men to do, quit trying everything and leave it up to fate? Keep up with women&#x27;s magazines changing their minds by the day and chasing trends to get women to buy things they don&#x27;t need? Accept the tax of women casually demanding 100+ bucks a date just to have a chance? Wait for them to socially atomize themselves even further to the point of &#x27;maybe you should pick hobbies with more women instead of your own circles filled with men&#x27;? Oh wait, that last one also has the caveat of &#x27;if you do it just to meet women, you are a creep&#x27;.About everything in the world, people have expectations for putting in effort and others root for their success. This is the one topic society has gone nuts about chastising men, while both encouraging women to demand more and encouraging the same aggressive approach. Even just saying>nobody asked for, like going to the gym a lotshows you&#x27;re completely out of touch with the younger generations, given the increased demands in muscularity and fitness. Seriously, the women themselves are saying it and have been saying it for decades now.The western world has gone completely mad in regards to dating, but the most vocal party can only shout &#x27;men bad&#x27; no matter what they do beyond being a complete doormat with zero expectations. reply BlahNeedle > Do you think in providing those things, men then become entitled to sex or attention?You seem to have skipped the take the risk of being rejected part of that comment when reading. reply projectazorian If the ego damage of getting turned down by a prospective romantic partner is a risk worthy of any note at all then you need to be in therapy, not on the dating market. reply lmm So a normal, healthy person should be able to ask someone to hook up as easy as saying hello? The few people I&#x27;ve met who did that did not seem more healthy and well-adjusted than the rest of us; quite the opposite in fact. reply BlahNeedle This is a refutation of the claim of being entitled, not a complaint. If you&#x27;re ready to be rejected, then you&#x27;re not entitled. Reading sentences in context aids comprehension. reply wiseowise Ok, mr. thick-skin, not all of us are Supermen. reply throwaway22044 You sound just like my therapist, but you charge less reply imtringued 29 >actually being a pleasant person.That is actually a classic \"nice guy\" trope. Women want a guy who is confident in stating his attraction to them and who doesn&#x27;t dwell too much before asking her out or after being rejected. Being \"pleasant\" only works if you naturally meet a lot of women and the woman asks you out. The reason for that is that platonic friendships physically take up time and limit the number of women you can meet. If you have five female friends, the likelyhood of one of them being attracted to you is practically zero, because the number is way too small. Nobody is going to have a hundred female friends so that one of them is going to ask you out. The economics of male dating just don&#x27;t allow it to happen.>Basically: your list entirely excludes the right of the other person to...be a person.How exactly did you come up with this response? Honestly, it feels like you copy pasted it from somewhere else and are now responding out of context.How does splitting the bill dehumanise \"the other person\"? reply JKCalhoun > She goes beyond that, turning them into a general sociopolitical claimAlso well within her right to do so. reply dahfizz Nobody is saying she shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do that. But when you talk politics, everyone else is \"well within their right\" to disagree with you. reply JKCalhoun You&#x27;re right, of course.I thought the issue was someone suggesting she should \"stay within her lane\". Whether I agree with them or not I like to hear a person&#x27;s views if they have walked in shoes I&#x27;ll probably never walk in. reply ianai That, too, is simple. And ok. And ok to agree&#x2F;disagree. replywhimsicalism Beautifully written, even if I don’t necessarily agree with every single point made.Especially towards the end, I feel that she tries to emphasize the nobility and radical nature of this work, taking umbrage at Eric Adam’s use of the word “low-skill” to describe some of these sorts of jobs. But it seems somewhat belied by the fact that, afaict, as soon as she had the means to escape, she did. And the romanticization of sex work as the only job where women get to call the shots and make profit off of men… I am curious the degree to which this is really true for these massage parlors, which are often managed or extorted by male-run organized crime. [0]But the central message, one that seems like a call for dignity, really resonates with me. It is one of the most beautiful vignettes I have read in a long time.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;02&#x2F;us&#x2F;massage-parlors-human-... reply ses1984 The author didn’t assert that sex work is the only job where women get to call the shots. The author suggested that could be a reason why it’s marginalized. Because if it was legitimized, then women would call the shots. reply whimsicalism I did not read it that way and I think that she would have phrased it differently if so.“an industry where women get to call the shots” she would have said “would get” imo if your interpretation was correct, just as you use ‘would’ in your comment.I took her to be describing sex work in the present, not some hypothetical future sex work.Here is the excerpt for those who want to judge for themselves:‘Unlike sex work, my “good” jobs didn’t threaten to overthrow traditional power structures. Many sex workers, including myself, have long hypothesized that the reason so many people in power work to keep the commercial sex trade marginalized is because they’re threatened by it—by the idea that it’s the only field where women outearn men, that it’s an industry where women get to call the shots, and that women profit off something that men have been told they’re entitled to for free: sex and attention in equal parts. In my experience of the corporate landscape, there was none of this radical power structure, only an upholding of the traditional: men talking and women listening, men in powerful positions getting both credit and profit for the labour of women beneath them’ reply ses1984 People in power work to marginalize it because they’re threatened by it. It’s pretty successfully marginalized if a woman can get arrested for it even while sacrificing economic profits to a pimp or massage parlor. Maybe the author could have been more explicit about it but to my reading sex workers can’t be both marginalized and calling the shots. reply barrenko It&#x27;s marginalized because it&#x27;s a shitty job, like every other shitty job (source: I&#x27;ve worked a lot of shitty jobs.) reply whimsicalism > sex workers can’t be both marginalized and calling the shotsDisagree. Calling the shots in the business, not in society. Just like a drug kingpin might be calling the shots in their organization. reply zapataband1 Women can call more of the shots in places where it is legal like Nevada or other countries. Not saying it&#x27;s a perfect system but the alterntive so far has been a trade that is controlled by criminals, bad customers, and law enforcement. reply whimsicalism Not sure why you assume this would be the case and it also isn’t really all that true [0], nor has it been true historically in societies with legal prostitution nor is it true in other industries with many women frontline workers (like the makeup industry, obviously not that similar but I think is somewhat representative).[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dennis_Hof reply throwaway22044 > Because if it was legitimized, then women would call the shots.If prostitution was legitimized, way fewer shots would have to be called in the first place. Apparently nobody wants that reply truculent > Especially towards the end, I feel that she tries to emphasize the nobility and radical nature of this work, taking umbrage at Eric Adam’s use of the word “low-skill” to describe some of these sorts of jobs. But it seems somewhat belied by the fact that, afaict, as soon as she had the means to escape, she did.Just because something is skilful doesn’t make it enjoyable or rewarding. Not to mention a person’s health and safety (both economic and physical) being considered. reply flir She also doesn&#x27;t know how many of those office drones also \"paid their dues\". But that&#x27;s a nitpick on an excellent piece of first-person journalism. reply tsss 33 She can write, I&#x27;ll give her that, but contentwise it is exactly the unreflected pseudo-intellectual crap you&#x27;d expect from a \"journalist\". How can you be so naive to sign up to become a propaganda foot soldier for the culture industry and then expect anything else but soulless stab-in-the-back ass-kissing work? This sense of comradery she is missing is the glimmer of class consciousness. It&#x27;s strangely real, it&#x27;s people who know they are at the bottom and they&#x27;re in it together. The corporate world on the other hand is fake. It consists of bosses who want to be treated like a friend or a royal when it suits them. It consists of colleagues who will throw you under the bus for that promotion and you will do the same, but you both act like you don&#x27;t know it will happen. It is that subconscious shame of betrayal from people like the author, who romance about the precariat on their personal blog and then go back to work to beat down on their former friends with the proverbial cultural stick in service of the man. reply iamnotsure It is easy to forget that central bank money is beads and trinkets with an average half-life of 30 years. reply Scubabear68 1I am a very picky reader, and I rarely say this, but this is an exceptionally well written piece.The pacing, the wording, the sense of atmosphere, and what to say when are just incredibly well done.This is what writers should aspire to.Also, great hook (we are all animals at night). reply sam537 1As an animal with similar fastidiousness, I agree. I am happy to have found this. Reminded me of After Dark by Murakami. reply wizofaus 1Agreed, found myself looking for the \"like\" button, something I virtually never click&#x2F;tap when it&#x27;s the first thing in your face at the bottom of a social media post. reply tuatoru Agreed, except for the use of \"diffuse\" where \"de-fuse\" (or defuse) was meant. Tiny subediting error. reply acc_297 I worked long months in the forestry industry (re-planting trees) during university it’s not so tough as sex work but sometimes people throw it in the bag of “low-skill” or “manual labour” jobs as if thought or critical thinking we’re not required.I have to say now working a “real” job now (for salary benefits etc.) I know way more forestry folks who could do my job today (consulting) than current coworkers who could dig out a stuck pickup truck properly, fix a broken generator, put out a brush fire…there are jobs which require accreditation or whatever but there’s no such thing as truly no-skill-required labour reply Baeocystin I used to weld in a shipyard, and one of the things I miss about it was that literally everyone I worked with was skilled and knowledgeable about our work. There was literally no way to fake being able to do what we did, so all the ego-first blowhards crashed out before they could affect our day-to-day much.It was refreshing. reply systems_glitch Burn that jet rod! All trades are like that to one degree or another. I end up working with a lot of factory&#x2F;plant maintenance personnel, and yeah there&#x27;s the occasional dropout who&#x27;s not pulling his weight, but mostly it&#x27;s super competent people no matter what their responsibility is.In jobs at semiconductor fab places, usually the head of maintenance holds a master&#x27;s or PhD and still rebuilds turbopumps and blown out ion gauges when needed. reply j-bos This is how I feel coming from the trades into the offices, my colleagues are often surprised when I say the work we do is easy. reply smabie I mean, if this was true, then why do office workers generally earn more? reply scns My theory is: The more people you help earn money, the more you earn.Private Equity is explicitly excluded, maybe they do, who knows?Example 1 Bill Gates&#x2F;Microsoft: Provided a stable platform for business software to run on, making it possible for millions of businesses to do accounting&#x2F;inventory management&#x2F;controlling CNC machinery&#x2F;etc.Example 2 Sales People&#x2F;Marketing: If you got the best product&#x2F;software&#x2F;whatever but zero customers, how are you you gonna pay your bills?[edit]Example 3 Jeff Bezos: Building the dominant platform for e-commerce of all kinds. Making it easy for a huge crowd of potential customers to discover and buy your wares. reply tuatoru This made me laugh out loud, at the sheer political naivete.Office workers earn more because they do jobs more similar to the jobs of those who allocate money. reply brabel Well, your take also seem pretty naive. Salaries in non-regulated jobs are a function of supply VS demand, that&#x27;s pretty much all.I would say office work does not actually pay more, it depends. Easy office-hand jobs probably pay much less than your previous job... but when it does pay more, it&#x27;s simply because there&#x27;s fewer people willing and capable of doing that job as a rate of the number of people actually needed for such tasks.When a job is regulated (requires license, or is protected by some law etc) the equation is skewed, usually in favour of a profession. reply whimsicalism This is a factor, but to say it is the factor is nonsense.Supply vs demand dynamics very much do exist. I get paid a lot, I also create measurably more than my salary in value. reply dragonwriter 49 > I mean, if this was true, then why do office workers generally earn more?Because the work (1) takes particular skills, and (2) skills that are functionally gatekept so they are disproportionately found in people coming from a middle class (or, at minimum, proletarian intelligentsia) background.It has work that is (compared to lots of more poorly paid jobs) hard to find people minimally qualified to do, but its not hard (in the sense of arduous) work, for the most part. Work being arduous doesn’t make it well-paid. reply Baeocystin Trades peak lower, which drives the average higher for white collar work, but I think if you look at the median income for both, trades are actually higher. FWIW. reply robocat Because money is not the only thing we gain by working. And few people optimise 100% for money. People work jobs for status, friends, pride, social good, stimulation, etcetera.I have friends who change between different types of jobs, and their reasons are often surprising. reply quinnjh Who earned more, the architect for the pharaohs pyramid or the people pushing one of the massive slabs of rock? Which job was harder? reply seventhtiger The ox that pulled the cart. So now what?This kind of measuring jobs by efforts always ends up being won by an animal or machine. Even among humans, the guy digging ditches with his bare hands is putting in more work than the guy using a shovel.It ends up being a stupid incentive structure, and is not a replacement for supply and demand in the labor market. reply legends2k Depends on who you ask.Physically the rock-pusher job is harder. Mentally the architect&#x27;s. I&#x27;d say pay comes in based on demand. Do we have more brainy folks or brawny folks? reply mensetmanusman Skills to collaborate across multiple nodes&#x2F;tasks are challenging in a different way, and some who might be good working solo flail when managing human interactions across multiple power centers. reply nullc Position in the production hierarchy.Consider a person that carves bespoke wooden figurines. Their job takes considerable skill, even talent. But it takes then X hours to make Y figurines. Time in, widgets out, completely proportional.Now imagine a person that configures a robot to carve crappy mass produced figurines. Their work is differently skilled, but perhaps less so. The product isn&#x27;t as good. Yet they put in their time once and the machine cranks out enormous quantities with minimal additional work from them. This has high leverage, they can command more pay because their leveraged work has more value.You can go further up the hierarchy, to the people who organize or direct the technicians or the channels that distribute the products of their machines. Their work is further abstracted, skilled in its own way but not necessarily more so. But the amount of income their efforts command is greater still-- even more leveraged.In areas where the use of the high-skill low-leverage work are largely optional-- say custom carpentry-- they often become unavailable because the sort of highly competent people who would excel at these tasks can make more money in a highly leveraged (but perhaps less skilled!) job writing boilerplate javascript to deliver advertising or whatever. In areas where the non-scalable work isn&#x27;t optional, like medical doctors-- the prices tend to shoot through the sky in part due to the income an equivalent aptitude could command in a more leveraged position.In between the two extremes we have workers that are just flat underpaid, and we rationalize the situation by imagining that they&#x27;re less deserving.As the article points out, many of these lowly paid jobs are highly skilled in their own way-- at least if done well. What they don&#x27;t have, however, is a big initial training barrier to entry that limits the supply of capable people and puts market power for this labor onto the supply side.Skill isn&#x27;t a factor in wages except in so far as the required skill impacts the level of supply or demand in the supply&#x2F;demand balance.I think we often underestimate the capability of the average person because we can&#x27;t know the average person and can&#x27;t see first hand the depth of their ability and because we also so often put that average person in a situation that just doesn&#x27;t exercise those latent abilities (or do, but do so in ways we don&#x27;t respect due to cultural biases). reply foobiekr The problem with this logic is that it only sort of works. I know a lot of executives personally and most of them are not high skill at all. Most of them aren&#x27;t even very bright.I guess you could make the case that their primary skill - reading the story that the people who promoted them wanted&#x2F;needed to hear - is in fact what&#x27;s being rewarded, but it has nothing to do with their applicability to high leverage work at all. reply quinnjh Who earned more, the architect for the pharoahs pyramid or the person pushing one of the massive slabs of rock?Which job was harder? reply whimsicalism The question is which job requires more skill, not which job is harder reply XargonEnder I think a lot of people in the office pretend to be less competent than they are to avoid getting assigned more work. reply hengheng 1Great writing! Seriously this is good stuff.For anybody that struggles with the length and slow-paced nature of this genre -- this is hackernews after all -- I had a much easier time imagining this as a radio piece. The writing style is very melodic, like it&#x27;s meant to be read out loud. The noises of the city, the description of light and temperature, all made it feel very alive. Something to absorb in a very sensual way, quite the opposite of the how-to and faq texts we read at the office during daytime.(Ha.) reply ilaksh 1It&#x27;s not a long article or slow-paced. It literally intersperses POV scenes from a brothel. If that can&#x27;t at least hold your attention for a few pages, nothing will.I suggest that people read a few novels if they think this article is too long. reply whimsicalism Try to call in. I am an avid reader, but I also know that lots of people really struggle with long-form reading, can feel insecure about this even though they are likely in the majority, and react with defensiveness and pride to rhetoric like this.Emphasizing the beauty and value of reading imo is much more important if the goal is to encourage longer form reading, which can be a learned skill. reply ignoramous 1They say, quite a few books could have been blog posts... Having read a hatful of books and blogs, I can see why that is. reply donkeybeer 1Novels have to justify themselves to be worth the read. Articles of this length would definitely do with a short comment or summary made by someone else to assess whether there&#x27;s a point to reading them. There&#x27;s a lot of journalists who are wannabe novelists and seem to suck at both skills. replyian0 Ive worked nights in manual & technical jobs and also found (and miss) the camaraderie she describes. I think a lot of it is more due to us being diurnal animals though, theres plenty of shitty jobs active during the day and theres just something fundamentally lonely&#x2F;scary&#x2F;exciting about working at night.Places that seem full are quiet and have a different character completely. You can hear echos of footsteps. Weather seems to be accentuated. Your going the opposite direction to everyone at the start and end of your shift. Its strange at a low level and everyone you meet is \"in it\" too. reply ilaksh 1The thing is, humans are ALL animals and 100% of the time. Group identification and primitive needs and instincts directly influence our behavior and the shape of society. Primatology should probably be required study for practicing politicians, economists, geopolitical analysts, etc. reply andrei_says_ 1And: Seeing rational thinking as a layer serving the primitive needs vs an independent process capable of overriding them explains a lot.All our choices occur in the emotional centers of our brain (in his lectures George Lakoff often mentions research showing that brain injury in emotional centers erase the ability to choose &#x2F; have a preference).The layer of rationalization deceives us into believing we somehow made an independent choice.One of Lakoff’s lectures: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;T46bSyh0xc0 reply DiscourseFan It&#x27;s not really one or the other, clearly there is a level at which we have expanded our rationality far beyond its basic use to serve our needs, and built a society where we in fact never really get to have what we want and if you&#x27;re sexually frustrated purchasing it is criminalized. We built our own cages because we&#x27;re afraid we won&#x27;t be able to wake ourselves up out of bed in the morning. reply bluenose69 1This is an exceptional piece of writing, finely crafted and suffused with unusually deep insight.I read a lot, and seldom have I run across a writer possessed of this level of skill. A writer&#x27;s central task is to place the reader in another world, living another life. At this, the author succeeds with what seems like effortless grace.Few of today&#x27;s award-winning novelists display this power.I do hope HN folks will take the time to read this essay. reply julianeon Funnily enough, your observation was the basis of my criticism. I can state it semi-socratically.What is this article about?A woman who did sex work at a massage parlor.Summarize what she did, then.I... can&#x27;t.I actually thought in the beginning that it may have been sensual, not sexual. Then she described it as sex work - which changed my mind - so it was sexual (incidentally, I have heard this critiqued in pieces before in creative writing classes - preferably a reader should not read 1&#x2F;2 of your story and then mentally have to reframe everything that came before a sentence which unintentionally repositions everything).And not to be indelicate but... how? What did the sex part of it actually involve? I can think of a whole lot of variations of that, which run a big gamut of intimacy and (I imagine) danger, but I can&#x27;t tell you how she fit into that. The fact that she bought condoms partially answered that, but it&#x27;s still an incomplete picture. Also if she had a boyfriend or girlfriend during that time, how she talked to her parents about this, friends - how was security handled, health, pregnancy - basic social&#x2F;workplace questions - all a blank.Maybe these were limitations imposed by the magazine itself and (ironically enough) the very power structure that she mentions as a threat. But I couldn&#x27;t tell you what she actually did as a masseuse, which seems like a weakness of the piece. reply DJHenk > What is this article about?It is not an article, it is an essay. Wikipedia defines an \"informal essay\" as: characterized by \"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,\" etc.> What did the sex part of it actually involve?The reason that this part is left to the imagination of the reader is that A) it is more powerful that way and B) the details don&#x27;t really matter anyway to get the message and image across.These things should have been covered in your creative writing class too. reply mensetmanusman It’s not the summary that matters, it’s the journey.Most people’s lives will end without a summary of accomplishments. reply lancesells 1> What do you need if you’re out seeking services at night? Food, sex, shelter.This really encapsulates what all humans want and need. Food, sex & love, shelter & clothing. With only those three things you can live a happy life. Everything else is really to satisfy a desire for novelty and experience. reply kibwen 1I&#x27;d rather quote the full bit, since the final sentence is important:> What do you need if you’re out seeking services at night? Food, sex, shelter. The staunch of a wound.What the author is trying to express isn&#x27;t that someone out at night has different needs than someone out during the day, but rather that if you&#x27;re out at night then whatever you&#x27;re looking for has an urgency that outweighs sleep, like a bleeding wound. reply seabird I hear this often and the idea that some people believe it strikes me as profoundly sad. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s even as applicable as people who say this think it is. I don&#x27;t know anyone who has ate and loved&#x2F;fucked their way out of the dread of doing nothing and knowing nothing. They&#x27;re usually just left wondering \"is this all there really is?\" I know plenty of people that primarily live off of gruel with little to no sex or romance and still feel like they have everything to live for. The nights of making things and feeling that the world is a thing I live in instead of a thing I&#x27;m just subjected to, takes up much more of my mind than any sex, food, or shelter ever has. reply flangola7 Many people have neither. It&#x27;s better if they can at least get one. reply seabass-labrax 1By your definition, I&#x27;m not a human. But then again, I always have thought that Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy of Needs was upside-down. reply kdmccormick 1You value self-actualization above food and shelter?Like, have you ever been stuck out at night in the cold and rain without eating all day and thought, \"I need to focus on pursuing my passions\"? reply whimsicalism My guess is that they are asexual, not sure why everyone is jumping to them not requiring food for some reason. reply sph They literally said they believe the pyramid of needs to be upside down, so you&#x27;d have self-actualization at the bottom, and food and shelter at the top. reply dumdumchan And air reply KineticLensman And wi-fi reply Exoristos 1Dues it surprise you that there are people on HN who have gone without food or proper shelter? reply kdmccormick Not at all! It would surprise me if someone had gone without food and shelter and then insisted that self-actualization was more important to them when they were cold and hungry. reply MichaelZuo 1 in a million outliers do exist, some folks are even literally wired differently. reply Exoristos Why? For the record, in my early twenties I moved to a city, fell in with a bad crowd, was robbed of my savings, and ended up living in my car for a time. I lost almost a pound a day that month. At no point did I start thinking differently, like a reptile or robot (or whatever you&#x27;re imagining), or stop thinking about myself as a personality or a soul. Soft-science textbooks are manipulative bullshit. reply simple-thoughts Limited shelter plus forced fasting is a way to achieve self actualization, learning both the limits of your body and discipline. Only to a degree, too much and you’re physically injured perhaps permanently. replylimaoscarjuliet 1This resonates with me so well. Every time I&#x27;m tired, hungry or horny, it very quickly changes how I perceive reality. Keep that state long enough and things change shape and meaning, as if I&#x27;m tuning my senses to new frequency. reply eurleif 1Actually, it&#x27;s just one thing: food & sex & love & shelter & clothing. reply nostrebored 1Hate this quote. This absolutely sums up certain cities though.Some places become amazing after dark. People just want to have a nice time together. Maybe that’s over food, maybe it involves sex, but more importantly it was about camaraderie. reply jayd16 I think in these discussions sex is just a glib shorthand for companionship of many kinds. reply darkclouds > Food, sex & love, shelter & clothing. With only those three things you can live a happy life.On the surface I think most would agree, but I think you need trust in a relationship.If your job or parents job moves you around, it becomes harder to lay down roots it gets harder to trust people in anything other than a superficial way.Friendships become a thing of the past.People end up becoming divided, but pre-internet this was standard practice employed by the UK govt, in the name of science and law & order.I&#x27;d be happy to spend the end of my life on my own now, ideally I&#x27;d even like a sort of drive-thru euthanasia service, where when you decide, not somebody else like doctors, politicians, scientists or religious freaks, where you can bowl up to an incinerating crematorium, pay a fee (because only a capitalist society would charge you to end your life in a painfree manner), optionally leave some beyond the grave messages, inject myself and end my life, body removed from the room, incinerated and the waste disposed of in the bin.Its the last act of self determination and autonomy any intelligent person could hope to have imo.Nobody gets their life back that&#x27;s stolen by people in authority like parents, teachers, employers, politicians, scientists, lawyers and judges or superstitious types.Todays society, which everyone is in denial over, is the fact they are nothing more than the property of the entities that ultimately control society.If its any consolation, life can leave you feeling numb enough to make suicide a viable option whilst the criminals that run the world, get fat off the land.So I can relate to the article. reply throwanem > I felt little of the camaraderie I once did while working night shifts. I’m unsure why I felt this dissonance, and it occurs to me now that it could have been more self-imposed than anything.I doubt it. I&#x27;ve worked days and nights at different times in the same place, at a couple of jobs in different parts of the country. There&#x27;s a real difference between what people are like in the daytime and nighttime worlds, and between people who are at home in the latter and those who are just visiting.I don&#x27;t really miss it. But I do kinda miss it. reply selestify What do you think causes this difference? reply Hextinium There is a comradery in that it sucks, you know it sucks and that we are just getting through it. No one is out to \"get\" you. You are also part of the suck club.The second you get another job they are reminded of all the people who take advantage of people in the suck club. You got out. They didn&#x27;t. reply systems_glitch \"Embrace the suck.\" reply qup The kind of people who are out at night; the kind of activities that are available; the kind of places that are open. reply throwanem Fear, of course.Abroad in the night, the human world grows tenuous, and one&#x27;s connection to it likewise. Most people can learn to live in that, but you never feel perfectly at home with it. Nor should you; there&#x27;s nothing like it to dispel the comfortable, foolish illusion that the world belongs to us, and not the other way around.Humans are better, I find, for a little fear of that sort. It makes us stick closer together than we do otherwise, gives us more incentive to look for the good in one another; camaraderie comes much easier, and that is part of what I miss. Both those jobs were customer service, and even the people on the phone were different: stranger certainly, sometimes desperate, but almost never spiteful like the day shift often was. The sun revolves around every narcissist, of course, but those excepted there is less pretense in all of us in night.Its very strangeness is the rest of what I miss. I find it frightful too, of course, but never because it&#x27;s trying, which counts for a lot with me after living so long with humans. There&#x27;s a lot to appreciate in that strangeness, for anyone who understands fear well enough to feel and not be driven by it - to know the difference between being afraid and being made to feel afraid.There&#x27;s a wild and ancient beauty in the night to which nothing wrought by human hands compares, and an inescapable reminder that beyond all the frantic work of busy human hands, something vast beyond our comprehension still abides: the world itself, from which we never stop fleeing, despite that we neither can nor need.I hope whatever of this species emerges from the other side of the next few hundred years understands that better than today&#x27;s version does - I can&#x27;t imagine how they&#x27;d fail to, at any rate. I think they&#x27;ll better understand the night than most of us can, too. Maybe by then the consequences of our lethal hubris will have far enough abated they&#x27;ll even have some time to enjoy it, the way I did decades ago when I last lived a nighttime life. reply j-bos 1Odd article for the front page of hn.

Awesome writing, thanks for sharing it here reply atleastoptimal 1This is why I imagine sex robots will only be a good thing. The humanitarian promise of AGI is it serves human needs optimally and frees humans from the need to stoop to the lowest levels to serve them. reply belorn The general impression I get from the article (and similar reports) is that patrons of sex workers in general do not seek the mechanical aspects of sex. They also do not seek power. What the largest majority seek is validation.The big breakthrough would be robots that provided the emotional need of human connection and validation. If the mind could be tricked into a similar state as being in the center of a strong social network, then not only would that serve human needs optimally it would also be the single biggest health boost given. reply vorpalhex There&#x27;s a community of people who really seek out \"AI girlfriends\".

Prostitution isn&#x27;t legal but nude massage is. So these places advertise as massage parlours. This article explains it a bit more head on:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;torontolife.com&#x2F;city&#x2F;the-parlour-game&#x2F;But then it&#x27;s not even grey where I am in New England and we still have \"massage parlors\" that are constantly getting shut down for prostitution. reply nuancebydefault 1I struggled with that aspect as well, but after reading the piece entirely, it becomes clear that massage parlour is used as an euphemism.Also about being legal or not, it&#x27;s probably work in the lite-grey zone (it&#x27;s not Texas after all). The schedule looks something like, during a fixed period of time at night you just wait until you get scheduled&#x2F;picked. That said, I don&#x27;t think it is very important for the article. reply morelisp 1> the word \"massage parlour\" is some local euphemism for some kind of sex work and its implied they aren&#x27;t actually masseurs&#x2F;masseuses?I&#x27;m genuinely curious where you live that this is not the case. It is such a euphemism in every Anglophone country, and (large parts of?) Germany and Italy. It is usually illegal (or at least unlicensed) even in places where prostitution has some kind of legal status. reply ACow_Adonis I spent a fair bit of my youth where there&#x27;s been legalised brothels (or at least I assume they were through most of my childhood) and sex work. And on the other hand there&#x27;s also physiotherapists and actual massages. I don&#x27;t particularly like massages that much, personally, but if needing one I go in and tap my health card and that helps cover it.So presumably there was no need to hide the business behind the euphemism&#x2F;front, everyone just knew that if you wanted sex&#x2F;porn, you went to a brothel in suburb X. Even where I am now, i know there&#x27;s brothels and presumably private sex workers and if i want a massage I go and I book a massage. reply ffhhttt > Even where I am now, i know there&#x27;s brothels and presumably private sex workers and if i want a massage I go and I book a massage.I don’t think many people would be able to mix up these places after seeing them. If you only wanted a massage for health reasons you would almost certainly not consider going there. reply jojobas In Australia there are legal brothels, there are legit massage joints and, as I&#x27;ve heard, something in between.I&#x27;m told, if you&#x27;re looking for an actual massage and the reception doesn&#x27;t have a HICAPS terminal (similar to the credit card one but for health insurance) you&#x27;re in the wrong spot. reply yieldcrv yeah that bothered me too and I was hoping it got better a few more sentences inthere are places to get massages that aren’t sex work so using euphamisms as both to placate a cultural appetite and coping mechanism is odd and needlessly confusing.I’m halfway through the article like “is this another sex worker that can’t acknowledge what they do in plain English, while the rest of us are supposed to repeat ‘sex work is work’ for the labor rights along with the ironic convenience that will come with it, or is this a place to get a massage“ reply astroalex 1Wow, this was a unique and beautiful read.

Of the form - it can be done, and no-one literally dies, therefore it may be done.People don&#x27;t work to marginalize prostitution because it&#x27;s \"the only field in which women outearn men\".People work to marginalize prostitution because it&#x27;s fundamentally morally bankrupt.Most well adjusted people eventually realise that casual sex is not the key to happiness in life. Not all of them will admit it, though.The illusions that one can have sex without emotional attachment, that relationships are just a side quest and careers are more important, all of that stuff comes back to bite people eventually. reply strken I don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s fundamentally morally bankrupt. I do think that in practice it&#x27;s often highly exploitative, and when a given sex worker might have been lured in by desperation it&#x27;s immoral to roll the dice. Is that not sufficient reason to work to marginalise it? reply phuyngrbrn4 Well, to not be morally bankrupt, it takes a sincere will to be decent to others, and a logically coherent set of principles, no?Because the author of this article shows no sign of either, but neither do many of the commenters in this thread who only look at the symptom: \"look kids, the stream of consciousness of a not particularly insightful person is being highlighted in the media because it serves a certain political agenda.\"The agenda performed in the article is, incidentally, the usual crypto-conservative pablum that gives the \"left-wing echo chamber\" its structural foundations, to be spiced up with AI drivel as the technology matures. The general form of the argument being made between the pixels is: \"see how dumb and sad this person is - we need to protect ourselves from becoming dumb and sad, by punishing others for having ended up dumb and sad.\"And here&#x27;s the catch. Punishment makes people dumber and sadder. What makes people less dumb and less sad is... intimacy. Which the article and ensuing discussing seems to be at least partially about.The author has evidenly lacked true human connection before, during, and after their sex work career, only finding it with other lost souls in the nightmarish desert of cities at night. Now she is briefly basking in the parasocial light of having her inner world exposed on The Media. (Aren&#x27;t we all?)>People work to marginalize prostitution because it&#x27;s fundamentally morally bankrupt.People really love throwing around the \"fundamentallies\" and the \"radicallies\", but what is the foundation, or the root, of the issue here? What&#x27;s morally bankrupt here is that we live in such a way that results in the emergence of a black market for loving touch.To satisfy one&#x27;s need for intimacy through \"official channels\", one is expected to participate in a costly and complicated social ritual with no guarantee of success. Imagine if buying food or renting a place involved pathological emotional enmeshment, and was prone to leave you with your humanity degraded (\"heartbroken\").You are just as wrong as the author. The fundamental reason people work to marginalize prostitution is to maintain the profit margins of intimacy arbitrage. Men marginalize prostitution not out of the desire for control that feminists love to project upon them, but as a way of rationalizing sunk costs; and \"decent\" women marginalize prostitution purely as an anti-competitive measure, for the labor of being a decent human being is twice as arduous should you be identified as a woman.P.S. Protip: it&#x27;s completely possible to have sex without emotional attachment. What trips people up is that participants must decide upon that from the start, and should never offer or request said emotional attachment for the duration of the encounter(s).Unfortunately, we are animals most of the time. Starved ones. Should the bait be proferred, it is likely to be taken - automatically, against participants&#x27; better judgements. Beware. reply FooBarBizBazz Let&#x27;s get this straight. The person blessed with what is basically a panhandling superpower -- an attractive female body -- somehow says her marks, the ones paying $80, have an entitled attitude toward sexual attention. Pause and think about that. Do you think these guys had a Plan B to buy them an English degree?These places conduct zero-sum economic activity. One person loses money, one person gains money, and nothing of value is created. Draw a control volume around an economic activity to understand it. China: Opium in, silver out. Congo: Guns in, rubber out. This place: Money in, nothing out.A hallmark of exploiters is that they have contempt for their marks. Well, I sense more than a little contempt here. Don&#x27;t trust this person around children or small animals.Of course she justifies herself eloquently; did you not just see what she spent the money on? An English degree.Moreover, she admits that she understands what she was doing:> my livelihood somehow still depended on men employing bad judgement.So don&#x27;t get distracted. Draw a control volume. And stay away from these places, and these people.Most people here commenting, even those praising this writing, who will surely rush to defend her, must at some level clearly understand this. Like -- do you frequent prostitutes? ... Didn&#x27;t think so. So you know I&#x27;m right. reply vunderba This place: Money in, nothing out.If this is the crux of the issue for you, I assume you don&#x27;t frequent the following places:- bars- arcades- any entertainment venue (concerts, etc)The impression she seemed to be making was that many of their patrons weren&#x27;t there for physical gratification but rather a sort of emotional catharsis.

You can frame this kind of stuff as therapy if you want, as something involving a pathetic kind of dignity, even as valuable work, but her essay does none of that. The only people with whom she evinces any solidarity are the convenience-store clerks and the taxi drivers. She basically says that this is not a good thing to be doing, which paradoxically means that her essay is in more logical agreement with my own condemnation of it than it is with your post. If there is to be an end to judgment and condemnation it has to begin with the author. She and I agree that exploitation is happening; we only disagree about whether it is good (or, \"radical\", she says). The catharsis you speak of, if real, is not something she cares about, because the people who experience it are not people she values. reply jjulius >She&#x27;s sneering at a bunch of schlubs...Same question[1].[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37028780 reply booleandilemma I had similar thoughts.She gets to take money from lonely men and then call them the bad guys.Saying it out loud costs HN points though. reply jjulius >She gets to take money from lonely men and then call them the bad guys.Genuinely curious to know where you think she called them \"the bad guys\".

The vast majority of them would absolutely support a successful businesswoman who earned her money through any moral means. reply xcxcx 1The \"dominant power structure\" of the last few N centuries broadly consisted of nations of European origin enslaving and trading others in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, plenty of which under the rule of people such as Queen Victoria.It had more to do with military differential than with gender, but now they must change the rhetoric with these discussions because wide availability of historical facts and global demographic trends do not benefit this \"dominant power structure\".The former slave drivers now want local women who read this trash to hate you for their own crimes so they can skip their bill reply whimsicalism Quibbles aside, it seems undeniable that there has existed a power relationship between men and women that likely had much more impact on people’s day to day lives than the macro-scale power structures you are describing. Nevermind the fact that it is arguable that the gender dynamics were to some degree productive of the colonialism you are describing.I don’t really get the point of your comment except insofar as the standard HN “well actually” putdown of anything resembling feminist rhetoric. reply xcxcx I see. I must have been mistaken then because I&#x27;ve always assumed the gap between a Dutch man and a Dutch woman was narrower than that between a Dutch man and a Bantu man reply whimsicalism Clearly, these are all tied up together. The gap between a Dutch man and a Bantu man was not merely defined by colonialism, as you well know. And gender relations defined each of those peoples day to day life far more than interactions with representatives of each other.But I still do not know the point of your comment. Is it to suggest that gender relations was not a big factor in the past? reply xcxcx The point of my comment is that it&#x27;s almost as if we weren&#x27;t constantly bombarded by how unfair current men are to women, we would start reflecting about these inconvenient legacies instead reply whimsicalism I hear about the legacy of colonialism all the time. People can walk and chew gum at the same time.I agree, some strands of feminism can certainly ignore all other dimensions of power, especially when coming from more affluent women, but I disagree that this was the implication of the original comment. reply xcxcx Since you keep referring to an original comment, I unfortunately must ask which comment you&#x27;re talking about reply whimsicalism > Since you keep referring to an original commentThis is my first mention of an original comment, but I was referring to this one: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37026511 reply xcxcx Gotcha.

    "originBody": "Electron Band Structure In Germanium, My Ass           Abstract: The exponential dependence of resistivity on temperature in germanium is found to be a great big lie. My careful theoretical modeling and painstaking experimentation reveal 1) that my equipment is crap, as are all the available texts on the subject and 2) that this whole exercise was a complete waste of my time. Introduction           Electrons in germanium are confined to well-defined energy bands that are separated by \"forbidden regions\" of zero charge-carrier density. You can read about it yourself if you want to, although I don't recommend it. You'll have to wade through an obtuse, convoluted discussion about considering an arbitrary number of non-coupled harmonic-oscillator potentials and taking limits and so on. The upshot is that if you heat up a sample of germanium, electrons will jump from a non-conductive energy band to a conductive one, thereby creating a measurable change in resistivity. This relation between temperature and resistivity can be shown to be exponential in certain temperature regimes by waving your hands and chanting \"to first order\". Experiment procedure       I sifted through the box of germanium crystals and chose the one that appeared to be the least cracked. Then I soldered wires onto the crystal in the spots shown in figure 2b of Lab Handout 32. Do you have any idea how hard it is to solder wires to germanium? I'll tell you: real goddamn hard. The solder simply won't stick, and you can forget about getting any of the grad students in the solid state labs to help you out.       Once the wires were in place, I attached them as appropriate to the second-rate equipment I scavenged from the back of the lab, none of which worked properly. I soon wised up and swiped replacements from the well-stocked research labs. This is how they treat undergrads around here: they give you broken tools and then don't understand why you don't get any results.  Fig. 1: Check this shit out.       In order to control the temperature of the germanium, I attached the crystal to a copper rod, the upper end of which was attached to a heating coil and the lower end of which was dipped in a thermos of liquid nitrogen. Midway through the project, the thermos began leaking. That's right: I pay a cool ten grand a quarter to come here, and yet they can't spare the five bucks to ensure that I have a working thermos. Results       Check this shit out (Fig. 1). That's bonafide, 100%-real data, my friends. I took it myself over the course of two weeks. And this was not a leisurely two weeks, either; I busted my ass day and night in order to provide you with nothing but the best data possible. Now, let's look a bit more closely at this data, remembering that it is absolutely first-rate. Do you see the exponential dependence? I sure don't. I see a bunch of crap.       Christ, this was such a waste of my time.       Banking on my hopes that whoever grades this will just look at the pictures, I drew an exponential through my noise. I believe the apparent legitimacy is enhanced by the fact that I used a complicated computer program to make the fit. I understand this is the same process by which the top quark was discovered. Conclusion       Going into physics was the biggest mistake of my life. I should've declared CS. I still wouldn't have any women, but at least I'd be rolling in cash.",

I too used a fancy computer algorithm to get a best fit. Except that I managed to get four significant decimal places in the result — an improvement over the (also outdated) textbook.The author of the angry rant had a life-defining experience of overwhelming frustration.The same scenario resulted in a positive life-defining experience for meIt’s funny how unpredictably things pan out even in identical circumstances… reply petermcneeley But in some way we all end up in the same place :) (HN)I really enjoyed the labs and it was seeing the predictions pan out in front of my eyes that actually got me interested in the first place. But you have to know what your getting into. The labs are extremely time consuming and required preparation. reply spxtr 1Pretty funny.Having taught low-temperature condensed matter labs, a big part of the grade is figuring out what went wrong, and either correcting for it, or at least acknowledging that it went wrong. The student needed to give more information about the experimental setup (what instruments did they use? four point or two point resistance? resistivity vs resistance? what is R_0?) and why they think the experiment didn&#x27;t work. It looks to me like they had something miswired, so they only measured noise. reply evilotto My understanding of undergrad lab work is that the point is not to get results, it&#x27;s to learn how to do lab work. reply lonelyasacloud 5 Usually on a Friday afternoon&#x2F;early evening while other non-Science&#x2F;Engineering types are out having something called a Social Life ... reply analog31 Indeed, a scientist should have some exposure to experimentation. Experiments don&#x27;t always work on the first try, and often require some knowledge and skill.The ones who can&#x27;t solder go into electrical engineering and sit at a computer terminal all day. (joking of course) reply splittingTimes 1Exactly my experience back in the days doing the mandatory \"advanced experimental physics laboratory semester\" where you had to do like 14 vastly different experiment of the caliber described in that post in the course of one semester on old equipment that would break during the experiment, with less than motivated PhD students or post grads as teachers. Of the 14 experiments only two worked and we got the expected results.This experience drove me right into theoretical physics and writing computer simulations of electron dynamics and light-matter interactions in confined semiconductors (quantum dots, graphene and the like). That was fun.Now I am working on medical device software development, as the other stuff does not pay the bills. reply javajosh Yeah I don&#x27;t quite understand how the physics curriculum is set. There is more and more physics discovered over time and yet the time you get to study remains the same. 4 years is not enough time to learn the math and physics you need to do anything real, not counting the other important stuff you need to do (like English comp and partying and getting your heart broken). reply doctorwho42 Physics course is set to do two things(1) &#x27;to teach you to think like a physicist&#x27; as my professor was fond of saying to us. No one is going to be able to learn all of the subjects knowledge in 4 years, let alone a complex and rigorous field like physics.(2) to give you a core foundation of understanding on which all other physics is built upon.By teaching the core subjects and lessons of physics, you can get a pretty good understanding of the world, how it works, and how to derive equations to explain it.As for it not being able to learn enough to do anything real. I beg to differ, like all fields you tend to learn the most in &#x27;the field&#x27;. Most physicists learn by doing just like any other field. Take for instance engineering, there are some exceptions but most of the engineers I have known in my life have really only become fully viewed as engineers once they had some years of experience under their belts... Same thing goes for comp sci, and same goes for physics.It&#x27;s hard to explain because the field is viewed as an abstraction to those outside of it. The goal of understanding something new, discovering some new phenomenon, or better understanding an old one. But what that looks like in practice is years of working in a lab failing, trying things, taking results, tilting your head and going &#x27;thats weird&#x27;, and charting to colleagues about how to get something to work. Those who have done experimental physics, this is just experimentation and it makes sense, those who haven&#x27;t, this probably sound simplistic and it is. Like your own fields, it&#x27;s hard to really capture the depth of what experimentation looks like because even in physics it varies from sub field to sub field.So it goes, sorry for the rambling from an experimental physicist reply EvgeniyZh At my uni (and probably and most others) undergrad physics just ends around 1930s. Then for master&#x27;s you get some of the mid-20 century (phase transitions and intro to qft). Then you specialize and learn the remaining 50 years reply tired_and_awake Heh this strikes me as funny. I remember studying hierarchical image classifiers... If you think physics changes fast you should check out CS sometime. reply i_am_jl This strikes me as funny, because Lucas Kovar, the author, is now a software engineer at Google. reply javajosh Physics is CS bro. reply dboreham As is Mathematics. reply TheCleric https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;435&#x2F; reply pbmonster I think he really missed out on making this a circle.Because Mathematics is just applied philosophy. Which is just applied language... which is just applied sociology. replypbmonster > one semester on old equipment that would break during the experimentI saw that as a learning opportunity, teaches you which glues are cryo-proof, how to switch fuses on amplifiers (and other, more complicated electronics quick-fixes), and how important knowing people to borrow equipment from is.Unless your lab is swimming in money, those are valuable skills for an experimentalist. And even if you swim in money, buying fancy new stuff has a minimum 8 week lead time while walking down the hall to the correct shelf to pilfer takes 5 minutes and gets you results before lunch.> with less than motivated PhD students or post grads as teachersThis is an unfortunate truth everywhere I taught. Unfortunately, teaching the same thing 14 times a semester is no fun, and every single person who enjoys teaching (and is good at it) knows it, and instead teaches any available lecture, seminar, tutorial or exercise - anything, where you get to teach something new every week and that allows you to stay with the same students for longer. reply robocat > on old equipment that would break during the experimentIsn’t that closer to the real conditions in a research lab?I met some NASA scientists doing atmospheric sampling on a plane, and they had to accompany their equipment to manage any equipment glitches during the expensive sampling process (a custom modified 747 flying from Hawaii to New Zealand IIRC) reply doctorwho42 Can confirm, work in a top physics university in the lab. It is not a rare sight to see equipment from 10, 20, 30 years ago still in operation. Though it really depends on the equipment. Optics? They don&#x27;t really go bad if you treat them right. Electronics? You&#x27;d be surprised as the quality of design and fab went into that plastic box that looks older than you.Really physics discovery is partially limited by equipment, but in my time in the lab I have seen great physicists get remarkable results with equipment or setups that I personally thought was not up to the task.As to college level experimental physics lab: the goal is not to get you to reproduce the nobel winning results, but to learn how to think like an experimental physicist. To hunt down issues, to calculate sources of error, to find out that some guy keeps running the microwave while you are taking sensitive measurements and that it actually impacted them and how.It is the unimaginative or poorly taught that think the experimental physics lab in undergrad isn&#x27;t important. reply antidisalloc7 > 14 vastly different experiment of the caliber described in that post in the course of one semesterMy one remaining did-not-graduate nightmare is that I never completed that course. And I was an experimentalist.> This experience drove me right into theoretical physicsHad a summer student work on my nearly-intractable dissertation experiment. He immediately switched to theory. reply doctorwho42 It&#x27;s not that bad of a course, it&#x27;s just a struggle because it&#x27;s different than all other physics courses you take.In that class you aren&#x27;t being graded on getting to the right answer. You are getting graded on how you approach getting the right answer, and no one expects you to get the right answer - in the ball park is generally the average for the course. reply wolfgang42 Original publication: Kovar, L. “Electron Band Structure In Germanium, My Ass.” Annals of Improbable Research, vol. 7, no. 3, May&#x2F;June 2001, p. 4, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20010620051228&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.improb... reply subroutine Here&#x27;s a list of classics from Improbable Researchhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;improbable.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;classics&#x2F; reply dav_Oz I guess this must be from &#x27;99.

Is it entirely in the electrons? Does the nucleus have any temperature? reply radioactivist That&#x27;s a good question. it depends how long you wait and how strongly coupled they are.For electrons and nuclear motion they are often strongly coupled enough that they quickly reach equilibrium and thus are at the same temperature (e.g. in liquids or solids). But on short timescales they can absolutely be at distinct temperatures. In dilute gases they can also become somewhat decoupled (there can be a well defined electronic temperature and nuclear temperature).One case whether this can take a much longer period of time is when dealing with nuclear spin -- this is much more weakly coupled to the electrons and so can take much longer to equilibriate. reply staunton The \"temperature of an atom\" is something very different from the temperature of a material with billions of atoms. For the material, what matters most is usually vibrations of atoms, where the nucleus contributes the most to kinetic energy, because it is heavy, and the electronic configuration contributes to potential energy.For an atom, you basically have to do quantum physics and talk about von Neuman entropy of it&#x27;s quantum state. This kind of temperature is very removed from the everyday concepts of \"heat\" and \"heat transfer\". reply ianburrell Temperature is the motion of the whole atom. Individual atoms don&#x27;t really have temperature, temperature is a bulk property, the average of motion of lots of atoms. reply NL807 Not a physicist, but I think temperature lives in motion of particles, let it be electrons, the nucleus, whole atoms, or otherwise. Because electrons shroud the nucleus and have much less mass, they are more prone with external interactions where they can change momentum by absorbing and releasing energy. The nucleus is not exempt from this, but takes a not more energy to change their momentum. That being said, \"temperature\" as we are accustomed to, is more like a statistical average of the total motion of all particles in the system. reply thriftwy https:&#x2F;&#x2F;physics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;716282&#x2F;43345 discovered by me some time ago. Long story short, nucleus cannot absorb low temperature thermal energy so it&#x27;s virtually zero. reply hardlianotion I feel this pain.

Larian’s Swen Vincke posted a tweet yesterday showing the game hitting 500,000 concurrent players, making it the third most played game on all of Steam behind only CSGO and DOTA 2. He said that he told IT to only expect 100,000 concurrents at max. That gap has widened even further. The peak yesterday was 712,281 players, surpassing games like DOTA 2, Rust, Apex Legends, GTA 5 and PUBG. Mind you, this is a single player, hardcore RPG. PROMOTED Past that, Baldur’s Gate has now broken into the top 10 peak playercounts in Steam history. It’s currently #9, getting dangerously close to Hogwarts Legacy’s 879,308, a high water mark from earlier this year. Above those two are New World, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Dota 2, Lost Ark, CSGO and PUBG. There are only four single players games out of the top 10, as others are MMOs or PvP games. I think that Baldur’s Gate might push even higher later today, as I’ve seen playercounts peak for many games on Sundays. While it’s not impossible the following weekend is higher, that’s a bit unlikely, as these all-time peaks often happen early on. But anything can happen, and Baldur’s Gate has already defied all kinds of odds.

The game does not have more than four scored reviews in right now, but given all the praise, even in a year of a megahit like Tears of the Kingdom and a AAA blockbuster like Starfield coming up, there’s a serious chance Baldur’s Gate 3 could be in play for GOTY, and I imagine many individual outlets or creators may end up picking it in the end.

I think what’s the most shocking to me is the kind of game this is, a very enormous, detailed, turn-based RPG that simply doesn’t get made anymore. But while it may have fallen out of fashion with publishers and developers, that simply is not true for the general public, who raced to Baldur’s Gate 3 despite it being 20 years since the last one.

All the signs were there, though.- Their previous game Divinity: Original Sin 2 was critically acclaimed, very popular for a pretty hardcore CRPG, and had long legs.- DnD has a lot of brand power and has been strongly in the zeitgeist for years.- There&#x27;s a big cohort of millennials who have strong nostalgia for Baldur&#x27;s Gate and who have plenty of money to buy games (if not time to play them).- The Early Access release for this game was wildly popular beyond the developer&#x27;s expectations, and maintained interest for years.I definitely underestimated the brand power of DnD and Baldur&#x27;s Gate because they aren&#x27;t very important to me, personally. But also there have been a load of really good CRPGs in recent years and there seemed to be a pretty low ceiling to how much interest they could get. Tyranny, Pillars of Eternity, Pathfinder: Kingmaker, and a few others were amazing and beloved CRPG games but were lucky to have a tenth of the success of BG3. But those games were generally less accessible, mostly not multiplayer, and again lacked the brand power. reply handmadeta 1I don&#x27;t want to attack you personally but I think your post illustrates an common error in thinking that caused gaming to stagnate for the past decade. I can just hear the army of MBAs making spreadsheets and checklist reflecting exactly this \"paint by the numbers\" style of thinking. This in turn means that the next ten AAA titles starting production are going to check all these boxes and then ... will still fail. In reality there is no formular for making a hit game. You need people who care and know what they are doing and let them do what they love. reply appplication 1I think you’re right but also making a good or beloved game is not really the same endeavor as making a massively profitable one. Stardew Valley is beloved. If you described the vision to a 10k employee game studio, they could probably make something that is stardew-like, widely played, and absolutely rakes in cash through micro transactions, $49.99 variegated eggplant DLC, etc. and has the charm and soul of a cold baked potato.Beloved games have heart, vision, and they don’t establish a predatory relationship with their customers. There will always be a place for them to gamers, because these attributes can’t be faked. There will also always be a place for soulless AAA because, as you said, the MBAs can bake these on paper, reliably, and procedurally. reply spacemadness 1The idea of Stardew Valley with microtransactions just ruined my day. reply kevinmchugh 1It&#x27;s just Farmville. reply mysterydip 1havest carrot (10 hrs) [harvest instantly for 5 gems!] reply Groxx 1It&#x27;s just Dreamlight Valley. reply thefringthing This comment undervalues cold baked potatoes. They are a great snack. reply hfhdjdks 1The GP is analyzing some dimensions to figure out if the success of Baldur&#x27;s Gate is surprising or not. He&#x2F;she finds that, given the limited dimensions we can consider, the success is surprising.I read your reply as saying \"no, it&#x27;s not possible to analyze why games fails &#x2F; succeed, because they&#x27;re all different\". I feel that&#x27;s usually unhelpful: assuming we can&#x27;t explain things because they&#x27;re all idiosyncratic is usually not productive. It&#x27;s more productive if you, for example, point to something extra that is missing. reply handmadeta 1I think OP is putting too much emphasis on brand and reputation. Blizzard had the best of both and they still manage to produce failure after failure (at least as far as critical acclaim goes). BattleBit had none is also a massive success. What makes a game fail or succeed? I don&#x27;t think anyone knows. But I am fairly sure that whatever AAA mainstream is doing isn&#x27;t really working. The biggest games are almost all either old franchises that usually have their roots in mods or some kind of simulator that just packages up and polishes something from the real world. So where has the innovation, the joy of video games gone? I think it&#x27;s being smothered by spreashsheets and processes. If that&#x27;s true then the solution is quite simple: Let people who actually like games and who can make games, make the games that people want. reply vvanders 1I&#x27;ve not been in that industry but was for a while, the closest input metric I ever saw that correlated to success was how fast your tools let you iterate on ideas to find the core of what was \"fun\" and the polish it until it shined. Same applied to the art side of the pipeline, the more headache importing&#x2F;iterating in-engine the more things diverged from render -> in-game.Oh and how much publishers meddled in games and&#x2F;or set constraints. At one point one of the big 3 wasn&#x27;t approving games that didn&#x27;t have multiplayer regardless of genre, got to spend ~5mo working on multiplayer that was totally broken until we got sign-off that we could pull it from the title. reply mastax 1> You need people who care and know what they are doing and let them do what they love.That includes Pillars of Eternity, and the other games I mentioned. They made great games but they just weren&#x27;t that popular. I agree in general about checkbox thinking. reply alexchantavy 1Nit: POE _is_ a success story (bootstrapped by a Kickstarter, proved that people still buy isometric CRPGs) but I get your point. Personally I grew up playing games and DnD campaigns in the Forgotten Realms setting and am thrilled to see it with modern graphics reply TillE 1Sure there&#x27;s no general formula, but it&#x27;s really not a surprise that the first big D&D videogame in a long time would be a huge success, after several years of tabletop D&D skyrocketing in popularity. reply galangalalgol 1This game also has the meta that most recent D&D games missed. If you know the tabletop game, you can build an optimized character in the bg series, because the game system is close wherever it can be. Some spells are just too freeform to work without a human DM, but they seem to have done very well, perhaps a bit too much focus on environmental damage like the divinity series, but they toned that down right? I haven&#x27;t looked at it in over a year. reply wlesieutre 1Main thing I&#x27;m missing so far is you can&#x27;t ready an action, which makes it nearly impossible to play defensively.If your turn doesn&#x27;t give you enough movement to run up to the enemies and stab them, you can&#x27;t say \"I run next to the doorway and wait to stab the first person who runs through it.\"Instead, you have to waste your turn and then stand around getting attacked. So it&#x27;s often to your advantage to roll worse in the initiative order, because the enemies will spend their turn dashing to within your movement range and then you actually get to hit them on your turn. Kind of hate it, rolling high initiative is supposed to let you get the drop on people or set up the battlefield more to your liking.BG3 players, please let me know if I&#x27;m missing something here. reply theoriginaldog 33 Ready an action could get really complicated from a design perspective, but I really miss the \"dodge\" action. It would&#x27;ve been easy to integrate and support offensive play. I use it in the tabletop often when I play tank characters to hold chokepoints. Interested in the reason why they don&#x27;t have it, maybe some EA players involved in the feedback process know why? reply dvngnt_ 1i think the key is to start combat in stealth so they&#x27;re surprised and they waste their first move reply wlesieutre Works for some characters, not really a strategy for a heavily armored fighter.And either way, if there&#x27;s a crowd of archers in the next room I wouldn&#x27;t want to walk in (sneaking or no) where I have no cover, so I&#x27;m going to try and hold at the door. Still the better play even if it costs a whole turn of not being able to use my action.The missing Ready action really tilts things toward those \"alpha strike\" characters made to hit first and hit hard, which isn&#x27;t a design choice I like much. I want to be able to lure enemies into a room with minor illusion or other sounds and have the whole party readied the jump them. reply theoriginaldog 28 Ready an action is only usable in combat, so RAW outside of combat readying actions to jump on people you lured with an illusion into a room is not possible. This is an ambush and would be dealt with stealth &#x2F; surprise rules and THAT is in the game, so it is possible if you play it by the rules.The ready action is designed to get used for delaying actions to bypass initiative order. reply jon-wood 1Even the ones I would never have expected to work do, I had a couple of potions of speaking to animals, which led to a lovely (fully voice acted) conversation with some oxen. reply ethbr0 1And I think this is one of the things modern games have missed for a lot of BG-era players -- discovery and delight.AAA production costs make it difficult: you can&#x27;t just spread the game&#x27;s budget equally into niche content most will never see.But if you do it smartly, it seems like there&#x27;s still financial and development space for \"Wouldn&#x27;t players find it cool if...?\" things.One of the major turn-offs of post-TES3 Bethesda style games has been just how soul-less the tracks through their content have been. It&#x27;s obvious anything \"weird\" had to get approved through a committee and was watered down in the process.Games were the better when there was a path for a development team member to have 10% time to implement some kooky feature.And maybe now that needs to flow through approval... but don&#x27;t soften it into pablum in the process. reply thebooktocome 1My first attempt with Speak with Animals led to a somewhat awkward conversation with a boar, whom an absent druid had recently promised a mate. His \"haunches\" clenched and quivered with anticipation.I laughed heartily. reply mlinhares 1Given almost every single D&D movie has been horrible it would be surprising if it wasn’t a well known studio like Larian doing it. It’s pretty common for games from existing “high profile” IP to be lazy, lackluster, money grabbing products.The last D&D game I remember, Dark Alliance, is horrible. reply MattRix 1The new D&D movie that just came out a few months ago was actually pretty fun, and it has a 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. reply Shared404 1Yep, went with my D&D party and a good time was had by all.Probably a high 7 or low 8 out of 10 for me. reply hombre_fatal I went in with zero expectations since nothing else was playing in my theater and I chuckled a good bit. Definitely fun and entertaining. reply mepian 1It&#x27;s one of the most entertaining movies I&#x27;ve seen in years, I recommend it wholeheartedly. reply starttoaster 1I had fond memories of Dark Alliance. You maybe didn’t like it, and coming out for a console with no PC release was an odd choice for the series, but there was fun gameplay and story there. At least, 13 year old me playing co-op with my Dad through Dark Alliance 1 and 2 on my PS2 is a fond memory I have that maybe nobody else got.Anyway, I was just surprised because I guess I never looked up a review of the Dark Alliance games but my general impression was actually pretty good.edit: Apparently there is a Dark Alliance game with a naming collision that came out much more recently than the Dark Alliance series I&#x27;m thinking of. Smart move, Wizards of the Coast&#x2F;DnD. reply Cornbilly 1They may be referring to the version of Dark Alliance that was released a couple of years ago. It was pretty much a dud. reply foobazgt 1I had the same reaction as GP, thanks for the explanation! I don&#x27;t think the original DA games hold up too well nowadays, but they were good at the time and still provide me with fond memories. reply starttoaster 1Ah, probably my mistake then. Wasn&#x27;t even aware that Wizards of the Coast decided to make a brand new game with a name collision there. reply mlinhares 12021 to be precise. replyelefanten 1Fair observations broadly, but gp’s points are fair too. It’s hard to predict hits but the points listed are all factors that helped the title out. Larian got the contract precisely because they proved themselves to be what you describe in your last sentence through the Divinity releases gp mentions. And even that was no guarantee here. reply thereisnojesus 1This game is huge. It&#x27;s 4 modern games in one. I am curious how one keeps a budget for a game like this. I agree love and passion are the reason this game is doing well, but honestly how do you convince the money to invest in something like, besides the trend of copying BG3 simply due to success? reply chii > honestly how do you convince the money to invest in something like, besides the trend of copying BG3 simply due to success?you cannot. The money is interested in making more money. Good art may, or may not make money - and that&#x27;s because the goal of the artist(s) aren&#x27;t aligned with making money. It just so happens that it _could_ make money, and thus that became the pitch to investors.If given the chance (imagine an unlimited UBI for example), the same artists would make such a game without investors (and might make an even better one...). reply jncfhnb 1Seems like a pointless retort given their first point was that they had just made a great game previously. reply iancmceachern Indeed. This is true for most creative pursuits.It reminds me of the montage scene in Matrix 4 where all these business types are telling Neo how to make a new hit game, when he already had made one, so he should be telling them.This difference, is the key difference I&#x27;ve seen in my career between successful startups and ones that fail. reply captainbland 1Depends what you mean by \"fail\". The MBA is going to be perfectly happy with a profit margin even if the metacritic score is well within the yellow range. Plenty of rehashed sports games and even beloved but ultimately fairly lazy franchises like Pokémon and Sonic (most recently ticking that open world.. er, excuse me, zone box) seem to do fairly well from that point of view. reply Waterluvian 1There must be at least some partial formula if some companies can consistently make critically acclaimed commercial successes. reply Novosell 1Are there any companies continuously making widely different critically acclaimed games? or do they typically have a hit and then make games in the same vein? Bioware had a certain take on RPGs, same with Bethesda&#x27;s modern Fallout&#x2F;Elder Scrolls, FromSoft make DS derivatives, etc.If I&#x27;m missing some studio which has a diverse catalogue of consistently successful games, then please tell me which. But I feel they usually find a niche and then work that. reply lobocinza Valve and Obsidian Entertainment have such catalogue but even great studios fail from time to time.Most will find a formula that works for a niche and stick with it. Which is smart because innovation increases both the chance of achieving something great and of releasing a fiasco. reply noirbot 1Supergiant is pretty close? Bastion, Transistor, Pyre and Hades have all been pretty big hits in different genres and styles. They&#x27;re consistently high production value in terms of art&#x2F;soundtrack&#x2F;writing, but the gameplay varies a good bit. About the same release cadence as Bethesda in my memory while being a smaller studio. reply Shared404 1FromSoft is also making a new Armored Core, which I imagine should be pretty different from Dark Souls. reply Waterluvian 1I’m not sure I follow the point of this criteria. They find niches and leverage their experience. This is what everyone in the professional world does.The point is that there must be a formula if studios can consistently deliver. reply weard_beard 1Rockstar has grand theft auto and grand theft horse.I hope some day to play grand theft spaceship, grand theft dragon, and maybe grand theft dinosaur. reply majormajor 1Nintendo? but that&#x27;s more \"publisher who curates external- or internal-studios who largely stay in the same genre each\" reply Novosell 1Yeah, Nintendo is the publisher in most of those scenarios. The individual studios, including Nintedo, tend to just iterate from what I can see. reply majormajor 1I wonder what the \"new game onboarding\" process at Nintendo looks like. Thinking of something relatively more left-field and recent like the Mario Rabbids tactical thing for Switch.Was that pitched to them? Solicited to studios by them? In the latter case that would be a fascinating process to observe. reply Waterluvian 1Whatever you label them, the same studios keep pumping out great games. reply rozab 1That&#x27;s all well and good, but all of this success is happening before reviews are in or anyone has even had time to play and recommend the game. People are buying it solely based on criteria like the parent described. reply squeaky-clean It&#x27;s been in Early Access for about 4 years now. I bought it because of word-of-mouth and reviews from the Early Access players. reply cyanydeez 1I&#x27;d hazard diablo4 wasn&#x27;t as award winning as nostalgia dictated, leading to baldurs gate gaining that. reply lylejantzi3rd 1> I definitely underestimated the brand power of DnD and Baldur&#x27;s GateI think you&#x27;re trying to put too much of its success on \"brand power\". Social proof is a thing, but it&#x27;s not powerful enough to overcome a bad game. Just look at what happened to the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises.I think it&#x27;s doing so well because they nailed the execution. The graphics are great. The game hasn&#x27;t had any opening week disasters despite getting more than 7x the expected numbers. The intro hook of the game really grabs you and keeps you wanting more (which is why everyone&#x27;s still so excited about it 3 years later). Also, it&#x27;s FUN to play.That last one is probably the biggest factor. When was the last time a AAA game was truly fun to play? It wasn&#x27;t too long ago that online streamers were publishing videos lamenting the lack of good games to play. reply theoriginaldog 21 >When was the last time a AAA game was truly fun to play? Tears of the Kingdom just recently is hella fun to play. Elden Ring last year was also great. You make it sound the last fun AAA game is decades ago, but the truth is that most years have 1-2 really fun AAA games. But Baldurs Gate 3 is definitely the first fun AAA game for years in its genre. Pillars of Eternity was great, but lacked the AAA production values&#x2F; reply mastax 1I mentioned many other great games in this genre which were lucky to have 1&#x2F;100th of the success of this game. But okay, those didn&#x27;t have the multiplayer, or the presentation, or the accessibility.But Larian&#x27;s previous game was extremely similar to this one in all respects. It&#x27;s not even that flippant to say BG3 is DOS2 with the lore and rules swapped for DnD ones which isn&#x27;t that much of a practical difference (I&#x27;d argue a slight downgrade). And yet BG3 is on track to be maybe 4x as successful. It&#x27;s hard to argue the BG and DnD brands didn&#x27;t play a big part in this. reply moonchrome I&#x27;ve never played BG (I did play icewind Dale when I was a kid but it was annoying to read the dialogue without voice acting). I did play all Neverwinter Nights games so I have some background in this genere and DnD rules - but that was always the tedious part for me.I heard of Divinity but just not into gaming anymore (too much other stuff going on). That said I&#x27;ll probably find the time to play this on PS5 because it seems like a super polished immersive experience. Just like cyberpunk (although that was a bit disappointing).My point is there&#x27;s probably a bunch of \"ex\" gamers that pick a few games to play occasionally - it&#x27;s very much down to quality of execution - if this game didn&#x27;t have the graphics&#x2F;voice acting&#x2F;story I&#x27;ve seen from early access and was divinity level I&#x27;d just skip this as well. reply kevinmchugh 14 people in my friend group have been rearranging their schedules this weekend to get more BG3 time (after previously planning on playing once a week). It&#x27;s possible that a DOS3 might&#x27;ve had that happening, at least 2 of the 4 played DOS2 but I am skeptical.They all have preexisting affection for both D&D and BG. They went into character creation with strong opinions about their favorite races and esp. classes. reply disgruntledphd2 1The DOS system was great, but the lore and stories were relatively formulaic. I was super, super worried about Larian doing BG3 because of this, but they really do appear to have nailed it.At least so far, the difficulty curve is much less steep which I suspect put a lot of people off DOS2. I certainly resented needing to kill everyone to remain on track with the XP curve, but that&#x27;s presumably because Pillars has spoiled me. reply bugglebeetle 1I love DOS2, but BG3 is SO much more polished in just about every aspect, better visuals, better writing, better combat, that I expect this accounts for a lot of the difference. reply jncfhnb 1> When was the last time a AAA game was truly fun to play?Tears of the Kingdom, Resident evil 4, Street Fighter 6 reply lylejantzi3rd 1Interest in Tears of the Kingdom dropped off pretty quickly.Is that all?edit: I didn&#x27;t play the other two games. One&#x27;s a remake of a game I never played (I never owned playstations) and I don&#x27;t really play fighting games. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯edit2: this is getting ridiculous. reply theoriginaldog 17 > Interest in Tears of the Kingdom dropped off pretty quickly. So are you now talking about what AAA games are fun to play or how big the interest is in them? Tears of the Kingdom is definitely an AAA game that is really fun to play and was also very successful. Elden Ring last year was also great. Your perception of fun AAA games is just warped. Baldurs Gate 3 is the first fun AAA game for years in its own genre, but if you include all genres there are actually quite good and fun AAA games that came out recently. reply deng 1According to Metacritic, in addition to the already mentioned people had fun withMetroid Prime RemasteredDiablo IVPersona 4 GoldenDead Space RemakeFinal Fanatasy XVIPikmin 4Star Wars Jedi SurvivorHogwarts LegacyRemnant IISo this year actually seems to be pretty great w.r.t. AAA games, and the next months will be pretty ridiculous, with Armored Core VI, Starfield, Mortal Kombat 1, Forza Motorsport, Alan Wake 2, Spider-Man 2, Cities: Skylines 2, Super Mario RPG... all still being released.So if anything, there&#x27;s probably too much AAA games worth playing out there. reply csa 1> Diablo IVYou must have missed the 2.2 score that it currently has after being review bombed due to recent development decisions.On a personal level, I will say that they got the campaign right, but the rest of the game is incomplete. This game should have been released as a public beta — it’s currently not close to being a complete experience, imho. reply rejectfinite 1That&#x27;s just cuz a recent patch nerfed some things reply deng 1User scores are completely broken, and probably beyond repair. reply RHSeeger 1The low score is not completely unwarranted, though. The game itself is pretty wonderful. But the balancing and QOL decisions made by the developers has been; abysmal, and getting worse with each patch. It sounds like 1.1.1 is going to help a bit, but every the game started with serious issues, and each patch since release has made it worse. Add to the fact that many of the issues have been know since before release, and you get players getting really made about the game.If you actively make decisions to upset the players, then don&#x27;t act confused when your player rating tanks. reply deng 1I don&#x27;t play Diablo IV (I just don&#x27;t have the time), so I cannot judge if these scores are warranted. Seeing that it currently sits between Lego Drive 2K and Gollum, I&#x27;d go out on a limb here and say that this score seems a tiny bit harsh to me.Games get review-bombed for the silliest reasons nowadays. Often times, a fundamentalist minority of gamers feels overly protective about \"their\" franchise, reacting to even the tiniest disturbance with maniacal anger. If a game has a high score from critics and a low score from users, to me that&#x27;s actually a good sign that the game might even try something interesting (Last of Us II would be an example here). Of course, the critics score for Diablo IV was the post-release score, not including these new patches, so it might very well be that it really is worse now... reply RHSeeger 1I&#x27;m not a fan of review bombing, and I think it&#x27;s current player score (2.2 &#x2F; 1-) is an unfair result of that; the over the top backlash to the changes. That being said, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say the 86 &#x2F; 100 critics view isn&#x27;t reasonable either. It had issues at release, and it&#x27;s gotten worse since then. My recommendation would be to give it a few seasons to get into a better shape before picking it up.It&#x27;s worth noting that Diablo 3 went through similar pains upon release; though with less \"read the room\" type issues like they&#x27;re having now. reply ThatPlayer 1Yeah, it turns out no one review bombs unpopular games that they&#x27;ve never heard of. replyvanderZwan 1> Pikmin 4As a long-time Pikmin fan it is absolutely wild to me to see Pikmin 4 in a list of AAA games.There&#x27;s nothing else like that series in terms of aesthetics, in-game lore or gameplay. It&#x27;s always been its own singular sub-genre which screams \"indy game\", and the mediocre sales reflected that. Except that it just happens to also be a first-party Nintendo game that Shigeru Miyamoto is personally invested in.And now Pikmin 4 suddenly blows everyone&#x27;s expectations away. reply rejectfinite 1Noooo you don&#x27;t get it, only niche pixel indie games can be FUN!!! &#x2F;s reply mark38848 That has actually been my experience for about ten years now. I&#x27;ve tried TOTK, Elden Ring, Hogwarts Legacy, BG3, and quite a few more and found them not engaging at all. It&#x27;s not quite as bad as the movies yet, but still bad enough as to not warrant simply playing older or more indie titles. reply jncfhnb 1If you don’t know anything about large franchises such as street fighter and resident evil then you’re probably not well positioned to make sweeping comments about the state of AAA games. reply lylejantzi3rd 1That&#x27;s a mighty fine gate you&#x27;re keeping. Well, you&#x27;re trying to keep it, anyway. A for effort! reply jncfhnb 1I don’t think it’s gate keeping to suggest you should be familiar with the biggest titles of the year if you want to make confident statements about the state of games. reply Eldt 1It&#x27;s not a gate, it&#x27;s recognition of your lack of knowledge reply lylejantzi3rd 1So in order to have an opinion, you must play every game that ever comes out, regardless of whether you enjoy the genre, the franchise, or even have the console required to play it? And you think that&#x27;s not gatekeeping? reply jncfhnb 1In order to have a credible opinion about things you should be familiar with the things. reply satvikpendem 1Why are you building a strawman? No one said anything about \"playing every game that ever comes out\" in order to have am opinion, just that it&#x27;s useful to have some knowledge of a topic before forming said opinion lest they be dismissed as yours seem to be currently. reply jasonlotito 1Not the parent, but the gate keeping is coming from you. Your question, assuming good faith, was simple:\"When was the last time a AAA game was truly fun to play?\"The comment in reply answer the question.You then preceded to gatekeep by redefining what \"AAA game\" meant but dismissing the ones listed out of ignorance.I can think of numerous AAA games that are fun to play. the first one that came to mind was Elden Ring. I know others that while I didn&#x27;t play, others loved, such as God of War.Rather than ask a question and start dismissing answers, gate keeping what \"AAA game\" means, instead accept the fact that there are numerous AAA games that have been released this year alone that people are having lots of fun with. That doesn&#x27;t take away from smaller, indy titles, nor does it mean AAA is without fault.tl;dr: Stop gatekeeping with ignorance. replydkersten 1Most people don’t get over 50 to 100 hours in any game, regardless of how fun the game is, so players dropping off playing a single player game after they’ve finished the story is pretty much normal, even on highly replayable games. reply whateveracct 1What do you mean by \"interest\" for ToTK? People are still playing it who got it on launch day. I know I am. reply mark38848 I know I stopped after two days. reply PurpleRamen 1Zelda was a massive hit in sales and social media-reception for months. Interest did not dropped quickly, it was just at instant peak from the beginning, and now everyone is done with it. Which is more a proof of how much fun people had with it. reply spacemadness 1If you know nothing of those games, you might want to stop with the gaming critique. reply MisterBastahrd 1Street Fighter 6 literally gave players something they&#x27;ve been dreaming about for years: the ability to customize a character to one&#x27;s own liking based off of the moves of the existing characters in the game.Want to dragon punch like Ryu, throw a sonic boom like Guile, and kick like Chun Li? You can do that now. reply ipaddr 1Maybe I&#x27;m a purist but that sounds awful.. If you want Ryu&#x27;s moves you have to take his shortcomings. Don&#x27;t super charge your player into something a backstory can&#x27;t support reply MisterBastahrd ... what are you even talking about?There&#x27;s an entire normal arcade mode where the characters are balanced and tiered. All the tournament formats use those presets.Then there&#x27;s the open world mode where your own character learns from these characters and creates your own moveset. reply rejectfinite 1Resident Evil 4 first came out on Gamecube, later on it also came out on PS2 and PC.

Video games are not just for teenagers you know. reply RHSeeger 1While I think \"everybody\" is stretching it... the general idea here is accurate. From my memory, the first two \"rounds\" of good D&D games on the PC were the SSI games (Eye of the Beholder, Pools of Radiance, etc) and then Baldur&#x27;s Gate. Both of those series, when they came out, set the bar for D&D RPG games (and RPG games in general, to some extent). If you played that type of game, you played those games (and likely Bards Tale and Wizardry).To this day, there are quotes that live on from Baldur&#x27;s Gate (\"Go for the eyes, Boo!\"). It has place in a lot of people&#x27;s hearts. Had BG3 been bad, it would have been a horror show of hate for the developer. But it looks like they delivered, and the adoring fans of decades ago appreciate that. reply aoanla Eh, I am an exception - I played Eye of the Beholder a bit (but never completed it), and I had Bard&#x27;s Tale (and never completed it), but I never got the Baldur&#x27;s Gate games (despite being an active computer gamer at the time, and liking TTRPGs). To be fair, though, that&#x27;s partly because my experience in not being able to finish the above too games due to the difficulty of the combat put me off CRPGs almost completely (until the more recent era of combatless or near-combatless RPGs with things like Disco Elysium). reply pixelpoet 1I&#x27;m about 40 and am usually grouped as a millennial (at least for the common purpose of blame, e.g. killing cinemas), though I somehow missed Baldur&#x27;s Gate; played the hell out of the Ultima series though! reply torgian 1This is something I wish could come back. Ultima was a great series, and I even liked the trash heaps that were Ultima 8 and 9.Unfortunately, EA still holds the rights. The new mmo-ish game that Garriet made is one I have not really dived into yet reply TillE 1The Ultimas were (mostly) wonderful, especially Ultima 7, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything particularly valuable about the \"IP\".It was really about Garriott exploring innovative ways in how to translate the tabletop RPG experience into a computer game. You don&#x27;t need an Avatar or Britannia to pursue ideas like Ultima 4&#x27;s virtue system or Ultima 7&#x27;s interactivity. reply lamontcg 1> played the hell out of the Ultima series though!this is Wizardry III erasure.(i&#x27;m a bit older and solidly GenX) reply caskstrength 1> Absolutely everybody who owned a PC for gaming in the late 90&#x27;s played BG1 and BG2, no matter the age.Maybe among your friends? Sales numbers don&#x27;t back that up and anecdotally among my friends and classmates barely anyone played BG, but everyone played Quake, StarCraft, Diablo, Need For Speed, etc. Even among RPGs Morrowing and Fallout were much more popular and accessible back in the day. reply aoanla 1I had a gaming PC in the late 90s and absolutely did not play BG1 or 2. I briefly tried PlaneScape: Torment several years after its release on the urging of one of its fans, but didn&#x27;t make it past the early parts due to being annoyed by the random thugs that would assault you if you stood still for too long, and the pseudo-realtime 2e-based combat being Byzantine and off-putting. reply adastra22 1Yeah I haven’t played a game other than Minecraft in two decades, although I was a huge gamer in my teens. Never touched BG. reply tda 1I have games plenty, but had never even heard about the Valeurs Gate franchise until last week. I must have been in a different bubble with Dune 2, Red Alert, Some City 2000, Tomb Raider, GTA3, Dungeon master and probably some more that I can&#x27;t recall now. But the whole fantasy RPG wasn&#x27;t really my thing I guess reply Agingcoder 1I agree with you, but eventually realized there was a specific reason. RPGs at that time were much less immersive, so much so that I had no interest whatsoever in the genre. And no I neither enjoyed eye of the beholder 2, nor lands of lore, nor ultima underworld , nor ultima, nor baldurs gate.Modern rpgs ( Witcher 3, dos2, etc), on the contrary, are amazing : technology has finally caught up, and my mind no longer has to compensate for the rather bland visual&#x2F;sounds&#x2F;lack of voices&#x2F;limited freedom&#x2F;etc.I used to play dune2, red alert, sim city, etc but these days I play rpgs ! reply Ekaros 1I think only GTA 3 is contemporary to it. Others are earlier games, which might explain things. reply tda 1I thought all these games were end of nineties, but I didn&#x27;t check and am not so good at this. Anyways, I never stopped gaming since reply jakebasile 1I like the CRPG genre a lot, but I think one reason that BG3 is taking off is that it _looks_ like a modern AA(A?) game while the rest look basically like Baldur&#x27;s Gate did in 1998. BG3 lets you see the world in a lot more detail and it helps immerse you in Faerûn.Many people will claim \"graphics don&#x27;t matter\", but the reality is that they do help. reply flohofwoe 1TBH it looks and especially feels much more like a reskinned Divine Divinity OS2 with DnD rules implanted than BG1 and BG2 (which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing of course, but I don&#x27;t feel a lot of BG1 and BG2 nostalgia when playing BG3, instead I&#x27;m constantly reminded of OS2).PS: One thing that is a lot better than in BG1 and BG2 is that combat with low-class characters feels a lot more interesting. Not sure how much of this is because of the ADnD vs DnD5 rules or whether Larian has added some tweaks to the DnD5 rules. reply theoriginaldog 12 And yet the graphics are obviously better and more immersive than BG 1 and 2. Of course they build their technology from their previous games, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that most other CCRPGs are less immersive for most gamers. I am pretty confident that high fidelity 3D graphics attract more gamers than isometric 2D, no matter if these look like the studios previous game. reply jakebasile 1The closest game that BG3 \"feels like\" to me is Dragon Age: Origins, which is great since I loved that game and the sequels just never did it for me. reply oblio 1The sequels just turned it into action games for the sake of 10% extra sales and for console ports. reply Shared404 1Haven&#x27;t play BG3 yet, but my DM has been and noted a few tweaks that Larian made to 5e, especially around spell durations and moving shoving to a bonus action. reply D13Fd 1The screenshots definitely look like DOS2. reply antisthenes > Not sure how much of this is because of the ADnD vs DnD5 rules or whether Larian has added some tweaks to the DnD5 rules.That&#x27;s entirely on D&D 5e rules. Combat with chars under lvl 5 is essentially 1 mechanic per class, and really boring.Tabletop suffers from exactly the same issue, even if you use all the extra&#x2F;optional subclasses and backstories. So does Solasta (the other 5e PC game) reply ReptileMan 1Properly drawn isometric is timeless ... reply imbnwa 1>Many people will claim \"graphics don&#x27;t matter\", but the reality is that they do help.Yeah, it was hard for me to get into Path of Exile over D3 and D4, despite being a technically &#x27;deeper&#x27; game reply mark38848 Graphics might be good in BG3 but the art style is non-existent. Generic clear skies or scorching red purgatory fantasy setting. People flying around on dragons fighting Cthulhu&#x27;s aunt. Man I&#x27;d love being able to love that. reply jakebasile Speak for yourself, I&#x27;ve found the world art assets in BG3 both high quality and well made. The detail on the characters and their arms and armor is intricate, too. reply wlesieutre 1I&#x27;ve made a habit of not buying games at launch anymore. Most of them are nagging me for microtransactions (rant: don&#x27;t like that word for repeated $10 purchases on top of a $70 game, that&#x27;s not \"micro\" at all), they require an internet connection for single player, or are otherwise full of bullshit that to me makes them not worth $60+.This one doesn&#x27;t do that, so I bought it!I&#x27;ve never played any of the previous Baldur&#x27;s Gate games, but I did play Neverwinter Nights (2002) so I have some nostalgia for computer D&D.Haven&#x27;t tried the multiplayer yet, but I probably will. I heard there are some kinks to work out with drop in&#x2F;out characters, but maybe that&#x27;s just how it&#x27;s going to work and you&#x27;re expected to commit to one group the whole way through. reply theoriginaldog 10 I think I just like different genres of games, because all the games I bought at launch in the last years never had these issues you describe. Zelda, Elden Ring, God of War eg. reply phyrex Thang’s, that’s good to hear. I’ve been incredibly disappointed with diablo 4 for that reason! reply wlesieutre Yeah there&#x27;s lots of reasons I didn&#x27;t buy it, even though I enjoyed a lot of Diablo 3 and thought the Diablo 4 beta was fun enough. I got D3 after the expansion unfucked the loot drop rates that had been tuned super rare to drive people to the real money auction house.Fingers crossed that Diablo 4 will eventually be on sale for $30 and have reached a point where it&#x27;s worth that much. That&#x27;s my price cap for anything with always online single player, and I can&#x27;t see that being fixed.Maybe I can be generous and bump it up to $35 now to give them 50% of the launch price. reply jncfhnb 1Divinity 2 did about 700k units in the first month. I think this is about on par with expectations with a bigger brand.I think Larian’s approach to multiplayer is the important bit. I would be curious about the stats of how people play it.I feel like once you have done a couple CRPGs you’ve kind of seen it all. I’ve done divinity and kingmaker. I can’t really be motivated to do tyranny or the other pathfinder game by owlcat. It’s just so samey.I will grant, Larian’s divinity 2 did feel a bit different. They managed to make combat feel more interesting. And playing split screen with the wife made it much more enjoyable. Optimistic they’ve done it again here. reply mastax 1Yeah the Divinity: Original Sin 2 combat system had the huge emphasis on elemental effects and surfaces and interactions which I found a lot more fun than the traditional RPG systems which feel more like solving a math equation.So far there has been a lot less of that in BG3 which is disappointing but maybe I just need to level up my spellcasters more. (I hate the DnD spell preparation system but that&#x27;s another matter) reply jterrys 1The element interaction from Divinity: Original Sin 2 are still there. Grease works and will catch fire, you can get ice spike and it&#x27;ll create an ice surface where enemies and players will slip, then turn into a puddle next turn. They will also slip on a sufficiently large puddle of blood. The intro ship has vats of mysterious liquid that will catch fire. reply jsnell 1> I think this is about on par with expectations with a bigger brand.No, this is wildly beyond expectations. They sold 2.5M copies of BG3 in Early Access (>500k in July alone) which is already amazing, but one might have expected it to eat into their launch day numbers as most of the fans already bought in during EA. Instead it it looks like they probably sold ~10M more copies just in the 3 days after launch. reply jncfhnb 1Hmm interesting. I guess consider me confused then too. I don’t get how a crpg has this much appeal. I’m not expecting this to be substantially better than divinity 2; which isn’t meant to be an insult any way. reply theoriginaldog 7 Its the brand. DnD had a major grow in the last years. DnD live play shows are getting their own animated series produced by amazon prime video. It became huge. There is your divinity 2 delta. reply suryong 1Because it is actually an RPG, there is actually choices there, even in Act 1 there are quite few major choices that have big ramifications in Act 2. Take something like Pillars of Eternity, it mostly had the illusion of choice and not much real reactivity, the npcs might say few different lines but it really did not matter much.I am tired of the games that present you with illusion of choice but it actually doesn&#x27;t matter. In BG3 you can actually be the evil character so that by itself lends the game at least for 2 playthroughs. Personally I am playing it through as Dark Urge first, and later going to do another run with good druid.Also the graphics are really nice, almost everything is voice acted, companions have interesting stories. Story is already much better than divinity 2. I have 39 hours in now and I bought it at launch reply bigger_cheese I think you&#x27;ve hit the nail on the head here with the illusion of choice in some games it really feels like the story is on rails and your character had very little agency. Mass Effect series in particular I think is to blame for this the series became incredibly popular but the actual role playing elements were not really there - these games had a Hero&#x2F;Villain slider and every conversation had basically 3 dialogue options, the edgy sarcastic reply, the goody two shoes reply or the neutral reply. You would arrive at same place on dialogue tree. The story proceeded the same way regardless of how you chose to act. Because of how popular Mass Effect was I think it had a warping effect on the genre.Voice acting as well is another key thing I think easy to overlook but it helps a lot with the immersion and getting invested in the world. Pathfinder Wrath of Righteous was a fun game but lack of voice acting made it a slog to get through there were what felt like paragraphs of text to read through constantly. By mid way through the game I found myself skipping over a lot of it. Imagine if tabletop roleplaying the DM handed you a stack of paper to read every conversation instead of narrating what was happening - that was kind of how I felt. replynottorp 1Two things:1. As it&#x27;s been said before, if you go at it MBA style you&#x27;ll end up with a crap soul less design by commitee game.2. DnD has a lot of brand power? The only thing related to DnD that I did was play some computer RPGs. The Infinity Engine games could have had any other RPG system in the background and they&#x27;d have been as much fun.3. Getting Early Access wrong too. It got popular in early access because some people considered it good.4. You may be right about Baldur&#x27;s Gate nostalgia, that is probably the greatest driver behind this. Personally I will get the game because of said nostalgia, but I&#x27;ll wait for enough reviews to have something to read between the lines and decide if the game is any good. reply theoriginaldog 3 You missed a lot in the last 5 years, DnD has become huge. Not in the video game sector, but thats why the huge DnD fanbase is craving for a good video game and BG3 delivered. I think most buyers are actually driven by that and not BG nostalgia. reply MisterBastahrd 1DnD literally had a hugely successful movie release starring multiple A list actors not that long ago. reply Arrath 1And it&#x27;s had a consistent presence in Stranger Things on Netflix, helping expose it to a younger generation who missed out on the D&D moral panic, BG&#x2F;NWN, the first movie, and so on. reply nottorp 1And I&#x27;m a Baldur&#x27;s Gate (somewhat reluctant) fan and I don&#x27;t even know there was a DnD movie out recently :) reply RHSeeger 1It&#x27;s actually a pretty fun movie. It has references to lots of fun D&D history, including the old cartoon. I enjoyed it, my wife enjoyed it, and my daughter (who knows nothing of D&D and doesn&#x27;t really like fantasy) enjoyed it. reply gmerc 1I think you underestimate GenX&#x2F;Y and our love for the time when games were not micrtransaction laced dopamine enginesBG2 was, for almost all of the 2000s, one of the highest ranked games of all time. reply ls612 1A lot of it is also that lots of big AAA non-live-service games were delayed by the lockdowns of 2020 and this year is when their releases have all piled up. reply remcob 1It’s also the only high production game with native MacOS & M1 support I could find. I got the early access just to see what M1 GPU can do and was impressed. reply bugglebeetle 1Caveat here being that the full game has yet to release on Mac. The release date for the full Mac game is TBD. reply actualwitch 1They said they are aiming for september 6 mac release date. reply lobocinza > But those games were generally less accessible, mostly not multiplayer, and again lacked the brand power.Creative Assembly&#x27;s Total War series had good and popular games but their popularity exploded when they made a Warhammer game despite the original fanbase preferring historical games and many hoping for a TW Medieval 3. Most games with the Warhammer IP at that time were mediocre at best. So brand doesn&#x27;t carry on it&#x27;s own and it helps when your target audience has nothing else that they might be interested to play when your game is released. Diablo 4 sucks and Pillars 2 was released in 2018. reply meroes 1Was nice to see their videos and developer videos in contrast to others like Blizzard&#x2F;Diablo IV.I know you can’t really tell based on one parameter like this, but you also kind of can.You can tell by this they got the product out they wanted and worked till it was complete. That goes a long way. reply orbital-decay There&#x27;s a lot more to it than just Larian. It&#x27;s mostly about a niche community developing into a mainstream one, and the public growing tired of the same stuff.After the golden age of late 90s, CRPGs went into shadows of a very narrow niche until maybe 2012-2013. Larian were unlucky enough to work during that winter, and their games weren&#x27;t particularly successful, although well known in the niche community. Pure RPGs were always niche, and it was hard for them to survive because the market has been split into AAA and indie, leaving no space for anything in between.Then the non-mainstream communities like RPG Codex produced several indie RPGs like Age of Decadence which also piqued curiosity of the people outside of the niche who grew tired of the constant stream of shallow same-face sandbox action soups with RPG elements like Skyrim.Larian in particular decided to have their presence on RPG Codex and 100% cater to their desires. They crowdsourced Divinity Original Sin development and implemented almost every reasonable advice RPG nerds gave them under their own vision. The result was a solid and fun game that was a breath of fresh air in the context of 2014. Since about that time, pure RPGs formed a much larger following that steadily grew over the years.The current sales are mostly because the genre itself got popular again - without it they couldn&#x27;t have possibly reached those numbers regardless of the quality of their game, as they never did in the previous 2 decades.2011-2014 were transformative years after the massive boredom of the \"next-gen\" treadmill of the mid-late 2000s. CRPG is not the only genre that benefited from that. Military-like sandbox games skyrocketed in popularity, giving birth to various offshoots like Battle Royale; soulslike games multiplied; there was even a short revival of arena shooters, although not really successful. reply lamontcg 1> DnD has a lot of brand power and has been strongly in the zeitgeist for years.I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re understating this and it is actually strengthening a lot.For example google trends shows \"dnd\" taking off:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?date=all&q=%22dnd%2...It is actively trendy right now. reply caskstrength 1> There&#x27;s a big cohort of millennials who have strong nostalgia for Baldur&#x27;s Gate and who have plenty of money to buy games (if not time to play them).I don&#x27;t think that demographic is driving the sales. Anecdotally I hear&#x2F;read fans of originals mostly complaining about how this is some turn-based reskinned D:OS with Zoomer-oriented Critical Role-themed writing and VO. reply thefz 1You forget Larian&#x27;s charisma. Some comical undertones (especially in DOS 1), likeable characters, fun dialogues... the reasons are many.And DOS2 had the best combat in decades. reply taurath 1> But also there have been a load of really good CRPGs in recent years and there seemed to be a pretty low ceiling to how much interest they could getCRPGs aren&#x27;t a genre, but RPGs are. wRPGs like Mass Effect, Fallout, TES, The Witcher are some of the most popular franchises in all of gaming. Then you have jRPGs like Zelda, Elden Ring... The ones you listed are similar to Divinity & BG3, but the fact is the games are either on the extreme end of hardcore (Pathfinder especially), or are made without the production values or marketing. You&#x27;ve got examples likeThe main difference that would still throw a lot of games is that BG3 is turn based combat, but I&#x27;d argue that with the dialogue, branching trees etc its more akin to Mass Effect or Fallout. Ultimately its its own thing, and it is a well crafted game, in a setting that many core fans already know and love. reply snird 1Me and my friends (5 in this case) bought the game yesterday.It had nothing to do with \"brand power\" - we didn&#x27;t even know it was DnD.We just bought what seems like a great game with no bullshit microtransaction.I think you are overanalyzing it. reply PurpleRamen 1I would put BG3 easily in the top10 of most anticipated games in 2023. Even if one does not know the franchise, the amount of articles and mentions in the last weeks was a good sign. Especially as it was an Early Access-Game, and not something that just drop from a void. So people already knew for a while that it will be pretty good. But I guess, especially because of this, it was also easy to filter out if one is not in the bubble. reply dageshi 1I think a lot of games over the years have borrowed elements from DnD and so there&#x27;s a massive audience out there of people primed to be interested in the real deal when it arrives.The fact it had such a great reputation from the fanbase who&#x27;d been playing it in early access probably pushed a lot of people to go ahead and get it. reply lacy_tinpot 1Wasteland 3 seems to be always left out. It&#x27;s an incredible rpg that deserves more attention imo. reply CamperBob2 1They&#x27;ve also done a great job marketing it. I&#x27;ve seen ads and references to it in places that normally wouldn&#x27;t cover RPGs. reply jakebasile 1It&#x27;s a really, really good game. I&#x27;m glad they decided to make it turn based vs the real time with pause, though I know that&#x27;s a somewhat controversial decision (what isn&#x27;t?). The game itself is beautiful, the music is immersive, the writing is (so far) intriguing, and it runs on Linux with only minor tweaks. The game does wonders to capture the feel of playing a well-DMed campaign.It&#x27;s no surprise to me that it&#x27;s getting a lot more sales than they expected, and I&#x27;m glad to see devs get rewarded for making a quality product. reply heywoodlh 1Absolutely agree.I love the idea behind CRPGs, but have found that I have a difficult time committing to them. I.E. I own Divinity 2, but have struggled to get past the first few hours of the story as the first area makes it so open-ended it&#x27;s tough to know how to move forward. Additionally, turn-based games often get quickly boring for me as they are often so challenging it doesn&#x27;t feel worth it (I&#x27;m aware I definitely fall under the \"casual\" category in this realm).After playing BG3 for over ten hours, I&#x27;m hooked. It seems they have struck such a great balance for me (on the \"Balanced\" difficulty) at making combat engaging, difficult and interesting -- but not so difficult I get bored&#x2F;hate it. As a casual CRPG gamer, BG3 seems to have struck a near-perfect balance for me.One of my favorite moments so far: get into a fight with a group of around 10 goblins with my 3-member group. I&#x27;m outnumbered so I fall back to a somewhat narrow bridge, to serve as a bottleneck. Once I have all 3 members of my group on the bridge (none of the goblins have made it yet), I throw a grease bottle at the beginning of the bridge to slow down my enemies. Sure enough, it slowed down my enemies enough that when they got to the bridge, I took them out with my two archer party members.Amazing game. reply bigger_cheese The difficulty ramps a fair bit at least in my experience I have just started act 3.There are also zones later in the acts where they disable resting - this really impacts spell casters. You have to really ration your ability usage (rely on consumables for healing etc), somewhat annoyingly you have no real way of knowing how far through the no-rest zones you are (could be 4 or 5 fights in a row you need to get through or only 1 or 2). I&#x27;d often end these zones with big spells still in reserve cleric in particular with turn undead would have helped immensely in one area but I thought there would be another fight still to come so I saved it. This is somewhat true to tabletop D&D but left me feeling a little frustrated I think on repeated playthroughs these areas will be much less frustrating. reply lost_tourist Sometimes you just have to swallow your pride and watch a couple walkthroughs and character build videos to get into a game from someone who has mastered it; just to get over that hump. reply paulryanrogers This is why I always bounce hard off RPGs yet love immersive sims with RPG-elements. Traditional CRPGs feel so hostile to players new to the genre, or those without a lot of free time. I would think difficulty sliders could help, though not sure if that&#x27;s seen as sacrilegious or something. reply jakebasile BG3 does have difficulty levels but even the lowest can be deadly. The game intends for you to save very often, even in combat. F5 is your friend! reply spacemadness 1As someone who mostly dislikes real time with pause I am glad they didn’t go that route. I just like the see the full results of my action such as to see a spell go off completely. Real time with pause also often messes up the art that went into the sound design and animation choreography.Relatedly, it’s so satisfying the way the care they took with sound and how impactful your combat actions are as a result. So many game designers ignore sound design; I think this is a huge factor in the success of Blizzard games. People can argue Diablo IV is a poorly designed game, but the sound design is excellent and greatly contributes to the weight of actions and ultimately the dopamine hit factor. I think it’s been their secret weapon as people don’t often realize the effect it has on them. Larian took the same care here and it’s awesome. reply jakebasile 1Agree about sound design, both in this game and its importance in general. That&#x27;s something I failed to mention. The sound of combat and just environmental sound is great and adds even more to immersion.If you&#x27;re a fan of sound in games, check out the original Dead Space. Master class in using sound to create atmosphere. reply spacemadness 1I’ve played Dead Space the original and the remake and agree completely. Most of the time, if the sound design is spot on, the team behind the game knows what they’re doing and has passion for designing games and what makes them great. reply vagab0nd 1> I&#x27;m glad they decided to make it turn based vs the real time with pauseNothing else will ever give me the satisfaction of pausing the game, fully assessing the situation, giving a string of commands to all my characters, then unpausing and watching the whole thing play out perfectly (or fail spectacularly).EDIT: also, the shock of first time seeing Time Stop. reply shawabawa3 1Should you try frozen synapse if you&#x27;ve never played that, extremely satisfying planning based combat reply caskstrength 1>It&#x27;s a really, really good game. I&#x27;m glad they decided to make it turn based vs the real time with pause, though I know that&#x27;s a somewhat controversial decision (what isn&#x27;t?).Yes, but naming the game \"Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3\" instead of something like \"Divinity: Dungeons & Dragons\" is, unfortunately, a successful cash-grab. Which is to be expected considering that AFAIK _none_ of the original developers or writers worked on it. reply WithinReason 21 Is Minsc in it?

Because that&#x27;s all that seems to unite the other titles and BG3 meets it. reply caskstrength > What are the characteristics of a \"Baldur&#x27;s Gate\" title beyond being a CRPG following DnD rules set in the areas around the city?I wouldn&#x27;t call it a defining characteristic since neither SoA nor ToB is happening in Baldur&#x27;s Gate on nearby areas. But \"top-down view cRPG heavy on RTwP D&D tactical combat with 6 character party\" would be more or less correct, if imprecise, definition. Minsc unfortunately also seems to have become the distinctive characteristic of the series, but what can you do... reply serf who knows.given that the whole dark alliance branch exists and essentially turned the game into something totally different it&#x27;s not like the precedent for radical change hasn&#x27;t already been set.also phrasing &#x27;cash grab&#x27; in association to any &#x27;Wizards of the Coast&#x27; IP as if it were any kind of surprise seems to be missing their whole business tactic for the past 20+ years.See: the new Neverwinter Nights branches and the cadre of expansion packs&#x2F;add-ons&#x2F;dlcs&#x2F;campaigns&#x2F;skins&#x2F;whatever.if anything BG3 exhibits less cash-grab behaviors than the entire rest of the portfolio of WotC at the moment. reply caskstrength > given that the whole dark alliance branch exists and essentially turned the game into something totally different it&#x27;s not like the precedent for radical change hasn&#x27;t already been set.But that was my point - they didn&#x27;t dare to name it \"Baldur&#x27;s Gate _3_ Dark Alliance\". It would rub people the wrong way much less if they named the new game \"Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Divinity\" I assume.> also phrasing &#x27;cash grab&#x27; in association to any &#x27;Wizards of the Coast&#x27; IP as if it were any kind of surprise seems to be missing their whole business tactic for the past 20+ years.Cash grab from Larian. Obviously I don&#x27;t expect WotC to have any ethics or integrity.> if anything BG3 exhibits less cash-grab behaviors than the entire rest of the portfolio of WotC at the moment.I kinda agree, but I never claimed that BG3 is somehow most blatant cash grab from the long list of WotC cash grabs over the years. I&#x27;m just disappointed that they have succeeded with it :) replyyownie 1The title of this article is essentially meaningless.BG3 is single player offline game, mainly distributed globally through Steam (and GOG) which runs it&#x27;s own CDN for games. There is a multiplayer mode but that is co-ordinated via p2p for the most part.The \"IT team\" at Larian doesn&#x27;t get hit with those downloads as they only send a single copy up to Steam&#x27;s CDN which handles the traffic (perhaps some backend user authentication too?)so essentially this article is \"Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, is a very popular download on Steam\" just buzz to push more sales presumably. reply 59nadir 1I searched for \"multiplayer\" here just to see if maybe I was mistaken about this game; number of players is not a super meaningful stressor on a system when you&#x27;re not providing a whole slew of live services and simulation, so I was wondering what the point of mentioning the 700k user count was.700k players when you:- Don&#x27;t run your own game update distribution&#x2F;patcher- Don&#x27;t provide real-time chat- Don&#x27;t run your own arbitration (what&#x27;s the point if mostly everything is P2P&#x2F;high trust sessions and cooperative?)- ...700k players is great for them and by all accounts they seem to have done a great job overall, but it&#x27;s a far cry from League of Legends or even DotA2 in terms of system stress. reply strken Even if you&#x27;re just doing NAT holepunching and orchestrating some P2P sessions, if you get 700% of your expected load and still stay online then good for you. reply javajosh 1>The title of this article is essentially meaningless.It&#x27;s worse than that, it&#x27;s creepy. What is a single-player offline game phoning home anyway? On every play? It&#x27;s crazy how much software companies get away with these days.The frog is well and truly boiled. reply etra0 1It&#x27;s a DRM free game. I cannot say if the game pings home or not because I don&#x27;t own it but this statistic is collected by Steam, not Larian. reply javajosh They outsourced \"home\". reply mathgeek 1It’s somewhere in the middle, as there is online multiplayer, but not at the scale that it could be compared to a “truly” online game. reply jamesgreenleaf 1I don&#x27;t believe that no one predicted the overwhelming success of a long-anticipated sequel to one of the most legendary and deeply-loved games of all time.Maybe I&#x27;ve played BG2 too many times, but for me this was a no-brainer. You could read the steam reviews from early access as well, and the prediction should have been pretty easy. People were already impressed with the early campaign.Personally I&#x27;m putting off buying BG3 because I know how addictive it&#x27;ll be. reply meristohm 1Same here; I won&#x27;t buy it anytime soon (possibly ever; depends on if there&#x27;s still a place for games in my life after going without for a year), though the fact that I&#x27;m reading and commenting this thread says that gaming is still important to me, if not just out of nostalgia but also that I recognize the importance of games in our collective experience, and I know something about them after three+ decades of playing and designing (table games; no publications, just for me & friends).I like to read the negative reviews on Steam to help talk myself out of purchases. I usually find something convincing, the urge passes, and I spend more time doing something with a longer-lasting benefit (for who I an now, anyway). I thought for so long that I&#x27;d never quit gaming, but it served its purpose, I try not to regret it as wasted time (gaming gave me an easy sense of purpose, without which I might have joined a cult or become an alcoholic like my dad), and I try not to rain on anyone&#x27;s parade. reply jamesgreenleaf 1> I like to read the negative reviews on Steam to help talk myself out of purchases.Hah, I do the same thing. On other sites too - the well-written negative reviews have a lot of value. Although, on some of the best games on steam, I&#x27;ve seen a few top negative reviews that say something like: \"Why are you looking at the negative reviews? You know this game is great.\"I think you&#x27;re right though. Games have their place and are culturally important, but the trend has veered more toward optimizing for engagement (addiction) and dark patterns like overcharging for cosmetics and such. reply duxup 1I wish I could go back and enjoy the old BG games but I tried recently and oh man the old school UI back then had a lot of inconveniences that for some reason I struggle to deal with at this point. reply izzydata 1What really sealed the deal for me checking out this game is the promise to not have any microtransactions. That&#x27;s a trend that has only been getting worse for 20+ years now and I&#x27;d gladly pay full price for a game that simply gives me a whole game upon purchase. reply fredley 1No micro transactions, offline single player. A luxury in 2023. reply ls612 1I don&#x27;t get this take, just in the past 12 months we have seen-God of War Ragnarok-Tears of the Kingdom-Hogwarts Legacy-Star Wars Jedi Survivor-Final Fantasy XVIAll entirely or almost entirely singleplayer and all receiving critical acclaim (except for the poor launch of Jedi Survivor&#x27;s PC port). And the next few months include Starfield and Spider-Man 2, both blockbuster singleplayer games with no microtransactions which stand a good chance of winning game of the year. reply izzydata 1That may be so, but for every game like this there are a dozen that aren&#x27;t. I just happened to not be interested in any of the above mentioned games. Still, I think the trend of releasing completed games is slowly becoming in favor again.

They are still all very successful AAA games that have no microtransactions. reply password54321 1*timed exclusive, plus Switch emulator. reply LegitShady 1an exclusive is an exclusive. \"timed exclusive\" is an exclusive. Also not interested in dealing with piracy and other things for switch emulator - there&#x27;s no way for a normal person to buy the game and play it on a switch emulator - you need an old version of the switch to dump it even if you wanted to, so you have to have the platform to emulate it without piracy anyways. reply gardenhedge 1Hogwarts Legacy is recommended reply LegitShady im just not into harry potter reply ChoGGi I watched a couple of the movies years ago. the game is enjoyable and very well done, I&#x27;d probably have more fun if I was an actual fan.You can definitely see the amount of effort put into recreating the castle&#x2F;town. replyMathMonkeyMan 1They do put some effort into getting you to create an account and go online in the installer.And, when you boot the game, it instead boots a window GUI that I can imagine serves only to display the giant ad to upgrade to the more expensive version of the game. You have to search for the de-emphasized not-quite-a-button below to actually play the game.This is one of the things I like about truly single-player games, where no interaction with other players is possible. Mostly puzzle games. None of those games have any of these dark patterns or unnecessary connectivity.I have been enjoying Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3. Offline :) reply honeybadger1 1The shills are already out from the big players denouncing the &#x27;type of game&#x27; development behind BG3. They&#x27;re justifying the reskinning of the same shit over and over and calling it the next best title when it&#x27;s basically nothing but the same shit regurgitated over and over.I am already almost finished with Act 2 and I have to say this game will keep me occupied for many a night to come.AMAZING team they have at Larian and their passion for quality shines in this game. reply pierrebeucher 1Can you be more specific about \"big players denouncing the &#x27;type of game&#x27; development behind BG3\" ? I&#x27;ve heard a few things about BG3 development method being critized by some devs and&#x2F;or companies but haven&#x27;t read some source material yet.EDIT: nevermind, Googling \"baldur&#x27;s gate 3 development critics\" yields tons of results reply leshenka 1Oh it&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s a single-player game, it&#x27;s not that you need any server capacity for that. Other than download servers but it&#x27;s Steam&#x27;s problem, not publisher&#x27;s....right? reply cube2222 1You wrote your comment as though it&#x27;s not ok, while you can play it offline in single player just fine.But there&#x27;s optional Cross-Platform save sync (independent of the steam one) and multiplayer.Anyway, as a person who bounced off of the previous entries of this genre I&#x27;m really enjoying this one, and I&#x27;m very happy for the success the studio is having - they deserve it! reply jdright 1You all forget about all the telemetry, which most decent games from the last 5 years have. It is fact of life that they collect all kinds of data to understand better their user base and game usage for future improvements. reply barbazoo 1It has a multiplayer modehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamer.com&#x2F;baldurs-gate-3-multiplayer-co-op-gui... reply mastax 1They have a cross platform save sync service which has been disabled, but it sounds like that wasn&#x27;t load related. I&#x27;m not sure how big the save games are but 700k people mashing the quick save button every 30 seconds probably adds up. reply asmor 1They are a pain. I&#x27;m 9 hours in and at 1&#x2F;17GB in Steam Cloud. I&#x27;ve been going between my Mac and an ROG Ally and syncing saves takes upward of 3-4 minutes and sometimes just fails silently (loudly if you launch the game, but still fails). Steam is definitely not built for that, considering that piece of the user interface barely gives any feedback. reply jakebasile 1I have a total of about 75 saves: quick and auto saves are limited to a rolling 25 by default, plus about 25 manual saves. Steam shows I have used 795 MB of space, so they&#x27;re not _big_ but they&#x27;re not small. reply ragestorm 1It might be related to multiplayer or that one had to redownload the game. The EA was so different, you had to uninstall and then install when it unlocked globally. No preload available. reply xaduha 1> it&#x27;s not that you need any server capacity for thatThey had Twitch integration since the beginning and judging by some accounts they weren&#x27;t prepared for how much that would be in demand on full release. Each user can see streamer&#x27;s full inventory and journal, vote on dialogue options when asked, etc. Surely Steam isn&#x27;t handling that. reply jncfhnb 1It’s also multiplayer coop but I assume this is P2P reply leshenka 1I hope so, otherwise it&#x27;s yet another time bomb reply dvlsg 1It should be.

They have a launcher reply ivann You can skip it entirely with this launch option in steam: `--skip-launcher`. reply rimunroe 1Yes. Login is not required. reply suryong 1I have played for over 30 hours since release, and now at Act 2. It&#x27;s one of the best games I have played. I am not a huge D&D fan, but I like real RPG games where the player choice actually matters such as DOS 2 and Pathfinder WOTR, so this one was instant buy for me and I am very pleasantly surprised. I can already see myself doing another playthrough, there is lots of diverging in the story. Too many so called RPG games nowadays are just pipes that you walk through with some kind of illusion of choice and few lines of different dialogue.The inventory management is little messy and could be better, but honestly I don&#x27;t find much else to critique yet. reply janmarsal 1After seeing some gameplay footage, this game seems more like a spiritual successor to Dragon Age: Origins than to Baldur&#x27;s gate 1 & 2. Of course Dragon Age was intended as a spiritual successor to Baldur&#x27;s gate back when it was released. Even the hype is very similar to Dragon Age: Origins, and how journalists were surprised that an \"old school\" RPG like this could be so popular. reply ledauphin I appreciate this note - I have no exposure to the original games, but Dragon Age: Origins was one of the best games I&#x27;ve ever played. reply neom 1I&#x27;m not a gamer but I randomly stumbled across someone playing this on twitch couple days ago, gotta say my mind was pretty blown at how far video game graphics have come (granted the last thing I played was Quake&#x2F;UT&#x2F;HL back in the day). Some of the cut scenes are basically just amazing movies, but even the in game graphics are fantastic. Does anyone happen to know what game is considered the gold standard for gfx in vidya games is these days? reply trostaft 1It&#x27;s a subjective question. Three that struck me recently were- Cyberpunk 2077 with its new path traced lighting option- Plague Tale Requiem (in general)- The high action sequences and cut-scenes of FFXVIThese games have their flaws in terms of graphics, but they were very striking to me. Note, this is speaking purely graphics, there&#x27;s more to be said regarding art design as enabled by graphics tech. reply macNchz 1For me, having not really played many video games between ~2008 and 2020, Red Dead Redemption 2 has continued to really wow me.It&#x27;s is particularly impressive in both its breadth and depth: not only does it have huge beautiful landscapes in deserts, plains, mountains, forests, swamps, beaches, snow & rain, but also includes tiny details like being able to shoot out individual spokes of a wagon wheel, and the way the sun glows through the cartilage of characters ears. reply izacus 1Cyberpunk 2077 with their new path tracing probably beats everything.Also their facial animation and dialogue direction is far ahead of any other game I&#x27;ve seen - those conversations feel much more visceral than anything. reply danparsonson Take a look at Ghost of Tsushima (PlayStation only sadly) - especially the fields of grass, absolutely breathtaking.Also Unreal Engine 5 is to me at the leading edge of graphics engines right now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;-lkEOEEKYD0 reply jsnell 1It depends a bit on what you&#x27;re into. For a decent sample, have a look at Cyberpunk 2077 (especially with the RT Overdrive update on the PC), Horizon Forbidden West, and Forza Horizon 5. reply ycombinete 1I want to say Crysis reply tmtvl 1The Baldur&#x27;s Gate series is one of the best cRPG series that exists. When another company wanted to use the name for their games they made a separate series called Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance. Larian&#x27;s defilement of this series being rewarded like this just breaks my heart. They could have easily called it Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Ulitharid or something, but no, they had to stir up maximum nostalgia by calling their game which has about as much to do with the original trilogy (yes, we, the real fans, called it the Baldur&#x27;s Gate trilogy back in the day) as Star Trek has to do with Star Wars \"Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3\". If it were still just \"Divinity Faerun\" but actually continued the story of the Bhaalspawn it would be fine, it may even have been interesting to play a really high-level adventure, but instead they do this shit and because it looks fancy people eat it up hook, line, and sinker. Maybe I&#x27;m just getting old, but I can&#x27;t deal with this. It reminds me of those activists who glue themselves to works of art, but whereas those people at least nominally have a good reason to do so, Larian is only out for self-interest. While I am probably taking things too seriously, after all it&#x27;s \"only a game\", only a piece of childish amusement, I still feel like I can&#x27;t deal with the disappointment. The statement \"gamers have no standards\" has never felt as real as it does now. It&#x27;s like as if Ultima IX had been successful, a clear showing that \"video games are art\" is an empty, hollow statement, easily disproven by a single look at reality. reply appleflaxen I don&#x27;t understand your objection.You&#x27;re unhappy that it&#x27;s titled like a thematic sequel but isn&#x27;t one? Or that the gameplay is too different than it&#x27;s predecessors? Or something else? reply vagab0nd 1I&#x27;ve accepted the fact that it&#x27;s \"just\" a good game and try to enjoy it. For a real BG game, Obsidian is probably our best hope. reply rcoveson 1It&#x27;s not obligate-multiplayer, but seeing as it&#x27;s a Dungeons and Dragons implementation with lots of best-in-class multiplayer features it seems libelous to call it \"single player\". reply mastax 1I love how the party can split up and go do completely different things. That&#x27;s often difficult to do even in a traditional tabletop setting. reply ramses0 1OG Wasteland had that feature, along with a pretty decent macro system. Worth a look. reply renewiltord 1They do that very well in Divinity : Original Sin (by the same devs).This class of couch co-op game is becoming rare but I buy them each time they come out. I hope there&#x27;s enough of us to provide a market. reply ycombinete 1Thank you, can you suggest some others please! I find the usual list of couch co ops it be total trash. reply Shared404 1I haven&#x27;t played the co-op mode of Cassette Beasts yet, but I&#x27;ve been playing single player and have loved every second.E: Spelling, gotta love mobile. reply Shared404 Actually wound up playing the co-op mode today, it&#x27;s quite fun once you&#x27;re past the tutorial. replyctenb 1Does anyone else think that modern rpg art style and graphics are often too flashy and overwhelming? I&#x27;m tempted to try this game, but held back by its appearance. reply aoanla 1Absolutely. I watched a few people playing Early Access builds of BG3, and I can&#x27;t believe more people aren&#x27;t put off by how overly flashy everything is. Characters models overact expressions, and even the simplest action in combat is accompanied by loud sound effects and exaggerated actions. It&#x27;s very off-putting. reply intelVISA 1I&#x27;ll give Larian a pass for the gaudy aesthetics, I&#x27;m more concerned that they cut out the GM mode from DivOS2 (same engine&#x2F;game basically). reply kuang_eleven 1In a team-based isometric RPG like BG3 you kinda have to be, the characters are dime sized and anything less flashy just wouldn&#x27;t read. It&#x27;s like stage acting, you have to overexaggerate so that audience can actually see what&#x27;s going on from a distance. reply ctenb That&#x27;s an interesting perspective, hadn&#x27;t thought of it that way. Even so, the fact that everything is so overwhelming also adds to that problem in a way. Can&#x27;t see the wood through the trees so to speak. reply redbell 1https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;TbzGM reply iamflimflam1 I don’t really play games much anymore. Too many other calls on my time. But I have many fond memory’s of the Baldur’s gate games.So I’m not surprised it’s doing well. I will probably try and have a play myself. reply offtwit 1Is this game mostly an inventory management game like Divinity Original Sin 2? I tried playing it but I was just clicking around menus 80% of the time. reply koof 1There are a few notable inventory improvements, but the most important is that BG3 is much less gear&#x2F;stat dependent than DOS2. You don&#x27;t have to sweat trading stats for each slot and character building is simpler (no skillbook type of progression beyond wizard spell scrolls, and that&#x27;s optional). You&#x27;ll still get engaging, difficult, beatable combat. The inventory is kludgy and there are a lot of items but it&#x27;s much less important to focus on than DOS.No lone-wolf mode made me wonder if the game would be too fiddly for me, but there are other ways to streamline combat. Champion fighters, berserker barbarians, non-arcane trickster rogues are mechanically simple subclasses that are fun to play. 5e is forgiving for party composition in a way DOS2 isn&#x27;t. reply Ekaros 1I suppose it depends how hard you hoard loot... It is quite bad and filters are slightly lacking if you really collect it to pawn to vendors. reply bitcharmer 1I don&#x27;t think you played it at all reply aoanla 1I don&#x27;t know, the brief time I spent with D:OS2, there was quite a lot of inventory shenanigans. reply theduder99 1This is a well-known criticism of the game though. Even putting rune mgmt and crafting aside, after dinging a new level, you should be hitting up the vendor and upgrading&#x2F;selling gear so that you can deal with enemies at your new level effectively. And you do that process x4 because you are managing 4 characters. I personally didn&#x27;t mind the ceremony too much but I can definitely see how some people would be put off by it. reply bunga-bunga 1More constructive comments please.

    "originBody": "Michael Geist About Writing Teaching Speaking Tech Law Topics Podcast twitter mastodon mail linkedin feedburner facebook apple spotify google Facebook Bill C-18 notice News The Lose-Lose-Lose-Lose Bill C-18 Outcome: Meta Blocking News Links on Facebook and Instagram in Canada August 2, 2023 For months, supporters of Bill C-18, the Online News Act, assured the government that Meta and Google were bluffing when they warned that a bill based on mandated payments for links was unworkable and they would comply with it by removing links to news from their platforms. However, what has been readily apparent for months became reality yesterday: Meta is now actively blocking news links and sharing on its Facebook and Instagram platforms. The announcement does not reference Threads, but it would not surprise if news links are ultimately blocked on that platform as well. The company says that the blocking will take several weeks to fully roll out to all users, suggesting that it has learned from the over-blocking mistakes made in Australia and is proceeding more cautiously in Canada. By the end of the month, the world’s largest social media platform will become a news desert in Canada, with links to all news – both Canadian and foreign – blocked on the platform. It is worth revisiting that it was only a couple of months ago that some industry leaders, lobbyists, and academics were assuring the Senate that the Meta threat was just a bluff. Kevin Desjardins of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, referenced the Australian experience, and told the Senate committee studying the bill that “when legislated to do so, they will come to the table.” Sylvain Poisson of Hebdos Quebec confidently said “they made those threats in Australia and elsewhere and every time they back down.” Chris Pedigo of the U.S.-based Digital Context Next assured the committee “it’s important to understand what happens when these bills become law. In Australia, they moved quickly to secure deals. They have done similar work in Europe, and I expect it would happen quickly in Canada as well.” And Carleton professor Dwayne Winseck said “I am not worried. The threats they are making, they are doing this all around the world.” Despite the assurances, the company was true to its word and blocking news links is now here. If this is a negotiation tactic, it’s a pretty strange one given that reports indicate the company is not talking to the government about potential changes to a law that has already received royal assent. Indeed, while the new Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge urged the company to participate in the regulatory process, there is nothing in the regulations that could alter the fundamental principle in the bill of mandated payments for links. At best, the government could toss aside its commitment to stay out of negotiations by using the regulations to dictate to the supposedly independent CRTC how much needs to be spent in order to avoid Bill C-18’s final offer arbitration provisions. Government negotiating total payment value and eviscerating the CRTC’s independence does not inspire confidence and Meta reasonably wants no part of it, since the time to fix Bill C-18 was before it received royal assent, not after. It is difficult to overstate the harm that Bill C-18 will create for the media sector in Canada, with enormous losses that will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Indeed, just the exit of Meta will lead to the losses that include the cancellation of existing deals, lost links that accounts for as much as 30% of referral traffic, and no new revenues from Bill C-18 from one of the two platforms that were supposed to fall under the law. The move virtually guarantees that Bill C-18 will represent a setback for the sector and a cautionary tale for a government that blithely ignored the warning signs, seemed to welcome a fight with the tech companies, and had no Plan B. In fact, if Google follows suit, there will be even more cancelled deals, lost links, and absolutely no new revenues from the legislation given that those are the only companies subject to the law (former Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez’s insistence that there is value in links that deserve compensation while simultaneously excluding Microsoft, Apple, Twitter and other platforms from the law amply demonstrates how the argument stands on shaky grounds). As disbelief has shifted to acceptance, Canadian media outlets are now rushing to promote direct access to their content via web, email or any other non-social media platform. The government is also seemingly hoping to drum up support for its ad boycott of Meta, yet given that the Liberal party launched new ads on Facebook just this week, that may be a hard sell. Instead, having rejected alternatives that could have avoided this outcome, the government has remarkably created a lose-lose-lose-lose scenario.  Canadian media is a loser, particularly the small and independent media outlets that are more reliant on social media to develop community and build their audience. The loss of Facebook links will take a serious toll and undermine innovative companies in Canada. The Internet platforms are losers as they comply with an unreasonable law by removing links and making their services objectively worse in order to do so. Individual Canadians who use the platforms to find links to news are losers since news links will be blocked from the platform. And the government is a loser, as having dismissed critics and ignored repeated warnings about the risks associated with its bill, it has now left Canada as the global example of digital policy disastrously gone wrong.     Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) More Related Posts: Meta to Test Blocking News Sharing on Facebook and Instagram in Canada in Response to Bill C-18’s Mandated Payments for Links Tough Talk, Empty Answers: How Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is Propelling Canada’s News Sector Toward the Bill C-18 Cliff Made-in-Canada Internet Takes Shape with Risks of Blocked Streaming Services and News Sharing as Bill C-18 Receives Royal Assent What If It Isn’t a Bluff?!: The Consequences of the Government’s Epic Bill C-18 Miscalculation Begin to Set In Tags: c-18 / facebook / meta / online news act / st-onge Share this post 48 Comments Kevin August 2, 2023 at 9:35 am All of those folks who advised that Alphabet and Meta were bluffing must have been delusional. I figure that the main reason that Australia got away with it was that the companies weren’t ready to reliably implement the blocking with minimal side-effects. However given that there were other countries starting to look at it these companies continued the development of the technology and were ready when C-18 passed; all they needed to do was set up and test the rules in the system. In the big scheme of things, the amount of money that these companies get from Canada is low enough that they are willing to forego that because either the fees they would need to pay is too high and/or the trouble is just not worth it, in particular if other countries start to implement it themselves. For the government, they get to claim that they are supporting MSM in Canada while it costs them pretty much nothing, and they can get some good press from MSM. Because MSM is so invested in C-18, the number of critical items will be a minimum, just enough to say they’ve cast a critical eye with a straight face. Reply scf August 2, 2023 at 1:55 pm The companies have explained in detail what is different about the Australian law. It has nothing to do with being “ready”. Reply Kevin August 3, 2023 at 4:55 pm Agreed, but my feeling is that the Australia experience gave the search and SM companies the idea that a capability such as this would be very useful, especially given how many other countries and media groups were watching what happened. As it turns out the Australian government was willing to bend to get the best deal they could and therefore the capability wouldn’t be needed. But just because Australia would doesn’t mean that other governments would. This would give an inducement to the companies to develop this capability. The fact that they rolled it out so quickly tells me that it has been under development as a contingency for some time. Now, had the Australian government taken the same approach as the Canadian government, I don’t know what would have happened. And don’t forget that this capability is basically a geographic filter based on a subject or target URL, so in concept it could use some of the same capability that they have in order to comply with local laws restricting what the residents of some countries can see. Reply JohnnyT August 3, 2023 at 7:23 am “All of those folks who advised…must have been delusional.” No, it’s the Ottawa bubble reality distortion field. The current government Can Do No Wrong and is morally superior to all, so no matter how moronic the idea spewing from the PMO, it gets full support from the sycophant ocean who live in Ottawa. Also, Ottawa minions NEVER tell the boss that what they are doing is stupid/wrong/illegal: That is career suicide. It’s always better to say “yes” to the boss no matter how stupid the edict, as if the boss IS wrong and gets kicked to the door there will be another boss coming along soon who wants to hear nothing but “yes” and so the yes-man minion protects their butt/paycheque/pension. I grew up in Ottawa. It’s one big lunatic asylum. Reply Kevin August 3, 2023 at 4:26 pm I live near Ottawa and have been both a public servant and i the private sector in the past, and my wife retired from the PS just a few years ago. There is a kernel of truth to what you said, but I can’t completely agree with it. There are public servants who are willing to say no to the boss, in particular if something that the boss wants to do is wrong or illegal. But in my experience this occurs more at the lower levels rather than the upper levels. It also depends on where the direction came from and where the push back occurs. In fact, I’ve seen it occur. The main problem exists in the higher level of the executive ranks. At the lower levels the public servants have union representation to help shield them (if the union chooses to do so). At the level of the executives, in particular at the ADM and DM level, they don’t have any such backup and they are appointed to a position, serving at the pleasure of the PMO. PMs in Canada (and frankly partly leaders in general here) don’t like to be publicly contradicted by their underlings; the news media jumps on this as they can’t control their party members or public servants and then in the next breath bemoans the tight party discipline that the parties have. Don’t forget that in Canada, and in particular in a minority government, the parties are always in campaign mode. Reply Yves August 2, 2023 at 11:44 am I am curious to see how Australia will deal with this issue they are also in the middel of trying to get a deal from the two big tech companies. This reminds me of the split run magazine debacle in the 90s where a Liberal government implmented Canadian content rules in Americanmagazines sold in Canada that did not last long Reply scf August 2, 2023 at 1:58 pm Australia are not in the middle of trying to get a deal. Both companies are exempt from the Australian law. They negotiated a path to exemption a long time ago, that was what they requested from the Canadian government, so they could avoid unlimited liability. The Canadian government refused. The companies need to know what they need to negotiate with media outlets to reach a point where they are no longer on the hook for even more money. Canada refused to provide such a path. Reply Bobbi August 2, 2023 at 12:46 pm Watching hedge funds and the great and the good of the Canadian media establishment learn the lessons that every small business in Canada has learned – don’t rely on a platform you don’t own is darkly hilarious. Canadian media has arrogantly decided that 100 year first mover advantage of paper printing means they’re entitled to the same revenue once the world changed. They don’t invest in local content, online community or active email outreach and now the truly painful lesson starts. The only thing more delusional is that government – which is terrified of Canadian and interacting with them – could have any relevant expertise in policing how Canadians gather online. A pox on all their houses. Reply scf August 2, 2023 at 2:01 pm Absolutely. If links to news media in Canada are so valuable, then you’d think this would leave a big money-making market opportunity in Canada for anyone to jump into! Literally anyone! Could be the media companies themselves. But they are incapable and obsolete, so they cannot do it. And it really isn’t a money-making opportunity at all, so no tech company has any interest. Reply Kisai August 3, 2023 at 12:38 am Bill C-18 was about punishing big tech companies for… being successful at what they do. Big MSM in Canada comes in and whines that they don’t get a share of something they opt’d in to. Nobody was forcing them to post their entire articles to Facebook. Just like bill C-11, big media whines that they aren’t being paid enough to produce the low-effort content nobody actually wants, so they want youtube to pay them to produce more of it. Like they are the only companies allowed to produce content. Since when did the Canadian government do Bell’s bidding? What the government should be doing is forcibly breaking up Bell, Rogers/Shaw, Videotron, Telus and have their internet service assets separated from media assets. Then you will see these media companies forced to produce things people want, or stop sitting on their IP that people actually want to see and license/syndicate it out. I’ll vote for whoever says they will undo C-11 and C-18 without trying to “fix” it. Cause these bills are a gift to Bell to loot big tech companies and not compete. Reply DB August 2, 2023 at 1:48 pm I’m amazed at the restraint of Meta and Google. They’ve focused solely on criticizing the Bill and spelling out its implications. On the other hand, supporters of the Bill have resorted to false claims, name calling, and hyperbole to attack Meta and Google. I half expect the Heritage Minister to now say she will hold her breath until those poopyheads at Meta and Google do what she wants. Reply Paul August 2, 2023 at 2:48 pm I don’t use Facebook. I don’t use Google News. Reply Richard August 4, 2023 at 10:51 am Fantastic contribution! Reply James Cassidy August 2, 2023 at 3:26 pm Most people sitting at home have little else to do but complain. Do not use Facebook for “news”. Do not know anyone who does. Considering the state of Canadian News Organizations it might be a good idea to start culling the herd. Reply Hugo Weber August 5, 2023 at 6:28 am I am afraid you have not yet fully understood the implications of this new law. Perhaps this will change when Google (with its search engine) stops showing results for canadian news outlets. Reply Elizabeth Pickett August 6, 2023 at 1:43 pm I’ve never used Facebook to get my news either. But I do belong to several Facebook groups where we share news posts and discuss the state of the world and the universe. If we can’t share news links, as many activist groups do, we can no longer have those discussions on that platform. Migrating hundreds of group members to another platform is not practicable. Reply Stephen Bosch August 7, 2023 at 5:29 am It’s not practicable? Have you even tried? You do realize that there was an Internet before Facebook, right? What do you think people did then? You’ve just put your finger on the problem: These platforms got huge by serving people’s intrinsic laziness. People used Facebook for organizing community groups because it was way too easy. And now everybody is hooked. When the pain gets big enough, people will figure out alternatives. Reply Henri Sader August 2, 2023 at 6:25 pm What are the odds of renegotiating a win win win win way out ? Reply Blue August 3, 2023 at 12:22 am No chance. The federal government would either need to completely gut its legislation, thus admitting defeat, or the tech companies would need to bend the knee, which is unlikely given how small Canadian news links are to their business model. The Feds took something that was legal and benefitted both tech companies and legacy news media and got greedy. As the expression goes, pigs get fed while hogs get slaughtered, and the federal government decided it wanted to be a hog. Reply Paul August 2, 2023 at 9:57 pm Good Riddance. Social Media should not be the place for news anyway! That’s part of the problem with all the hoaxes and fake news. CYA meta, and I’m happier for it. Reply Bruce Harling August 2, 2023 at 10:07 pm I agree Reply Hugo Weber August 5, 2023 at 6:33 am You underestimate the sharing of URLs between private users of FB or Instagram. As soon as Google stops showing canadian news outlets in its search engine, this became a real nightmare for the already struggling canadian news industry.

As idiotic as the legislation is, the *result* is terrific: Facebook no longer pushing a news agenda. People will have to actually look up the news themselves. This is good, not bad. This bill was, and still is, insane, but the specific outcome in relation to Facebook has been a net positive: Facebook should not be your source for news, because Facebook has put you in a bubble, and will only give you want you want to hear. Now it can’t. That’s a positive development for all Canadians. Reply Soren August 7, 2023 at 5:15 am I would to see Canadian media collectively try to not to “overstate the harm that Bill C-18 will create for the media sector in Canada, with enormous losses that will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. ” It reads like a verbatim copy of a Meta press release. And again the “Small independent media” are used as the show case for it. Isn’t it striking how the BIG TECH always uses The Little Man as their arguments against limiting their enormous reach?

For those not aware, the PBO analysis showed that the primary beneficiaries of this bill were to be Bell, Rogers, Shaw, and some CBC.But even if that were not the case, this bill simply makes no sense, and could do a lot of harm. reply ysavir 1Are we cheering on Facebook? It feels like a situation where all the foul players--the platforms, the government, and the media--are all losing.The article author tries to say \"Individual Canadians who use the platforms to find links to news are losers since news links will be blocked from the platform\" but doesn&#x27;t actually support that with a reason as to why that&#x27;s a loss. Feels like a win to individual Canadians to me, even if some are upset at their inability to easily and immediately share clickbait and ragebait articles. I think those are the people we&#x27;re really cheering on. reply treprinum First, nobody really wanted FB to show news articles especially when they were always biased to something they wanted to propagate (like when Google started pushing news to Android devices out of blue without any prior request). Second, the main utility of FB was to connect with friends and acquaintances and have some cursory look into their lives. There is this thing called Internet to browse newspapers if one wishes to anyway.Meta, please ban newspapers all around the world! reply bandyaboot This. People using FB to share information outside their lives has been a net bane to society. Unfortunately, FB profits immensely from the damage it causes. reply roywiggins Uh, sharing news articles is most of what people do here on this site. Why is it uniquely bad when people do it on Facebook instead? reply qup Lack of moderation or filtering of the content (via voting) reply neltnerb I mean, I gave up on Facebook long ago to be honest, but this is a news aggregator website that is specifically about sharing links to articles of news or interest.Facebook... I mean... it wasn&#x27;t pitched to be that? It was supposed to connect you to each other, not be an algorithmic view into the universe. Sure, sharing news can be a big part of that, and talking about news too, but every site doesn&#x27;t have to be everything.Why would my personal social group (i.e. facebook friends) make sense to combine with the random strangers on here who discuss technical posts? Sure there&#x27;s some overlap in audience but it just doesn&#x27;t seem like a necessary compromise to make. reply nonethewiser According to the people doing it or outside observers? Seems like there are lots of things that are net negatives in the opinion of one group of people despite many others choosing it for themselves. Should we ban soda? Granulated sugar in general? Rap music? The liberal arts? This is the government acting as a parent. We need a society of adults, not children. reply kaffeeringe Yes, we created a world, where many people make objectively bad decisions, because we let companies become so big and so rich that they can pay the cleverest mind to influence us. I too want a free society of adults, that can choose their own fate. But we as single persons do not have the capacities to find a reasonable way through all the bullshit that rich organisations feed us every day.Look at supermarkets: everything after the department for fruits an vegetables is basically bad for us. Science prooves that. But we have to pass all this convenience food that promises to be cheap and fast and healthy and it isn&#x27;t. And most people somehow learned that in school but ever since they are being informed by the companies. reply simple-thoughts Science does not in fact prove only fruits and vegetables are good for you, and in recent years the healt benefits of meat and dairy have been coming to light. reply kashunstva > Science does not in fact prove only fruits and vegetables are good for youI will agree with your objection to the “prove” claim about the science (if only because it’s an overstatement of what science does) but the negative associations between various adverse health outcomes and a plant-based diet are well-supported in the literature: lower risk of type 2 diabetes, lower systolic BP, lower risk of cardiovascular events, lower total cardiovascular mortality, lower rates of certain malignancies. reply sheepscreek YouTube is the new FB newsfeed. On a personal note, I wholeheartedly hate their half-assed approach to parenting controls. reply dclowd9901 Ban clickable links even. I mean, if someone wants to share a web location, they can still do so. The opt-in effect of having to drag to copy, right click, click copy, open a new tab and paste would likely be enough to keep stupid shit journalism from turning viral.Facebook would really blow my mind if they doubled down on their core mission. reply codedokode A news media producing \"clickbait and ragebait\" articles should not be covered by the law because it requires to follow a code of ethics (article 27 [1] ) unless it is a Indigenous news organization. I think the articles you mention definitely are not compatible with \"code of ethics whose standards of professional conduct require adherence to the recognized processes and principles of the journalism profession, including fairness, independence and rigour in reporting news and handling sources\" so please rest assured that they can be shared free of charge. Sadly, clickbait articles from Indigenous news organization might disappear.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parl.ca&#x2F;DocumentViewer&#x2F;en&#x2F;44-1&#x2F;bill&#x2F;C-18&#x2F;royal-as... reply bastardoperator 1I just find it odd that someone interested in consuming news would choose to do so out of a dumpster when given a plethora of non-dumpster options. reply graeme People share links with their friends online. If you login to facebook you will see links your friends shared.This is a major source of traffic for media, along with say sharing links via imessage.Almost no one logs onto facebook with the goal of \"checking the news\". But they see news there and it adds up to a lot of traffic because Facebook and instagram are huge. (The media posts clips to Facebook and Instagram and these can show up in feeds too if the post is popular enough) reply ethbr0 1Because it&#x27;s not a dumpster.It&#x27;s a casino with flashing lights, exciting noise, and free cocktails. reply _Algernon_ 24 A shiny, polished dumpster is still a dumpster. reply labster It’s the same picture.jpg reply Broken_Hippo Do you also think it is odd that news consumers would then want to possibly discuss or share the news with people they know?Because that&#x27;s the reason. Folks interested in news tend to talk about it with other folks interested - and that has happened long before the internet. In some cases, it is pretty similar to leaving a newspaper in a fast food place: Let folks you don&#x27;t see much (or at all) read that stuff as well.It doesn&#x27;t always matter if other options are better - folks work with what they have. Similar to wanting to talk to someone more intelligent about the news, but still talking about it with the folks you have around. reply dangus The techno-elites act like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok aren’t at all enjoyable when they have billions of daily active users.This is the 2020s equivalent of saying that there can’t possibly be legitimate news culture happening with Comedy Central viewers at the peak era of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. It’s just out of touch with the common person.By the way, Meta products are incredibly good at a UX and technical level. Fast loading, simple UI, and ads have a predictable layout where they don’t bloc site elements or interrupt you (much unlike a typical news website). reply _Algernon_ 20 Smoking was \"enjoyable\". Sugar is \"enjoyable\". Snorting cocaine of a hooker&#x27;s ass is \"enjoyable\"A thing being \"enjoyable\" doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good, neither for society or the person(s) doing it. reply whimsicalism It’s not just the “techno-elites”, it is elites of all stripes. I grew up in DC with exactly the sorts of interactions you might imagine, none of those people are techies, and they all have similar anti-social media views.AFAICT, most of what they really take issue with is intrinsic to allowing direct communication between anyone in the world. There seem to be severely anti-democratic implications for many of the critiques of Meta that I hear.Truly the only place where the techies seem to diverge is that they care about privacy, whereas it is about “fake news” for everyone else. reply alistairSH and ads have a predictable layout where they don’t bloc site elements or interrupt youAre we using the same apps? My FB and Insta feeds were a steaming pile of ads and influencers and other garbage. I stopped using both because posts from people I follow were buried reply dangus “Updates from friends you know” is what elder millennials think the product is, but that’s not primarily what it is anymore.I’m talking about the endless stream of content that is the bread and butter of social media. Your friends don’t have infinite content to post.The endless stream of content product (think Reels and TikTok) is what captures 90% of users’ attention.In that context, yes, you’ll get ads and influencers shilling sponsored stuff, but you can swipe them away instantly. And my argument is that this product is very good for very many people. reply alistairSH “Ads don’t get in the way”“Your feed will be mostly ads”If that’s the way it’s supposed to work, I want none of it. There was a time I could check FB or Insta a few times&#x2F;week and see mostly friends&#x2F;family.:old man yelling at clouds:Also, elder Millenials. Snort. Gen-Xer here. I’m not even all that gray. Yet. reply pbourke I guess Elder Millenial is the new Boomer.Incoming on-brand Gen X comment: it’s funny that they even skip over us when handing out pejoratives. replydelfinom Your average person never gave a shit about good content. That&#x27;s the proof that&#x27;s been visible for centuries, where there were newspapers, there were tabloids with giant click-bait headlines to make a quick buck and it always worked, because people don&#x27;t want to read, they want just a headline to tell them how to feel.But those average people are the majority of \"views\" of said paper, that&#x27;s why all these media outlets are desperate for that ad revenue. They already have subscriber bases that are actual real interest in reading content.Welcome to the sad reality of our world, crack open a cold one and laugh with the rest of us. reply roody15 George Carlin said \"imagine how stupid the average person is then realize half of all people are stupider than that.\" reply edgyquant Such an insufferable quote. The vast majority of people aren’t stupid in any sense of the word just because they have different priorities than what the over zealous “smart people” think makes one smart. reply xvector It&#x27;s not just different priorities. The average person will more consistently act against their own self-interests (eg their own priorities) because they simply cannot reason well enough to choose the best path forwards for themselves. reply FpUser This guy is (should I say was? ) the best. Love his stuff. reply cgh George Carlin didn&#x27;t understand the difference between mean and median.

Dylan16807 \"more\" is not \"all\" or \"always\"Being better than average at a couple things is extremely common. It&#x27;s not delusional to point those things out.Most websites are good at something (excluding spam sites). replygnicholas Yes, it would have been a much better joke if he&#x27;d substituted the word \"median\", which wouldn&#x27;t have interrupted the flow at all. &#x2F;s reply Angostura “Average” can demote mode or median, though mean is the most common usage reply philwelch Human intelligence is normally distributed which means the mean and median are the same. reply MertsA Human intelligence is arguably not even truly ordinal, let alone cardinal. No one who reasonably understands human intelligence believes it&#x27;s as simple as a normal distribution. IQ is defined as a normal distribution but that doesn&#x27;t mean the difference between 100 to 110 IQ is comparable to the difference between 140 and 150 IQ. If you boil \"human intelligence\" down to nothing more than IQ, sure, but in reality there&#x27;s no such thing as a mean here and median is tenuous as well. reply root_axis Indeed, and also, same as it ever was. Before the dominance of the internet, television was the dominant structure of media, it is also jam packed full of ads and shitty \"click-bait\" news. As you allude to, that&#x27;s just life. reply nonethewiser Junk food reply chaostheory A lot of boomers still are not comfortable enough with navigating the internet. Apps like Facebook are easier for them. reply firecall I&#x27;d put a lot of everybody into that category, to be fair to boomers.Age isn&#x27;t a reasonable excuse at this point. Common access to the Internet has been with us for ~30 years. reply II2II It goes a bit deeper than that. Older people had to actively seek out news. They didn&#x27;t have to option to go to a service operated by an global corporation that pushed the headlines to them. (Or, as I used to put it to my generation back in the day: grandma invented the computer. We simply use them.) reply alistairSH Common access to the Internet has been with us for ~30 years.[deleted stuff about internet rollout at UVA in the mid-90s]Shit, that was 30 years ago. Thanks for making me feel old. ;) reply chaostheory Unlike subsequent generations, boomers weren’t born with the internet, and they’ve developed habits that fall outside of the internet like reading physical periodicals and subscribing to cable TV that they’ve kept for the past 30 years. reply pigeons All subsequent generations weren&#x27;t born with the internet either. I guess it depends on your definition of the internet, but ARPAnet didn&#x27;t start using TCP&#x2F;IP until the 1980&#x27;s. reply chaostheory That may hold water for some of Gen X, but it was still a key part of many of their formative years. Many Millennials literally grew up with it.To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that boomers aren&#x27;t smart enough to use technology. It&#x27;s just that old, comfortable habits are hard to break. Facebook for many of them is a safe, walled garden compared to the wild west internet. replyrobertlagrant 1If the only news is clickbait and ragebait then Facebook is in the right. If the news is good then the Canadian government is in the wrong. reply ysavir 1It&#x27;s not about who&#x27;s in the right. It&#x27;s about whether this law, as it plays out, acts in the best interest of the people.We can&#x27;t let our impression of how things should play out be determined by asking which self-serving powerful player deserves the right of way in policy making. reply robertlagrant 1I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re getting that from. I didn&#x27;t mention asking who should get the right of way.Have you not just rephrased my \"right\" and \"wrong\" as \"how things should play out\". I&#x27;m not sure why someone would do that. reply ysavir 1You&#x27;re right. You weren&#x27;t speaking with that intent and I brought that context into it. My apologies there.I think I was responding to the idea that because the government was acting in self-serving ways, that we were necessarily cheering on Facebook, and that what facebook is doing is \"standing up to...corruption\", when their own efforts are a corruption of a different kind. The phrasing there made me feel like I was being made to choose--that I was either cheering for facebook or for their rivals in this situation--and I didn&#x27;t feel that that choice was accurate. It&#x27;s possible to think that both parties are in the wrong, even if they are on opposite sides here.Your follow up post reinforced that feeling as it maintained the idea that one party or the other was in the right, but that post was also a direct response to what I said, and not necessarily a continuation of what you had posted earlier. So by continuing that thread I reinforced my own misinterpretation.I will try to better understand my own reactions to people&#x27;s posts in the future, and be better in responding in the appropriate context, not with a shift. reply robertlagrant Absolutely not a problem! I was just slightly surprised (-: reply roflc0ptic 1\"right\" and \"wrong\" are normative statements: quite literally they&#x27;re statements about how things should be. IMO it&#x27;s a reasonable read of your comment reply robertlagrant 17 I wasn&#x27;t saying who should get right of way.Just because right and wrong can imply the word \"should\" in a hypergeneric sense doesn&#x27;t mean I was talking about right of way. reply nonethewiser Clearly no limits on sharing news is the best policy. reply pluc Anything that gets people off Facebook is in the best interest of the people reply dmix Most Canadians are obsessed with American news anyway. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the bulk of people barely notice.If I was an American&#x2F;Euro&#x2F;South American news org I&#x27;d be staffing up my Canadian journos. Any org out of reach of the backroom dealing Ottawa private school clique can probably hire some local freelancers and fill the void by the end of the year. reply ImprovedSilence I mean, sure Facebook has its bad points, but anyone who thinks that this is true clearly has no idea how hard it was to stay connected to so many people pre-Facebook. And keeping up on those connections really does have value. reply nonethewiser I dont use facebook anymore and think life is better without it so I dont even care about the merits you listed. Even still, it doesnt mean we should legislate this opinion on others.Regardless, Canada isn’t protecting people from facebook. They didn’t ban news sharing, they just wanted to give their media companies a cut. reply nonethewiser Anything that stops sugar intake is in the best of interest of the people. reply nonethewiser > but doesn&#x27;t actually support that with a reason as to why that&#x27;s a lossBecause people want to share and visit news links. Evidenced by the fact that they shared and visited news links often. Its a bit condescending to suggest you know whats better for people than the people freely choosing to engage in news articles.Besides, the Canadian law doesn’t even ban news sharing on Facebook. It just institutes a shakedown. reply trompetenaccoun Exactly right. It&#x27;s shocking to see such an authoritarian-type viewpoint that far at the top. I don&#x27;t like Facebook (never had an account) but people sharing links is none of the government&#x27;s business. reply Apofis The news is best consumed stale. It&#x27;s a big win for Canadian consumers. reply ChumpGPT Rogers, Bell and Telus run Canada. It&#x27;s why Canadians have the highest mobile rates in the world. Trudeau offered to protect them for ever during NAFTA II and let them become Canadian Media Companies protecting them from any competition insuring Canadians will have less choice and higher rates for everything and basically letting Telco&#x27;s control over all media, etc. reply epgui These companies have an oligopoly, they don’t “run Canada” by any stretch of the imagination and even by the most charitable of interpretations. reply ChumpGPT They control the media and you only hear or get their sanctioned perspective. They can sway public opinion in any direction they want. Ultimately those who control the message control the narrative. They could destroy anyone then want, even the Prime Minister.Disclaimer: Not a conspiracy nut. reply epgui I love to hate all these companies, but no, they don&#x27;t control the media. I would challenge that disclaimer. reply nonethewiser Why do you think ChumpGPT is a “conspiracy nut”? reply haldujai In a more respectful way he&#x27;s probably getting at the fact that while the telecoms control a significant proportion of TV and radio there&#x27;s still the CBC (owned by the government at arm&#x27;s length, theoretically) and print media, which is arguably more important, that&#x27;s independent.Interestingly different from the US I would say the vast majority of Canadians I knew (including my elderly parents) get their Canadian political news from print media rather than TV (acknowledging that biases towards people who attended university and live in cities) which is more for local news if anything. Canadian TV channels are very underwhelming and have no where near the relevance of CNN or Fox News to US society. I would even modestly wager that CNN has a larger Canadian viewership than Canadian news channels.I expect a significant amount also get it from radio which from what I recall are mostly telecom owned. reply themitigating I think he is exaggerating the internet speed and competition issues that seem to be more prevalent in Canada. I don&#x27;t know if this is true anymore but a friend told me many plans have upload caps? reply epgui That part is not an exaggeration. We don&#x27;t have unlimited data plans for mobile AFAIK. Anecdotally, I pay around 90$ for somewhere between 6 or 10 GB per month, and I pay extra for long distance calls. I pay through the nose for international calls (sometimes when I have to make 20-60 minutes&#x27; worth of calls to the US my monthly bill goes up to 150$). An internet connection at home (fiber op) costs 120$&#x2F;month for 1.5 gbps.But it&#x27;s hard to see how that relates to \"running the country\". reply haldujai That&#x27;s a pretty crappy cell phone deal unless you&#x27;re somewhere really remote. Rogers offers 75GB @ 5G and unlimited throttled with Canada-wide long distance and North America roaming for $90.I&#x27;ve kept my Canadian # for posterity and I&#x27;m on a legacy plan for $50 that gets me 15GB and US-Can voice so you can definitely get cheaper ones through retention (the only way to get a good deal on wireless in Canada).> But it&#x27;s hard to see how that relates to \"running the country\".Agree that&#x27;s a bit much, they basically rule the CRTC (telecom regulator) which has never made an adverse decision against them to my recollection. The running joke was they had regulatory meeting at the National Golf Club in Toronto.They do own a fair proportion of TV & radio outlets and political influence but I wouldn&#x27;t call it running the country. reply VWWHFSfQ Is Canada still going forward with the law that USA streaming companies have to provide at least 30% domestically-sourced Canadian programming? I know EU and Australia did that. I appreciate the resistance to the continued American-ization of their cultures, but let&#x27;s be honest here. I can only think of Rush, Bieber, and Kids in the Hall. Where is the rest of the 30% going to come from? It&#x27;s going to be a lot of nonsense filler content that is only there to comply with some law.edit: actually, Apple Music might be able to cover their 30% quota just with Neil Young&#x27;s discography. reply nvy > I can only think of Rush, Bieber, and Kids in the Hall.Don&#x27;t forget Avril Lavigne, Drake, Gordon Lightfoot, Céline Dion, Joni Mitchell, deadmau5, The Weeknd, and Nelly Furtado.Just off the top of my head. Interestingly enough I&#x27;d never heard of Kids in the Hall before today. But all of those are or were \"Big Names\" in music.We have (protectionist, yes) media regulators (the CRTC) that are nominally arm&#x27;s length from elected governments so it&#x27;s not likely to change unless the Canadian public decides that this will become a major election issue. Don&#x27;t hold your breath. reply philwelch Yeah, I&#x27;ve always assumed that Canadians were overrepresented in popular culture as a consequence of Canadian content regulations. reply nvy Well we&#x27;re certainly overrepresented domestically, but there are still a reasonable number of Canadian acts that are known quantities south of 49. reply SonicScrub Off the top of my head, more recent ish bands that never really crossed the border: The Arkells, Metric, July Talk, Broken Social Scene, Billy Talent, Tegan and Sarah, and many more. These bands sell out large music venues domestically, but can&#x27;t gain much cross-border traction. They basically are able to exist because of Canadian Content laws. reply nvy Oh shit, forgot about Arkells. My wife went to high school with the bass player. reply haldujai Some other noteworthy ones include: Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, Bryan Adams, Barenaked Ladies and The Tragically Hip.Of course one shouldn&#x27;t forget what is perhaps Canada&#x27;s greatest contribution to music: Nickelback. replyTylerE Neil Young! reply thsksbd Well the Prime Minister himself agrees with you condescendingly saying there is no Canadian culture. reply nonethewiser Well Toronto does a lot of porn. reply Waterluvian 1I don&#x27;t necessarily think the government is right, but I can&#x27;t help but feel like it might be a very good thing that people affected by this will have to leave the Facebook garden and seek out news elsewhere.I&#x27;m really quite fine with this experiment happening. reply trts 1A choice is being imposed on citizens and private companies by the government, for the benefit of organizations that are influential with the establishment.An experiment is when you have a hypothesis about something that could be improved or optimized, test the hypothesis with a subset to find evidence or observe unintended effects of the change, replicate the finding, scale up, or revert depending on the outcomes observed.A national policy by fiat is somewhat the opposite of what I consider an experiment to be. reply danbolt The Grits, Tories, and media companies in Toronto are all lizard people, but they’re much easier for Canadians like me to bully via ballot box than the lizard people running Meta.(edit: as an aside, I just want to clarify that when I write “lizard people”, I mean to suggest politicians and corporate leadership acting out of self-interest rather than implying a bigoted conspiracy theory. I realized this could come off as anti-semetic in 2023; sorry if that landed poorly for anyone) reply thsksbd You&#x27;d have more representation buying a single meta stock than a lifetime of voting in Canadian elections.I cant think of any western country with a more (effectively) non linear response of seats vs. vote share than Canada. reply themitigating Maybe it&#x27;s best to not call them \"lizard people\" as that&#x27;s now conspiracy theory on right. If I saw someone on HN call a government official a lizard person I seriously wouldn&#x27;t know if they were being literal reply asvitkine The Canadian ballot box isn&#x27;t super effective though, since there&#x27;s not really much competition for the Liberals given they cover the center pretty well and many people don&#x27;t align with the Conservatives and NDP hasn&#x27;t been very viable... reply palijer 1>for the benefit of organizations that are influential with the establishment.Those organizations, being Canadian news organizations, employing Canadians, and making content for Canadian consumers. Aren&#x27;t those the sort of organizations that should be able to work with the Canadian government and influence Canadian laws?What sorts of organizations instead of those ones should be able to work with the government here? I think legislation should have outside influence, but I think I&#x27;m missing something here, or making the mistake of taking things at face-value. reply gruez 1>Those organizations, being Canadian news organizations, employing Canadians, and making content for Canadian consumers. Aren&#x27;t those the sort of organizations that should be able to work with the Canadian government and influence Canadian laws?You can make the same argument about local companies lobbying the government to enact tariffs to protect them from foreign competitors. The people being harmed are the same: consumers who end up with a worse product. How about nobody tries to influence the Canadian government to enact laws that distort the marketplace to their advantage? reply mardifoufs Oh so lobbying and cronyism is fine as long as it&#x27;s home grown?Why the hell would I care if the people who are trying to basically legislate themselves into profitability are Canadian or not? reply Barrin92 >A national policy by fiatThere is no such thing. This regulation is the consequence of a regularly passed law (Bill C-18), that passed with about 210 to 110 majority. If I remember public poling on the issue correctly, on the bill itself popular opinion was pretty evenly split, but the underlying principle of tech companies paying domestic news, had wide majority support.Framing this as something being imposed on citizens is disingenuous and effectively the Facebook PR line. Just with related media laws anywhere else it has little basis in reality. reply bregma But that&#x27;s what came up in their Facebook feed so that&#x27;s the truth they know. reply csomar How about get their news from independent journalists and fellow citizens? You know, kind of like we always dreamed it&#x27;ll be. reply Broken_Hippo How about get their news from independent journalists and fellow citizens?Because we do that now. \"News\" sites with independent journalist filled with misinformation. Aunt Marge telling you what happened, only putting a religious slant on it.And I can pretty well promise that neither Aunt Marge nor the \"news\" sites are going to have any news on the war in another country that your neighbor&#x27;s son just died in, nor a drought that has affected wheat prices globally or things like that.It isn&#x27;t that professional journalists always get things right, but its better than Aunt Marge and the \"news\" sites out there. reply barbariangrunge The rule is because of American monopolies and oligopolies. To have your news seen at all, you need to use major social media platforms or google. These platforms benefit from the news links, and the news has to fight to compete on those platforms, earning less and less revenue every year because the news is less engaging than flamebait. So the news gradually becomes flamebait to try to garner enough engagement to compete, otherwise the news stops existing, and next thing you know, investigative journalism is almost extinct.This isn’t an ideal solution, it’s basically a subsidy that big tech is supposed to pay for, but there is a massive, massive! power imbalance where the platforms are the only winners, so it’s also not the worst rule ever. I don’t know. The overwhelming power imbalance of oligopoly platforms is a thing, I’m not sure what to do about it. The issue is bigger than just news, and this law only partially addresses one aspect of the situation reply fauigerzigerk The issue of real journalism having to compete with sensationalist tabloids and clickbait is nothing new though. There was a time before all the blind rage turned against big tech when we actually found it problematic how much political influence media moguls like Murdoch, Berlusconi or Springer had accumulated.Google and Facebook have syphoned off a lot of advertising income from these big publishers and they are leveraging their political clout to make politicians pass laws that have nothing to do with journalism and everything to do with serving the special interests of a few powerful publishers.Yes the fact that too much money stays with Google and Facebook rather than funding serious journalism is a problem. But these laws are not supposed to fix that and they are not fixing it. It&#x27;s just corruption. reply teunispeters One of the nice things about Canada is a requirement to be honest within reason, and to always fact check - and handle if things don&#x27;t match later.For the news source I go to, this means they&#x27;re pretty reliable and honest - and not so prone to lying or deception. I mean at the end of the day people are people, and different agencies will have some bias, so I check across a bunch. And I avoid anything owned by Rupert Murdoch, as that drives down the quality by a lot. APTN for instance is good, and honestly so is Al Jazeera USA. I&#x27;ve liked CBC, and between the different programs they&#x27;re pretty good at calling out political bias - especially about their own. (the actual news news on CBC has some center-right bias towards either Liberal or Conservative parties - and will occasionally even air \"official lies\". Their long form shows on the other hand are much better and will catch out those \"official lies\". Canada is complicated in its own way). reply bushbaba 1Disagree. The law ensures there are Canadian media, which can be used to push media to the betterment of Canadians.Many countries have protectionist laws and this isn’t much different. reply chongli 1This is protectionist law but it’s not protecting independent media in Canada, it’s protecting big players like PostMedia, Bell, and Rogers. If anything this will just kill off the remaining small media companies in Canada, or force them to be bought up by the big companies. reply midasuni Those aren’t big players on a global basis. Canada is concerned its culture is at risk from globalisation, and those concerns are not without merit. reply VancouverMan > Canada is concerned its culture is at risk from globalisation, and those concerns are not without merit.I don&#x27;t think that preserving Canadian culture is a factor in any of this, nor does it seem to be a concern of the current government.These same politicians have been bringing in an absolutely staggering number of foreigners each year for many years now, with most of them from cultures that are extremely dissimilar from, if not outright incompatible with, what was Canadian culture. reply chongli Why does it matter whether they’re big players on a global basis or not? Those companies have an oligopoly over Canadian media. They also abuse their dominant position over Canadian wireless and broadband internet service, leading to some of the highest rates in the world.Yet the government is passing even more laws to try to give them cash grabs. These companies should be broken apart and the spectrum sold off to smaller players. Canadians need more competition in both media and wireless &#x2F; internet access, not less. reply wesapien What is Canadian culture? reply chongli This Hour Has 22 Minutes, The Red Green Show, Royal Canadian Air Farce, Corner Gas, Anne of Green Gables… That sort of stuff! reply _delirium Also: PostMedia, at least, is owned by an American hedge fund. I see this as more of an internecine war between U.S. capitalists over how to divide the spoils than anything else. Canada is only involved in a secondary role. reply indymike How does forcing some companies to pay to link TO a news story (and send traffic to that new story) do anything other than give an incentive not to link to news stories any more? How is making it impossible to discover news stories good for Canadian media? How is it good for Canadian citizens and Canadian democracy?The underpinning concept in HTML is:My document can link to your document without asking, and without cost.This whole, if you send traffic to me you have to pay me for it is backwards. reply gruez 1>Many countries have protectionist laws and this isn’t much different.And just like other protectionist laws, this is a dumb idea and is going to end up hurting consumers. reply lolinder 1How exactly does Facebook and Google blocking links to news in Canada ensure that there are Canadian media? I&#x27;m having trouble seeing the connection from \"fewer inbound links\" to \"sustainable Canadian news media\". reply mattstir 1Presumably he&#x27;s talking about the intent of the law, which seems to have been to ensure news outlets actually receive money for linked articles. It seems that the government didn&#x27;t expect Google or Facebook to just stop linking to Canadian news instead.Canada appeared to be attempting to emulate countries like Australia, Spain, France, etc that have passed very similar laws. It seems like the tech giants were perfectly happy to just cut ties with Canadian media rather than make a deal however. reply veave The very idea of having to pay to link to something is ridiculous.Imagine if I recommended you to watch a show on Netflix and I had to pay to give that recommendation. It makes absolutely no sense. reply SpeakinTelnet Its more like if instead of dropping you to a cinema a bus driver was showing you the full film so that you don&#x27;t have to enter the cinema and spend money there. reply lolinder Your analogy would only make sense if the bill were only trying to tax including all or part of a news article on Facebook&#x2F;Google. It sounds like instead any link would be taxable, so it would be more like the bus driver having to pay the cinema for the privilege of driving you there. reply SpeakinTelnet \"Clause 2(2) stipulates that news content is “made available” if two conditions are met: that it, or any portion of it, is reproduced; and that access to it is facilitated by “any means, including an index, aggregation or ranking of news content.” \"Just linking does not satisfy the first part of the clause according to the bill. reply lolinder Edit: mannerheim points out that OP is quoting from an outdated version of the bill, and the final version is much worse. I&#x27;m going to leave my original reply because I think my objection is also valid, but mannerheim&#x27;s point is more important:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37029066---I think that&#x27;s ambiguous enough to be problematic. For example, does a slug (headline-with-hyphens-in-it) count? If so, links often do. What about the headline? And what if a user copies a paragraph into their post?\"Any portion\" is language that gives away that this is intended to be read pretty broadly. There&#x27;s no qualifier, no \"significant\" or \"substantial\". If the goal were to prevent the kind of abuse that your bus driver analogy suggests, they should have been more specific. reply stephen_g &#x27;Any portion&#x27; seems very much key (although the final version of the law is apparently even worse). Sites linking (that is, driving free traffic to a news website) often include the time and a one sentence or so (or even just a truncated sentence with ellipsis) so people know what they&#x27;re clicking on. Sometimes a low-res thumbnail from the meta info.Obviously this is entirely beneficial for the news source for this to be shown - this bill is like trying to go after people for copyright infringement for showing somebody a movie trailer (since the movie trailer contains \"any portion\" of the full feature film). reply mannerheim I see an &#x27;or&#x27;, not an &#x27;and&#x27;.&#x27;Making available of news content (2) For the purposes of this Act, news content is made available if(a) the news content, or any portion of it, is reproduced; or(b) access to the news content, or any portion of it, is facilitated by any means, including an index, aggregation or ranking of news content.&#x27;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parl.ca&#x2F;DocumentViewer&#x2F;en&#x2F;44-1&#x2F;bill&#x2F;C-18&#x2F;royal-a... reply SpeakinTelnet There&#x27;s definitely a discrepancy in the various documentshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;lop.parl.ca&#x2F;staticfiles&#x2F;PublicWebsite&#x2F;Home&#x2F;ResearchP... reply mannerheim Your link is October 2022. Mine is the final version that was assented to on June 22, 2023. replyvarenc 1But if Facebook is blocking news links in Canada, it doesn’t seem like the law is having the desired effect. reply isaacremuant 1This only protects the Draconian Canadian government. The same that will take your money if you protest against it. reply sandworm101 1>> (and incompetent) political corruption.Hyperbolic and self defeating. If the corruption is incompetent then I guess there isn&#x27;t much effective corruption. Canada ranks well above even the US on most indexes of corruption. Not liking the current government is a totally different thing than a country being corrupt.Canada=14th, which is nothing to be embarrassed about.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Corruption_Perceptions_Index reply chrisco255 That is a \"perceptions\" index. Note corruption is not something which can be reduced to a scalar value and analyzed like temperature or pressure. It&#x27;s far more multivariate and complex than that.Even if, for the sake of argument, it was possible to do so, you would have to interrogate the methodology used to produce this value. Note the complexity in analyzing corruption by country. How does one investigate in detail, the governments of almost 200 countries? If one relies on survey results from members of those countries, how was the survey consistently conducted across language barriers, cultural barriers, and legal barriers?Finally, even if you believe all of those incredibly dubious factors were accounted for, it could be possible that being 14th in a world that is becoming more corrupt does not mean that Canada is improving in that regard. reply mardifoufs Typical Canadian response. Who said anything about the US?It&#x27;s amazing how we can make excuses for everything, as long as we delude ourselves that we somehow have it better than the US. reply tick_tock_tick This is all perception and especially for Canada most of the general view is just unbelievable massive incompetence rather then corruption. reply whimsicalism Most of these indices are nonsense and perception based. reply unpopular42 No way! A political index that doesn&#x27;t actually reflect the reality, has that ever happened? reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 I&#x27;m cheering on the content producers.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;science&#x2F;meta-instagram-canada-online... reply JacobThreeThree You can include Post Media, TorStar, Quebecor and other media in the list of those lobbying for this.It&#x27;s part Canadian protectionism and part desperate ploy to prop up a few large failed media business models.Canada has a long history of protectionist measures. The shocking part of the bill is the way it exposes the complete technical incompetence of the government. There are many ways to extract a pound of flesh, implementing your tax in a way that is fundamentally incompatible with the web is inexcusable. It will hurt Canada&#x27;s efforts to be a tech leader. reply firecall They did this in Australia.It all seemed like it was to prop up Murdoch owned media.The Australian Gov must have cut an acceptable deal with Google and Facebook though, as both threatened to do what FB has done in Canada.There are more details to it all, I&#x27;m sure. I&#x27;d have to go research more as I dont recall them all :-) reply osigurdson Fully agree. If the electorate can’t manage to get rid of this freedom constraining government in the next election then the country is probably a write off. At least it is hard to imagine how we can recover from another government like this. reply fooster That hyperbole is just that. Overly dramatic nonsense. If the other parties want to win an election they first must elect a leader who themselves speak to the remainder of Canadians. Which is something they managed to do even more badly this time around. reply sneak 48 Both sides of this argument are bad. The choices on the menu are \"Facebook chooses what links (published by users) to censor\" or \"the legislature chooses what links (published by users) to censor\".The dispute is just which authority decides what you get to share with your friends and contacts - not that you should be allowed to do so freely. reply jacquesm Funny, for once I find myself on the side of Bell, Roger ands Shaw (the CBC was in my good book anyway). That normally wouldn&#x27;t happen but if FB news feeds are exchanged by those of Bell, Rogers, Shaw and the CBC that could well be a net positive. reply aprdm Why should the government of Canada be on Facebook&#x27;s team instead of the Canadian Telecom&#x27;s team? reply great_psy 1A bit off topic, bye does anyone know why those monopolistic companies (bell Rogers) stocks are doing relatively poorly compared to even the US index? reply afterburner 1They already control all the market they&#x27;ll control in Canada, and they won&#x27;t expand outside Canada. Not a growth story. reply epgui Who says anything about corruption? This seems much more likely to be a result of technological incompetence. reply matheusmoreira In my country they tried to sneak in similar laws into a \"fake news\" censorship law. There were provisions to preempt this exact move: it would have made it illegal for social media companies to block the links.I guess Canada&#x27;s politicians weren&#x27;t sociopathic enough to think of such a thing. reply winddude huh? What? This has nothing to do with telecom. reply jiveturkey did you even read the post you&#x27;re replying to? \"PBO shows ...\". one google search away tells me> The analysis by the PBO, an independent body that provides economic and financial analysis to MPs and senators, concluded that newspapers and online media would get $81,550,000 a year, while broadcasters such as the CBC, Bell, Shaw and Rogers stand to get $247,677,000 if the bill becomes law. reply j45 1In Canada it will mean news from other places, including the US will likely directly or indirectly influence those feeds.UGC (User Generated Content) could remain commentary about these news articles when shared in, but it would require consumers to become creators. reply loeg 1The article states explicitly that news sources from the US would also be blocked. reply j45 1Yes it does. But will Buzzfeed type commentary choosing to interpret an interpretation and present it as facts about the articles also be blocked?I remember a facebook before any articles was posted there.News articles were brought in explicitly to get the news crowd there, and keep them engaged.I wonder how federated news delivery could work - anyone use anything like this. reply bparsons The entire Canadian media ecosystem is collapsing. This is a desperate last shot at salvaging a few newspapers. This is a rounding error of a rounding error for Meta.The Canadian media is almost universally right wing. Helping these outlets survive is almost certainly against the governing parties interest. reply flangola7 1Who is cheering on Facebook here?Facebook needs content to survive, as it does not produce anything itself.News agencies have THEIR content posted on Facebook, giving it value, not the other way around. reply ncann 1Google and FB can easily drive 30%+ of a news site&#x27;s traffic. If that&#x27;s not value to a news site I don&#x27;t know what is. reply rvnx 1News agencies and websites have their content reproduced on Google Search and News. That&#x27;s massive value for a search portal. reply warning26 1Then ban that, don&#x27;t ban linking. reply mattstir 1Who&#x27;s banning linking? The new law tried to get tech companies to pay to show the links with previews (similar to Australia and France, etc).To be clear, the bill is fundamentally broken. It would require Google or Facebook to pay simply when links to news sites are served, rather than for reproducing or condensing the material in the news article as a \"preview\" sort of be thing (as in other countries). The bill isn&#x27;t banning links explicitly, but the government should have seen this coming. reply rvnx 1From the perspective of the newspapers:Google is exploiting copyrighted content to make profit and create audience.If the search index of Google was empty, the people wouldn&#x27;t use Google, it&#x27;s that simple.So the newspapers are asking for royalties for feeding that search index. reply gruez 1But they could easily opt out with robots.txt. They want to have their cake and eat it too. They want the free traffic from search engines AND want google to pay them for the privilege of bringing them traffic. reply warning26 1That&#x27;s like demanding that Rand McNally pay a fee to each city they print onto their maps. Or demanding that World Book Encyclopedia pay a royalty fee to every entity they write an article about.Noting that something exists and including it in reference material should by no means incur royalties. reply faeriechangling As it turns out artists detest being paid in exposure and prefer money. reply stephen_g Paid for what? If Google and social media sites didn&#x27;t send people to the news sites for free through links, then the news sites would have to pay for a lot more advertising to get the same visitors... reply mardifoufs Traffic is money. But if you are right, I guess the media corporations don&#x27;t care since as you said, mere exposure is worthless.But they care a lot. So clearly that exposure must be worth something. reply bregma Traffic is not money. Traffic is exposure. Ads are money. Facebook keeps the ad revenue and the media are left with the expense of creating content. Exposure my bare behind. reply stephen_g That makes no sense. Social media drives people to the news site. Google and social media aren&#x27;t showing all or even large parts of the articles. If the news website fails to monetise those visits then it&#x27;s their problem... reply ncann \"Traffic is exposure\"? What are you talking about? People see links in Google and FB, a significant amount click on those links and visit the news site. How does FB keep the ad revenue? Your comment makes no sense. replygruez 1>News agencies have THEIR content posted on Facebook, giving it value, not the other way around.The relevant legislation isn&#x27;t just taxing the platforms for \"content\", it&#x27;s taxing the platforms for merely linking to the content. reply mannerheim Facebook needs content, but it doesn&#x27;t need news content.In fact, you could probably make the case Facebook would be made better without news content. It&#x27;s interesting that they chose to remove all news content for Canadians, rather than just Canadian news. I assume this was a good opportunity for them to try out some user testing. reply indymike > Facebook would be made better without news content.This. Times 1000. My neighbor&#x27;s cat&#x27;s incredible Easter Island vacation photos are much more interesting that 1000 articles about presidential politics. reply Transpire7487 Facebook posts their content, and in return the agencies can run ads and beg for subscriptions from the traffic that Facebook drives to them. They both benefit.Now nobody benefits. reply stephen_g People post links to their content. Not the content itself - this is a very strong misconception that has been at the heart of all of these bills and laws (Australia, this one, etc.) - from the start, there seems to be a determination to treat posting a link with maybe a headline and one sentence of preview as being the exact same thing as posting the entire article, which is incorrect and ludicrous! reply memefrog Facebook doesn&#x27;t post anything. These websites post things to their own pages and individuals post links to news articles. reply pseudotrash 1If it feels weird it&#x27;s because it is. The only effect of Facebook not distributing outrage clickbait to boomers can have: is positive.Remember relatives cheering for Trump, pro-russian narratives, and Anti-vaxx because it was on Facebook? Drinking from the fire-hose of (free but) manipulated content hurts our society and the planet.Any progress of getting rid of targeted ads is a net positive for people&#x27;s mental health, and the survival of our species.If Canada isn&#x27;t able to cover that niche that Facebook leaves behind, that&#x27;s another problem entirely. reply lolinder 1> not distributing outrage clickbait to boomersMeta comment in the interest of improving discussion in the future: this is why you&#x27;re getting downvotes.I&#x27;ve seen plenty of comments that include everything else you said and get upvoted to the top, but casual negative stereotyping of whole generations doesn&#x27;t play as well on HN as it does on other platforms. reply pseudotrash 1Interesting for me to reflect on this because I&#x27;m in that age group and most of my environment is too and they are absolutely my target of this comment. While I have skin in the game holding this position I wonder if those downvoting do too. How many friends did you lose to social media dividing you harder than I ever could, and who do you direct that anger to. :)never mind fake internet points or moron writers that optimizes content for likes or whatever their audience wants to hear. Schopenhauer and Taleb have already written plenty on the subject. reply simple-thoughts If you’re abandoning your friends because of political differences, you’re part of the problem. Picking fights with people because you don’t agree with them doesn’t change any minds and does make the world a little worse. Also, your beliefs may not be rooted in fact as much as you’d like or you might be more confident in your truth to win in its own. reply onlypositive Governments are for the people by the people.Cheering on Facebook is cheering against your own interests.Companies need to learn that they play in and extract resources from our sandbox.If they want to continue to play in our sandbox, they need to play by our rules. They need to act in a socially responsible way. There are even laws about corporate governance pertaining to this.You don&#x27;t have to agree with Canada&#x27;s laws (I don&#x27;t), but you do need to recognise that they are their laws. Being hostile like this is a good way to make enemies. reply lolinder Facebook is playing by Canada&#x27;s rules. They&#x27;re responding to the incentive structure that Canada set up for them and reacting appropriately.> Governments are for the people by the people.> Cheering on Facebook is cheering against your own interests.This is so exceedingly broken that I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. You really can&#x27;t envision any situation where a government might do something that is hostile to both a big company and \"the people\"? Where the government might make a decision that benefits a small set of companies at the expense of other companies and consumers in general?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Regulatory_capture reply sintaxi This is verifiably incorrect. Members of the Canadian House of Commons swear their allegiance to the monarch. They make no such oath to the People nor the Constitution in Canada.\"I, [name], do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and Successors. So help me God.\" reply onlypositive chill america reply sintaxi I&#x27;m Canadian. replyTranspire7487 1As a Canadian, I’m glad that Meta is doing this. Google is going to be doing it soon as well from what I’ve heard.The irony is the government says their intent was to “protect Canadian media by getting big tech to pay their fair share” and it is backfiring spectacularly. Having the opposite effect where there is less traffic going to these media sites, and will have a big impact on their bottom line from their innability to run ads on their own domains and make revenue that way.Of course, this will just lead to another media bailout making them even more reliant on government subsidy - which the Liberal party will use as a wedge issue come election time because the opposition (which is leading and gaining in the polls right now) will want to defund them. Wether this would be successful as an election issue is yet to be seen, but there’s one thing that the Liberal party is good at is demonizing the opposition and if their gravy train is on the line I’m sure e media corps will gladly indulge him.And of course this completely neuters independent media which is much more likely to actually be critical of the establishment. Leaving only pro establishment agencies in place to do the bidding of the hand that feeds them.So the big players take a hit to revenue (and get bailed out), and every one else gets completely wiped out.It’s absolutely sinister what Justin Trudeau’s government is doing. I used to think they were just stupid but it’s scandal after corruption scandal after corruption scandal with him. At some point you stop giving them the benefit of the doubt. reply chaostheory > Having the opposite effect where there is less traffic going to these media sites, and will have a big impact on their bottom line from their innability to run ads on their own domains and make revenue that way.I think this happened to France early on. What they did was to force Google to pay no matter what. Optically, it looks like extortion and protectionist laws for incumbents too big to fail.I’m not sure Canada can go that route though since they probably care about their relationship with the US unlike France. reply xvector I really want to see tech companies pull out of France and watch it collapse technologically overnight because of this. Ridiculous that the government can get away with acting like this. reply nonethewiser I can’t find that anywhere. I see google was fined for not compensating publishers. But not that google blocked news or whatever in France and still owed publishers something. reply xvector https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;07&#x2F;13&#x2F;business&#x2F;media&#x2F;google-fra...After Google decided to block all news, the French government accused them of \"not operating in good faith.\" reply cmrdporcupine It&#x27;s all just consistent with Canadian economic policy since confederation and before. The preference here is for monopolies dating back to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, etc, and powerful protected interests in large part control the state here ... Both major parties are completely under their control, just with variance in the sectors. The federal Conservatives are dominated and controlled these days by western energy sector interests (and the provincial Ontario ones by real estate development). The federal Liberals by the Westons and Bell and, it seems, the shrinking media sector.Nationalism is the sugar water they use to sweeten the deal to make it palatable to Canadians. People have a gut reflex to swallow this stuff because they are rightly or wrongly attuned to the threat of dominance from the US.When Harper was prime minister, it was all about fossil fuel companies, defunding and silencing climate scientists, shoveling money into projects in the west and energy sector, etc. With Trudeau it&#x27;s just a different pile of bullshit.I&#x27;m sick of the dysfunction. It&#x27;s a corrupt state, with corrupt, colonial foundations. reply FredPret Try going to an actual corrupt state with colonial foundations. Canada is heaven on earth with zero problems in comparison. reply chongli We’re not North Korea or anything like that, but we have a pretty terrible legacy with residential schools and the destruction of indigenous people’s families, languages, and cultures, not to mention land.Canada is also in the midst of the biggest housing affordability crisis we’ve ever had. We’re in 3rd place in the world behind Luxembourg and Portugal for the most unaffordable housing, relative to income.The U.S. may have some serious affordability issues in the Bay Area, Seattle, and New York, but large swaths of the rest of the country aren’t so bad. Most Canadians are crowded into a few extremely unaffordable cities. reply SllX One of the ways less corrupt countries keep it that way is by free societies calling out and addressing that corruption. When we refuse to, that’s when corruption festers, even if it looks like heaven on earth to an outsider, corruption is corruption. reply zmmmmm The problem with all of these laws is the lack of integrity in the underlying logic. The laws are written because ad revenue is no longer supporting news. But the laws are written as if somehow this is connected to social media and search linking to news media content. It just isn&#x27;t. You can take away all the news media content (as Facebook is) and you will still have no ad business left for news media. The ads are going where the eyeballs are and it&#x27;s just a brutal fact that the eyeballs want much more than news media - they want a lot of other things that the news media aren&#x27;t providing. So they go where they can get what they want.Trying to fix any complex problem without addressing the root cause is nearly always going to be futile. The root cause here is something important to society (news media) is intrinsically &#x2F; structurally impossible to fund organically. The people who need it most either can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t pay for it (and many are in the \"can&#x27;t\" bucket).Guess what, there are many things like that. We structurally can&#x27;t fund hospitals, roads, defense either based on organic funding methods. When we want or need something that can&#x27;t be funded like that, there is one party that is supposed to step up to the table - designed by intent for that purpose.Which is all to say that to me, a lot of what is happening here is theatrics because governments want to avoid doing the actual hard thing which is convincing taxpayers that this should be part of what we support through broad based support as societies. reply notatoad > governments want to avoid doing the actual hard thing which is convincing taxpayers that this should be part of what we support through broad based support as societies.I think it’s a level beyond that, to the point that I’d just call it pure corruption. A government-mandated fee that a company has to pay isn’t any different than a tax. They’re taxing big tech, which is fine, and most people wouldn’t have a problem with that.But then instead of booking that as revenue and deciding what to do with the money as part of the normal budgetary process, they’re short-circuiting procedure to send that money to news companies. If the government wants to fund news companies, it should be done in the normal way that all the other government funding gets decided upon, not in a special allocation just for news companies that is excluded from the federal budget. reply AYBABTME Next they&#x27;ll sue for monopoly on eyeballs and they&#x27;ll have a strong case, as evidenced by how these two companies were able to starve an entire country&#x27;s news medias by merely ignoring them.I think what the Canadian govt is legislating is silly but it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s no problem: foreign governments in the US-sphere are losing a ton of tax revenue to US entities that are capturing all the value. This essentially strips the residents of wealth, further putting them at a comparative disadvantage in all other fields. Eyeballs are at the center of the largest commercial entities on the planet. There&#x27;s a lot of value here being sent to the US with no obvious return mechanism.Not recognizing this will prevent any mutually agreeable solution from being found. Canada isn&#x27;t keeping up with the US and things aren&#x27;t looking up either. reply zmmmmm If they simply acknowledged that and said \"we are making a tax on tech social&#x2F;search companies\" and then that they were distributing the proceeds of that to news&#x2F;media? I&#x27;d be fine with it. It&#x27;s the theatrics that are the problem - pretending the underlying issue is social&#x2F;search \"stealing\" content from news media.This isn&#x27;t benign - setting precedents that linking to something is stealing it is toxic to the whole concept of the internet itself. It may take a while to seep through but that precedent is going to get built on by every other aggrieved party who sees an opportunity there eventually. reply steebo 53 Theatrics are a part of politics. Do you think you&#x27;re the only one who sees through them? Who cares what they call it? reply nologic01 Newspapers and magazines thrived for more than a century on ads, subscriptions and the like.The calculus will have to change in the digital era. There are effects like zero marginal cost that are genuine challenges. But the targeted adtech period is such a great economic and social distortion it makes a difficult problem almost impossible. reply kredd 1This actually made our neighbourhood and local politics Facebook groups more tolerable (which is the only reason I still use it once a week). It was basically 24&#x2F;7 ragebait articles being shared around anyways, since that’s the only way of gathering large-scale engagement. reply barbazoo 1> local politics Facebook groupI can&#x27;t even imagine why someone would voluntarily participate in something like that. You must be among am exceptional group of people. :) reply lolinder 1I would assume that they don&#x27;t mean \"local group discussing national politics\", but \"local group discussing local politics\". Think city councils and mayors.At least where I&#x27;m at, local politics is the only sane politics left. It helps that in my city we don&#x27;t have a party system at the local level, so candidates have to run on their own platform instead of on party affiliation. reply kredd 1Fastest way to get information regarding street closures, city events, infrastructure upgrades and etc. At least in my city 80% of the people in the group sound reasonable, so it’s fun Saturday morning reads.Most of the toxicity comes from larger political groups, and yeah, agreed they are absolutely trash. reply whstl 1I&#x27;m not Canadian (nor American), but I used a few back in the day when I had Facebook. It was actually not that bad when people used those groups for local politics only. When it becomes too partisan then it&#x27;s unbearable, but moderators can squash that. reply jprete 1I think that requires the moderators to be willing to do so, both in the sense that they are inclined to strongly moderate the group, and in the sense that they aren’t themselves getting an emotional high out of the ragebait. reply j45 1Especially the comment sections, felt like the first time people discovered trolling on internet forums. reply elemos 1The cool thing about humanity is it’s almost always someone’s first time. reply montroser 1Okay, fine, but do you really want your government to be moderating your Facebook conversations about your government? reply mitthrowaway2 1The government isn&#x27;t moderating Facebook conversations about the government. reply gxt Good. If journalists had been doing their job for the last 15 years they would not need federal intervention to force other businesses to fund them, they would not need subsidies, and we would not have these incompetent politicians and these repeated failures on almost every level of government.Journalists need to do their job for subscribers and the public:* Keep an updated profile on every elected official, judge, journalists, high level clerk, private entities and their owners who work for government and who get money from government.* Keep track of the MONEY by providing analysis and correlations of potential misbehaving officials.* Who voted for what and how it conflicts with their promises for the term.* Every statement from elected official and how it conflicts with previous statements, corresponding retractions or post mortems.* Previous and future employment history of elected officials to root out ethicsless individuals.* There&#x27;s a very long list of accountability measures journalists should be providing to make them worth their weight but they do only the above with extreme ideological selectiveness which nullifies it all. It needs to be done in full for them all of them to be objective and to get Canadians to subscribe to them. reply codedokode Note that the law intentionally has a backdoor that allows to exclude any digital platform from having to bargain with media outlets by decision of Governor [1]:> The Commission must make an exemption order in relation to a digital news intermediary if ... the following conditions are met:> ...> (b) any condition set out in regulations made by the Governor in Council.So instead of treating every digital platform equally and clearly writing the rules they have reserved an option to make arbitrary exemptions. I wonder, who will get an exemption? Canadian search engine? Or maybe a company managed by a friend of the Governor?The definition of \"eligible news business\" (who is supposed to receive money) is also written unclearly, for example in article 27:> 27 (1) At the request of a news business, the Commission must, by order, designate the business as eligible if it ...> ...> produces news content that is not primarily focused on a particular topic such as industry-specific news, sports, recreation, arts, lifestyle or entertainment, andThis rule allows to exclude anyone, because you can always say that this newspaper is too focused on politics, that one is too focused on the war etc.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parl.ca&#x2F;DocumentViewer&#x2F;en&#x2F;44-1&#x2F;bill&#x2F;C-18&#x2F;royal-as... reply newsclues \"Governor in Council\" in the Canadian political system is the Cabinet.Who serve at the will of the PM, he recently just shuffled them around. Recently the government has concentrated and centralized power in remarkable ways that goes largely unnoticed. reply dmix This has been the largest trend in western countries since early 2000s (growth in executive&#x2F;PM power). And Canada wasn&#x27;t even close to the notorious executive over reach of the US until recently (if anything Canada has long been a better beacon for state-rights&#x2F;federalism than even the US), but like all Canadian politicians they get jealous of the US system of power. reply nonethewiser Im not sure that it goes unnoticed. People are literally asking for it. Not necessarily the particular event you mention but generally for the government to expand power with the expectation that they can do more good. reply gumby 1This has happened in every other places such a plan has been tried like Spain or Australia. What did they expect?And really, what else could goog&#x2F;fb etc do -- what other company or person for that matter would pay someone in order to provide them a service? Governments tax things they want less of (e.g. smoking) so this should be no surprise. reply hirundo 1The article says the opposite about Australia: Sylvain Poisson of Hebdos Quebec confidently said “they made those threats in Australia and elsewhere and every time they back down.” Chris Pedigo of the U.S.-based Digital Context Next assured the committee “it’s important to understand what happens when these bills become law. In Australia, they moved quickly to secure deals.And apparently we&#x27;ve yet to hear from Google on this regarding Canada. But what&#x27;s different? It&#x27;s hard to see how Google can have a principled objection to Canadian but not Australian danegeld. reply jsnell 1The dirty secret is that the Australian law doesn&#x27;t actually apply to anyone. They passed the law, but left it to the government to define which companies are in scope. And the government never designated any companies to it.Basically it appears that the tech companies signing the same kinds of deals as elsewhere is being spun as a success of the legislation, even though the law does not apply to anyone, as a face saving measure. reply anotherevan [Australian here] Recalling these &#x27;negotiations&#x27; when they happened and when Facebook blocked news links for a short while (which was actually quite a lovely time) - the whole thing came across as a shake-down with all the subtlety of a tele-evangelist. reply graeme I&#x27;m Canadian and I suspect our problem is that we&#x27;re approaching this in earnest, not realizing that the Australian law was a shakedown and made no sense from an earnest perspective.We were advised by Australia&#x27;s top policy wonk, but maybe he was in earnest and didn&#x27;t understand the game he was in. reply xvector I just don&#x27;t understand how anyone with a shred of intelligence could even think of this law and not immediately realize it&#x27;s a shakedown.Your policymakers are either- earnest and incredibly stupid- malicious and only somewhat stupidThere&#x27;s just no in-between here. A child that has done ten minutes of research on the issue could realize the problems with these bills. reply kirrent I&#x27;ve got mixed feelings about the news media bargaining code but I don&#x27;t think the lack of designations is one of its problems. Only stepping in once negotiations fail seems to be how the law is intended to operate. 52E(3) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 says that in making the designation that the code applies the minister must consider:1. Whether a significant bargaining power imbalance exists.2. Whether the platform has made a significant contribution to the sustainability of news media.As to 1. the mere existence of the code seems to redress any power imbalance somewhat. As for 2. The actual deals Facebook and Google made in response to the law being enacted are confidential, but many news media companies said they were happy with the results so there wouldn&#x27;t seem to be any reason to designate these organisations in the first place. reply js4ever Same in France reply peanuty1 1Google has also confirmed they will be removing links to Canadian news. reply cat_plus_plus 1Details matter? Australian law may have had details to make negotiations happen and result in deals that are still commercially viable for search engines. reply gumby I believe the Australian deals were \"tell you what: we won&#x27;t pay you, but we&#x27;ll continue to send you traffic\" and the papers realised that that was better than the alternative: \"we won&#x27;t pay you and we won&#x27;t send you traffic either.\" reply steebo 44 As a Canadian, I applaud this. And I hope the government sticks to its guns. This is not just about \"big Canadian media\", it affects a lot of small outlets who draw from the journalism fund as well.It was stupid to allow media business models to depend on monopolistic search engines and social media platforms in the first place. This stuff is like hard drugs. For everybody.And getting off the smack is painful.The Canadians who care about this are going to find other ways to get their news. And the ones who don&#x27;t weren&#x27;t part of the real readership in the first place. reply dagaci 1Bad for the Canadian so called trolling bottom feeding viral \"News\" services, and I actually expect great for Canadians and their mental health and productivity - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apa.org&#x2F;monitor&#x2F;2022&#x2F;11&#x2F;strain-media-overload reply granzymes 1I hope Google follows through, too. The government forcing two companies to pay for links to news is pretty disgusting rent seeking by media companies. reply whynotmaybe 1Are \"links\" the issue or showing a summary of the article? reply graeme The media actual controls the summaries seen. They purposefully made large, enticing summaries in order to encourage clicks! They are free to write any summary they want. reply nitwit005 1Linking is the issue, despite them also complaining about the summaries. reply r00fus 1They did. reply flangola7 1That&#x27;s an opinion to have but the Canadian people, through their elected representatives, have decided they disagree and have codified that requirement into law.The Canadian people have asked their government to pass these laws and Facebook doesn&#x27;t want to follow them. No one is forcing Facebook to operate in Canada. They&#x27;re welcome to leave at any time if they don&#x27;t like it - we all know FB talks a big game and won&#x27;t do that, but I know I&#x27;m not alone in secretly hoping it happens anyway. Zuck can go zuck himself. reply granzymes 1Let’s be honest, the Canadian government is acting on behalf of the politically influential and well-connected media companies.And Facebook is complying with the law by removing links. It’s just not the compliance the lobbyists were hoping for. reply smoldesu 1> and Facebook doesn&#x27;t want to follow them. No one is forcing Facebook to operate in Canada.OP&#x27;s article seems to indicate that Facebook is already following these rules without issue. reply alphanullmeric 1The “we voted for it so it’s voluntary” people always seem to move goalposts when you try applying their logic in a scenario that doesn’t benefit them. Would you like to prove me wrong? reply nonethewiser > For months, supporters of Bill C-18, the Online News Act, assured the government that Meta and Google were bluffing when they warned that a bill based on mandated payments for links was unworkable and they would comply with it by removing links to news from their platforms.So its already moved from “Facebook removing news is bad and not going to happen as a consequence of this law” (the quote) to “the Canadian government’s ban on news is good for Canada ( the comments here).The intention was never to ban news. It was to take a cut. If they wanted to ban news that would have been the law. Regardless of whether you think the effect is good or not, the laws purpose has failed. It was a blunder. reply mr_toad Increasing tax rates doesn’t always increase tax revenue.It’s like every year some government somewhere learns this the hard way. reply pmontra 1> Canadian media is a loser, particularly the small and independent media outlets that are more reliant on social media to develop community and build their audience.So, regulatory capture by the largest media companies? reply ta8645 This is likely the intended result, without caring at all if it generates revenue for the large media corporations. Consolidated media is easier to influence and manipulate. reply gmerc And nothing of value was lost. We need a do over that aligns news with incentives for a working democracy. Now of course this isn’t it, but burning down Facebook news is a good step into the right direction. reply blindriver 1Stupid, stupid, stupid politicians and media companies. I&#x27;m glad to see tech companies show some backbone to the sheer hubris and greed that they were being subjected to.There is no other way that news companies will be shared except via social media. I hope within weeks they are on their knees, begging for the law to be repealed. Too bad you can&#x27;t recall politicians in Canada the same way you can in the US. reply 3LazTjBv-f I am not sure I understand it correctly. It is not about Google News ripping article title and summaries but platform users sharing links? Publisher wanted to be paid for that? reply 87 more comments...",

American Tobacco. U.S. Steel. Alcoa. AT&T. IBM. Microsoft. These cases are almost always against high-tech firms that control a key sector of the economy, and win or lose, they determine what our society looks like going forward. Because of a ruling last week, we’re about to add Google to that list of famous corporations facing a monopolization claim by the government. For two months this fall, a judge named Amit Mehta, who is presiding over this antitrust case against Google, will become one of the most important economic policymakers in the world. Judge Mehta will be this important because of Google’s outsized place in our society. The firm knows more about most people than their families, answering intimate questions from billions of us, every day, and controlling much of our communications to boot. It has 95% market share in search, annual revenue of a little less than $300 billion, and 15 products with more than 500 million users. We’ve perhaps never seen any corporate asset as powerful as Google search, with marketing professor Scott Galloway going so far as to say in 2017 that “Google is God.” And at trial, Google will use that dominance as its main narrative, essentially saying 'Why are you picking on us? Our search engine is awesome! Everyone uses us!” The Antitrust Division will hopefully respond with “No, your search engine was awesome, but it’s increasingly ad-filled crap. You’re too powerful, you’re too lazy, and America needs some real competition.” Which narrative will win? Let’s dive in. Judge Amit Mehta is presiding over the Google antitrust case brought by the Trump administration in 2020. Escaping Nazis, Breaking Up Monopolies When you walk into the Washington D.C. district courthouse, you encounter a display describing the role of the court as it pertains to corporate power and competition. If you look closer, on the upper right corner, there’s a cartoon of a judge named Harold Greene, drawn as a man in a robe tangled up in phone cords. The cartoon represents Greene’s role in the AT&T antitrust case in 1982, when this confident and smiling judge broke up the biggest corporation in the world, ushering in the modern age of telecommunications There are many Supreme Court Justices who have served as judges in this district, but it is telling that it’s Greene’s visage on display. And that’s because of the historical importance of the AT&T antitrust case, shown to all who enter the building and pass that hall. The D.C. district court matters because of big swings like that one, because of judges like Greene. Greene was an immigrant, and an extraordinary American. Born in Germany in 1923, he fled the Nazis, enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, and then went to night school. He ended up at the Justice Department, where he helped draft the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1978, Jimmy Carter put him on the court as a district judge. A few years later, Greene issued a ruling finding that AT&T was monopolizing a ‘broad variety’ of telecommunications equipment and services. AT&T, realizing it was going to lose, agreed with the Justice Department to break itself up. Greene was a fair man, but no fool. He was highly attuned to the vagaries of political corruption and what Congress meant in passing various antitrust laws, such as the Tunney Act, to let judges block corrupt consent decrees between the government and powerful firms. Greene even disparaged earlier settlements with AT&T by the Department of Justice as “blatantly inequitable and improper,” and demanded one that would fulfill the “goal of de-concentrating AT&T's vast economic power.” And so it did. The break-up delivered. Rates soon came down for consumers, but far more importantly, there was a massive explosion of innovation, including, in all likelihood, the development of the internet and mobile telephony. It’s hard to overstate the impact of this decision, ushering as it did in the modern telecommunications era. (Greene was known for a time as the ‘father’ of telecommunications law.) And this remarkably beneficial change happened because the case landed in the lap of a man with a deep perspective on power and life. “I guess my tendency is, in a sense, to be for the person who appears to be pushed around,” Greene said in an interview about how he understood the law as an instrument of fairness for those without power. This isn’t to say Greene always ruled in favor of the little guy, he knew anyone could violate the law. But he did recognize the temptations of power, which he saw up close in Nazi Germany. “I never think my past experience has anything to do with my judicial philosophy,” he said, “but one thing you do learn living in a dictatorship is that there is no impartial law.” Fairness was intrinsic to Greene’s thinking, so he was willing to follow the statute laid out by Congress, even if that meant applying the law as written to an iconic center of concentrated power in America. The Stakes of the Case This fall, another immigrant jurist, Judge Amit Mehta, will take up Greene’s mantle, in the same building displaying a cartoon of the great man tangled up in phone cords. Last week, Mehta ruled that today’s giant monopoly, Google, must face the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, as well as state attorneys general, in a trial over whether it has monopolized the search market. Mehta issued an opinion on summary judgment in which he stated that the accusations laid out by the plaintiffs, if proved at trial, show that Google’s business model is illegal, and that the firm might need to be split up. The case coming to trial was first brought under Trump in 2020 and continued by Biden. It is also the first monopolization case brought to trial by the Antitrust division in 25 years, since Microsoft in 1998. What’s the allegation in the case? The government argues that Google has a monopoly of general search and search advertising, roughly 90-95% of the market. Google has maintained this monopoly, the government alleges, not by making a better product, but by locking down everywhere that consumers might be able to find a different search engine option, and making sure they only see Google. How does Google lock out rivals? Well, it pays $45 billion a year to have distributors refuse to carry its competitor’s products, signing deals with “Apple, LG, Motorola, and Samsung; major U.S. wireless carriers such as AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon; and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb— to secure default status for its general search engine and, in many cases, to specifically prohibit Google’s counterparties from dealing with Google’s competitors.” Essentially, Google has bought up all of the shelf space where search is placed in front of consumers, which is to say browsers and phones. This behavior is very similar to what Microsoft did in the 1990s, when it bundled its browser with its operating system, and signed deals with ISPs to block its browser rival Netscape from getting access to customers. The analogy isn’t a coincidence, as the Microsoft case is controlling precedent. It should be a slam-dunk case, and not just because Google search has become much much worse over the last five to ten years, packed increasingly with ads and poor results. To understand why this case makes sense, look no further than the experience of Neeva, a search engine whose quality was as high or higher than that of Google, but died a few months ago because it just couldn’t get access to customers. Neeva, according to David Pierce in the Verge, was “running an AI product, a full-stack search engine, and a privacy-first browser… If people went through all the bother of switching, they became converts,” Pierce wrote. “The problem was that very few of them managed to make it past the thicket of default settings and redirections.” I actually used Neeva, and it was excellent, an innovative service better than Google. But as all defaults are set to Google, there are an endless number of screens encouraging people to set their search engine to that of the search giant. So Neeva, despite its quality, couldn’t get in front of potential customers. It died. These default settings and redirections are what’s on trial, because that’s what killed Neeva, and prevents anyone from investing in the next search competitor. If Google is found guilty and disciplined reasonably by being broken apart and having a choice screen imposed, then the new technologies of machine learning/AI will be deployed in a competitive marketplace, with immense possibilities similar to those after the AT&T break-up. And it’s not just newcomers like Neeva who could compete. In 2020, the Financial Times reported that Apple is preparing its own search engine in case its deal with Google falls apart due to this very antitrust case. So if the government wins, we’ll see immense innovation and new entrants. If Google wins, however, then machine learning/AI will be deployed consistent with how Google, and perhaps Microsoft, chooses to deploy them, which is to say, slowly, un-creatively, and in service to monopoly power. In many ways, cases like these are why Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, and why antitrust laws are considered the ‘Magna Carta of free enterprise.’ The inflection point here is like that of telecom in the 1980s - would we be a society of walled gardens controlled by AT&T, or one with competition where consumers could get access to this thing called… the internet? That’s the question Greene answered, with courage and wisdom. And now Mehta gets his shot to answer that same question. A Time When Monopolies Weren’t Pervasive But the stakes, and the merits of the case, are about where the similarities between these two periods end. When Greene presided over the AT&T trial, America was a much more equal society, and there simply weren’t very many monopolies. AT&T was an anomaly, a regulated monopoly whose long distance business was being assaulted by MCI and new ways of carrying voice transmission. There was also a fairly robust regulatory apparatus - the Federal Communications Commission hadn’t yet been gutted, and many states regulated phone prices effectively as well. Moreover, antitrust precedent was pretty good, judges were mostly not libertarians, and the corporate world accepted the rule of law as a meaningful check on their behavior. This is not to say the politics of the case were easy. The Defense Department and the Commerce Department opposed the case, and Ronald Reagan was highly and explicitly favorable to big business. Moreover, the case had been inherited from the Carter administration, and Reagan had a very different view of antitrust. Indeed, his antitrust chief, Bill Baxter, mostly ended antitrust enforcement, dropping the major IBM challenge that had been pursued since the 1960s. But in the case of AT&T, Baxter sought to litigate this particular complaint “to the eyeballs.” There was a very Reaganite rationale to his aggression. Baxter did not care that AT&T was a monopoly, but believed in deregulation, and thought the regulated part of AT&T was unfairly cross-subsidizing its position in long distance. It was an unusual situation, not just Greene getting the case in his lap, but Baxter’s ideological inflexibility and genuine good faith. Today, almost everything is different. Let’s start with the judge. Mehta is an immigrant, but other than that, his career tracks very much like the technocratic elites characterizing most of our judges. He does not have the experiences of Greene, who saw in the Nazis just how dangerous concentrated power truly can be. By contrast, Mehta grew up in a suburb of Maryland, worked at the big law firm Latham and Watkins for a few years of training, was a public defender in D.C., and then served as a white collar defense attorney. This isn’t to say Mehta is hostile to antitrust, he did block the merger of Sysco and US Foods, though that one was fairly obvious. It’s just that Mehta is mostly a creature of D.C., and he doesn’t, as far as I can tell, have a strong record of recognizing the threat of concentrated corporations, or an instinctive skepticism of the powerful. We can already see some problematic choices from Mehta. Google executives, including its CEO Sundar Pichai, have been found, in multiple cases, including this one, of destroying evidence related to potential antitrust violations. Apparently, chat logs involving discussions over antitrust show “that Pichai personally asked whether a chat group’s history could be turned off and then attempted to delete that message.” A different judge in California sanctioned Google for this bad behavior, but not Mehta. Indeed, Mehta has fretted about document destruction, but so far has done nothing. This kind of bad faith behavior by Google, and lack of sanctioning from Mehta, is exactly what Judge Greene would never have tolerated. It is a statement through inaction that the law doesn’t apply to the powerful. One reason for this kind of behavior is that the America in which Mehta is operating is different than the America of Greene’s era. In 1982, AT&T was a one-off, a regulated monopoly in a generally competitive corporate American order. Google, by contrast, is a pace setter of an America that is now full of monopolies, because of the lack of antitrust enforcement for decades. Today, corporate executives see the law as mere suggestions, and generally believe they can get away with anything. Judges have adopted an attitude of deference to corporate power, as Mehta did on document destruction. (This isn’t unique to judges; Merrick Garland’s former spokesperson, Anthony Coley, is a cheerleader for Google and even implied his former boss is engaged in unethical actions in litigating a Trump-era case.) There is also a loss of faith in American institutions writ broadly, which differs from the 1980s. At the same time as he’s been dealing with Google, Mehta is presiding over trials of January 6th perpetrators, a showcase of the deep fissures that simply did not exist decades earlier. One result is that the politics of corporate power is very different, and that antitrust is on a generational and bipartisan upswing. (Indeed, Trump’s Attorney General Bill Barr brought the case, Biden’s antitrust chief, Jonathan Kanter, is continuing it.) The net effect is that Mehta is an important actor here, but not as important as Greene. The case is likely to be appealed, probably all the way to the Supreme Court. And if the Supreme Court erodes antitrust caselaw against Google, then Congress will be confronted with the reality that it is hard to use the existing antitrust laws to address big tech. But ultimately if no cases against dominant firms succeed, then eventually Congress will change the law. Moreover, this case isn’t a one-off; the environment is less like AT&T in 1982, or even Microsoft in 1998, and more like that of the turn of the 19th century, when Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson brought dozens of cases against dominant firms. This is one chapter in the fight over corporate power, but not the only one. Google: We Are Too Awesome to Be an Illegal Monopoly So far, I’ve laid out the arguments in the case, and the historical context. But what about Google? What do they say about the allegations? Google’s essential argument is that search is about economies of scale, and that it owns the whole market because consumers prefer its search engine to rivals. While Google may engage in behavior to exclude competitors, it needs to do so to get the data to improve its search engine. Fundamentally, Google argues, its ability to exclude others is a good deal for America. Consumers love Google search so much that its monopoly is legal. As Google lawyer John Schmidtlein put it, “conduct that is a superior product or competition on the merits cannot, as a matter of law, violate the antitrust laws, regardless of its effect.” Basically, Google argues, we can do whatever we want as long as we can show consumers are happy. While this argument isn’t necessarily persuasive to me, it is a very strong narrative to someone like Mehta. To people like us, it’s clear that Google is coasting, and produces an increasingly shoddy product. (As one ex-Googler recently put it, “Google has 175,000+ capable and well-compensated employees who get very little done.”) Google used to be magic, but that was 10 years ago. Today search increasingly sucks, full of too many ads and crappy results peddled for Google’s own self-interest. For instance, as the Washington Post noted in 2020: The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine stored some Google search results over the years. When we look back, a picture emerges of how Google increasingly fails us. There’s more space dedicated to ads that look like search results. More results start with answer “snippets” — sometimes incorrect — ripped from other sites. And increasingly, results point you back to Google’s own properties such as Maps and YouTube, where it can show more ads and gather more of your data. Many judges believe what corporate executives say, and so Mehta is likely to hear from Google’s CEO that economies of scale are all that drives product quality, and he may buy that. I bet Google executives believe that as well. Still, such an argument isn’t very different from what every monopoly has always argued; Standard Oil discussed how it brought cheap kerosene to the masses, AT&T stressed its awesome quality and universal service, and Alcoa said that its control over aluminum was a result of its focus and dedication to America. Monopolists always believe they are serving humanity, but Congress made it clear by passing antitrust laws that monopolies, whatever they may say or think, are not actually doing that. And the evidence, from Standard Oil’s break-up leading to the development of gasoline to the suit against IBM creating the software industry, suggests Congress was right. So What Just Happened This Week? Last week, Mehta ruled in the summary judgment stage, which is the part where the judge decides what the trial will be about. Trials clear up factual and legal disputes, so the decision this week was about which disputes should be litigated. What Mehta ruled is most of the Antitrust Division’s case is good to go. Google’s main argument to get the case dismissed was that the various contracts to set Google as the default search engine weren’t exclusive, since consumers and partners could technically choose other search engines to use if they wanted to. Mehta rejected this argument, and said that the issue would be decided at trial. That was a big loss for Google. There were a few technical areas where Google narrowed the path for the Antitrust Division to win, but the core of the case is on to trial. The main win for Google was on the state attorneys general case, led by Colorado. Colorado made bigger claims than the DOJ, arguing that Google self-preferenced its own reviews ahead of Yelp’s, or its own travel services ahead of those like Expedia. Judge Mehta tossed these claims, saying that services like Yelp and Expedia aren’t general search engines and are therefore not in the same market as Google. It was a highly technical and annoying way to read certain legal questions, but bringing an antitrust case has become virtually impossible unless it’s done perfectly. Fortunately, a lot of the case survived. Going Forward The net effect is that a trial will start on September 12 and go for roughly two months. Depending on what happens, there may be additional time spent on a remedy, or it may go on appeal. As witnesses testify, from Google executives to rivals, we’re going to learn an enormous amount about how the internet developed, how advertising is sold, and why decisions about what we search for happen the way they do. It’s pretty disconcerting so much key evidence was destroyed, but it will still be a massively educational experience. This trial, and even the case, isn’t the end. There are other cases that Google has to deal with into the fall and next year. For instance, Judge James Donato is allowing a class action trial over Google’s app store monopoly in November, which could cost Google tens of billions of dollars in damages. And in another case, Google has been trying to keep an antitrust claim from the state of Texas and a bunch of state AGs in New York, but a judicial panel just ruled that the case will go back to be heard in Texas. Then there’s the Federal government’s trial in Virginia on Google’s monopolization of the software underpinning most online advertising. Other parts of the firm, like Google Maps, are being investigated as well. I can’t say this trial will work out one way or the other. Given his passivity as Google destroyed documents, Judge Mehta has aways to go before he lives up to the legacy of Harold Greene. But I don’t want to assume anything, or be unfair to Mehta. After all, current antitrust caselaw is much weaker than it was in 1982. And frankly, the case is bigger than Mehta, or the D.C. Circuit judges who will hear an appeal, or perhaps even the Supreme Court. The public is actually engaged in a way they haven’t been in our lifetimes. Ten years ago, the FTC shut down a monopolization case against Google with a 5-0 vote, and zero controversy. That would never happen today. Indeed, regardless of how Mehta rules, it’s going to be a big deal. Reviving laws to constrain corporate power takes time, as people within many institutions must change their minds, and come to grips with the choice of living in a free society or one dominated by monopolies. Fortunately, that change is happening. In September and October, we’ll start to see some of the fruits of that change. And hopefully, Judge Mehta will live up to the legacy of the D.C. district court, set forty one years ago by the courage of Harold Greene. Thanks for reading!

It was deeply refreshing compared to most of the corporate lawyer, nonprofit and judicially influenced environment in which I operate. Attorneys general are elected, which means they are responsive to voters, but they are also legally oriented and tethered to social problems happening in their state. 10 state AGs from both parties showed up in a hard-to-reach part of Connecticut just to talk about antitrust.

When they purchased YouTube, they 'disappeared' our exploding music video website SINGINGFOOL. A year later, they did the same for our movie and tv search and review site VIDEODETECTIVE. I hired a lawyer who wrangled me a visit to the DOJ. Absolutely nothing happened and we moved on to providing B2B data service which thanks to Netflix and Comcast did quite well.

It’s not obvious to me that paying to be the default search product is pro-competitive.On the other hand, the case that Google is going to make (and which I think is going to be really hard for the government to overcome) is this: we (google) give our product away for free and so do our competitors. What’s more, the cost of switching search engines is literally zero: just type Bing instead of Google.If customers are choosing our search product among two free options, then our product is better. It’s going to be very difficult to establish that there’s an abuse of dominant position in that case. (There is other behavior by google which is more questionable, but in search they are on firm ground.)Having a large market share is not an antitrust violation, nor should it be. reply scyzoryk_xyz 1Look, I’m not informed or an expert here, but if it’s being given away for free, then the search itself is not the “product”. The way I understand it, Google’s monopoly is over the ad market.Stoller wrote a book on the subject which I never properly got through in its entirety, but it included a deep dive on what a monopoly is. You are correct - market share is not an anti-trust violation in it’s own. My assumption is that they will be arguing over whether Google is exercising its total control over the system to prevent competition from emerging, and using that control to extract all the value for itself. All while crippling functionality for the customers, not us search engine users in this case - but the advertisers. reply jsunderland323 I don’t think the problem is Google being the best at search. The problem is that you cannot possibly have your user or customer’s best interest at heart when you own the most dominant browser and smartphone os by market share AND when you’re a search engine and ad exchange. Owning those lower level parts of the stack (os and browser), which are network effects loaded, is the anti-competitive piece.Google as a default to other browsers doesn’t bother me. It’s the being the ad broker, the exchange, the browser, the os and the search engine that are problematic. They have demonstrated over two decades that they cannot protect the interests of either their users or the ad buyers. Disabling cookies is essentially meaningless when you’re forced to sign into your browser or os. Absolutely no ad exchange can act in the interest of their users’ privacy when they have a browser or os that mandates you to sign in. And yes, even ad buyers get screwed by Google’s exchange (Google’s real customers). There are many fraudulent publishers that stack ads but get paid out for false impressions, Google still collects on fake impressions and has little interest in decreasing the fraud since they have a 30% take on the impressions.The ideal outcome is that chrome is spun off, android is spun off, and the ad exchange is spun off. Google can keep its suite of productivity tools and search engine and run ad words. That’s a completely reasonable and still extremely valuable business that is highly defensible. I think their interests can align with their users and customers in that scenario. As it is right now, I don’t think you can have the business model they have and not have serious conflicts of interest with users and advertisers. reply huitzitziltzin Essentially none of the issues you cite are antitrust issues. You could be right or wrong on the merits but they won’t be part of this case about the monopolization of the search market.(There are really important antitrust issues in the ad exchange but that isn’t the case the government brought!) reply jsunderland323 I was mostly venting into the void (sorry). I admittedly don&#x27;t know the first thing about antitrust.But to your earlier point: > On the other hand, the case that Google is going to make (and which I think is going to be really hard for the government to overcome) is this: we (google) give our product away for free and so do our competitors. What’s more, the cost of switching search engines is literally zero: just type Bing instead of Google.Don&#x27;t you think the counter argument to this, is, \"No it&#x27;s not that easy to just go to bing when you buy out the default search on rivals&#x27; browsers and operating systems and have the browser and mobile os with the world&#x27;s largest market shares\"? I get that the attack here is directly on search but it would be surprising to me if this wasn&#x27;t part of the case. It seems insane to bring this case if there isn&#x27;t a component focused on the browser and OS conflict of interest in search. reply huitzitziltzin >> Don&#x27;t you think the counter argument to this, is, \"No it&#x27;s not that easy to just go to bing when you buy out the default search on rivals&#x27; browsers and operating systems and have the browser and mobile os with the world&#x27;s largest market shares\"?I’m looking for an analogy for you. The claim is that Google has monopolized the search market. It’s difficult to find actual monopolies in real life bc generally antitrust regulation works well (pace Lina Khan).Think about a small city with two independent hospitals which then merge. That’s closer to a monopoly. There is a potential harm to consumers here bc traveling to go out of your local market for hospital services brings real costs: travel time, inconvenience, etc. That gives the newly merged hospitals power in the market. (Maybe not to the level of a monopoly, but likely substantial market power nonetheless.)Applying something like this analogy to your counter argument: literally all the consumer has to do to avoid Google’s so-called monopolization of the search market is type the letters “b-i-n-g-.-c-o-m”. That’s entirely different from the hospital case.It’s going to be very very very hard for the government to establish that google has anything like monopoly power here. Remember: making a better product and as a result having a large market share is not a crime. Google is going to say that since consumers can costlessly switch to a competitor who is also free, the reason they have 95% market share is bc their product is better.I find it very hard to imagine that they will lose this case. It’s possible! But it seems really unlikely to me. reply pclmulqdq Sorry, but in any other market for goods, being the main supplier, the biggest supply-side brokerage, the biggest exchange, and the biggest demand-side brokerage would be considered a blatant antitrust violation. Somehow, Google thinks they can get away with it in ads. reply huitzitziltzin Not true. Look at the market for meat. There are lots of farmers, a small number (really three or four) processors (who appear to carve up the national market into non overlapping regions) and then a large number of retail customers.To me that looks like an actual antitrust violation but the DoJ and FTC aren’t investigating bc they are obsessing about “big tech” uselessly and bringing bad cases they are going to lose!If you want your regulators to actually do something about a lack of competition in the US economy (which they really should be doing!) there are a ton of markets worth investigating before they waste their time on this loser of a case. reply sam0x17 FTC&#x2F;DOJ not investigating doesn&#x27;t mean this isn&#x27;t a flagrant monopoly that would be prosecuted by a non-corrupt FTC&#x2F;DOJ reply pclmulqdq So the meat market is generally pretty healthy with an oligopoly at one stage of the supply chain? That actually sounds a lot better than I thought the meat market was. \"Carving up\" like that is also not a big problem unless they collude to do it, and it&#x27;s a natural thing for an oligopoly market to do: each of the companies focuses on the niche they are best-equipped to serve, keeping in mind that their competition can come in if they get too greedy.It&#x27;s also a lot better than the ads market is, with literally one dominant player that monopolizes all stages of the supply chain. This is literally what Standard Oil did, controlling the wells, the refineries, and the distribution railroads to shut out competitors.If you look at financial exchanges, there&#x27;s a very good reason for the brokers and exchange to all be different companies. reply sam0x17 Yeah we really need to expand what counts as monopolization, and, you know, actually trust-bust like we did at the turn of the last century. It&#x27;s getting ridiculous. reply TheCoelacanth > You are correct - market share is not an anti-trust violation in it’s own.I think that entire line of jurisprudence is a tragic mistake.The wording of the law is crystal clear: \"shall not monopolize\", not \"shall not monopolize unless it&#x27;s just a really good product\".A 95% market share should not be allowed under any circumstances. reply huitzitziltzin There are a whole bunch of edge cases you aren’t thinking about. Markets can be highly local (hospital markets, eg.), firms go out of business, new products enter new markets (smart phones, tablets), even defining “the market” is hard (does Sirius XM have a meaningful “monopoly” on satellite radio?). So your “make 95% market share illegal” idea is quite challenging (actually impossible) to work out reply flangola7 Difficult but absolutely not impossible. There&#x27;s whole domains of law dedicated to identifying and defining these kinds of fuzzy edge cases. Anyone that tells you it is impossible has malign motivations. reply YurgenJurgensen Wouldn&#x27;t fixing all those edge cases defeat the point of something simple like a 95% rule? You&#x27;d be at the point where 95% is neither necessary nor sufficient and all of those laws covering the edge cases are the real law. reply mistercheph You have rediscovered the American legal system, the laws that cover the ‘edge’ cases are aptly named ‘case law’ reply huitzitziltzin Hey - if you think you can do it go ahead. No one in the economics profession would oppose a usable definition of market which covered all of these cases (or even a subset of them) and made it easy.We aren’t failing to offer definitions here bc we’re in the tank for big tech. To immediately suggest we have malign motivations isn’t charitable. It’s genuinely a hard problem. reply scyzoryk_xyz That’s what makes this whole subject so hard to argue. You can’t just be persecuted for being successful. They have to prove you’re actually preventing others from being successful. And how the do you do that without a whole bunch of wishy washy woulda coulda shoulda’s?And I agree that it shouldn’t have been “allowed” but here we are. reply huitzitziltzin 1The DoJ is welcome to make a claim on monopolizing the ad market. The case here is about monopolizing the search market. reply scyzoryk_xyz 1Isn’t the whole point that they’re tightly intertwined? You pay to advertise in the relevant search results of your customers. reply huitzitziltzin That’s not the law, so it’s irrelevant to the legal issues. reply scyzoryk_xyz I don’t mean the law. I mean how the actual ad&#x2F;search product actually works. As a Google customer I pay them to present my stuff the way I want it to my customers when they search for stuff about the things I sell. That’s the product, no? reply huitzitziltzin That’s not relevant to the monopolization claim here though. reply HWR_14 On the contrary, antitrust law has a lot of rules about using dominance in one industry to prop up another. reply jahewson There’s a 2nd, later case where the DoJ is suing Google over their ad network:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;justice-department-sues-googl... reply narism 1>we (google) give our product away for free and so do our competitors.Search is not Google’s product, it’s a way to get their product. Their product is eyeballs which they sell to advertisers.>the cost of switching search engines is literally zero: just type Bing instead of Google.If this is true, why does Google pay Apple billions&#x2F;year and Mozilla millions&#x2F;year to make Google the default search? You could be saving that money! reply huitzitziltzin 1The government could make antitrust claims regarding google’s behavior vis a vis advertisers. (I’m sympathetic to some claims that could be made there!)Monopolization of the ad market is not the issue here, because the specific claim is that google has monopolized the search market. You can read that right in the linked article.Google’s payments to be the default are (as I already said) not obviously pro-competitive to me. I don’t know if you and I disagree there.But again… in Google’s defense they are going to say (accurately!) “everyone gives search away for free so consumers are free to switch.”It’s going to be impossible (IMO) to argue that consumers are harmed in the search market. It just won’t be credible.The department of justice is likely wasting its time, which is similar to the recent behavior of the FTC under Lina Khan which is (if you are American) wasting taxpayers’ time taking on losing cases, while letting mergers which really deserve critical scrutiny through. Microsoft Activision is a prominent recent example.And if the Justice Department actually does show up in court with a filing that says: “No, your search engine was awesome, but it’s increasingly ad-filled crap. You’re too powerful, you’re too lazy, and America needs some real competition” (this is a direct quote from Stoller’s article) they are going to be laughed out of town and they will richly deserve it.So again… I like the attention Stoller pays to antitrust issues but his analysis of the economics (especially in the case of some tech firms) is just bad. reply narism > Monopolization of the ad market is not the issue here, because the specific claim is that google has monopolized the search market.Incorrect. The Stoller article says “government argues that Google has a monopoly of general search and *search advertising*”.The case in question (1:20-cv-03010) alleges anticompetitive behaviors in multiple interrelated markets: general search services, *search advertising, general search advertising, and general search text advertising*. The other major case (1:23-cv-00108) is about their monopolization of the digital ad market via Doubleclick&#x2F;Ad Exchange&#x2F;Google Ads. reply thaumasiotes > Microsoft Activision is a prominent recent example.That was always ludicrous. The only way for the FTC to win that case was to define the relevant market as \"games produced by Activision\". That would have made the merger anticompetitive by definition... but no more anticompetitive than Activision already was. reply sam0x17 > we (google) give our product away for free and so do our competitors.This is hogwash though. They take an 80% cut of the advertising profits (could be more now, this is just my dated figure that I know from a decade ago). Are the courts really incapable of dealing with an ad-supported monopoly in 2023? reply Apofis I love this part of the article and it definitely describes what&#x27;s going on with AI assisted research:\"So if the government wins, we’ll see immense innovation and new entrants. If Google wins, however, then machine learning&#x2F;AI will be deployed consistent with how Google, and perhaps Microsoft, chooses to deploy them, which is to say, slowly, un-creatively, and in service to monopoly power.\"Specifically, the \"slowly, un-creatively\" part, which is what I really care about. reply ameister14 >On the other hand, the case that Google is going to make (and which I think is going to be really hard for the government to overcome) is this: we (google) give our product away for free and so do our competitors. What’s more, the cost of switching search engines is literally zero: just type Bing instead of Google.That&#x27;s not a defense, though.So the government is unlikely to prove anti-competitive outcomes by arguing an increased cost to consumer, but that&#x27;s not what they seem to be arguing. Going from Ohio v. Amex, The other relevant ways to prove anti-competitive outcomes are through a decrease in product quality in the relevant market or market power and evidence of harms to competition.The government appears to be arguing that product quality is lower and that Google has market power and has engaged in conduct that harms competition. If those are results from anti-competitive behavior then that is an antitrust violation, and should be. reply huitzitziltzin It is a defense. It is the defense that they will use and probably the only one they need.The government lost Ohio vs. Amex, which was in any event about a two sided market. Google is definitely active in two sided markets but this case does not make those claims.Good luck to DoJ if they are arguing that the quality of the product is lower! They are going to fall on their faces.I’m not saying google doesn’t engage in anticompetitive behavior. There is a good case to be made on various things they do. But to go at google for “monopolizing the search market” is just pointless. The DoJ should bring a stronger case! Such cases can be made. reply andyferris Zooming in on just search: I would have assumed once reaching a monopoly position in search it then becomes illegal to then use your influence on Android and payments to Apple and Mozilla to maintain that monopoly (by making 95% of \"new\" consumers opt-in to your monopoly by default and not by explicit choice).Having some kind of default search selection come up on fresh installs of Android, iOS, Macs and Firefox wouldn&#x27;t really hurt consumers, and barely hurt Google (it became dominant through quality and people remember that). Ironically (and sadly) preventing Google using it&#x27;s influence over default seach options would probably harm Mozilla the most... but it should still happen. reply EMIRELADERO For your information, it actually is being made by the DOJ, just not on this lawsuit.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;justice-department-sues-googl...The press release doesn&#x27;t mention it, but the actual court document asks the court to:\"Order the divestiture of, at minimum, the Google Ad Manager suite, including both Google’s publisher ad server, DFP, and Google’s ad exchange, AdX, along with any additional structural relief as needed to cure any anticompetitive harm\" reply huitzitziltzin Some of those other claims are quite strong, IMO. There’s a good case to be made there.However, asking for a structural remedy like divestiture after so much time is going to be a tall order, to say the least. Generally courts don’t like to meddle directly in the way firms are run (correctly, in my view). reply EMIRELADERO Assuming all the claims about harm are true as alleged, what would your ideal damage remedies be? replyHWR_14 I tried rewriting your comment as it could have been written a few decades ago:> On the other hand, the case that Microsoft is going to make (and which I think is going to be really hard for the government to overcome) is this: we (Microsoft) give our product away for free and so do our competitors. What’s more, the cost of switching browsers is literally zero: just download Netscape instead of Internet Explorer.> If customers are choosing our browser among two free options, then our product is better. It’s going to be very difficult to establish that there’s an abuse of dominant position in that case. (There is other behavior by Microsoft which is more questionable, but in browsers they are on firm ground.) reply huitzitziltzin Bundling IE was anticompetitive for the same reason bundling Teams now is anticompetitive. They (= Microsoft) deserved to lose that case (as they deserve to lose a similar case about Teams). This is not the same.Notably the claim is being made that the search market is being monopolized, not that there is a bundle at issue. If the government thinks there’s a bundle here they can make that claim. reply HWR_14 It&#x27;s legal in the US to have an awesome product that monopolizes the market as long as it wins on it&#x27;s own merits.The government is claiming that the search market is being monopolized, not by having the best results, but by paying $45 billion dollars&#x2F;year to various browser suppliers to make Google the default browser. That&#x27;s the illegal act.> \"Essentially, Google has bought up all of the shelf space where search is placed in front of consumers, which is to say browsers and phones. This behavior is very similar to what Microsoft did in the 1990s, when it bundled its browser with its operating system, and signed deals with ISPs to block its browser rival Netscape from getting access to customers. The analogy isn’t a coincidence, as the Microsoft case is controlling precedent. \" reply huitzitziltzin >> The government is claiming that the search market is being monopolized, not by having the best results, but by paying $45 billion dollars&#x2F;year to various browser suppliers to make Google the default browser. That&#x27;s the illegal act.And google is going to say correctly that consumers are free to switch search engines. They are free to enter “bing.com” in google chrome and it will take them right where they want to go: to another search engine!I note above that I am not sure google’s payments are pro-competitive. They probably aren’t. It’s fair to be uncomfortable with them. But to make an antitrust case on monopolization of search you are going to need more evidence than those payments. reply HWR_14 I don&#x27;t see the distinction you think is very obvious. Google is paying 3rd parties to bundle GoogleSearch as the default in their browser. That&#x27;s what the government objects to. I&#x27;m fairly sure that violates antitrust rules just as much as bundling a browser with your OS does. reply jenadine > They are free to enter “bing.com”And people were free to download Netscape.But the thing is that people don&#x27;t type \"bing.com\" nor \"google.com\" because they just use the browser search bar and don&#x27;t bother with what search engine is being used. replymr_toad > we (google) give our product away for freeSure, like a farmer gives his cows pasture.If one farmer bought up all the land, and then tried to claim he was giving away grass for free I doubt any jury would be fooled. reply taeric 1But is it free if it costs them billions?That is, saying that customers &#x2F;could&#x2F; switch is not necessarily relevant. There is evidence that they believe paying for the \"default\" billing is worth a ton of money. Not just to Apple, but to Mozilla, too.That they could lose access to revenue streams by losing default billing is very relevant when that is also a large portion of how they are able to make that payment.Could see it more as collusion with competition, I suppose? It isn&#x27;t competing on the merits of their search, but more on their ability to afford default status. Which keeps Apple from entering search, and ostensibly keeps it more expensive for Microsoft to keep Bing.Consider, if Apple could get more from MS to make Bing default, why wouldn&#x27;t they? reply huitzitziltzin >> That is, saying that customers &#x2F;could&#x2F; switch is not necessarily relevantOn the contrary, it’s the whole ballgame in a case like this. Google’s claim will be: “we have high market share because our product is good. Look - customers could switch for free if they didn’t like it.” The government cannot make a monopolization claim solely on the basis of high market share in this case. It’s not remotely persuasive. (Indeed: who do you do your searches with??)>> “there is evidence…”Totally agree with this sentence. But it’s not going to be decisive for the government. It will not be remotely sufficient. Again - it’s not clear to me personally that this behavior is pro-competitive. But I’ve already told you what google is going to say. If you’re going to argue monopolization you have to define the market (here search) and then show it’s monopolized. Market share isn’t enough.>> could see it more as collusion…Not legally. Sorry. Not without some specific evidence of a conspiracy. reply taeric All it takes is an email between Apple and Google saying they want to keep prices high for conspiracy. Isn&#x27;t above them, either. Certainly inline with past of apple. Seems more a complaint against them, I grant.The discovery is what could kill Google, here. They will argue customers could switch, but any negotiations with apple to stay default are discoverable. If any of them note they fear losing share, that is pretty damning.Note I fully agree with you on difficulty of position. But you don&#x27;t pay billions for status that you think you earn on your merits.Especially if you then charge other players to be top search spot for their own name. reply frays 1I wonder if Google will talk about the rise of AI-powered competitors (ChatGPT, Bing, etc) as part of the search landscape to help defend their case. reply huitzitziltzin If they don’t they should fire their lawyers. (They will.) reply arrosenberg 1As the article and others are pointing out, Google achieves &#x27;free&#x27; Search through bundling and predatory pricing, which are both anticompetitive. reply huitzitziltzin “Bundling” can be anticompetitive but is not at issue in the actual case the government has filed. Nor can I personally identify a meaningful bundle from google in the right sense. You may be using the word informally. reply arrosenberg I wasn’t referring to the case specifically, but Google is absolutely bundling products in the formal, illegal sense as well.Would drive, docs and gmail be free if you divorced them from the ad revenue products? reply huitzitziltzin >> Would drive, docs and gmail be free if you divorced them from the ad revenue products?If they are all free then it’s not a bundle in the antitrust relevant sense. Microsoft Teams is a great example of an anticompetitive bundle if you want one. reply arrosenberg Gonna need a cite on that logic. The MS case was about including IE with Windows for free. With Google, the products are paid for by the ad revenues instead of Windows and Office licenses.> Microsoft Teams is a great example of an anticompetitive bundle if you want one.Also true. reply huitzitziltzin >> The MS case was about including IE with Windows for free.This is exactly where the anticompetitive effects of bundling arise.>> With Google, the products are paid for by the ad revenues instead of Windows and Office licenses.That’s why it’s going to be impossible to argue that this is bundling in the anticompetitive sense. reply jonas21 > Would drive, docs and gmail be free if you divorced them from the ad revenue products?Yes, probably. They all count against your 15 GB quota of free storage, after which you have to pay Google for more. It&#x27;s basically the same model as Dropbox. reply arrosenberg Dropbox doesn’t do email or office tools as far as I know; they have Paper, but thats not the same. I also believe the free tier is storage only, which is the cheapest element of the offering to deliver. replyDannyBee In the legal realm, I actually like to read blogs, newsletters, podcasts of folks that are often on the other side of an issue or thing than I am. I find it useful to gain perspective&#x2F;etc. When i have no opinion, i try to find folks on \"both\" sides. Like say insurance lawyers and injury lawyers takes on a thing or whatever.So I tried to read Matt on antitrust (though it turns out we share some of the same views), but once you get beyond the \"forcefulness\", everything only gets worse in my experience.It&#x27;s a lot of bloviation, and when you get into the details, he often will, charitably, take interesting interpretations of the actual opinions and views of courts and others, especially when they disagree with his view. Once I read enough to have a sense of continuity (IE how did claims&#x2F;views&#x2F;predictions turn out), I ended up giving up my subscription because i just couldn&#x27;t read it anymore. There are those who are much better at representing what&#x27;s going on as a whole in a thing, even when they have a point of view and share it. Even when it&#x27;s a point of view i think is totally wrongheaded. It&#x27;s not as passionate, for sure, but I find it more useful and enjoyable in the end, whether i agree or not.In Matt&#x27;s case, let&#x27;s take this one: \"Judge Mehta tossed these claims, saying that services like Yelp and Expedia aren’t general search engines and are therefore not in the same market as Google. It was a highly technical and annoying way to read certain legal questions, but bringing an antitrust case has become virtually impossible unless it’s done perfectly.\"You&#x27;ll note that Matt does what he often does here - when he can&#x27;t explain why he&#x27;s right, things become more abstract - there aren&#x27;t any examples of how it was \"highly technical\" or \"annoying\" or what \"certain legal questions\" are. Not a single example anywhere to be found. No example or data that backs up that it is \"virtually impossible\" to bring antitrust cases unless they are \"done perfectly\".Nope, just some abstract complaint and throwaway language about how, you know, whatever he said in the last newsletter about how this part was gonna be a slam dunk or whatever is really right, it&#x27;s just, you know, \"highly technical\" things got in the way.Which ones?Oh, well, you wouldn&#x27;t know them, they live in Canada, and only visit in the summer.Let&#x27;s look at what actually happened here: No, the judge did not throw the claims out because they aren&#x27;t general search engines. He threw it out because he felt the plaintiffs were way short on the evidence, because they rely entirely on an expert who cites no evidence himself, only makes up theories. This sounds like an exaggerated opinion of what happened, but it&#x27;s not :)See page 46 of the opinion.\"The court agrees with Google’s second argument. Plaintiffs’ theory of anticompetitive harm rests on a multi-linked causal sequence that relies not on evidence but almost entirely on the opinion and speculation of its expert, Professor Jonathan Baker. Plaintiffs cite Professor Baker’s report for the following propositions:Remarkably, not one of Professor Baker’s opinions, on which these fact assertions are based, cites to any record evidence.Indeed, a closer inspection of Professor Baker&#x27;s reports shows he has largely theorized the anticompetitive effects in the relevant market of Google&#x27;s conduct toward the SVP&#x27;s...Plaintiffs are required to show with proof \"that the monopolist&#x27;s conduct indeed has the requisite anticompetitive effect\", and they have fallen well short of that burden\".This isn&#x27;t even the end.It goes on, where the Judge points out this state at oral argument and the states confirm they have no evidence, etc.It then explains why unsupported expert opinions aren&#x27;t enough to get past summary judgement, etc. It is a clear step by step refutation of the claims, unrelated to the market question.It does then end with \"Professor Baker&#x27;s opinions do not rest on facts; only his ruminations about the market effects of Google&#x27;s conduct\" as one final jab.To read all that, and believe that this is about, you know, some highly technical legal questions being read in an annoying way and that it&#x27;s the judge requiring them to \"do it perfectly\" is, uh, an interesting take for sure.It&#x27;s one thing if Matt went into this and said \"I think that random theorization should be enough, because facts are a lagging indicator\" or \"I think the court is wrong on the following legal standard\", or whatever, but nope, this just gets painted as the nonsense we started with.This is very common in his writing, and at least for me, made it not worth reading. reply candiddevmike It&#x27;s not free, but you aren&#x27;t paying money for it. reply huitzitziltzin In other words… it’s free. Google search is free.All of this “… then you are the product” stuff is totally meaningless legally and economically. reply candiddevmike Wikipedia is free, Google search is not. You are paying for Google Search. People need to realize their privacy has value, a lot of value actually, otherwise Google Search and every other privacy invasive platform would cost money. reply huitzitziltzin >> People need to realize their privacy has value, a lot of value actually,I mean… maybe? (How much is your data worth to google in dollars? Probably not that much.) But I think consumers understand how google makes their money. If your argument in court is “consumers are misunderstanding in dollar terms how much this is harming them,” then you are going to lose. reply enigmurl If it&#x27;s truly the case that you&#x27;re paying for Google Search, that would be an even bigger incentive for consumers to leave to a different search engine (in essence, they would be paid to switch). reply fredgrott And if I was a gov lawyer I would submit proof of: 1. the browser blocks in using free email accounts, for example Google makes it impossible to use gmail accounts from a non Google browser. MS also has a similar things with Edge.Not the only example, but an example most of us had dealt with....If you are locking a product down so that I cannot choose why are you afraid of fair competition in a free marketplace Google? reply huitzitziltzin I have logged into gmail via safari recently so I’m not entirely sure I know what you’re referring to here??? reply willi59549879 it is not blocked, but i get an annoying pop up that tells me i should use chrome. reply hgs3 1Antitrust laws are too reactive. We need proactive laws that break up companies if they grow beyond a certain size criteria. Ideally, the criteria would be aggressive enough to kill large corporations leaving behind only small to medium-sized businesses. The result would be markets with increased competition, more innovation, lower prices, more options for employment and self-employment, and the elimination of Big Corp&#x27;s big money political influence. reply lolinder 1I agree that antitrust is too reactive, especially in tech, but when it hits the real world your proposed solution would just lead to a new Byzantine maze like our current tax code. We&#x27;d get a whole new industry built up around helping corporations to technically stay under the thresholds by exploiting loopholes (and another industry for lobbying for those loopholes to be expanded). reply ghayes My spitball solution is to add an excise tax on revenue based on market concentration, potentially paid back to consumers or new market entrants. So if you own 50% of a market, maybe you pay a 25% excise tax, and thus the market finds an equilibrium except in cases where a monopoly is warranted, despite the high tax. reply bbor 1This could be used as a criticism of literally any law of any kind. reply charrondev Precisely. Laws and regulations are overly complex, and as a result open many opportunities for corporations pay for carve outs for themselves, enriching themselves at the expense of the public. reply wahnfrieden Yes, see the entire field of anarchism reply mikepurvis 1Is there a model anywhere for this having been tried, successfully or otherwise?The obvious hesitation I have is just that some companies really do benefit from a lot of vertical integration. Could Apple be Apple if they were forced to spin off the phone business, or the chip design house, or the OS?What would it mean for the startup ecosystem if getting bought by a conglomerate was a less plausible exit?How would regulators enforce that the split off entities were truly independent vs faking it and then having exclusivity deals that meant they were basically still the same singular entity? reply dmbche 1Should Apple exist in it&#x27;s current form?If it weren&#x27;t, the things that are integrated become available for others - meaning better products for all, no?What&#x27;s the societal benefit of integrating all these advances in single companies? reply vlovich123 1Not so much because then, for example, you become Qualcomm and have 50 different customers all asking for different things from your chips and you reach a local optimum where you solve everyone’s issue a little bit but don’t actually do a good job. There’s a reason that Apple’s chips are so much better in terms of performance and energy efficiency. Similarly, it’s why Apple did the W1 first and it took a very long time before any competitor figured out how to do the same thing. And you’ll see the same with VR where FB will struggle to make HW with comparable specs while Apple’s chip gives their SW a leg up.TLDR: it’s complex, but successful vertical businesses have fairly different products, efficiencies, and outcomes. reply bogwog 1Apple made better chips than Qualcomm because Qualcomm is a monopolist, and thus doesn’t need to actually compete. The moment a competitor sprung up, they got their ass kicked.Yes, no other company but Apple could have pulled that off, but that’s only because Apple themselves are a monopolist with the market power to fight another monopolist.That’s not a good thing. The solution to monopolies isn’t more monopolies. A much smaller company than Apple could have theoretically created a better processor than Qualcomm, but it just couldn’t happen due to multiple anti-competitive factors. Like how Qualcomm has a patent portfolio that gives them a monopoly on 4G modems, and can use that to force companies to purchase other components from them if they want a modem.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;qualcomm-us-ftc-apple-chips... reply jonhohle 1I ask this every time it comes up, but what exactly does Apple have a monopoly in? They don’t control majority of anything in any category that they participate in. They are a major purchaser of high end fab processes, but that doesn’t allow them to control PC, phone, steaming, messaging, audio, home integration, or any other market.They are one of the most vertically integrated large companies, but they are allowed to monopolize their own products. There is no iPhone market - that’s a product within a huge market of other mobile devices that anyone can join. reply bogwog 1These types of discussions on this site are pointless. I can tell that no matter what I say, you’re going to end up moving the goal posts. Why do I know this? Because you non sarcastically are trying to say that Apple doesn’t have a monopoly. The amount of mental gymnastics is takes to frame it that way is only possible if someone cares more about defending the honor of their favorite megacorp than finding any kind of truth.And if I’m completely wrong about you, then I apologize. My patience for these internet arguments isn’t what it used to be. To answer your question, there are no doubt thousands of comments on this website about that topic. Ignore the ones that seem to come from Apple fanboys, and you’ll find the right answers. reply jonhohle I was being genuine. I lived through the Microsoft antitrust trial and like several of the companies they obliterated with their anti-competitive practices (specifically Be). They had 90+% desktop OS market share and they used that to prevent PC manufacturers from selling competitor’s operating systems, bundle a free browser that destroyed an entire industry of browser companies, and other behaviors that made it impossible for others to compete.So when people say Apple has a monopoly, I want to know what market they control so entirely that they are able to eliminate any competitors should they choose to behave anti-competitively. People often say they have a monopoly on iPhones, but that’s not a market, it’s a product that they make and sell. If 90% of mobile devices were iPhones, I’d agree, but they’re not, so Apple cannot have a monopoly in that market.Sometime people suggest they have control over mobile development. Targeting iPhones is profitable because iPhone users spend money. It’s no different from console development (PS5, Switch, Xbox) where all software goes through a gatekeeper who takes a cut. How does that control mobile development when they’re in the minority in the market?They have a huge market cap and pile of cash, that still doesn’t make them a monopoly. They don’t have price control in any market segment. Sticking with phones, you can get Samsung and Pixel phones for higher and lower cost.AFAICT they don’t meet any common or legal definition of a monopoly so I am interested in what industry people think they control.You’ve not said why you think they’re a monopoly, so I can really only assume the common things I see people complain about. A company having business practices that might be considered hostile does not make them a monopoly though. That word has a specific meaning. reply vlovich123 To play devil’s advocate, I’d say having something like 85% of the profit in the mobile space despite only have ~13% market share is probably a good start in terms of classifying as a monopoly. Do you really have competition when you’re the only one making money and the rest are being subsidized by your competitor? That’s also a good case Apple has that they’re fighting the Google monopoly of flooding the market with their own. reply ddingus 1I think about this topic often and am also curious, but not an Apple fanboy, unless we end up talking about the 8 and 16 bit 6602, 65816 based computers. :)The way I see it, Apple has targeted a very specific kind of customer. And these people have a few things in common:Value privacyValue great hardwareWilling to recognize and pay for all the ways Apple adds value: packaging, UX, etc...And there are some more, but I feel listing more won&#x27;t add value here.I do like the Apple M1 computer I own. And I like the older 8 and 16 bit ones too. The reasons are very different with the older machines being open and hackable and the M1 being fast with crazy good battery life given the overall performance.However, I flat out won&#x27;t own an Apple phone. Too closed down, and the UX is not well aligned with how I prefer to do things.I disagree strongly with many things Apple does and feel their products often are too restrictive.But, I do not have to use anything they make either.Some have argued that Apple has serious lock in on their products. Yep. Except for the computers, I agree! That is why I won&#x27;t use any of their stuff.Yet lots of people want it that way and Apple delivers it to them and asks those people to pay right up, and those people do pay up and a whole lot of those people are happy having seen good value for their dollar.In my view, Apple gets to do that.And nobody has to like them doing that, right?How is any of it a monopoly?Serious question. reply musictubes “These types of discussions on this site are pointless.” So you’re a troll then. Don’t start shit if you don’t want to engage. If you really think it’s pointless don’t bring it up.As you say, many people disagree with you. It is very possible they have more of an argument than then just being idiots or shills or whatever disparaging label you want to give them. The question you are responding to is a legit one. People will continue to ask for justification whenever you proclaim Apple a monopolist. The fact they haven’t been convinced by the thousands of comments means your position isn’t as self evident as you think. reply jpadkins your reply missed the part where you said what market Apple has a monopoly in.(I own zero Apple products, not really a fan of any mega corp) reply dmbche 1Thank you for the answer!My first thought is that the \"apple Qualcomm\" that would come out would have incentives to make better chips without needing to also sell phones (competing with other chip manufacturers) but I can understand that the chip industry is very costly and risky, I can see how without integration they can&#x27;t compete with any current player - too expensive and risky. reply kylehotchkiss 1Substantially less opportunities for your private data to be hacked and leaked all over the web.I think Apple’s long term privacy and e2ee pushes and googles recent attempts at the same would not exist across a pile of medium sized companies. iCloud Photos leaking would continue to be a thing. reply ehnto 1> What would it mean for the startup ecosystem if getting bought by a conglomerate was a less plausible exit?I guess going public would be the move realistically. I would prefer to see a shift toward startups aiming for solvency though, which I believe would make better companies. Companies that fit a role in society better. Free market capitalism isn&#x27;t really happening if consumers aren&#x27;t paying for anything and the money rains in from the VC heavens instead. reply nicoburns 1I feel like we ought to have progressive taxation on corporations: the larger you are, the more you get taxed. This would act as a general purpose biasing of the economy in favour of smaller companies and more competition. reply gottorf 1What we have currently is the other way around, unfortunately: the larger you are, the more efficient it is for you to be \"compliant\" with various laws and regulations. The same way that a billionaire wouldn&#x27;t mind paying half a million dollars to an accounting firm to optimize their taxes another 1-2%, whereas someone making $50k a year would just use the free version of TurboTax and maybe miss out on some deductions.This (among other things) contributes to the trend of increasing consolidation in virtually every industry in America. reply elteto While I agree with you, people making $50k a year are not missing out on many deductions. Putting its parent company aside, Turbo Tax is not a bad product for simple taxes at that income level.What they are missing out is alternative investment categories only available to those with more money, or estate planning solutions that are expensive to setup. reply barnabee 1I&#x27;d strongly welcome this, based on both size and profitability (which should also include money going to salaries above some level per employee, as well as accounting profit, dividends, etc.). reply Animats > We need proactive laws that break up companies if they grow beyond a certain size criteria.Which is what the Sherman Act says:\"Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other per- son or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $1,000,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.\"It hasn&#x27;t been rigorously enforced since the 1960s, but the Department of Justice does have the option of enforcing it as written. reply hintymad 1> and the elimination of Big Corp&#x27;s big money political influence.And companies like Google have more than just \"big money political influence\".

Congrats, you yield all the economics of scale to China. What now? \"Export\" the US&#x27;s domestic laws to other countries like it always does? reply bbor 1We would be more efficient if we made the work week 80 hours minimum, at the small cost of people&#x27;s happiness! China would stand no chance.In case I&#x27;m unclear, I feel that not keeping our economy diverse and fair because China might make more stuff than us if we do is very misguided. reply thfuran >We would be more efficient if we made the work week 80 hours minimumNo, we wouldn&#x27;t. reply 0xDEF >Congrats, you yield all the economics of scale to ChinaThat is the goal and why \"Break up Google\" is being aggressively pushed by pro-Chinese bots on reddit, twitter etc.\"Break up Google\" should be translated to \"Give all the data to China\".Before the rise of TikTok I would as a European have supported the US shooting itself in the foot by breaking up Google, Microsoft etc. I assumed those would be trivially replaced by European alternatives. However today, post-TikTok, I know the majority of people will just eagerly jump on the first Chinese spyware alternative that pops up. reply huitzitziltzin 1The point of antitrust law is to protect competition. It’s not to protect small firms nor to prevent the emergence of large ones. The kind of law you want is different, and in my opinion as an antitrust guy a very bad idea. To my knowledge no such law exists in any industrial democracy. reply vharuck It would also have the benefit of making supply chains more robust. Baby formula prices shot up during the pandemic because one factory had a contamination problem. My sister-in-law was asking friends on Facebook to look in their local stores for a specific type of formula her baby needed, because her store has empty shelves of it for a month.The free market wasn&#x27;t solving that problem. A new baby formula factory can&#x27;t just be built to cover a gap that&#x27;d probably disappear in a year. But that leaves people in a shitty position for a year. reply yjftsjthsd-h > The free market wasn&#x27;t solving that problem.By the definition I learned in school, that&#x27;s not a free market, precisely because it can&#x27;t scale on both supply and demand sides. If it can&#x27;t be (if factory startup costs will always be too high) then that&#x27;s an argument for regulation to offset the problem, but it&#x27;s not a free market problem. reply summerlight > We need proactive laws that break up companies if they grow beyond a certain size criteria.Even assuming that this is a good idea, this have an unnecessary risk of being unconstitutional and getting scrapped by the justices. If you want to limit property rights in this fundamental way, that has to be based on a very strong judicial basis. That&#x27;s why almost all reasonable antitrust regulation happens in a reactive way, because it has to prove that those regulated entities are actually doing something harmful. reply arrosenberg The constitution says nothing adverse to regulating entities that are not actively doing harm (though I disagree). Congress can write any standard they want into law if you get the right legislators in a room.Antitrust is reactive because consolidation is a slow burn and it takes a while for a critical mass of voters to feel the problem. Thats why Obama and Biden have taken completely different approaches, despite being ideologically similar. reply summerlight Regulations have to happen in a \"Necessary and Proper\" way (see 8.18). The Congress is delegated with a strong legislative power, but it&#x27;s not something limitless. reply arrosenberg That clause basically says “Congress shall have the authority to make laws that enable it to execute its powers”. It has nothing to do with what you said. Its there to prevent judicial chicanery, not encourage it. reply TheCoelacanth People have rights. Trillion dollar corporations should not. reply lordnacho 1Bigger fines and liquidation on misbehaviour. reply jahewson This gets you cartels, where the top players collude. reply colordrops 1It&#x27;s similar to the two party system at this point, where the powers are so entrenched that they control the regulatory bodies that could change anything. reply prakhar897 1The Indian govt imposed restrictions that a payment provider in India can fulfill max 30% of the total volume of transactions in an year [1]. After that, they have to restrict themselves. This completely avoids monopoly and concentration risks.This can be done for search as well which makes sure at least 4 players stay in the market at all times.

Except it&#x27;s \"prove you&#x27;re a human by completing these robotic tasks\".You&#x27;re right, I hate it and always switch to a different search engine instead. So, that&#x27;s the goal here right? reply slowmovintarget 1Google&#x27;s goal is to fingerprint you so they know exactly who you are on every site you visit. That&#x27;s the point of WEI, to make the environment safe for their ad business, not better for you.You using a VPN is just as outrageous to them as you attempting to use a working ad blocker. reply badrabbit 1You and others replying to GP keep suggesting google users who are the product not the actual customee would be restricted when in fact it would be the real customers: people wanting to place ads on google that would be restricted. The amount of clicks google can monetize would be restricted. reply xdennis > Can you imagine being in the middle of some work, Googling a term, only to be hit with \"Sorry, we&#x27;re over the government limit and can&#x27;t fulfill your search\"Programmers are often overconfident and think they can implement anything... except when they have to follow common sense regulation in which case it&#x27;s always impossible or they come up with ridiculous straw men like you just have.There are a million ways to curtail anti-competitive behavior. One, on the spot, example would be: not to stop people from making searches, but instead to tax at 100% everything over the 30% of searches. reply halflings 1> Why isn&#x27;t US govt doing this?Why isn&#x27;t the UK, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, ... doing this? Because it&#x27;s a pretty strong form of controlled economy that distorts the market.How would this work for search engines? Would you force people to use a different search engine than the one they want? (e.g. they type Google.com and end up redirected to Bing.com) ; or somehow just funnel revenue to other companies... then who gets to decide which companies this gets funneled to?Anti-trust is about preventing anti-competitive tactics, but the scheme you is ironically anti-competitive: it artificially inflates usage of other services even if they don&#x27;t provide an equal&#x2F;superior service, with consumers paying the price.[disclaimer: I work at Google, so likely biased] reply drdaeman 1> How would this work for search engines?There is a way. If we start treating Internet search as commodity&#x2F;public utility, we can use shared municipal fiber analogy. One public website can route requests to multiple participating search providers, ensuring that the searches are evenly distributed.Of course, it&#x27;s not a good idea for a lot of reasons. Starting as extending government surveillance, through leaving consumers with limited choices (if different providers&#x27; result quality is significantly different, which it probably is), and all the way down to having to decide what qualifies as a search engine.It&#x27;s best to look at the root of the issue. I don&#x27;t think most people are upset that Google is the most popular search engine out there. It&#x27;s the other practices that make people wary or outright unhappy. Google is very multi-faceted, so government forcing company split (e.g. make Google Search, Gmail, Chrome, Android etc. entirely separate entities), or disallowing of some business practices (such as making Chrome cater to Google Analytics needs) might be beneficial. reply skinkestek 1> Because it&#x27;s a pretty strong form of controlled economy that distorts the market.Would be trivial compared to how Google and Microsoft have distorted the markets over the years. reply BolexNOLA 1What would you propose instead? reply halflings 1Banning anti-competitive behavior (which is what antitrust laws are for in the first place). For instance: a company actively blocking competition (e.g. coffee machine manufacturers that make it impossible for people to buy pods from another brand).Again, I am probably biased here, but I don&#x27;t see much anti-competitive behaviour in the search engine space. If people have a clear superior alternative to Google, then by all means please share it here.Even during the brief period where I used duckduckgo, I was constantly finding myself typing \"!g\" to get results from Google as they were just consistently more relevant. reply lordnacho 1What about buying the default search from Apple? Maybe I&#x27;m remembering it wrong but I seem to recall they pay a lot of money for that. reply saalweachter 1What outcome are you hoping for here? Google can&#x27;t pay to be the default search engine on a browser, no one can pay to be the default search engine on a browser, no one can be the default search engine on a browser, or just Google can&#x27;t be the default search engine on a browser? reply paulryanrogers Legally enforced ballot with random default if users click through without reading. Same for browsers themselves. reply arrosenberg 1 and 2. Google as the overwhelmingly dominant player should not be allowed to pay to further monopolize the space, and since Microsoft is the alternative, I would support banning paid defaults in general. replybadrabbit 1People can use google all they want, the restriction would be on how much ad can be sold by Google. reply halflings 1So the remaining traffic would be all expenses, no profit? Doesn&#x27;t sound like capitalism anymore then, more of a public service. reply badrabbit It would be expenses and profit, the remaining traffic keeps users coming. reply shadowgovt 1Imagine a government creating a search engine as a public service.... Oh wait, that&#x27;s actually a great idea and I want to see that happen. reply xcdzvyn 1I, personally, am very, _very_ glad my country doesn&#x27;t oblige me to use a state-sponsored search engine.Baidu \"六四事件\"[0] to find out more![0] \"June Fourth incident\", the Chinese name for the Tiananmen square massacre. Other banned search terms include \"candle\", \"never forget\", and the numbers 25 and 64. reply badrabbit You know, even with Google amd Bing, search terms are extremely (even politically) censored depending on where you search from. It&#x27;s not like Chinese users can search the same thing fine on Google. reply shadowgovt 1I wasn&#x27;t imagining one would be obliged. Merely that as a demonstrated vital good in modern society, it&#x27;s something a government could, perhaps, guarantee a minimum standard on.Ad-free tax-funded search would be kind of neat. reply halflings 1Sure, then advocate for your government to build a public search engine.Why do you need to penalize private institutions if users prefer to use them over a government service? reply CPLX 1They would just have to divest portions of their product.It’s painfully simple and we’ve done it a million times. Breaking up AT&T is probably the most obvious example.They could split up the search and ads business and maps and Google local search and so on.It would be fine. We’d be fine.Also if you work at Google can you tell us if anyone has noticed that the supposedly “equal&#x2F;superior service” has degraded so badly that it’s barely fucking usable a lot of the time?Which is, of course, relevant. reply why_only_15 1Except previously the big breakups (AT&T, Standard Oil) were location-based, which doesn&#x27;t really make sense for Google. Why do you think splitting of maps and display ads would matter for Google&#x27;s market share in search? reply lordnacho 1Done it a million times? How often does this happen? AT&T was decades ago, though I suppose you are referring to less well known actions since then? reply kurthr 1Alphabet in the US would just spin off 3 \"competitors\" and be done. All 4 would then be subsidiaries of the holding company and they still collect the money. Of course this can&#x27;t happen in India, because there would be political repercussions unless it was was an Indian firm connected to the government.To change this takes real political will and a recognition of who the beneficiaries of the current systems are. It&#x27;s not simple in any remotely democratic system with rule of law.We do have the FTC which can enforce antitrust (when the executive branch doesn&#x27;t interfere) and force various requirements (like the auctioning of ad terms be separated from the business of marketing ads, and the collection of search data) on different parts of the company.(edit: Oops, I must remember to only discuss US politics with any realism. Reference to any other country&#x27;s corruption&#x2F;politics must only be with the highest reverence, deference, and awe.) reply yjftsjthsd-h > Alphabet in the US would just spin off 3 \"competitors\" and be done. All 4 would then be subsidiaries of the holding company and they still collect the money.Right, because a judge would look at a company holding the same market through subsidiaries and not throw the book at them. IANAL, but AFAICT the wording in the law doesn&#x27;t even distinguish one company vs a group acting together; why would that make a difference? reply kurthr The law in India that this was a direct response to... or the FTC&#x27;s case in the US?I&#x27;d answer those two questions differently, but I think you&#x27;re referring to something I wasn&#x27;t. reply huitzitziltzin 1Because it’s a bad idea?You shouldn’t ensure that three potentially inferior products stay on the market. That makes no sense.It also reduces the incentives those firms have to invest in quality - at some point there is a hard limit on how much competition they face. That would be a terrible, terrible law. reply paulryanrogers 1It makes perfect sense. Doesn&#x27;t happen in the US because of regulatory capture reply siliconc0w 1It&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s Google&#x27;s dominance causing search to suck or just the web ecosystem naturally optimizing for clicks. I will say most queries with even vaguely commercial intent do seem to get the max or nearly a full page of sponsored links. I don&#x27;t recall what it was like years ago but I&#x27;m pretty sure it is worse. I also think it&#x27;s pretty clear the platform take-rate needs to be generally lowered across the board, likely making it illegal to lock customers to a store or require payments go through the same store. This is a tax on basically everyone and provides very little value. reply i_am_jl 1>I don&#x27;t recall what it was like years ago but I&#x27;m pretty sure it is worse.It&#x27;s absolutely worse today, how much worse depends on how far back you go.Before 2005 Google didn&#x27;t put ads in search results, AdWords results were separated off to the right side of the page to make them clearly distinct from organic search results. reply lolinder 1Kagi stands to me as proof that search can be better if it isn&#x27;t run by an ad company. Kagi deliberately downranks sites that are loaded with ads and trackers, and the quality of their results is much higher, with much less SEO blogspam. Unsurprisingly, having a high concentration of ads and trackers is highly correlated with having content that is intended to maximize views rather than provide utility.Google has a conflict of interest here: on the one hand their users need information, but on the other Google is the primary vendor of advertisements on these garbage clickbait sites. It would not surprise me if Google intentionally upweighted results that have their ads in them, and they certainly are not downweighting them the way Kagi does. reply jonex 1If Kagi were as popular as Google, you&#x27;d quickly see pages appear \"without ads\", that looks suspiciously like what an ad would say. The problem is SEO, and it affects the mainstream search engine because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s worth optimising for.For instance, Google product search results would likely be greatly improved by always showing relevant reddit posts first. But this would last a very short amount of time until reddit would be completely drowned in junk. (I&#x27;ve seen people argue that this is already the case, but searching reddit still tends to work well for the products I search for)We can be happy that Google search hasn&#x27;t gone this way, and as a Kagi user you should be glad that it&#x27;s not a more popular engine, as the quality of results likely highly depend on that just fact.In a way the ads-filled product search results are better, because at least they&#x27;re honestly trying to sell you the product you are searching for rather than making fake comparison sites pretending to be genuine content. reply lolinder 1> that looks suspiciously like what an ad would say ... fake comparison sites pretending to be genuine content.This is already a thing under Google&#x27;s system: if a result isn&#x27;t an ad-ridden mess, it&#x27;s content marketing trying to sell an adjacent product.You haven&#x27;t addressed the conflict of interest that Google has as the largest vendor of ads on the internet. Right now, Kagi&#x27;s sole job is to help me find what I&#x27;m looking for. If SEO started to game their current algorithm, the incentive would be for Kagi to improve their algorithm and win the meta game. If they fail to do so, their payments will dry up as people look for an engine that will.Google has no such incentive. If their algorithms consistently drive traffic to pages that have their ads on them, Google is incentivized to keep that traffic flowing, regardless of how SEO&#x27;d the content is. The user isn&#x27;t Google&#x27;s customer, the advertiser is. reply eitland 1In addition to what lolinder writes Kagi already gives me what we have askes for from Google for a decade or two: a way for us to punish creative SEO artists by individually downranking or outright block them.If they start popping up in Kagis result they will bother me at most two or three times before I hit the downrank or block button and they are gone.Why Google hasn&#x27;t managed to create something similar during the last two decades I leave as an exercise for the reader. reply zlg_codes 1> In a way the ads-filled product search results are better, because at least they&#x27;re honestly trying to sell you the product you are searching for rather than making fake comparison sites pretending to be genuine content.In what universe can for-profit behavior be trusted or accepted at face value as genuine? Also, maybe I&#x27;m using it Wrong™, but I don&#x27;t use general search engines to look for products. I&#x27;m not shopping all the time, so why should we be advertised to all the time? I use a blocker and aggressively eradicate ads from my experiences, precisely because they are useless to me, take up valuable screen real estate and bandwidth, and are security and privacy vulnerabilities.It wasn&#x27;t so bad back when it was just a JPG and a link, but the telemetry that gets baked into it is creepy as well. For-profit Internet behavior needs to rein in its snooping if it wants to gain trust. reply Given_47 I interpreted differently, in that it’s easier to filter out the explicit ads than the sites that purport to being honest review pages but actually have affiliate deals for every product reply fireflash38 1How does kagi do with \"corporate blogspam\" - things like tutorials, guides, intros, etc created by a company as a funnel for conversions.You know, things like the fusionauth OAuth guides (not trying to call them out).I ask because it&#x27;s a weird area where it can be shit and predatory, or a general good thing. reply mordae 1Try Kagi. They are weeding out the bad results waaaay more aggressively than Google. It helps a lot. They even allow me to immediately boost or block whole websites! Something absolutely trivial Google just refused to do. reply WirelessGigabit 1The problem here is authority. What makes you an authority on a subject? Books written? Credentials (diploma?)? References?These things aren&#x27;t all true in real life, and on the internet it&#x27;s even easier to fake all of that.In the beginning Google went by &#x27;amount of text&#x27; (which is why you read everybody&#x27;s life story on how they had sex next to a magma flow in Hawaii which created the idea of doing burnt ends on a pizza stone), references (remember all those backlinks which would boost your page). Credentials are a lot harder to track. There is no API at my school where you can put in my name and see my credentials (and all you&#x27;d see is &#x27;we got governments subsidies for this person, which is why we let him pass&#x27;).And all of this worked at the start. Knowledgeable people naturally had references on the web, as only knowledgeable people were on the web.Now we literally have people writing text purely to make it look like their website has more content on them, even if it is remotely related to what they serve.Great example, even posted here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36740400Or any coding problem where you end up on logrocket &#x2F; some partitioning app &#x2F; some generated website with which has an &#x27;answer&#x27; for KB0000000 -> KB9999999... reply RubyRidgeRandy 1I work (partly) in SEO. One of the main issues that affects search and will get even worse in the future is the post-scarcity environment of the web when it comes to information. Say you had five websites for that each have identical cookie recipes. If you optimize search rankings by click-through rating, eventually all the sites will have similar copy, titles, and page descriptions. If you optimize for bounce rate, you knock out sites that get to the point but also knock out sites that crappy and have bad ui&#x2F;ux. What about core web vitals? Well again, everyone will catch up eventually. Anything that can be gamified will eventually be gamed.Now instead of 5 sites with identical recipes, what about 500? 5,000? 5,000,000? How can you even rank them in a meaningful way and does it matter to the end user?There will be too much of a supply of information, especially when ai ramps up, that no one website will have unique value outside of local significance or if it was made by your mom or someone you like. I think it will be crazy to see what the web looks like 10 years from now. It could be vastly different. reply ClumsyPilot 1This expectation that everything can be automatically done by algoryths is the core if the problem. its like a form of insanity, it doesn&#x27;t work but we keep trying.Why are top 10 results for &#x27;apply for visa to Moldova&#x27; a scam? Is it really impossible to give government officials an ability to provide input for official business, like applying for a passport?Could you not hire like 2 people in each makor country to keep track of websites for important government services?Could you not take community input like reddit does, or wikipedia?seriously sometimes i think the people making the smartest algorythms are tge ones with biggest tonnel vision, and are incapable of examining alternative solutions. reply salawat 1...It isn&#x27;t the algorithm that&#x27;s the problem. It&#x27;s people invested in becoming a value extracting diversion for an answer that&#x27;ll be around.Lets take your problem. Applying for a visa for Moldova. Let&#x27;s say that there&#x27;s a site hosted at visa.moldova.gov with a form to apply.Eventually, someone is going to integrate a bunch of data broker services to auto-fill that form, then data broker to other tourism related businesses trying to compete to plan your stay.It is very much in their interest to ensure that no one sees visa.moldova.gov, but instead sees one of their onboarding funnels.Thus the well around a well known onboarding point to a critical government service is poisoned. reply salawat 1You could stop working in SEO and just design shit to be responsive to typical boolean search like Tim intended. But dear God, people might be able to find things then, and where would you fork in the distracting cruft?The problem never was or will be Search. The problem is advertisers hijacking the verb of \"Search\" to weight it for those willing to pay.Librarians and archivists have had search solved for the last century. The only people who have a problem with that implementation are the ones who want to convince you the answer you&#x27;re looking for is them. reply rolph 1>>What makes you an authority on a subjectAlso, as the 90s Microsoft case showed, just having a monopoly isn’t bad. It’s the harm caused by having the monopoly.Can you elaborate your thoughts here because the point of breaking up companies with monopolistic power is they cannot be divorced from monopolistic abuse of that power. It is written into US law that the company has a legal duty to it&#x27;s shareholders. It seems your point is a distinction without a difference. reply prepend 1The issue is that having a monopoly in the US isn’t a reason to break up a company, even though it might make it possible to abuse. Antitrust law in the US requires some consumer harm, so it’s the abuse of monopoly power that’s the crux, not just having it.And duty to shareholders would actually mean that management would not abuse their monopoly power because of the risk of breakup. reply joshuamorton 1Basically all of this is false.The legal duty to shareholders doesn&#x27;t mean that companies need to violate the law. In reality, saying \" we don&#x27;t abuse our market position to avoid regulatory scrutiny\" is acting in the interests of shareholders, and a lawsuit wouldn&#x27;t go further. Otherwise you&#x27;d be saying that companies had a duty to break all laws in pursuit of shareholder value, which is obviously silly.And yeah under us law you have to prove consumer harm or anticompetitive practice, not just having a significant market majority. reply wak90 I am aware of the legal duty. The legal duty is to maximize shareholder value but not explicitly break the law.What do you think this looks like in practice? Because it makes logical sense to me that monopolistic companies would use their monopolistic power to come as close as they can with anti competitive behavior without attracting scrutiny which is why you break them up in the first place. And it&#x27;s not theoretical, there are many examples not least of which is Microsoft. reply joshuamorton > The legal duty is to maximize shareholder value but not explicitly break the law.It&#x27;s not though!The legal duty is to act in the best interests of shareholders. Avoiding the risk of regulatory scrutiny is in the interests of shareholders. The way a lawsuit like this would work is that you&#x27;d go to discovery and short of the CEO explicitly stating that they were tanking share prices (and not disclosing that at the time), the lawsuit would get thrown out.> monopolistic powerWhat is monopolistic power that isn&#x27;t anticompetitive? Either what you&#x27;re saying here is \"Companies would engage in anticompetitive behavior and avoid scrutiny\" in which case that&#x27;s a regulatory failing, or you&#x27;re saying \"companies would engage in legal practices I personally dislike, and not attract scrutiny as a result\", which is totally fine.> And it&#x27;s not theoretical, there are many examples not least of which is MicrosoftI&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re saying, Microsoft wasn&#x27;t broken up. replydelfinom 1>Microsoft has over 90% of the desktop OS and Office software markets.Their market has been shrinking due to the rise of tablets and smartphones (so a majority of the population doesn&#x27;t need PCs at home beyond certain professionals, gamers and hobbyists)They do have a large business market share, but that is also shrinking as many \"modern\" businesses diversify with Apple computers due to employees growing up with them.Depending on stats, it has fallen from 90% to 75% in a decade and will most likely continue to fall. This is part of the business case for Microsoft to make their software work cross-platform in order to diversify.Otherwise their position is a natural monopoly. Companies opted to all use Windows because there are certain economies of scale that occur when you all standardize on the same software, including, and this is the biggest one, your employees not needing to relearn whatever ridiculous snowflake UI scheme came up by each different linux distro. It&#x27;s why Windows and macOS will continue to remain dominant in the PC space.The same goes for Office 365. Sure there are certain elements of it that are a bit _too pushy. But companies buy into it because it&#x27;s one standardized and integrated system. Going elsewhere has overhead of increased training costs for end users and even the IT admin side. reply JumpinJack_Cash 1But you can have them for free so it doesn&#x27;t count reply layer8 1Price dumping is an anti-competitive practice. reply lolinder 1You can&#x27;t have them for free—you pay for Windows in the form of a higher OEM cost for your computer.EDIT: OP eventually clarified in the thread that they&#x27;re talking about piracy. So apparently the argument is that because Microsoft products can be pirated, Microsoft isn&#x27;t a monopoly. Make of that what you will. reply JumpinJack_Cash 1Only if you buy an already assembled computer, not if you take the time to assemble the components yourself.And also as a small fish the higher OEM price is being subsidised by the Fortune 500 companies which buy millions of dollars worth of products from Dell etc. reply lolinder 1If you assemble the components yourself, you still don&#x27;t get Windows for free, you just get out of paying the Windows tax if you intend to install Linux.Edit: The idea that OEMs only tack on the extra cost to big companies is demonstrably false. For one thing, margins per-item are always lower on bulk purchases, not higher—Fortune 500 do not pay list price on anything. For another, you can see the difference in cost on the Dell XPS 13 by switching between Linux and Windows:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dell.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;shop&#x2F;dell-laptops&#x2F;xps-13-plus-dev...Computers that don&#x27;t offer a Linux option just all come with that $149 surcharge baked in. reply JumpinJack_Cash 1> > If you assemble the components yourself, you still don&#x27;t get Windows for free, you just get out of paying the Windows tax if you intend to install Linux.You get Windows for free from the combo of self-assemble + torrenting + Microsoft not pursuing individual users for piracy> > Dell XPS 13And that is what I said, if you don&#x27;t assemble the thing yourself buy the cheapest option from an OEM and then you can get Microsoft products for free if you are a wise guy.And Microsoft tolerates it. reply lolinder 1This is a completely useless argument in the context of antitrust. Microsoft falling victim to copyright infringement is not going to cause a judge to say \"actually, since so many people steal your stuff, you&#x27;re not a monopoly after all!\" replyAnthonyMouse 1Platforms are ecosystems with a monopoly intentionally created by copyright. But the copyright monopoly is supposed to be for the copyrighted work. You shouldn&#x27;t be able to anti-competitively leverage it into a monopoly over everything else it touches, from hardware to app distribution to services.And there is no inherent reason it has to be that way. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t have any kind of a monopoly on app distribution for Windows, for example. POSIX applications aren&#x27;t tied to any specific vendor&#x27;s proprietary Unix. You don&#x27;t have to run Windows on most PCs even if that&#x27;s what it comes with, and the same has been true of many Macs, but not iPhones.Taking a monopoly you have legitimately and leveraging it into control over some other market is called tying. reply joe_the_user Amazon: Walmart (goods), Netflix (media)Walmart and Amazon are both huge but it seems just wrong to say a brick-and-mortar store as equivalent to an online market place. The direct competitors to Amazon are Ebay, Baidu, Etsy, Temu and others, all of which are much smaller in the US (but some are huge elsewhere). You say that Facebook is a Google competitor because it offers eyeballs and because people sometimes go there to get stuff and it uses it&#x27;s info for ads providing.The actual situation imo is that online enterprises compete via monopolistic competition [1]. No large high tech company wants to offer exactly the same thing as it&#x27;s because at best neither will make a lot of money - instead, any company entering a crowded marketplace will come up with something guaranteeing them more engagement, higher profits and so-forth (thus something even worse from the consumer&#x27;s view). See Meta&#x27;s Threads.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Monopolistic_competition reply tzs > Walmart and Amazon are both huge but it seems just wrong to say a brick-and-mortar store as equivalent to an online market placeWalmart is also an online market place. Walmart.com includes third party reseller products with many significant similarities to Amazon. They&#x27;ve got fulfilled by Walmart, free shipping, and if you join Walmart+ it includes Paramount+ video streaming (also free grocery delivery). reply jitl I go to Walmart a bit less frequently than I go to Amazon in person (Fresh or Whole Foods), but I order from Walmart quite frequently. Their online delivery services are very competitive and comparable to Amazon&#x27;s. If Amazon is out of stock on an item or showing long delivery time, I&#x27;ll order from Walmart instead. Most recently I ordered a Synology RT6600AX Wifi router&#x2F;media server because Amazon had 2 week delivery time, and Walmart had 2 day. reply barnabee 1I realise its not how current laws work, but I think the threshold for any large&#x2F;mature market for anti-trust should be more like 33% than near 100%.There&#x27;s no need for companies supplying a product en masse to be anywhere near that large. reply barbazoo 1Many have made cases against Amazon, e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doctorow.medium.com&#x2F;californias-antitrust-case-again... reply LorenzoGood 1Apple has over 75% of 18-24 year olds with their phone in their pocket. reply constantcrying 1But how is this the result of Apple engaging in anti-competitive practices? 75% of people choosing your product can not be grounds to breakup a company and the fact that it looks different for other age groups is just further evidence that Apple is engaging in fair competition. reply satvikpendem 1Blocking iMessage on non Apple devices and generally making Apple stuff only work with other Apple stuff, not to mention their 30% fees on their app store while also not allowing other app stores, are all anticompetitive practices, which the EU is well regulating soon. reply GeekyBear 1> Blocking iMessage on non Apple devicesiMessage has always worked with any device that supports SMS.Google, on the other hand, actively blocked Windows Phone from having access to Youtube. Even when Microsoft paid to write a Youtube app themselves, Google blocked it.Google did the same thing and blocked Youtube on Amazon&#x27;s Echo Show. reply magicalist 1> iMessage has always worked with any device that supports SMSyoutube has always worked in a web browser.Meanwhile I&#x27;m laughing about how fast Apple would come down on Google if they made their own Android chat that tapped into iMessage and internet commentators tried to justify it by \"even when Google paid to write an iMessage app themselves, Apple blocked it\" reply GeekyBear Google has used it&#x27;s internet video monopoly as a weapon against Microsoft&#x27;s competing smart phone platform AND Amazon&#x27;s competing smart assistant platform.Apple doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly position to abuse in when it comes to texting.Google, on the other hand, does nave a monopoly position on internet video, and a history of using that monopoly as a weapon against competing platforms. reply satvikpendem 1Why the whataboutism? They both have flaws. By iMessage blocking, you surely knew that I didn&#x27;t mean just interoperability via SMS. If Apple adopted RCS or some other such standard, Android users and iPhone users could talk without having a degraded experience on either side. Apple executives literally admitted that not expanding iMessage ensured that people would continue to buy iPhones:> app.)...In the absence of a strategy to become the primary messaging service for [the] bulk of cell phone users, I am concerned [that] iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;4&#x2F;27&#x2F;22406303&#x2F;imessage-android... reply GeekyBear 1> By iMessage blocking, you surely knew that I didn&#x27;t mean just interoperability via SMSIt&#x27;s not blocking at all, when you explicitly support interoperation.The only example that can obviously be called \"blocking\" is when Google used it&#x27;s internet video monopoly as a weapon against Microsoft&#x27;s competing smart phone platform.Refusing to allow anyone to produce a Youtube app for Windows Phone isn&#x27;t even in the same zip code as Google not writing a Youtube app themselves. reply stale2002 1Since it seems like you are not aware, you should know that the functionality available for iMessage is different on other platforms.That may be causing your confusing here. You weren&#x27;t aware of the functionality difference that Apple prevents other platforms from using with their design choices.I&#x27;d recommend that you research which functionality is prevented on other platforms, since you didn&#x27;t seem to know about it. reply GeekyBear 1Are we both talking about a text messaging app that can send text messages to any device that supports the universal SMS standard?That&#x27;s not blocking.A good example of blocking is not allowing any developers on a competing smart phone platform to write an app that allows users to access your monopoly internet video platform. reply ewoodrich https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;why-apples-imessage-is-winning-...Apple is pretty clearly blocking Google (or any other Android app developer) from implementing this functionality and greatly benefits from it. Particularly relevant for the age demographic this thread originally referenced. reply GeekyBear > Apple is pretty clearly blocking Google (or any other Android app developer) from implementing this functionalityWhat functionality? Give some concrete examples. reply ewoodrich High res photos is the most egregious example. reply GeekyBear That&#x27;s an issue with the MMS standard.Try again. reply ewoodrich Correct, the issue is that Apple doesn&#x27;t support interoperability with iMessage or a modern standard like RCS. The EU is concerned enough to address this with a regulatory apparatus that the US lacks.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;4&#x2F;27&#x2F;22406303&#x2F;imessage-android... reply GeekyBear > Apple doesn&#x27;t support interoperability with iMessage or a modern standard like RCS.Sorry, but Google&#x27;s proprietary closed source fork of RCS is not any kind of \"standard\".> Google&#x27;s version of RCS—the one promoted on the website with Google-exclusive features like optional encryption—is definitely proprietary, by the way. If this is supposed to be a standard, there&#x27;s no way for a third-party to use Google&#x27;s RCS APIs right now. Some messaging apps, like Beeper, have asked Google about integrating RCS and were told there&#x27;s no public RCS API and no plans to build one.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;new-google-site-begs... reply ewoodrich Then Apple should allow interoperability with the iMessage protocol. They maintain control without the anti-competitive side effects. They are also free to use any variant of RCS that isn&#x27;t controlled by Google. reply GeekyBear > Apple should allow interoperabilityThis is very amusing given that Google wants to charge people to have RCS that can interoperate with their proprietary closed source implementation of RCS.> If you want to implement RCS, you&#x27;ll need to run the messages through some kind of service, and who provides that server? It will probably be Google. Google bought Jibe, the leading RCS server provider, in 2015. Today it has a whole sales pitch about how Google Jibe can \"help carriers quickly scale RCS services, iterate in short cycles, and benefit from improvements immediately.\" So the pitch for Apple to adopt RCS isn&#x27;t just this public-good nonsense about making texts with Android users better; it&#x27;s also about running Apple&#x27;s messages through Google servers. Google profits in both server fees and data acquisition.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;new-google-site-begs... reply ewoodrich Then allow iMessage to interoperate freely, problem solved. Very interested in the implementation of the new EU rules about this. reply GeekyBear iMessage already does interoperate freely through the open standards SMS and MMS. reply ewoodrich EU clearly disagrees 1 more stale2002 1> Are we both talking about a text messaging appWe are talking about iMessage.Were you not aware of the functionality differences, cross platform?I can totally understand if you weren&#x27;t aware of them, because you had only used one type of phone, for example.It can be hard to know about things like this, depending on ones personal experience. replyconstantcrying 1Some of those may be reason to bring legal action, but breaking up Apple over this seems insane. reply satvikpendem 1Yeah I wouldn&#x27;t break them up but they are anticompetitive which is what was asked. reply waveBidder 1Apple has specifically decided to not adopt texting standards, so that anyone not on an apple device can&#x27;t participate in group chats. reply easeout 1I don&#x27;t see how that would hold up in a court. They didn&#x27;t adopt RCS and I can still have group chats by SMS. They didn&#x27;t adopt USB Micro and I can still charge my phone with the cable that came in the box. reply ewoodrich 1You could make an argument that number would be smaller if Apple was forced to make iMessage interoperable with Android devices. reply constantcrying 1Seems like a very weak argument. Practically irrelevant for an anti-trust case I would say. reply charcircuit 1It is interoperable already using SMS. reply LorenzoGood 1Not adopting RCS, and insisting on using iMessage. I don&#x27;t think this should cause antitrust litigation, but it is problematic. reply dantheman 1Hopefully the government loses. reply hackernewds 1I would rather give my data to one entity, than thousands of fragmented ones. Some things can only be accomplished at scale, and also risk getting into the wrong hands (re Twitter) reply growingentropy 1If you only want one entity having your data, you&#x27;re better off being abused by Apple. Google invites all his friends over to run a train on you. reply waithuh 1Why do you think that Apple doesnt do that? reply growingentropy 1Although to be fair, the next paragraph says, \"Surprisingly, Google offers a similar deal. The company collects and uses your personal data for targeted advertising, but it doesn’t sell it to third-party advertisers. So it means advertisers can pay Google or Apple to be seen on your iPhone or Android device. However, the advertisers can’t know who you are and come after you on their own.\"I just find Google to be an advertising company that happens to produce software. reply growingentropy 1https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossbytes.com&#x2F;apple-data-collection-explained&#x2F;\"Now that we’ve established that Apple collects and uses your data to serve ads, does it sell your data too?

Not outright selling, you are right there. Selling in bulk would be dumb for these companies when they have ad networks in place, though.
