    "originBody": "My Windows Computer Just Doesn't Feel Like Mine Anymore By Sydney Butler Published 1 day ago Thread 62 Follow Share Link copied to clipboard Sign In To Your How-To Geek Account Lucas Gouveia / How-To GeekGorodenkoff / Shutterstock KEY TAKEAWAYS Windows feels more commercial, less personal; past versions were disconnected & resilient. Advertising integration in Windows makes it feel cheap. Updates, intrusive changes, settings modifications, and lack of control plague modern Windows systems. An operating system is the most personal part of a \"personal\" computer, and it used to be that as a Windows user I didn't feel like I was renting my computer from Microsoft, but in recent years that feeling has all but evaporated. To me, Windows feels cheaper and more commercial than ever, and that's not a recipe for a good user experience. The Offline Glory Days of Windows The first version of Windows I ever used, coming from MS-DOS, was Windows 3.1. While Windows 3.1 might look incredibly primitive today, it's hard to explain just how big of a leap this was for a kid who had to memorize the Command Line instructions just to play some games. Things didn't really kick off for me until Windows 95 and our first taste of the internet, but even then, 99% of my Windows time up until Windows 7 was spent disconnected from the net. In retrospect, this was actually a good thing in some ways, because it meant that Microsoft couldn't remotely mess with my Windows installation. Patches and updates came in the form of Windows service packs, and those were on actual physical floppy disks or CD-ROMs. If my computer worked yesterday, and I didn't change anything myself, it would almost certainly keep working until I inadvertently broke it myself. Now that Windows is almost always online, my \"personal\" computer experience is feeling quite a bit less personal. Advertising Sneaking In Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek If you bought a laptop or a pre-built computer you probably didn't think much about the price of Windows, but the fact is that Windows has never been an inexpensive operating system. As someone who has almost always built their own computer, I'm keenly aware that this software cost a significant amount of money. Which is why I and many other people were a little irked when Windows started introducing advertising and writing guides on how to turn off advertising in Windows became a popular new pastime for us tech bloggers. Basically, it now feels like Windows is partly subsidized by advertising, and regular users can't just have the operating system they paid for without being sold more software and services. It's not (yet) the most egregious way to go about it, but for someone who prefers absolute minimilism in their computer interfaces, it's not working for my feng shui. Updates Breaking My PC At this point, I have lost count of the number of times that I've left my perfectly working Windows computer at the end of my work day, only to return to a completely broken computer that won't boot the next morning. We have numerous articles at How-To Geek on how to stop Windows from updating, and the mere fact that readers are searching for this information should tell you something. Forced, automatic Windows updates seem inevitable now, and with every workaround people come up with, the loopholes are closed. Updates can be delayed, but not deferred. Resistance is futile. Which is why I find it hard to even trust Windows to run a Plex server or a NAS, because inevitably it will reboot the computer without asking me first. Leave My Settings Alone, Microsoft When I have my computer set up a certain way, I'd like it to stay that way permanently. Yet search the forums on sites like Reddit or Microsoft's own community forums, and you'll find numerous complaints about settings changing after updates. It can be innocuous stuff or more serious or impactful things, such as privacy settings. If anyone is going to flip the switches on my computer to control how it behaves and what's allowed, it should be me. My Mac Doesn’t Feel Subsidized Sergio Rodriguez / How-To Geek My constant technical issues with Windows 10 updates eventually led me to switch to macOS back in 2019, and the difference in user experience is stark. You won't find bright garish ads for games or apps anywhere except for the actual App Store, which is where they belong. Intrusive \"notifications\" that are really just advertising? I haven't encountered that on macOS yet! Honestly, it might sound weird, but macOS feels like the offline Windows experience of old to me. In fact, the operating system tends to stay classy and out of my way as far as possible. I've been thinking that the common complaint that Macs cost too much for the hardware you get misses the fact that you are also paying for the software. You get macOS and several other full-fat apps, such as the iWork suite, Garageband, and iMovie included in the price of entry. You pay more now, and don't have annoying monetization efforts later. When I use my Windows 11 laptop (which was more expensive than my Mac, mind you), it feels like those Amazon Kindles that are subsidized by ad money. Except, at least Amazon gave us the choice. Linux Respects Its Users The other major player here is of course Linux in all its varied distributions. Here you are literally getting the operating system for free. The closest that a distro of Linux has come to punting ads was when plugs for software showed up in the Ubuntu Message of the Day and more recently a sort-of \"ad\" for Ubuntu Pro in the terminal. If anyone knows of other examples of native ads in a Linux distro, I'd love to hear about it in the comments. I've had an on-again-off-again relationship with Linux over the years, and daily drove it during seven years of university, and never did I feel that I was being exploited or not in control. In fact, I was probably in too much control, which is why you can break Linux in so many creative ways just by being a dummy. Can Windows Make a Comeback? More and more, I feel like Windows is just becoming a loss-leading front-end for Microsoft to sell its many software-as-a-service products. They don't even do anything if you don't activate Windows other than block wallpaper changes and put a tiny watermark in the corner. You can be sure you can still subscribe to their services even if you didn't pay for Windows! I really hope there will be some way in the future to get a version of Windows (that's not for enterprise users) which gives you the choice to have Microsoft butt out of the daily running, appearance, and settings of your computer. I hate to even suggest it, but I might even be willing to pay for an \"ad-free\" or \"hands-off\" version of the OS. Will this happen, or will Windows continue to slowly turn into a twisted Black Mirror version of itself? As someone who actually likes Windows, I sure hope it can turn that corner.

Reply / Post Sort by: Popular Oldest Newest Kate Forget the ads, what about everything else wrong with Windows? Customisation is frowned upon - you WILL use your computer the way Microsoft think you should, not the way you want to. I LIKE the old start menu, and want it in the bottom left corner thanks. Massive consolidated security patches that aren't properly tested, that take an hour to install and require reboots - normally while you're in the middle of something important. A gazillion services running with obscure names and unclear functions that you're not sure it's safe to switch off. Bloatware you can't completely remove. Device driver backend rewrites that make your old printer / scanner obsolete. Two different control panels because changing settings isn't challenging enough already. And as for trying to debug issues, the event viewer is a confusing mess, and the error messages themselves are complete gobbledygook. It's just complete garbage - the first thing I did when I got my new Windows 11 laptop was install Linux on it. 2024-06-21 16:54:05 16 MadScientist1001 or switch to linux 2024-06-21 12:01:33 10 1 Cki4r Yes 2024-06-22 13:23:37 Luis Fernando Nothing feels more personal than Linux. 2024-06-21 09:56:16 9 John The simple solution for getting rid of ADS is setting your DNS server to Adguard and any other ad blocking service. It's free and most importantly, it works. Surprised it wasn't mentioned here. Either set it under windows network settings or even better, your router. 2024-06-21 10:40:31 7 1 Arca Ege Have you used Windows in the last five years? The ads are a part of the OS, not in webpages. DNS cannot do anything about that. 2024-06-22 07:15:14 2 William This is why I started using Linux, it's not bad and got rid of the spyware which frustrated me. 2024-06-21 12:07:03 7 Pat Same experience, well said. For years I've realized that Windows is an ad delivery platform with a not-great, insecure o/s thrown in as an afterthought. Switched to Linux in 2016, and now it's really lovely using my computers again. Ubuntu lost me for good with their recent \"pro\" spam - I couldn't even believe that d move. Thank goodness there are so many other choices. 2024-06-21 12:27:27 5 1 George Competition across the various distros is one of my favorite things about Linux. Choice is a Feature! 2024-06-22 09:44:19 Jean Yves You are right with Windows. It has become annoying. When you add Google ads, it makes you think that Linux may be a solution...... Keep How-To Geek alive, your doing a great job! 2024-06-21 17:21:43 5 Susieray You took the words right out of my mouth. I too started out on DOS and loved Excel when it came out as well as Word, but they have both changed to some thing else trying to be \"ahead of the competition\". Yes, there are some things I like better than Windows 3.1 but most of it has to be re-learned with each new version. I spend way too much time trying to learn how to do something simple in the new version every time it is \"updated\". 2024-06-21 18:09:08 4 colleen My graphics software will not run on LInux, my husbands CAD won't either, and also not on a Mac. I keep my main work computer, a Windows 7, off my network 99 percent of the time, turning on the network only to transfer files to my other computer, which I call my garbage computer. I use my garbage PC for email and browsing. When I have time will look for a linux distro in order to email and browse. 2024-06-21 17:20:42 4 2 Uber If you're not using specialised Windows software much, install Linux and run Windows through 'Virtual Box\". Not only is this safer, the windows OS is kept on a folder and can be easily backed up and reinserted to a fresh linux install or even another computer. 2024-06-22 12:24:33 Col_Panek It took quite a while, but I got all our PCs onto open source, cross-platform software so that when I switched them to Linux, it was easy. Once in a while I used Wine to run the odd Windows program. I do everything from electronic circuit simulation to sheet music and architectural CAD. All free. 2024-06-22 12:33:25 HTGMember I've been a Linux user for many years - Mint and now Elementary. When I recently had to replace my laptop, before wiping out the pre-installed Windows 11, out of curiosity I started Windows set-up and couldn't believe how bossy and commercial it was. It was a real struggle to get to the point where I could open a browser and do some real work. I quickly fled and wiped it out. Never again. Linux installed so quickly and with minimum nosiness and hassled. Bliss! 2024-06-21 17:59:29 3 1 George I bought a small Dell laptop to host my lectures at the University during the Windows 10->11 transition. The eternal setup software agreed to encrypt the drive (required if I keep any student info on the machine), installed patches, then rebooted and asked for the encryption password - which it had neglected to give me! (It's possible it was shown on a subtle dialog - I quickly tried of the long wait and worked on other more interesting things.) Dell support was wonderful, spending over an hour trying to find the password. It was supposed to be available on my Microsoft account, but the literal message on that page (I'll never forget it) was \"There's nothing for you here\". Couldn't have said it better myself. I wiped the drive and installed Ubuntu from scratch (much faster than just setting up Windows, why?) and asked one of my Teaching Assistants to help our students with Windows problems. Two other students that semester had the same experience. Bad look, Microsoft. :( I've used Linux for virtually all of my work since 2000, although I now have a Windows mini-PC just to better understand my students' Windows issues. My wife has a niche quilting app that only runs on Windows, so she has a tablet just for that and uses her Linux-based Chromebook for everything else.

In my company I'm forced to use Windows, because we develop Windows software (WPF). I'm not totally happy with Windows (especially 11), but I tend to look for jobs that have nothing to do with what I'm too familiar with to gain new knowledge. However, I'm trying to make the windows experience as good as possible for my personal taste :-) Additionally I hope I can help to migrate to a web based solution in the future. reply Admiral_AWS 8 hours agorootparentprevBetter yet - just switch to Linux Mint. reply sandreas 8 hours agorootparentAs already stated: At home I use Fedora (and others).

But I'm a bit confused on how it works, can you go into a bit more details? Can I use starship+ps to get all Unix and git tools or should I stick with my existing workflow with windows git bash? reply blooalien 12 hours agorootparentStarship is just a fancy prompt that just happens to be crazy cross-platform (works on Linux, MacOS, and Windows shells), but it's super-informative, and easy to install/configure. Beyond that, you'll still need to choose a shell you prefer for when you want/need to use a terminal/console window for things. Contrary to popular belief, the shell is not obsolete by a longshot, even on Windows. On Windows, PowerShell is probably gonna be your best bet, as it's the current standard going forward. I use Starship on Fish shell on Linux and love it. reply red-iron-pine 6 hours agorootparentprevpowershell is light years easier than bash. like, im fluent in bash enough to get stuff done, but i only got there over years, while i picked up powershell fairly quickly. also wayyyyy more readable. i'll admit the object vs text thing is annoying, i feel like bash is more straightforward there, but PS will let you do the same thing eventually. reply nativeit 2 hours agorootparentMy experience is almost exactly inverted. WTF is Invoke? Am I a sorcerer? I want to call a function, I think… reply sandreas 1 hour agorootparentI would have thought Microsoft on is dotnet multi-platform journey would find a way to make PowerShell just POSIX compatible, supporting at least standard all day commands like `grep`, `wc`, `find` and others. All it would have taken is to create aliases or replacements for the top 50 shell commands. Instead they re-invented the wheel. It's not a bad wheel, but the wheel is completely different than most people would expected to be and for POSIX enthusiast it just does not feel right. With wsl or git bash you can do this but it feels slow and clunky most of the time. reply sandreas 9 hours agorootparentprevBesides git bash you could also use wsl, like in: wsl ls -lsa wsl cat file.txt Basically, starship is a config generator for your shell. It transforms a cross platform config file (starship.toml) into a platform specific configuration shell script, e.g.: starship init zsh will output something like zmodload zsh/parameter # Needed to access jobstates variable for STARSHIP_JOBS_COUNT # Defines a function `__starship_get_time` that sets the time since epoch in millis in STARSHIP_CAPTURED_TIME. if [[ $ZSH_VERSION == ([1-4]*) ]]; then # ZSHAll this fuzzy language That's not the exclusive problem to Microsoft - it happens all around us within the IT world. The corporations stopped acknowledging the permanent \"No\" anymore and the actual user choice. It's a plain harassment up until you give up and agree to what you get shoveled with.

We have killed them. If a government tries to do anything against a company that isn't a perfect 1:1 mapping to an explicit thing in the law that they are breaking, the company will sue back and win. And if they try to pass such a law, the biggest companies are powerful enough to get rid of them next term, so they don't even try. reply 0dayz 7 hours agorootparentprevYou get what you vote for. If you want less government interference then less regulatory power will exist. reply BiteCode_dev 7 hours agorootparentprevThey are in Europe, and heavily criticized on HN everytime they regulate.

Nothing more. A classic case of it doesn't happen on _my computer_ so it must be a lie. reply Numerlor 6 hours agorootparentI have been lucky on multiple installs on multiple computers? I'm not saying what people are complaining about are lies, I'm saying the issues don't seem to exist in EU installs on Windows. For example the only ads I've seen were during the initial setup screen and pre-installed apps/shortcuts that are gone in a minute of work, and OneDrive can be uninstalled in two clicks. The only issue that is still here would be bing in start search but that's trivial to disable compared to the configurations I had to do on my linux desktops, so while it is bad and shouldn't be a thing I don't see it as a big issue when comparing to linux. reply janice1999 6 hours agorootparentprevWindows is literally different in the EU and the rest of the world. https://blogs.microsoft.com/eupolicy/2024/03/07/microsoft-dm... reply noprocrasted 5 hours agorootparentprevOnly problem with GDPR is that while the spirit/intention of the law is great (and it even prohibits malicious compliance such as consent prompts that make it more difficult to decline than accept), enforcement is significantly lacking which means it's still more profitable to breach it than respect it. reply BiteCode_dev 2 hours agorootparentI would say the problem is rather that companies are becoming too big to cares.

I can live without the small handful of Linux-hostile Windows-only games that still won't run due to draconian DRM/AntiCheat, as the vast majority of my Steam library is \"Click 'Play' and they just work\", for Windows games and the many native Linux games I also have.

I have worked with Linux for 17 years and the last time I was forced to have a Windows VM was 14 years ago. Yes, it limits available jobs and probably doesn't pay any top salaries. But better than selling myself to people I don't respect. reply hylaride 6 hours agorootparentAlthough I probably have my price, I too otherwise refuse to work for companies that'd force me to use windows. I've been lucky to be able to use macs since 2008 and some of those companies had linux users. Most top tech companies will happily give you a choice between a mac or windows. For me it has generally mean I don't work for banks, the government, or very large organizations that aren't recent tech companies. That being said, at a certain scale or type of company centralized management, software support, and security risks mean \"allowing\" random people to run their own OS becomes difficult and risky. Lots of large older companies probably have proprietary software, too (thankfully more of this is becoming web based). Yes, in theory linux is more secure and anybody who would want to use it is probably capable of taking care of themselves, but it is probably (at large companies) corporate lawyers and CISOs ruining the fun. And linux can have its own risks and dedicating a team to support (from a security perspective) them isn't economical for the what would be very small user base. Ye old big bank can't and arguably shouldn't allow it without an otherwise good reason. reply ndriscoll 4 hours agorootparentThe good reason is to get your job done, which is what the computer is for. The tools many developers use today (e.g. containers) are Linux only and their target environment (i.e. the servers where their code will run) is Linux. The typical workaround is to use VMs. This results in terrible filesystem performance on both Mac and Windows, and on Windows I've also had to deal with things like time, DNS, and routing breaking in the VM, so now I need to know how to be a Linux and Windows sysadmin (i.e. not what you want to be paying me for) to fix it instead of just using e.g. Fedora which I've never had any issue with; it just works. Another user commented about how it's unreasonable to ask them to run CAD software in a VM, but this is exactly what (some? many?) companies ask programmers to do. It's especially goofy if it's a software company where that development is their core business. reply hnbad 7 hours agorootparentprevI'm a dev who switched from desktop Linux to Windows with WSL without regrets. That devs at a company use Windows doesn't mean they're forced to. Often it just means the designers also work on Windows. reply docmars 4 hours agorootparentWhy would engineers need to use the same OS platform as the designers? Most designers use Figma these days, which has clients for Windows and macOS, and can be used fully in a web browser as well. reply A4ET8a8uTh0 7 hours agorootparentprevI admire this spirit, probably because I am still unable to put it in practice -- and those are typically moments where I dream of my own business. IT at my current employer is capable enough ( though there are rumblings of moving everything, but hardware offshore again.. I am starting to think it all moves in waves ), but our executives, well, lets just say over the past few weeks I was questioning what I am doing here. reply joenot443 7 hours agorootparentprevWeird, all the Microsoft engineers I know all use Surfacebooks with WSL. Is that different from the Microsoft engineers you're friends with? reply the__alchemist 6 hours agorootparentprevHere are some thoughts: #1: Apple locks you into their ecosystem, and feels even creepier than MS. #2: The Linux distros I've used are designed in a way so you shouldn't have to use the CLI and sudo for normal tasks, but you end up having to anyway in practice. It's a combination of annoying, and I, sooner-or-later, end up in a state where the system is \"totaled\"; easier to do a clean install than get it working again after the wrong CLI C+P broke something important. reply makeitdouble 8 hours agorootparentprevLinux requires you give up on cutting edge hardware. Basically there's no alternative to the Surface Pro or the Asus' Z13 (or even X13), or Lenovo's dual screen or tablet lines that works with Linux.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a Linux lover and user, but from an outside perspective Windows registry (a central, structured database of configuration for everything) looks easier. reply otherme123 10 hours agorootparentA sane program knows were to find the \"random\" configs: first, in cwd, then $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, then $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS. This is not exactly \"obscure\", you learn it soon and it's documented in every program. The big advantage of this is that you can take your local config files and take it to other system. Can you do that with the Windows registry? Ironically, the only way to port settings in Windows is to have a .reg script and execute it, the thing you critisize. And the Windows registry might be a single centralized config file, but config values are scattered through all the tree, and usually undocumented. E.g. this is a commonly recomended tweak: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop] \"UserPreferencesMask\"=hex(2):90,12,03,80,10,00,00,00 Can you tell what it does? reply gudzpoz 13 hours agorootparentprevI've been wondering if these magical registry things are documented anywhere...

Which is not even necessary on most distributions for basic usage. With Windows you have to patch it through the registry (which is not bsckupable config files) to remove ads and other annoying \"features\". So the out-of-the-box experience is better with Linux. My mom even understands Linux GUIs better these days than Windows, it's just less bloat and distraction. And for basic apps you don't have to configure anything on the CLI. I recently got a Raspberry PI for my parents to use as a HTPC, installed some basic apps on it, and they can just use it like that. reply somat 11 hours agorootparentprevThat is the paradox of the registry.

I am not even suggesting third party software, just Windows. But I agree, somehow this idea seems better on paper than in practice. reply pndy 9 hours agorootparentprevThe basics I'd say are still pretty much configurable via GUI so a newcomer wouldn't have hard times with either KDE, Gnome or Xfce. For majority it probably would be enough if GPU, sound and network drivers are working and it's possible to easily install apps they used to use on Windows or OSX/ Back around 2003 I read in local \"Linux Magazine\" about some project that tried bringing kind of a registry equivalent to Linux world. Sadly these were Internet caffee times so it was hard to track projects, so I really don't know what happen to it. The closest thing that resembles that idea is dconf. With Windows nowadays you do all this tweaking or juggling within registry/group policy editor to protect yourself (and of course you do that if you care - majority of people don't) while with Linux I'd say it's more a matter of fine-tuning your distro of choice to your needs. reply skydhash 13 hours agorootparentprev> Dozens of obscure config files (each with a different syntax), stored in various random places in the filesystem, with the general expectation that every user should be able to run a terminal command once in a while to fix something.

There you could do things as a noob by just looking around and after a while you could do things without even thinking. Every windows version after that has broken that flow in some way. In Linux I keep forgetting what file to edit to get what I want. I need to look up location and syntax for most things every time I want to do something. reply skydhash 6 hours agorootparentI agree with you that an application needs discoverability. Like a text processor for a writer or a photo editing software for a photographer. It should make sense for a particular domain, requiring only minimal training for the medium. But we can't abstract away the notion of computers. An analogy is car. Driving a car only require a minimal interface. Racing with one, however, requires a lot more knowledge. Repairing a car is where knowing the internals is the minimum. Different needs, different levels of knowledge. Most people would be happy with the iPad if only the applications were a tad more useful (File sharing is aweful). But some people do \"general computing\" and graphical interfaces usually fail in some way or another (especially with automation). reply squarefoot 9 hours agorootparentprevI like to describe the shell and commands as a big dashboard with many levers and indicators compared to a much simpler one with just a small bunch of ON-OFF switches. They're indeed complicated, until the day you need to change something that isn't on the simple panel, or isn't a simple ON-OFF choice, because every operating system is complicated; you can hide some of its complexity behind a graphical interface, but you always lose something in the process because you can easily have a command with 100 options but you can't put 100 buttons on a screen. It simply doesn't scale. So the next question is \"how do we put a complicated system under control of a simpler graphical interface?\" We make assumptions of course (read: we write code that makes assumptions), and there is where bugs arise or more complexity is created, because machines (still) aren't good as humans at doing some things. As an example, very complex string operations can be performed using sed, awk and the usual shell command with regular expessions, where on Windows for years (I have no experience with its new shells) many people would have to load Office, import the text, write a macro, and export back the text.

Within each new Windows version they keep switching things around, adding layers upon layers and options within options within option that point back toward the initial options page, where you end up in a loop. The search function rarely finds the settings I want. Edge search results by default, including digital cancer such as Instagram, TikTok, et cetera, on the start menu by default. Now too, for normal computer users who don't want to tweak their operating system and only need basic utilities, and are able to read and follow simple instructions, Linux has long become way more accessible than Windows. reply advael 11 hours agorootparentprevI think there's always a pressure in balancing the ability for anyone to contribute to the software ecosystem with the convenience of a unified interface. Many people who like Apple's ecosystem seem to really want one extreme of this spectrum (A tightly-integrated ecosystem with design choices that standardize throughout - though this has not quite exactly been my experience with that ecosystem in practice), but there are grades of it everywhere. Mainstream linux distros increasingly favor centralized system services, like systemd or upstart, to manage several processes under a quasi-common hierarchy. Config files often get unified in /etc when a project becomes mature and integrated into a lot of distros, and there are conventions in how people write config files that are pretty straightforward in commonly used applications, but much less so in niche projects. Windows seems to be growing less customizable over time in an attempt to tighten its grip on its users, but of course even windows and macos seem to allow a bit more user control than mobile or game console operating systems. It's all degrees. To be frank, I think the only battle-tested reliable ways to make a config language or a set of command line flags easier to use is good, complete documentation, though little things like integration with tab-completion or syntax highlighting can often go a long way too. These exist in almost any commonly used software found on a linux distro and are more than enough for someone willing to actually try stuff, which describes most of the people who can navigate doing anything that's not a default behavior of any OS anyway. Most people seem to have what I can only describe as learned helplessness about computers doing things they don't expect, but to be honest if you put people in an environment where they are motivated and don't feel afraid to mess up (which most educational contexts fail miserably at, both in terms of social norms and systemic incentives), most will actually start to figure stuff out a lot quicker than they expect themselves to. A small portion won't, and unfortunately most social environments are either too rushed or too high-pressure to facilitate this kind of exploration. But if we just accept that people are \"non-technical\" in the sense of \"can't try anything remotely new in order to fix their computer\", the only real way to satisfy those users is going to be keeping a system they already know how to use the same, which companies are simply not willing to do To me, the main difference between open (like linux distros, but there are others) and closed computer operating systems is that the former tends not to tell you \"Sit tight and we'll send a company-certified adult to help you\" (or sometimes \"This is not allowed\", or \"You need to pay extra for that now\"), and the latter, increasingly, wherever possible, makes these the only options available reply PhoenixFlame101 14 hours agorootparentprevWhile I agree with you, the registry is the windows way of hiding away config files. It's either the GUI, or it's the registry. Linux alternatively uses config files directly meant to be altered by the end user. It's less user-friendly, but better than the registry.

I've run docker on my mac with zero issues, except that the move to apple silicon has caused some disruption for cases where I build and push images locally (99% is done via CI/CD, but there are always exceptions) and I have to specify linux/amd64, which with some tooling is actually quite painful. 3) Yeah, powertools is nice. 4) This is absolutely true. The most recent macos announcement does add some better native window management, but all I really want is to be able to plug in my external monitors and have macos not switch them around half the time. It's frustrating as this used to work until around 2012 or so, and then just broke and was never fixed. 5) I've run into windows updates reverting settings or replacing defaults that point to third parties. To be fair, macos has sometimes done this, too. In particular it used to re-enable siri after every OS point release. 6) The ads are there and (with effort) can be removed. But it's the principle. Some product manager thought that this is a good idea - the good idea being something that's good for microsoft and not the user. This way of thinking can and does lead to rot by a thousand cuts. What's next enabling location tracking for the advertisers, thus making my laptops battery slightly worse? - google did this with android. This way of thinking has been killing google. 7) Most of this is repeating point 4 which I agree with, but its filesystem is just a posix filesystem. Mind you the finder has it's strengths and weaknesses - it took awhile to get used to, but it's never really gotten in my way. Calling macos third class for linux development is just plain incorrect. One of the main reasons MacOS took off when it did is because so many developers moved to it because they could use the same \"unix/linux\" tools more natively than windows, but didn't have to deal with linux on the desktop. Web developers in particular could easily run apache/php/etc as well as various design tools from Adobe or whoever. I've not seen too many complaints with most languages on it, but I could see more niche ones like Haskell being painful. > I could provide other reasons but essentially it is way better for me and my use case than alternatives.

Hilariously for me, the one thing that's more painful than anything else when using windows is the poor quality of the bloody trackpads, even on more expensive/premium hardware (I haven't bought a windows laptop since before covid, so maybe this is better now?).

You can put these dlls back when and if you want to install updates. reply Dalewyn 10 hours agorootparentI find approaches like that ultimately end up borking Windows more often than not. Disabling autoupdates via Group Policy is supported and won't bork anything. reply OptionOfT 16 hours agorootparentprevThanks! But I don't want to disable driver updates. I just don't want it to install older versions. reply wvenable 16 hours agorootparentMaybe they know something that you don't or it's just a glitch. reply nequo 15 hours agorootparentBut shouldn’t they inform you and let you opt out of the downgrade even if they know something? Ubuntu at least asks if you want to proceed with a package update, you can look at the changelog to see what the update is about, and you can mark packages to be on hold and skipped for updates. reply beagle3 11 hours agorootparentThat was before snap. Now, Ubuntu doesn’t ask you, and just refreshes snaps in the background. Which is why I have stopped recommending Ubuntu. reply nequo 6 hours agorootparentThat’s fair. But Debian would also let you mark packages, and I imagine other distributions, too. reply ilayn 13 hours agorootparentprevNope same for me with intel drivers. Intel update utility recommends one, installs it. Leave computer idle windows rolls it back in the night to a driver from 2021. reply accrual 15 hours agoparentprev> Every time I search on the start menu there is a web search, impossible to turn off. How is that acceptable? YMMV, but this is what I used to disable web search on my Win 11 Pro workstation: Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer] \"DisableSearchBoxSuggestions\"=dword:00000001 reply ChrisSD 15 hours agorootparentOn Pro it would be better to use the group policy editor. As a bonus this also ensures the setting survives updates, which is not always a given for raw registry edits. reply DaiPlusPlus 12 hours agorootparent(Unsolicited related advice) If gpedit.msc gives you unexpected results (I.e. policies just don’t seem to work) then do two things: 1. gpupdate /force 2. Download the latest ADMX templates; newer versions of Windows often introduce similarly-named - but still distinct - policy templates, for unwanted “features” in older versions, just like Start Menu web-search and forced-restarts for updates. Lastly, while Windows LTSC is really what Microsoft should make available for everyone, don’t forget that Windows Server is still Windows LTSC too - so if you’re outside the MSDN Subscription Garden-of-Eden, you can still get Windows Server tricked-out as a real LTSC Workstation OS. reply DrSiemer 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's frankly offensive that this utterly pointless \"feature\" can't just be disabled. Starting Photoshop used to be windowskey, \"ph\", enter. Now, by default, it will give you an Edge Bing search for \"ph\"... But even if you wait a few seconds before confirming, you'll get some garbage like Windows Photos, even though that's literally never been used. At least the start menu got a lot faster with the net search disabled, but dropping usage based ordering is just another sign that Windows is NOT aimed at power users anymore. reply rkagerer 12 hours agorootparentprevOn an older version of Windows I used the Classic Shell start menu.

If you forget and click save.. well now you have one drive again. reply bongodongobob 13 hours agorootparentDon't. Do. That. Leave it alone, that's why Windows is breaking for you. You keep fucking with core components. It's not Linux. You can't do that and not suffer consequences. reply DrSiemer 12 hours agorootparentLeave it alone? It's unnecessary bloatware, that performs absolutely zero required functionality. It's continuous prominent presence in the _always_ visible part of the file tree on the left of _every_ explorer window is a constant reminder that what used to be my favorite OS is now user hostile. At least in Europe it did get a proper uninstall a while ago, which proves that it really was just there for promotion. I'd gladly pay for a version of Windows that just leaves me alone. No I don't want Edge, Bing, a weather snippet, start search, Cortana, forced updates and a regular black pattern maze promising a somehow \"improved experience\" while trying to force metrics participation down my throat. But I also don't want Linux, because many tools I rely on (plus games) won't run on it and I don't want a Mac because it's too opinionated. It feels exactly like being stuck in an abusive relationship at this point. reply zeppelin101 11 hours agorootparentYou can disable OneDrive pretty easily reply DrSiemer 11 hours agorootparentNow you can, in Europe.

Don’t leave us in the dark. Is that option being removed in the future? reply hnlmorg 12 hours agorootparentprevThere’s actually a few different glibc replacements available for Linux. And if you think OneDrive is essential for Windows then I’d suggest you do a little reading on the history of Microsoft and how they falsely claim dependencies on their own software stacks. Especially the court cases around debundling IE4 with Win98, and DR-DOS vs Windows 95. reply deafpolygon 12 hours agorootparentWell, \"technically\" - it wasn't a false claim. It WAS dependent on IE and other things. It didn't have to be dependent - MS made it that way on purpose, so things would stop working without (even though the dependency didn't need to be baked in). It's akin to adding webview to your application to display a text file, even though you never would display an HTML file. It could have been done another way, but it wasn't. reply hnlmorg 11 hours agorootparentExcept that it was demonstrated that IE could be removed from Windows 98. So Microsoft then claimed that Windows ran slower without IE. A judge (because this whole saga went to court) argued that Microsofts video evidence proving that point was falsified and so Microsoft later also dropped their slowness claim too. reply anthk 8 hours agorootparentprevNo, it wasn't. There was w98lite and such where you could replace WIndows 98's (i)explore.exe/shell32.dll with a Windows 95 one and yet the rest of the software just ran like nothing, while being able to run IE in a standalone way. reply Zambyte 8 hours agorootparentprevIgnoring the fact that you're comparing a cloud storage client to what is essentially a kernel wrapper that all software depends on, you actually can remove glibc without breaking things. You just also have to install another libc (say, musl) and replace your software that targets glibc with software that targets musl, or install a glibc -> musl compatibility layer (gcompat). So, yeah. If you actually know enough about libcs to want to get rid of glibc for a real reason, you can do it without breaking things. If you just want to go around and start deleting core system dependencies (which I think is very silly to put a cloud storage client in that bucket, regardless of the brand of cloud storage) without replacing them, then chaos seems to be the goal, and maybe order is the \"broken\" state for that machine :P reply pxc 1 hour agorootparentprev> core components A Dropbox clone is now 'core OS compinents'?

Though as an ex-Windows developer and hacker, I can tell you that NT is pretty modular and is designed to be “fucked” with in various different ways. Microsoft just like to ship defaults that are more favourable for their own business than your typical power user. reply DrSiemer 12 hours agorootparentprevHow is OneDrive a core component? It even has an uninstall in Europe, because baking it in is clearly anti-competitive. http://windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft... reply stavros 11 hours agorootparentprevHow is Dropbox now a \"core component\" of computers? Have we collectively lost our minds? reply josephg 12 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn’t mind the defaults if they weren’t horrible. No, I don’t want Microsoft selling my data to 3rd parties. I don’t want an AI “assistant” watching everything I do. I don’t want crazy right wing conspiracy theory news stories in my start menu, or popping up next to the clock or wherever that junk lives. I don’t want my start menu to do an internet search. Or to try and get me to play candy crush. If I want a dropbox like service I’ll research my options. Don’t auto install onedrive and make it start automatically at boot. None of that stuff is a core component. The only reason any of that stuff is part of windows is because windows is a mature product. And all their desperate product managers need to add stupid features to windows to justify getting promoted. Maybe I’m just old fashioned, but I don’t use windows because I want to be part of Microsoft’s software empire. I just want an OS that boots fast and lets me play video games. I don’t buy ram from the computer store so some tasteless bozo at Microsoft can justify their 6 figure salary. reply timeon 11 hours agorootparentprevIf cloud is core component does it mean that Windows requires internet to run? reply bruce511 13 hours agorootparentprevYou're getting downvoted, as will I, because presenting an alternative anecdotal experience isn't acceptable in Windows threads. I've learned this the hard way. Unfortunately just like the original post is anecdotal (I haven't had a machine fail to startup after an update since XP) not all anecdotes are born equal. Interestingly, I don't see adverts myself, and I've never seen any at work. I -suspect- that's heavily regionalized. Are there features I don't care for? Sure - I don't use OneDrive, I don't internet search from the Start bar, and I use Edge only occasionally. But it's not like somehow you -have- to use everything they ship. I get it. An OS is personal. If you don't like Windows, use MacOS or Linux. All 3 have different approaches and one of them will fit you better than the others. Arguing over which is better or worse is like fighting over ice-cream flavors. reply k8sToGo 13 hours agorootparentYes you have to use what they ship. Because they force you to. You cannot turn off one drive nagging. You cannot turn off the start menu search. When installing windows these days you have to use a Microsoft account and so on. Yes there are work arounds, but that’s not for the average user. If I need to start tinkering and hack around in registries I might as well use Linux. reply bruce511 13 hours agorootparentI confess I don't have a Microsoft account, and installed without one. I'm not sure how I did that, I guess I just passed on it. Every month or so it after a reboot it prompts me to \"finish setting up my computer\" and I just \"remind me later\". I haven't touched the registry, so that's not in play. OneDrive doesn't nag me. As I said earlier this is all anecdotal, clearly your experience is different to mine. This post is just anecdotes, not data, and I'm not suggesting my experience is your experience. reply prmoustache 10 hours agorootparentI had to install a temporary windows 10 (not 11) install so that I can unlock the bootloader of a xiaomi phone and install a better rom.

I down voted them and you because of wild baseless assertions reply bongodongobob 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's because people fuck with the registry, run those decrapifier scripts etc. They completely mess with the guts doing nonstandard things and eventually it turns into a mess. Ask me how I know. After I started administering fleets of Windows machines, I learned that if you don't fuck with it, it's fine! If you need to make changes, use group policy. Don't like OneDrive? Don't use it! Uninstalling it is going to fuck things up. Install updates as they come. \"But it breaks things!\" No it doesn't. It only does if you've fucked your registry to hell. Just leave things alone and stop trying to customize it like a Linux box is my advice. It is what it is and will work fine if you use it the way it's intended. reply chipdart 12 hours agorootparent> Don't like OneDrive? Don't use it! Uninstalling it is going to fuck things up. OneDrive in the end is a component designed to exfiltrate documents. Wanting to remove a security vulnerability should not brick a device. Asking people to not use it is not a solution because you are prompted to send your documents over the internet to a third party every single time you save a new file. reply kstrauser 12 hours agorootparentprevIf uninstalling it breaks things, at least one of these must be true: 1. It should not be uninstallable and MS screwed up by making it so. 2. The uninstaller is broken and MS screwed up by making it so. Either path is MS’s fault, not the user’s. reply phito 11 hours agorootparentprev> Don't like OneDrive? Don't use it No, I absolutely want it off my computer.

What's worse is that you have to separate the tasks between OSes, you can't easily have a default computer for everything, with everything relevant locally available. It's fine if you keep Windows for gaming, and want gaming to be explicitly separate. It's harder if you need Windows for graphics / video, or for CAD/CAM, or for Office.

I use it to reduce procrastination. Put all your fun things on one OS (or user account), and all your business stuff on another (possibly blocking distractions via hosts or firewall rules); and you've added a bunch of friction to switching from work to play. Not that it can't be done, but it needs to be a deliberate choice and you can't just bounce between them. reply dotnet00 7 hours agorootparentI've found that this only works in very specific circumstances. If you have any flexibility to your work schedule (which is a lot more common nowadays with any amount of remote work) this becomes massively inconvenient, as every small context switch means reseting your current system state (eg closing your dev tools). I don't really have a set work schedule, so it's normal for me to jump between a work context and a play context. It's much easier to do by very rarely rebooting my computer (once or twice a month), so I can always pick up where I left off. The regularly scheduled update meetings do a good enough job of keeping procrastination in check. reply creshal 10 hours agorootparentprevIf you're careful with how you handle the ESP and other shared drives on Linux's side, I found it reasonably ergonomic to suspend to disk, rather than hard shut down, when switching between OSes.

    "originBody": "\"Devastating loss\" — Internet Archive forced to remove 500,000 books after publishers’ court win Internet Archive fans beg publishers to stop emptying the open library. Ashley Belanger - 6/21/2024, 9:42 PM Enlarge Tim MacphersonImage Source reader comments 138 As a result of book publishers successfully suing the Internet Archive (IA) last year, the free online library that strives to keep growing online access to books recently shrank by about 500,000 titles. IA reported in a blog post this month that publishers abruptly forcing these takedowns triggered a \"devastating loss\" for readers who depend on IA to access books that are otherwise impossible or difficult to access. To restore access, IA is now appealing, hoping to reverse the prior court's decision by convincing the US Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit that IA's controlled digital lending of its physical books should be considered fair use under copyright law. An April court filing shows that IA intends to argue that the publishers have no evidence that the e-book market has been harmed by the open library's lending, and copyright law is better served by allowing IA's lending than by preventing it. \"We use industry-standard technology to prevent our books from being downloaded and redistributed—the same technology used by corporate publishers,\" Chris Freeland, IA's director of library services, wrote in the blog. \"But the publishers suing our library say we shouldn’t be allowed to lend the books we own. They have forced us to remove more than half a million books from our library, and that’s why we are appealing.\" IA will have an opportunity to defend its practices when oral arguments start in its appeal on June 28. \"Our position is straightforward; we just want to let our library patrons borrow and read the books we own, like any other library,\" Freeland wrote, while arguing that the \"potential repercussions of this lawsuit extend far beyond the Internet Archive\" and publishers should just \"let readers read.\" Advertisement \"This is a fight for the preservation of all libraries and the fundamental right to access information, a cornerstone of any democratic society,\" Freeland wrote. \"We believe in the right of authors to benefit from their work; and we believe that libraries must be permitted to fulfill their mission of providing access to knowledge, regardless of whether it takes physical or digital form. Doing so upholds the principle that knowledge should be equally and equitably accessible to everyone, regardless of where they live or where they learn.\" Internet Archive fans beg publishers to end takedowns After publishers won an injunction stopping IA's digital lending, which \"limits what we can do with our digitized books,\" IA's help page said, the open library started shrinking. While \"removed books are still available to patrons with print disabilities,\" everyone else has been cut off, causing many books in IA's collection to show up as \"Borrow Unavailable.\" Ever since, IA has been \"inundated\" with inquiries from readers all over the world searching for the removed books, Freeland said. And \"we get tagged in social media every day where people are like, 'why are there so many books gone from our library'?\" Freeland told Ars. In an open letter to publishers signed by nearly 19,000 supporters, IA fans begged publishers to reconsider forcing takedowns and quickly restore access to the lost books. Among the \"far-reaching implications\" of the takedowns, IA fans counted the negative educational impact of academics, students, and educators—\"particularly in underserved communities where access is limited—who were suddenly cut off from \"research materials and literature that support their learning and academic growth.\" They also argued that the takedowns dealt \"a serious blow to lower-income families, people with disabilities, rural communities, and LGBTQ+ people, among many others,\" who may not have access to a local library or feel \"safe accessing the information they need in public.\" \"Your removal of these books impedes academic progress and innovation, as well as imperiling the preservation of our cultural and historical knowledge,\" the letter said. \"This isn't happening in the abstract,\" Freeland told Ars. \"This is real. People no longer have access to a half a million books.\" Page: 1 2 3 Next → reader comments 138 Ashley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated to tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.

Yes, almost certainly. Is it legal? No, not as the law currently stands. You can support Robin Hood, but you shouldn't be shocked when Robin Hood is caught and sent to jail. It was a mistake and a huge legal risk for IA to do this. It could easily have brought down the whole organisation, and all that they've archived to date. I wish a fraction of the people who are upset about this would actually commit a portion of their time to lobbying and organising for copyright reform. Copyright terms are too damn long, by half a century and then some. This isn't some iron law of nature, this could easily be changed if there were enough of a push for it. reply iandanforth 17 hours agoparentAre you a lawyer? Can you point to the relevant statutes? I don't ask this flippantly as there exist many forms (private / public / academic) of library which allow for both physical and digital lending of owned assets and are not subject to lawsuits like this. It's not at all obvious that IA's interpretation of the law is in error. reply troad 16 hours agorootparentThe relevant statute provision is 17 U.S.C. § 501. On March 24, 2023, the Internet Archive was found liable for copyright infringement under that section by a federal court, in an order granting a motion for a summary judgment.[0] A summary judgment means that there is no genuine dispute about facts, and the plaintiffs (the people suing the Internet Archive) are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.[1] It is your prerogative to feel that you're better qualified to interpret federal law than a federal court is, but it is fairly misleading to say that it is not at all clear what the law is here, when a court decision exists on these exact facts. Should the law be changed? Yes, in my opinion. Is there much dispute over what the law is? No, not really. [0] https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.53... [1] Other common law jurisdictions use clearer language to describe summary judgments: in the UK and Australia, for example, a summary judgment is granted when a party has \"no reasonable prospects of success\" and there is no point in going to trial. These exact words aren't used in the US, but they give a reasonable indication of how summary judgments are used in practice. None of this is legal advice. reply thefringthing 2 hours agorootparentprev> Can you point to the relevant statutes? This is about sound recordings rather than books, but one of the more insane features of US copyright law is that the copyright status of sound recordings made before 1972 is governed by state rather than federal law, and many states are thought to have no applicable statute. Some of these states determine copyright status for these works by deferring to federal law, which does not cover them. reply badlibrarian 16 hours agorootparentprevYou really don't need to be a lawyer to understand the extent to which Internet Archive really screwed up here. For starters they lost on Summary Judgment, which means they couldn't come up with a single issue of fact that the judge thought deserved a trial. Read the Order, the Judge obviously has it straight. Then check archive.org's Form 990s and see how little money they run on, how much they pissed away on legal fees so far, and also infer the amount they had to pay in damages, which was obviously very tiny. You are welcome to argue it as a matter of culture (and I'm inclined to agree and cheer you on) but from a legal perspective, Brewster should be removed and they need to find competent people to put on the board because they really did put the entire organization at risk over an idiotic decision. And the ramifications continue. Internet Archive's \"we own a copy of a book, we scan it and loan out one digital copy\" policy was already on shaky ground. When Covid hit and everyone lost their minds, letting homeless people sleep on the stairs of their building apparently wasn't enough so they just turned into The Pirate Bay and loaned out infinite copies of everything. In discovery for the case, it turned out they weren't even tracking the \"we own one copy\" part to begin with correctly. None of this should be surprising to anyone who actually attempts to use the site. The whole thing is duct tape and string. They have a tiny budget and the do amazing things with it, but it really deserves to be treated like a business and not be run like an art project. If they wanna stick your neck out and push for CDL reform, great. Just do it under a different LLC so you don't tank the 50 other important things you've got going on. And it's time for Brewster to move on. In any other non-profit he'd be gone by now. reply rwasco 16 hours agorootparentI disagree. Brewster demonstrated real courage. The world locked down u necessarily precisely because the population has not been getting smarter the past 50 years because copyright has poisoned our information wells. This is a fight worth having. It's time to abolish copyright. reply lolinder 6 hours agorootparent> This is a fight worth having. Literally everyone here has already stated that they agree with you on this. There's no controversy upthread about whether copyright law needs to be reformed, the controversy is over whether it made sense to risk the entire Internet Archive (whose most important contribution to the knowledge of mankind has nothing to do with online lending) or if it should have been fought by an organization that was built to fight it. Their instinct to help is admirable, but their lack of restraint shows a major lack of judgment and very well could have put their archives of the internet at risk. Not every nonprofit organization can do everything. reply red-iron-pine 5 hours agorootparentTo put a finer point on it, the archive is there to be an archive -- there is a lot to be done there. The EFF is there to fight battles. reply mardifoufs 14 hours agorootparentprevThere's absolutely no courage in putting that's been built and used for almost 2 decades on the line because of the wave of \"we must do something\" that was so common in March and April 2020 even when in most cases, doing nothing would've been more helpful. It would be like if Mozilla decided to stop taking any google funding overnight because they felt like their values didn't fit with Google's. Sure, it would be well intentioned. But then you also guaranteed that Firefox won't be able to exist for more than a few weeks. Deciding to unilaterally reproduce (by way of unlimited lending without the copies to back said lending) books is the legal equivalent to doing that. It would be a nice thing to have, but it's not something you get by just getting wrecked in an open and shut case in court. reply badlibrarian 15 hours agorootparentprevWhen a CEO pulls some nonsense and gets his ass handed to him in court, it's not an act of bravery, it's hubris. He set the result both you and I want back ten years by running his organization in such a sloppy manner. Even before the lawsuit they didn't keep accurate records of what they were lending, full stop. reply jzb 6 hours agorootparentprevIt may be a fight worth having, but that wasn’t the way to fight it. There was zero chance this was going to end with a favorable court decision. It only carried risk for the organization - no upside at all. reply jjmarr 13 hours agorootparentprevIf you want to fight that fight, instead of putting hundreds of thousands of books on the internet, you start with a few books and get sued over that. That way, if you lose, the actual damages are minimal. Right now, the Internet Archive could go bankrupt because of the millions of dollars in potential damages now that they've lost. Finding representative cases to fight over and create precedent is a common strategy that exposes you to less risk if you lose. reply repiret 17 hours agorootparentprevAre you aware of a form of library subject to US law that lends copyrighted digital assets without either a license from the copyright holder or legal trouble from the copyright holder? reply Dalewyn 16 hours agorootparentprev>Can you point to the relevant statutes?

Not good enough. We have frameworks for mandatory music licensing, we can do more things like that. reply mardifoufs 14 hours agorootparentShould we apply that logic to gplv3 code too? Just basically disregard the license since knowledge should be completely free? Or maybe impose some burden on the maintainers to keep the code active and constantly changed so that the codebase doesn't lose its license after an arbitrary period of time? I'm genuinely wondering , because to me there's a clear parallel yet in tech circles we almost always see defense of copyleft code (which I totally agree with, I'm extremely pro GPL) and a very heavy bias towards maintainers. I know GPL code is already free but we are talking automatically putting copyrighted/licensed material in the public domain which isn't GPL compatible. reply mlyle 13 hours agorootparent> doesn't lose its license after an arbitrary period of time? The whole thing that allows copyright in the US is in the Constitution: > To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries. The original term was 14 years, with one 14 year renewal allowed. This was probably a little short, in my opinion. 25+20 seems reasonable; most works have no commercial value after 25 years, and 45 years is already a long time to keep things that have become cultural touchstones locked up. The present legal regime of life of the author plus 70 years is clearly excessive. > but we are talking automatically putting copyrighted/licensed material in the public domain This already happens: just after an unreasonably long period of time. > which isn't GPL compatible. Code which is in the public domain is freely compatible with code under the GPL. The whole point is \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts\". Stuff kept locked away beyond its useful commercial life is no longer promoting progress (the authors have already gotten paid anything they're going to get). Indeed, most of present works borrow deeply from the public domain but the authors seek to only return the same favor to future authors in a few generations. How long should Nintendo be able to rent-seek and convince/force the same people to buy the original Super Mario Bros. over and over again? Should that be done in 2030, or 2080? What about operating systems of the 1980s-- should they be locked up to 2090, even though no one will sell them to you? At some point, there are substantial impediments to legitimate archival and research purposes; to keeping existing important systems working; and to allowing the free exploration and creativity that comes from remixing and building upon past works. reply Dylan16807 10 hours agorootparentprev> Should we apply that logic to gplv3 code too? Well the GPL code was never being sold in the first place, so these rules might not apply at all. And it's still available the same way it always has been, so that suggests no need for intervention. Alternatively it would make sense to treat source code differently from books and photos and music and movies. > lose its license after an arbitrary period of time Of course GPL code would become public domain after an arbitrary period of time, that's how public domain works. In the year 2024, why shouldn't anyone be able to reuse 1997 linux code or pieces of windows 95 in their own programs? reply lolinder 6 hours agorootparentprev> There was the recent case of the company that owns the rights to Dr. Suess choosing not to publish old versions of books they felt had racist depictions. This is actually exactly why I agree with OP. See also the changes made to Roald Dahl books. Future generations deserve to be able to read the content that their forebears produced as they produced it. I'm supportive of an author's right to not initially publish something that they at the time are uncomfortable with being made public. There should be protections for that. But once something has entered into the public consciousness in a particular form, I'm not okay with a cultural censorship wave being able to memory hole the original copy and replace it with a sanitized version (or wipe it out entirely). They shouldn't be obliged to print content that they find objectionable, but that content needs to be accessible or we lose our history. Messy and uncomfortable as it is, future generations have a right to see us as we were and are, not as the second-generation holder of our too-long copyright wishes we had been. reply cwillu 15 hours agorootparentprevAuthors should have that inalienable right, and it should not transferable via contract or any other means. Publishers, on the other hand, should have no such rights: they own the presses, their inalienable right should be to refrain from using them. reply CSMastermind 14 hours agorootparentShould I be allowed to commission a work under the understanding that I own the rights after it's created? If yes, then how do you regulate who is or is not allowed to transfer ownership of rights to or from whom? reply hmry 13 hours agorootparentThat part is already solved. Under current international law, if you commission a work then you own the economic rights, but the original author retains the moral rights. In fact, selling your moral rights is not possible. It sounds like the suggestion is that retracting / completely discontinuing a book should only be part of the moral rights, not the economic rights. I'm not sure how feasible that is, but it's not totally unprecedented. For example, one of the moral rights recognized by many countries is the right not to have your works destroyed. E.g. even if someone else owns the physical object of your painting, they are not allowed to set it on fire, and you could sue them if they did. reply vineyardmike 15 hours agoparentprev> Copyright should be \"use it or lose it.\" Which is basically how trademarks are. So we even already have a system in place to manage something like this. reply KennyBlanken 15 hours agoparentprevNo, it really isn't. That person, and you, don't understand how publishing - or mass production of any kind, it seems - works. A publisher \"stopping printing\" of a book is completely normal - books are like any other mass-produced good, in that there are fixed and variable costs to production and a factory can't economically crank out more than a certain number of different things at once. Sp, there are \"printings\" - ie a production run - and then that inventory is sold to distributors. When the inventory is sold out, it is \"out of print.\" That does not mean it's not available - there's still stock at distributors. And likely on shelves. When it sells out at distributors, then it is backordered. It is completely normal for a publisher to wait until they feel there is enough pent-up demand for another printing - increasing the size of the printing to improve per-copy profit (or make it economically viable at all), and then sell it to distributors because the distributors think they can sell the inventory at a high enough rate. Distributors don't want to keep around books that don't sell very fast, because that means they don't have warehouse space for books that do sell quickly. And if they have books that don't sell and need the warehouse space, the books might get remaindered (sold to a low-budget distributor for sale at well below original price) or destroyed (cover stripped as proof of destruction and the rest destroyed/recycled.) Things have changed with digital press technology improvements, opening the door to more print-on-demand books - but printing one copy will never be anywhere close to as cheap as printing, say, 1000 copies. There are also other reasons it might not be for sale, despite the author trying / wanting to sell it. If you know nothing about how book printing, publishing, distribution, buying, and retail works - you probably shouldn't be forming opinions on how it should be subject to radically different regulation, much less offering them up. https://pinestatepublicity.substack.com/p/book-distribution-... reply nanomonkey 15 hours agorootparentInternet Archive isn't printing books, they are lending out digital copies.

But I see the point. reply zjuventus14 12 hours agorootparentprevI mean the goal of GPLv3 and other copyleft licenses is to ensure that innovation building on the licensed work is also made available so others may continue to innovate, no? In my mind reducing copyright terms is aligned to that goal. You can disagree with that goal, but I don’t see anything inconsistent about reducing copyright terms and allowing copyleft to extend for a longer period. Even so, I think in most cases if a piece of software has been unedited for 10 years it’s either feature-complete or obsolete. If it’s been under development for those 10 years, the original version being released into the public domain probably isn’t a significant threat to innovation by way of closed source improvements being made. reply CaptainFever 12 hours agorootparentprevYes. reply mjburgess 10 hours agorootparentprevThe view across both is the same: people should be paid for their labour. So authors should be paid for the books they write. The line isnt that hard to draw. The issue here isnt the IA's provision of brand new books that are still being published; this few would say should be legal. We're talking dead authors, books no longer in print, or books published so long ago that the second-hand market (which offers no pay to the author) is the place to find them. As soon as works transition to \"second-hand markets\" we're no longer talking about the labour of the author being remunerated. At this point, it's pretty clear that it's a net benefit to society to make creative works publically available. reply CaptainFever 12 hours agorootparentprev1. Yes. 2. LLMs are an incredible step forward in humanity's progression. 3. 10 years from publishing, then public domain afterwards.

Perhaps these schemes made sense in the past but with the advent of the internet and independent groups willing to fund all hosting fees, we should move to models of publishing that do not require this restriction of information. Library genesis exists but necessarily must hide and create some friction in the discovery process. A legally unencumbered free library of all books for all people would be the greatest achievement in all of human history. We prevent this achievement due to our attachment to a specific economic system that serves as the current means of financially supporting authors. We must build alternatives to for-profit publishing, and the only resilient and widely acceptable system I can imagine is one where every community owns and controls the means of production upon which they depend for their survival. In such an economic system, the need for automation would be obvious and once implemented, all people would receive the benefits of automation. This would include such a wide allowance for leisure and free time that authors would no longer need to restrict access to their books to extract profits from their value their shared knowledge creates. All people would be free to do what they will. It would take great effort to build such a system, but open source and digital repositories of machine designs would ensure that efforts are not duplicated. The effort would still be substantial, but what hangs in the balance is the opportunity to assure the freedom of all people and the creation of the most significant repository of knowledge humanity has ever conceived of.

So, bringing food to a starving area is unlikely to be bad for business. However, the more important point is that you can surely make money off of people by becoming their only source of food/money - i.e. they would starve without you, so they accept whatever trickle of resources you deign to assign.

I'll cite a counter for you. The US was the first country in the world to eliminate the specter of famine (around 1800). Free labor was the distinguishing ingredient, not slave labor. (The slaves at the time were used to primarily farm cotton and tobacco.) The average height of Americans increased dramatically throughout the 19th century. Scores of millions of Americans arrived in America as paupers and moved into the middle class.

People may recognize the concept of mining towns, company stores, or its role in debt slavery. The practice back in those days were to advertise inflated wages for a job in remote areas. People then traveled there, only to find out that food and living costs, all under the control of the company, were also inflated to the point where even a full working day would results in debt when subtracting food and living costs. People who tried to flee was prevented from doing so under the argument that they tried to escape acquired debt. The fines for smuggling food was also extreme, since food costs was the primary way that the companies held control over their debt slaves.

Foreign miner taxes in California, often aimed squarely at Chinese immigrants, prevented them from staking mining claims, which in turn forced them to look for opportunities elsewhere. The CPRR hired an initial group of 50 Chinese workers that in short time dispelled the negative assumptions held by some CPRR managers. They fostered a reputation of strength, efficiency, and reliability. More Chinese workers would be hired and they held a variety of jobs: laborers, foremen, contractors, masons, carpenters, cooks, teamsters, interpreters, and medical professionals. Even so, racial inequalities persisted. Chinese workers were paid an average of 30% less than their white counterparts. They were segregated in work camps and had to pay for their own lodging, food, supplies, and equipment.

I don’t think they’re intentionally undercutting us they just have lower costs from decades of investment that we haven’t been doing ourselves. reply Ray20 12 hours agorootparentThere is no problem with the investments size, China had way less investments. The problem is in the amount of work and production regulations, which in some cases just doesn't exist in China. reply spywaregorilla 14 hours agorootparentprevThey're undercutting us by virtue of labor standards and other corners that we don't cut. reply coliveira 5 hours agorootparentThe USA cuts corners on labor standards for more than a century, but Europeans are Ok with that. The same logic applies, Europeans get a lot of their products and services from a country that has little to no safety nets for their workers, so by buying from USA, Europeans are funding their own demise. reply TaylorAlexander 14 hours agorootparentprevHonestly I know that used to be true, but how true is that today? Laborers in the USA don’t have great standards either. What proportion of the cost reduction comes from lower labor standards and what proportion comes from the fact that they absolutely have invested more in manufacturing than we have? I order my PCBAs from JLCPCB in China and they’re about 1/10th the cost of ordering something from the USA. But you can watch a factory tour, it’s not some horrible labor conditions it’s huge highly automated machines: https://youtu.be/jTBOSob5MLg They just invested more than we did. So maybe their labor conditions are still worse than ours, by some amount, but it’s more than just saving on labor that got their prices low. reply almatabata 12 hours agorootparentIt can be multiple things at once. They did indeed invest a lot more into manufacturing but they are also definitely using slave labor to cut on costs (see https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/02/01/china-carmakers-implicat...). Who knows as well to which extent the government funds these companies and keeps them afloat. > But you can watch a factory tour, it’s not some horrible labor conditions it’s huge highly automated machines: https://youtu.be/jTBOSob5MLg Rhetorical question but do you really believe they would be allowed to publish anything showing a human rights violation on youtube?

I’m sharing it as positive proof of the many very large highly automated high throughput machines they have! It’s clear they have invested a lot in machinery to produce their goods. Did the Chinese government help invest in that production capacity? I don’t know probably, but I think the US should be doing that too so my point that we failed to invest still stands. The point is, it’s not some evil communist plot to undercut us. They just actually invested in manufacturing and that’s what I’m trying to show with the video. Seriously click through it. There’s a lot of large high throughput automated machines there! There is no equivalent to that facility in the USA that I have ever heard of. Probably big companies like Intel have some impressive machinery but this is a job shop where anyone with $5 can place an order for PCBs. And I seriously doubt this is some North Korean style propaganda show where a bunch of slave labor is hidden behind a door. This factory is a state of the art PCB fabrication facility that gets cheap prices due to investment in capacity. They’re not cheating. They just actually invested and we’ve failed to catch up. reply coliveira 5 hours agorootparentSomehow in the West it is now an ideological crime to point out the obvious: that China has high tech industries, new technology, and scientific development.

I think they invested in manufacturing while we divested and now they’re simply reaping the rewards of those investments by producing superior or soon to be superior technology. A lot of people in the west have a vested interest in discrediting Chinese manufacturing but if we put our heads in the sand and refuse to see what is really happening they’re just going to pass us by.

When a book can be readily transformed into audiobook, or even a song, a movie and anime, a sketch, a scientific diag or anything else, how you define property in that environment? Pretty impossible. I think a useful analogy is when we lived in caves. A cave is given as is, no way to transform it, to evolve it and optimize it. As long as we found new ways to create an enclosure, then technology advancement really took off. Houses made of rocks, clay, concrete, wood started popping off everywhere. The same way with books. A printed book is not transformed to anything else really. As long as written words can be represented in a more flexible way, then they are on to the race for technology advancement. reply sneak 7 hours agorootparentprevReplicators can produce so much mass so quickly, they pose an existential threat to public health and safety.

My plan as a robotics engineer is to prove that open source robotics can be a viable industry by building open source farming robots (see my profile) so that a generation of children grow up understanding that community owned community built robotics are a perfectly viable option, and we don’t need venture capital for robotics infrastructure development. There’s a generation of adults today who grew up watching Carl Sagan’s COSMOS from 1980 and are now adults working in law to combat climate change - a major call to action in his show the fruits of which Sagan would never live to see.

Just as I am working on open source robotics for farming, I encourage other people to contribute to open culture so that we can some day build a better world.

The physical restrictions in a library - ala, only 1 person could read it at a time - is what prevents publishers from trying to charge more or prevent it. The basic issue is that if a library is filled with electronic books, the publishers will stand to lose a lot of profit. Now I'm not arguing that they deserve this profit, but there's no good model so far that both preserves the profit motive, but also make available the copyrighted material digitally and unrestrictedly. Perhaps there could be a form of library \"fee\" that is funded by tax payers, in a similar way to how public radio gets funded.

I don't have any good answer. reply ysavir 4 hours agorootparentThe problem here isn't that we need to find a way to compensate authors for their work, it's that people can't survive without compensation, so writing for the sake of writing, without compensation, often isn't viable. If we had some form of universal income, or other form of distribution of goods such that people didn't need to labor for a living (at least not with the current US norm of 40-50 hours a week), then it would be much more practical to say that all books are free for mass consumption. Then authors can write not for compensation, but for the pleasure of writing and knowing their works will be appreciated. And writers with a famous profile, who want the spoils of compensation, can be sponsored/patronized, like artists in the Renaissance. reply Dylan16807 10 hours agorootparentprevI don't have a full plan, but I know exactly where I'd start: A scheme where you lend each copy you own to one person at a time and don't use it yourself, with them deleting the loaned copy at the end, and with a reasonably large granularity like \"1 day\", needs to be legal.

That doesn't scale to the entire populace, and there's no good justification for subsidizing this group and not others. UBI, on the other hand, is entirely feasible, not least of which because it ditches the completely infeasible \"at their current salary\" in favor of \"enough to live, not enough that most people won't want more\". And you'd create substantial growth via startups and other creative endeavors. UBI gives everyone the option to try experiments that might not pay off right away. reply geysersam 12 hours agorootparentA reason for subsiding this group but not others is that our economic system is so bad at utilizing the potential of their work. It's literally free to distribute all books/newspapers/magazines to all people in the world. Why aren't we? It's common to have state intervention in markets that are unable to utilize resources efficiently on their own. About UBI, sure!

    "commentBody": "Language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought [pdf] (gwern.net)351 points by hardmaru 14 hours agohidepastfavorite270 comments benrutter 12 hours agoIt absolutely melts my mind every time I come across the two facts that: - People experience their thoughts very differently - We all secretly believe that deep down, everyone experiences thought like we do. I've never really had a strong internal monologue when thinking, so my assumption would always be that of course, thinking isn't very linguistic (even if we can use it as a tool while thinking). It seems like there's a large number of people who experience their thought exclusively as language. That sounds absolutely nuts to me, but I've heard people say the exact same in reverse. Even more fringe is that there's a sizable number of people who when thinking about words (i.e. remembering names) visualize their words as text. What!? I can't imagine that anymore than I can imagine how a jellyfish feels? The University of Wisconsin did a cool study that comes with a fun quiz you can do to see just how much of a wierdo you truly are: https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3NMm9yyFsNio... reply ecjhdnc2025 5 hours agoparentThe question about visualising three dimensional objects is fascinating to me. Because my answer has changed radically in the last five or so years, and I'm not a young person! I used to consider myself 3D-impaired -- unable to maintain and rotate a 3D image in my head, which also made 3D software frustrating. (I also have, it turns out, some binocular vision issues and some other mild cognition weirdness). But a few years back I started on a hobby project, and I started to assemble my own DIY kit (because the commercial stuff is too expensive). To do that I had a lot of mental puzzles to try to solve. Then I decided the best way forward was a 3D printer so I tried to find 3D tools that would work for me on even a basic level -- OpenSCAD, CadQuery, FreeCAD etc.; as many different ways to approach the problem as would shed light on ways to think about it. I'm no longer really an OpenSCAD person but once my first successful models came out of my printer, my brain was changed forever, and now I visualise mechanisms in my head. (One of the most powerful things I have learned about how to imagine any man-made, real world object, is to imagine the tools making it.) reply haswell 5 hours agorootparentAs someone with Aphantasia, this is fascinating to me. There have been other aphantasics who report gaining the ability to visualize after mental exercises, and what you’re describing sounds somewhat similar. No luck for me yet, but I’m really interested in the idea that I could actually learn these skills… reply dinkleberg 5 hours agorootparentThis is such an interesting topic. I believe I also have aphantasia and I find that communicating about the topic is rather challenging as the right vocabulary doesn't seem to exist (or I'm ignorant of it). I have no \"mind's eye\" and can't produce an image in my head. But confusingly, I am quite good at the mental 3D manipulation. I can spin the cow in my head and describe its orientation, but I don't actually see the cow, I just know it. I suppose my brain just has a different way of approaching this problem than visually. This is where the language is tough. I'm not visualizing or imagining as those words describe the act of using a mental image. I'm perceiving the cow? It is hard to communicate. reply ecjhdnc2025 4 hours agorootparent> I find that communicating about the topic is rather challenging as the right vocabulary doesn't seem to exist (or I'm ignorant of it). Right. This is enormously challenging in itself. And I think because nobody talks about it, it's possible, or maybe the default, to assume that you're simply broken in an obvious, universal way, and not that there might be variation or even routes to change your outcomes with metacognition or thought experiments. What often comes up is stuff like \"oh I thought 'the mind's eye' was just a figure of speech, I had no idea people meant it in a meaningful sense\" reply klyrs 1 hour agorootparentprevI have a form of aphantasia, but with that lack of visuals I also have a rich internal sense of touch. Like you, I can create and manipulate 3d objects in my mind; I really feel them down to texture and temperature (and I must say, that cow has textures I didn't want to feel, thanks for nothing) Most of my dreams are like this too -- I know where everything is, but I don't see it. But my aphantasia isn't complete. Sometimes when I think of a person I get a dim image of their face for about a tenth of a second. And very rarely, I do see things in dreams. reply andrewflnr 4 hours agorootparentprevNow that is fascinating. It's like you have blindsight for your mind's eye. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight reply LoganDark 4 hours agorootparentprevYou're deriving the cow. You don't see the cow, but you know things logically about the cow, and you can describe it just as well as would someone who does see it. But you are not, and don't need to be, actually seeing the cow. reply scarmig 3 hours agorootparentA while back, I did an experiment: drawing a typing keyboard. It's something I see and use every day, so it should be easy, right? Well, I was able to, but it didn't come from first principles or even visualizing it. It came from imagining myself at a keyboard and \"simulating\" typing. In my mind's body, I would type a sentence, which enabled me to extract the location of the keys, which I could then translate into part of the visual sketch on paper. The initial sketch came out with key sizes and shapes heavily distorted, but all of them spatially located in the correct relative horizontal ordering, and a second sketch made it possible to regularize them. Not sure what it means, but it was an interesting exercise. reply ecjhdnc2025 4 hours agorootparentprevThe weird thing obviously is that next to nobody with a mind's eye is actually seeing the cow. A tiny tiny fraction of people talk about their mind's eye being part of their visual field, to the point that they can sort of functionally see -- hallucinate -- an imaginary object on a table like AR. Another small number of people talk about imagining complete objects out of nowhere that they then have to analyse to describe; the imaginary thing has complete shape before its shape is described. Most children can sort of whimsically play the imaginary-drinking tea game, imagining the shape of the teacups, imagining spilling tea or milk, but the mental images might not have attributes like colour or weight until they are specifically assigned to the visualisation. Like: what colour are the teacups? They don't have colour until you pick one, and then they do. Is it a heavy cup? It's not, but I do have a saucer. The more you add to the visualisation, the less translucent/ghostly/formless/conceptual it is. The fascinating thing about broad aphantasia is that it appears to be way beyond even that; it's like things only happen conceptually, yet they still happen. Like the sibling comment from andrewflnr perceptively said: as if it's a conceptual blind-sight. And when you consider our evolutionary pathway, perhaps it actually is the same phenomenon: a part of the brain successfully doing part of the task, without the support of the visualiser. reply kaashif 3 hours agorootparent> Another small number of people talk about imagining complete objects out of nowhere that they then have to analyse to describe; the imaginary thing has complete shape before its shape is described. But this is different from the kids tea party. I can easily pretend to hold a teacup without closing my eyes and visualizing a teacup, I don't think one has anything to do with the other. If you ask someone to actually imagine seeing a teacup but what they're imagining doesn't have a colour or size, _what are they imagining_? reply jodrellblank 2 hours agorootparentIf I cover your eyes and put a teacup on your open palm so you can't see the colour or feel the size, _what are you holding_? I'm imagining a teacup - made of china, decorated in some way, capable of holding a few mouthfulls of ~75C thin liquid, smaller than a big mug, larger than a shot glass, with a handle sizes for the tip of one finger, delicate, ceremonial; concept space constrained to broadly teacup-ish area. But not a specific teacup unless it becomes important whether it's a plainer heavy duty cafe teacup or a grandma's Royal Jubilee promotional teacup. reply ecjhdnc2025 4 hours agorootparentprevOK so -- on this score. I have, I believe, a kind of partial aphantasia. Though maybe it's normal and people just don't really see the distinction? I used to think -- until maybe ten years ago -- that I could not imagine the faces of friends and loved ones. That is, if I try to visualise a person's face, I get an incomplete glimpse in my mind that dissolves away within an instant. (People in my dreams do not really have detailed faces, if I can ever really look at their faces at all; it's like I don't make eye contact. Though they are not face-less horrors.) This has been distressing, particularly when my mum died. But then I discovered two really interesting things: 1) I can sometimes imagine a \"still\" face if I visualise a photograph of that person (maybe only slightly more if I took it) 2) I can bring someone's face to mind much more successfully if I associate it with an emotion or an action, and once I've done that, as long as I keep them in motion I can visualise a lot more for longer. A quarter of a century after she died, if I want to remember my mum, it's a real challenge. She hated being in photos so there aren't many. But it's possible to start by imagining her angry (sorry mum) or the annoyed look on her face when she was trying to solve a puzzle game on the computer. Then I might be able to keep her face in my mind for long enough. My dad passed away a couple of years back and for this loss I was ready; I have some photos, but more importantly I had spent the previous years learning his face experiencing different emotions. My favourite route to imagining my Dad's face is to imagine a situation where he might show puzzled, half-smiling amusement or fascination when presented with something he didn't understand or didn't work quite the way he expected. I will be able to recall his face in motion, just as my face starts to leak around the eye sockets :-/ So on the one hand: even now I can't visualise still faces at all! I struggle to describe faces of people I don't really know well. As soon as a face is still, it goes. On the other hand, I have taught myself a visualisation process that can conjure up meaningful animated recollections that are filled with emotion. I have to do it deliberately, but it's lovely to do. One final quirk: despite all this, I appear to potentially be a super-recogniser. I can't visualise a still face, but I do not \"forget a face\"; I can tell you with eerie accuracy whether I've seen someone before and where. And I do rather well with the \"which of these faces did you see in this clip\" type test, and very well at the tests like \"which of these faces is this face from another angle\". reply haswell 2 hours agorootparentThis is all extremely interesting. I also struggle to remember faces, and most of my are tied to emotions, sounds, smells, sensations, etc. When I recall something/someone, I don't see it/them, I just \"know\" + feel. And I find myself very easily fooled by subtle changes in a person's appearance. If someone gets a major haircut or changes their hair color, they might as well be a different person to my brain, initially. reply emiliobool 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is very interesting, when I was a kid I didn’t think with words but with “abstract” ideas. When I realized every other kid used language for thinking I tried to do it myself and not only I was able to do it, but it never stopped after that. Now I probably think 90% with language, but I’ve been trying to practice other forms of thought recently. reply endofreach 11 hours agoparentprevOften times i can actively feel how laggy my brain is in wrapping the thoughts in language. Before i even have the words ready, my thinking is already way ahead at the next thought. Not sure if that's just ADHD. I like to think secretly it's because i am not too dumb and actually a quick thinker. On the other hand, my analytical thinking is not that good. While i enjoy the process of thinking about things alone for hours, when presented with problems like in school or sometimes even today when someone gives me a riddle, i can also very strongly feel that i am not \"thinking\" actively. I am just thinking that i should think and often seem to make myself appear as if i was thinking – and that's it. It feels a lot like \"fake it till you make it\". Often times i have ideas other people call \"brilliant\" as well, or i seem to have s lot of refreshing takes on things according to others (stated to hide my weirdly self-conscious arrogance), it's not that i actively pursue it. I sometimes feel like i am standing on the piazza, waiting for this beautiful thought to walk past me. Too scared to talk to it, because she would realize i am too dumb to understand her and a con-artist anyway... but then, every once in a while this beautiful thought turns around and takes over my brain. But maybe, i am truly just mad. reply orwin 9 hours agorootparentI'm clearly not in your exact case, but having idea before the words to express it happen to me too (less the more i grow old tbh, when i was in my early twenties it was almost everytime, nowadays it is a bit more limited to subjects i know deeply). It usually end up with my tongue tied and having to take a deep breath and reformulate everything since the beginning with a better exposition plan. One thing that help is improv theater and pen and paper role play game, because you don't only have to thin about your idea, but how you are going to deliver it, and this is true in professional settings too. Doing that slow down my thought just enough to be clear. Hopefully this advice works for you too [edit] You aren't mad reply ulkis 8 hours agorootparentprevI recognize this \"thinking the thoughts twice\", and sometimes feel that the \"fast\" thoughts have to wait for the slow ones (language wrapping) to catch up. Then I try to skip the second phase and let the fast ones roam at full speed, expecting brilliancy. Never succeeded yet, but not giving up. reply Agentus 5 hours agorootparentprevFunny all the criticism LLMs get for hallucinations/conflabulations as if humans aren't often worse offenders at this very behavior unintentionally or intentionally. I think you're not mad, but rather demonstrate a learned behavior to a very common situation any person finds themself in. IE they don't know or aren't sure if they don't know and any case don't want to appear as if they don't know certainly so they put in the least amount of effort to obscure ascertaition with some fancy distracting magicians hoodwink. I think getting answers to nuanced/frontier or non-frontier problems can involve different sets of brain processes and behaviors. For already solved problems with knowledge thats pervasive throughout society, the solution is simply observation and copying, OR recollection and re-execute from memory. For other problems one can figure out through reasoning and extrapolation. For other problems no amount of armchair reasoning and theorizing will figure out (frontier problems not yet solved by any humans or at least humans accessible ) it, and they will need to do some trial and error exploration within reality on the path to solving a problem. Thinking in language, recalling by search and retrieval isn't going to find a solution to the problem at hand in these situations, but humans will try and jam the square peg into the circular hole especially if thats easier to do (and it is) than expending a lot more trial and error energy to do reality based experiements instead of pure clean easy brain processes of keyword/descriptor search and retrieval. Search and retrieval with or without words is a very quick and easy brain process, perhaps anything you do that solely involve those brain processes you perform excellently at. Not all problems solely rely on these process such as analyzing new unsolved puzzles put on your doorstep. Perhaps there's a habitual behavior where you're trying to over-rely on the quick processes and doing the magicians trick to obscure the lack of actual solution with the hopes of retaining social standing. Instead of slowing things down attempting the slow bog down of actually finding the problem while communicating as such OR making use of human language for its actual purpose and networking for someone who has already solved the problem and deferring to their authority. But all and all humans collectively are driven to collect (no, hoard greedily) solutions to problems at or not at the frontier and incorporate/encode those into their brain in a way that the solutions can be searched and retrieved in an efficient reflex like manner that's conducive to your ADHD speed. I suck at language but am good at analytical stuff and because of that I'm not going to put any more effort into reducing this lengthy TLDR literature rambling into a concise conducive to reading snippet. My apologies to those that don't skip over this and trudge through this Thesis length reading. reply nikster 7 hours agorootparentprevDo your Human Design profile and see how much it fits. Our society expects everyone to be a Generator (in HD terms) - all people who are not then feel like they're totally weird. In reality, they're just wired differently, and have other strengths and weaknesses. Humanity is like a big puzzle piece. As someone who never was into astrology, Human Design was a shock. I didn't want to even consider that idea at all, but as I got my design read by someone I never met, and it matched 95% of what I already knew about myself, I had to admit that it just fits. And so it is for most people - it fits. Whereas astrology always was a lame 50/50 \"could be true or not true\" kind of thing. HD is different. For example I have open head centers - in HD this means I take in thoughts from others and get carried away with them; I also have an easy time to still my mind and have no inner dialogue. And in my life I had already observed if I am talking to someone who is genuinely really excited about something, I get excited about it too - to the point where I am joining their project or decide to buy a book etc - but when they leave and it wears off I am thinking... \"wait... why was that so exciting again?\"... Now I know how to watch it, and how to distinguish their emotions and thoughts from mine, very useful skill. reply kriro 7 hours agorootparentHuman Design seems like unscientific babbling to me. First of all the connection to astrology should already be a huge red flag and it mixes random stuff and magically we come up with four personality types (then later a fifth one is \"discovered\"). Shockingly these can be arranged into exactly twelve profiles. It may be surprising to you but as someone who is well read in mentalism I can fairly confidently tell you that a 95% match is not hard to fabricate in readings. Admittedly is the area of mentalism I don't perform but I have read plenty of theory. Your HD reading was probably based on Barnum statements/cold reading. If you're interested to learn more about this I'd suggest \"The Full Facts Book of Cold Reading\" by Ian Rowland. For a more fun exercise, get a reading at a medieval fair or from some \"medium\" (please don't pay a lot) and compare it to your HD reading. reply jahsome 6 hours agorootparentI had never heard of Human Design until now. It looks like absolutely maddening junk to me. To each their own but nonsense pulp like that is just about the exact opposite of what draws me to hn, and avoid almost all other forms of social media. Full disclosure: I loathe astrology, to a disproportionate and somewhat irrational extent. Thanks for the book rec though.

Could have to do with exposure to sunlight during early days or whatever.

Well, it depends on the degree which we require it to define you. In a looser degree, it would define most people quite a lot. Put another way your \"place of birth\" alone, would be a huge information point towards predicting lots of things about someone vs someone from another place of birth, given they're different enough (say, India vs Italy, not Spain vs Portugal or Germany vs Austria). If betting and money was involved about e.g. income, wealth level, studies or not, food preferences, religion, politics, morals, and so on, knowing the place of birth would be a great boon (all other information being equally shared). Repeated many times with different people, you'd be correct way more. >i.e. you'd need to know \"people born around this date in this place tend to have whatever human design\" in order to provide me actual predictions based on only date and place of birth, but no such data has ever been collected.

Yes you do. In order to make an educated guess, you'd have to know, given where they were born, whether that place is more likely to produce certain traits or not. You could then use that information to make your guess about how likely they are to possess those certain traits, having been born there. But without any information on how likely those traits actually are for people born there, knowing where they were born grants you nothing. > It's common knowledge. It's not common knowledge what my Human Design type would be given only when and where I was born. That's the whole point I'm trying to make. Astrology or not, the entire idea of giving me an answer solely based on when and where I was born, will always be bogus. Now, if they had an actual dataset of the Human Design types of people from all around the world, and wanted to correlate me with that, then maybe I'd be inclined to give it a try, just out of curiosity. But I'm not even the slightest bit curious about bogus astrology (or any other types of divination). I'd be glad to take a personality test, for example, because they ask actually relevant questions. Just not this. > And in some cases where this changes over time, the data of birth would also come in handy. E.g. in the tendency of a random London citizen to have say South Asian features in 2024 vs 1950. I'm not arguing against correlating this with other data. The entire point is that one needs to correlate it with other data in order for my answer to be at all useful, and what I have a problem with is that correlation is not being done.

I apparently am about as high as you can likely get a percentile score to go for the number of questions here on inner voice and representational manipulation, and as low as possible on mind's eye and orthographic representation The inner voice and mind's eye don't surprise me, I'm among the more hyperlexic people I know and seem to have total aphantasia, but I didn't realize (though I guess it seems like an obvious possibility in retrospect) that there were people who processed words as text in their head - I guess the survey itself said that surprised them too. I also didn't consider that there could be a large degree of variability in representational manipulation, and assume that this kind of inevitably leads to some pretty hard to bridge inferential gaps when speaking across that divide. Honestly maybe I'm misunderstanding what's meant by that, because the other extreme sounds to me like there are some people who just can't do metacognition which sounds insane. I'm guessing however that this is similar to an experience I had with a (now ex-)lover who was shocked when I mentioned I don't have visualization, and asked \"So you're telling me you have no imagination at all?\", which like, I wouldn't say is true? My imagination can be prosaic, narrative, auditory, abstract, olfactory, emotional, or kinematic, just not visual. I kind of assume that's similar to what I'm doing here, like whatever \"manipulating representations\" means here is a useful capability by which to do metacognition but not the thing itself... but it seemed like their questions pertained to a lot of different kinds of manipulation of abstractions or mental models, so I can't really figure out how you'd examine your thoughts per se without that ability. Maybe there's someone more knowledgeable about this field here that could help me understand the distinction? reply wruza 9 hours agorootparentHow does one even get high inner voice score there? I dialogue in my head all the time and answered “sa” to most of the inner voice questions, but fell on the far left side on that graph. Feels like other questions subtract from it silently. Instead I got high score in object rotation which I can do easily but it isn’t my main mode of thinking. I usually think abstractions and/or speak myself into convincing they are good enough. I probably failed due to this agree/disagree test laziness. You never know what they meant by things like “I often enjoy X”. What does strongly disagree mean here? Never? I don’t enjoy? What if I don’t enjoy it, but do often? Why not ask it directly like “I X: never sometimes often” or “I relate to X: hare it … love it”. Even then it’s unclear what “sometimes” means. Once in a year, in a month, in a day? This indirection and vagueness adds so much noise to the result. I guess all this tells how I think more than the test itself. reply advael 9 hours agorootparentWeird, based on the wording of the questions and the categories they presented I kind of just assumed that each question only pertained to one of them. If they're doing something more complex I didn't notice it. But maybe they have some baked in assumptions that some of these modalities are like, mildly anticorrelated? That's the thing that kinda irked me about psychology when I was studying it more seriously. The epistemic integrity of psychological research reads to me as basically castles built on sand, where people get excited about results that seem super weakly supported based on reading the paper, which is often itself laden with a ton of assumptions that don't seem justified, but people who cite them just take the conclusions the authors drew as established, build their own studies with those assumptions baked in, ad nauseum. I was not shocked at all when the replication crisis hit this field as hard as it did, and since the issue is often in the way the hypotheses are operationalized in the first place, there are inherently going to be tons of flawed studies that are hard to even detect through the heuristic of replicability. As far as the Likert scale nonsense, I am right there with you, all these psychological instruments are pretty poorly framed from my perspective, and while there's some discourse deep in academia about the rigor of various experimental methodologies even in the most broken of social sciences, in practice they don't seem to care much because it's publish or perish baby! It really doesn't seem like most sciences are quite this broken, though some are clearly trying. Obviously there are people in psychology trying to do good rigorous science, it seems like institutional pressures are not working to support them, and certainly won't amplify rigor over making bold claims that get a lot of press Like, all this to say that it's definitely worth taking these things with a massive grain of salt, but if you do that, it can still be pretty interesting. reply hifromwork 7 hours agorootparentprev>Interesting test.

I'm constantly talking to myself in my head as if I'm talking to a duplicate of myself. Asking questions, providing answers, having full back and forward conversations (especially with programming). There are certainly days though where, if you have a lot going on, you can start to burn yourself out with conversation (since every single action of the day comes with a conversation). Even if it's just \"Oh I should make a coffee. Did I have a coffee yet? No, I think you had one this morning. What about if I made one anyway. Yeah I think that would be fine. Oh do I need to boil water? I suppose I should check if the water is hot. Yep looks like I do have to boil some\". and after a while you just get sick of talking to yourself.

You are melting chocolate and somebody suggests adding basil, you can vividly imagine how that would taste before trying it. 4.

I have the same experience of being \"unable to stop thinking\". Are you by any chance neurotypical, or close to neurotypicality? My impression is that neurotypical brains have a higher degree of synchronization than autistic brains, which would make suppressing thought easier. I'm autistic, and I don't just have thoughts; they have themselves. Thoughts just spontaneously come into existence, and just think on their own. I can think about them myself, but only by picking up existing thoughts. Thoughts come into existence whether I intend them to or not, so it is not possible for me to suppress them. On one paw, the fact that thoughts seemingly think about themselves allows me to fit a lot of logic in my head at once without getting overwhelmed. But on the other, being unable to control which thoughts are in my head can be really infuriating. reply anon373839 6 hours agorootparent> I have the same experience of being \"unable to stop thinking\". I am doubtful that anyone can truly stop thinking. But people can have more or less awareness of their thoughts, and they can be having thoughts that they don’t consider to be thoughts. For example, if you notice that your shirt is wet, that is a thought even if you don’t “think” anything about it. I haven’t personally tried one, but I believe the purpose of a sensory deprivation tank is to create an environment where your thoughts are unavoidable. reply LoganDark 6 hours agorootparent> But people can have more or less awareness of their thoughts, and they can be having thoughts that they don’t consider to be thoughts. Yes, that is my experience. If I try not to have thoughts, then what happens is not that thoughts stop happening, it's that I stop noticing them until they're more fully developed. This \"not noticing\" results in a relative lack of remarks upon those thoughts, but the thoughts themselves are not made of or depending on language. They just are things. Technically, they are \"derived meaning\". When on psychedelics I can have thoughts that not only don't depend on language, but don't have language. It's not possible to describe them because they represent indescribable things. It's possible to feel them and interact with them in a way that seems to makes sense to me, but it's not possible to communicate them. If I try, they can actually result in words being generated, but those words sound like a bad phone autocomplete - stuff like \"can have a haves and take a three sixteenth quarters\" (real excerpt from a past trip). (My guess is that my brain has some sort of internal format that real-world concepts are translated into in order to be operated on. That's the \"meaning\" that gets derived. I wonder if psychedelics allow me to create or perceive meanings that no real-world concept would ever actually translate into, and therefore don't have any way to communicate as a real-world concept.) > I am doubtful that anyone can truly stop thinking.

My own thinking on this has been to consider the origins of language. In a community of hominins on the verge of developing a language, would they not need, as a prerequisite, some non-linguistic ability to consciously grasp that at least some of the vocalizations of their peers represented feelings that they recognized in themselves? But that, by itself, would not be enough for them to develop a language; in addition, I feel, it would take both a desire to communicate their thoughts and feelings to others (motivated in part, I would guess, by recognizing that it would be useful to do so) and the recognition that this might be accomplished through artificial sounds and/or gestures with arbitrarily-allocated yet specific meanings. I feel that there's a bootstrap problem in regarding language as primarily a means of thinking that was found to be useful in communicating. Like you (and, apparently, the survey compilers) I am surprised to learn that a sizable minority of people report frequently visualizing words as text. On reflection, however, that sounds somewhat like a form of synesthesia, and I occasionally get enough of a hint of that to put it just barely in range of my personal experience - but then, I don't regard people whose experiences differ markedly from mine as wierdos. reply gvurrdon 9 hours agoparentprevThat test was indeed interesting.

An interesting bit is that this internal jukebox is actually playing faster than real time, even though it sounds absolutely correct and natural in my mind and definitely not as if it was a 1.2~1.5x play rate that would give this funny \"Benny Hill effect\"; so when I perform the song at the time scale that I hear it it is clearly too fast (higher BPM) to outside observers or when compared to an original recording. It's as if my experience of mind-time is skewed vs real time so I've developed a bunch of coping strategies like padding (e.g making every beat having a \"late by ~x\" feeling), forceful downclocking (some sort of detached zen mode where I let go of the internal clock, which gives a very surreal feeling of perceiving the world), or active continuous ratio compensating (sort of like the world is going at 0.8x compared to my reference clock so remapping makes it sort of bullet-timesque) Socially it's all very disconnecting and exhausting. reply cableshaft 5 hours agorootparentprevI have the internal audio.

The experience of thought differs from brain to brain. For example, autistics generally experience thought differently from neurotypicals. This happens, in part, because autistics have a different distribution of synaptic connections, which are shorter on average than is neurotypical. This typically results in an experience of disorganized thought, where multiple different parts of the brain contain independent thought, because there aren't enough connections directly between them to enforce synchronization. There are enough localized connections to allow general thoughts to happen and be operated on, but they are exactly that; localized. Detail-oriented thinking is another well-known side effect of this, because each individual detail can easily be fit somewhere without being lost in the \"big picture\". Autistics are usually who you'll find sweating details that most people wouldn't necessarily care about, but they're also who you'll find sometimes getting lost in those details rather than sticking to a single clear vision. Neurotypicals, on the other paw, can miss those details if the picture as a whole looks okay to them, but they also usually won't get stuck on them in the process of executing their vision. Note that every person is different, whether autistic or non-autistic, so there are autistics who are good at thinking in terms of the big picture and neurotypicals who are good at considering every detail. The fact that the physical mode of thinking differs doesn't necessarily mean that another can't be emulated - it just means that even if two people appear to be doing or thinking the same thing, the way it's actually implemented \"in hardware\" (meatware?) can differ greatly depending on neurotype, even from autistic to autistic and neurotypical to neurotypical, as the brain has no single switch between fully autistic and fully neurotypical. Some of the statements in this comment are based on my personal experience as an autistic, some are based on anecdotes from others, and some are based on this article: https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-disorganized-thoughts/ I've been informed that the author of the article doesn't generally do good work, but I've personally reviewed the article and believe it to still be sufficiently accurate. Additionally, this particular description of autistic disorganized thought is what originally tipped me off to the fact that the way I think is different from others. If you're not autistic and/or it doesn't describe you, please know that it perfectly describes me, which should be enough to understand how exactly the experience of thought can differ from brain to brain. Also, psychedelics can significantly change one's mode of thinking. I use them recreationally from time to time.

And I do need to do that step - the conclusion doesn't seem \"stable\" unless I trace it back like this. reply grugagag 6 hours agorootparent>I reach conclusions by feel That sounds like intuition to me reply Jensson 4 hours agorootparentWords are also based on the same intuition, you just verbalize it and restrict yourself to what you have words for instead of all concepts and thoughts. For example I do math entirely without any words in my process, and I easily got a master in math that way, barely had to study. No problem, you just translate it at the end. Limiting myself to words just makes it harder to think freely. reply mewpmewp2 3 hours agorootparentThat just sounds so different to how I solve math problems. I was naturally good at maths, but it was always from monologue kind of bruteforcing different solutions until one of them seemed to work. I guess it might be a reason also why I find LLMs really exciting since I feel like if I can do it, LLM should be able to do it. I don't feel like I am doing anything special. I always had problem with trusting my intuition or gut so I was worse in a lot of other real life things however. But math seemed abstract and solvable by words and brute force. I wish things just magically came to me, but I think I always have to go through things with my inner monologue. Like if I was to do multiplication in my head e.g. with same numbers, for example 62 x 62. I would have to go through it as a monologue. I first remind myself of the strategy to do it, which is first I will do 60 x 60. Then it is 3600, then I add 2 x 60, 3720, and then there is 2 x 62 left, but I have to keep reminding myself occasionally what the last numbers were, that initial multiplication was 62 x 62, then I got 3720, and now I have to add 124... okay lets go 3820, 24 left, now 3844. Of course it is easier to remember as I am typing this, but in my head I have to keep reminding myself. And now I am not sure if I did a mistake so I go verify that on the calculator. reply Jensson 3 hours agorootparent> I first remind myself of the strategy to do it, which is first I will do 60 x 60.

I do multiplication in my head similarly, just strip out the words, the numbers just flickers through and operations happens by themselves and I'm done in a second or two when I'm not rusty. Now that I'm rusty I do it more like (60x60=3600, 2x2=4, 60x2=120, 3600 + 4 + 120 + 120 = 3844), without doing any words, I just did that in my head right now and I am 100% sure not a single word, just the steps, I do sometimes verbalize the numbers so what I wrote in those parentheses is the most verbal my process for mathing that out gets. Edit: Looking at that, I think it might be easier for someone to correct your thinking if you think in words, but thinking without words is way faster and way more creative since it removes the restriction of only thinking about concepts you have words for. Edit2: I think your verbalization there is a ritual for the concepts to get to you. For me all I need to do is see 62x62 and imagine I want to solve it and all those thoughts flow to me automatically, basically a shortcut instead of having a large verbal ritual to piece together the concepts. I never did math verbally the way it is taught, so I am not sure how people think that way, to me this was always automatically this way. reply RaftPeople 2 hours agorootparentprev> That is thinking slow for you?? How do you reach conclusions or how do you know the reasons why you reached the conclusion? Are you thinking that using words during thinking helps with reaching conclusions and knowing why you reached the conclusion?

This explains why I read slower when I read in English. reply globular-toast 11 hours agorootparentprevNot OP but I also don't think with an internal monologue most of the time. For me it's often more like mentally manipulating abstract shapes or quantities and trying to make them fit together. When I'm writing software I'm literally thinking about pointers and bytes etc, not thinking about the words \"pointer\" and \"byte\". This is highlighted by the fact that after intense programming sessions I have dreamed about code, like I am computer memory and I'm being allocated by a memory manager or something. Sometimes I do explicitly think with an internal monologue, though. Like if I'm debugging something I'll sometimes narrate what the program is doing in words. Also if I'm trying to figure out how some event happened I'll try to tell a story in my mind. It helps then as it forces me to serialise things. When I read there is sometimes an internal monologue. When I write, there isn't. I don't talk like this. I think it's quite clear sometimes when people write with an internal monologue as their text reads like speech (which can be a good or bad thing, depending on its purpose). reply 4ad 10 hours agorootparentprevI don't have an internal monologue at all (I am able to speak to myself in my head if I want to, but I seldom have a reason to). When I read, the information just gets uploaded to my brain. I don't vocalize words in any way, silently or otherwise. I don't read one word at a time either. When I read something quickly I can \"feel\" that my understanding of the material is lagging \"the cursor\", sometimes by even a paragraph at a time. reply fnord77 4 hours agoparentprev> People experience their thoughts very differently I don't see how we could possibly know this. reply api 2 hours agoparentprevLook at how different we are from each other.

What I would rather say is that everyone starts with the expectation that they share thought with others. There is overwhelming empirical evidence that people can tell when others think like them. Not everybody treats this indicator the same way. Some are fascinated when others think differently. Some get uncomfortable when they can't tell what another is thinking or feeling. I'm sure not everyone understands why there can be others that don't think like them. To a simple mind, it might just seem like there's something wrong with them or that they have unaligned goals/interests; you actually can see that assumption from certain neurotypicals. (I don't know if it's truly specific to neurotypicals.) However, it is possible not to believe, even secretly, that everyone experiences thought the same; I certainly don't.

Not a universal law. I don’t think I work in the same way as other people at all, as I cannot see what is obvious to others, and they cannot see what is obvious to me. I don’t think, per se, the information and the integrated results of information are just there. People call it “intuition” but it isn’t some magical sixth sense, it’s just not using one’s language centre for compute, which is what many seem to do. The moment I start consciously considering something, it all usually goes to hell - so a large part of how I operate is preventing myself from lapsing into “conscious thought”, and instead to keep whatever it is just below the surface until it’s cooked. I infuriated teachers throughout my childhood by apparently paying zero attention but then inexplicably having the correct answer to whatever was posed to me, and have never quite related to other people, as it usually feels like I’m trying to bridge an immense gap of comprehension - not, to be clear, that I think other people are stupid - just more like I am running fundamentally different software, and everything has to go through an extensive translation and abstraction layer to make sense to others. If I speak my thoughts directly, then they often emerge as allegory, as it’s the only way I can try to encapsulate the otherwise rather inchoate froth of connection which leads to a result. Sometimes others understand the allegory, but more often than not, they do not, as the symbols mean something else to them. So yeah. I don’t think my mind works like most other people I encounter. The only other person I know who I think operates in the same way is my sibling, and people who have observed our conversations find them downright bizarre. They sound like beat poetry half the time, as with five well chosen words presenting the correct allegory we can transmit deep meaning to one another. reply medstrom 10 hours agorootparentI don't automatically do what you describe, but I've had good experiences with it: \"preventing myself from lapsing into conscious thought\". Especially in how I experience ADHD, if I just wait for my subconscious to cook up something for me, it's a good trick for seeing past the weeds to what is actually relevant today, here and now. reply ay 7 hours agorootparentprevThis feels to me very similar to my experience - I tend to joke that in order to express a thought to others I have to translate it into words first; and in doing so I also flatten the thought. And before it, the time of having a raw thought in my brain it just feels like… something, it’s not sound, not light, but “a thing” which I know means the item or concept I am thinking of. And the process of thinking is kind of these “semantic things” bouncing off each other - which usually happens much faster than I can translate it into words. When solving a problem, I usually tinker with it for a while and then let my “big subconscious coprocessor” deal with it for a while, and more often than not if not a solution but the clear idea of direction and reasoning emerges the next time I look for it. At the same time I tend to make a fair bit of puns based purely on spelling alone - feels a bit magical to have all the omonyms kind of flash in the head all at once, and then make-pretend pick the wrong one for fun. Is this anywhere similar ? reply madaxe_again 7 hours agorootparentThat’s pretty similar, from the sound of it. The flattening analogy fits - it’s like trying to describe a multidimensional sculpture using only three letter words. As to the big processor - I definitely do the same if no answer is immediately forthcoming - send it to the boys upstairs and wait for an answer, which usually comes while I’m in the middle of a conversation about something else entirely. Puns, to an extent, although more often than not I just go off up and down an etymological tree, as the semantics behind so many words and concepts reveal further layers of interconnection and peculiar shreds of history. Physics is my play park, where I enjoy posing and chewing on gnarly problems, which often result in “inadequate data, please try again later”. Didn’t make me popular as an undergraduate as I asked all sorts of awkward questions about presuppositions and usually ended with a professor waving their arms and telling me to just accept it as so. “Dark matter” was what made me finally spit on the ground and decide to not pursue academia, as it’s just so blatantly wrong, and it hurts to see so many accept it as a hard done and dusted solution to something that is anything but solved - because our presuppositions are almost certainly wrong. Piles upon piles of monkeys supposing that they are the centre of the universe, with the perfect sensorium to know it. Anyway. Like I say, I find it hard to see eye to eye with a majority of people, and I know I don’t make it any easier for myself. reply licebmi__at__ 9 hours agorootparentprevI can totally relate. In my case I feel deeply connected to Poincare writings about unconscious processing. It’s not that I have sudden eureka moments, but I observed that if I try to consciously search for an answer, I just won’t find it, like I need to soak on information and do something else to actually get the result after a while. reply nopinsight 14 hours agoprevThere are many concepts in our thought stream without a 'word' or even a simple 'phrase' to label them. A word or a common phrase is coined when a concept is sufficiently common and important enough such that someone comes up with a label to communicate the idea succinctly and the label catches on. We, humanity, have words or common phrases to label the vast majority of significant concepts. However, not every concept is accorded such importance in every language. Some common words in other languages without direct translation in English: * 積ん読 (Tsundoku) (Japanese): Buying books and never reading them, just letting them pile up. * น้ำใจ (Nam-jai) (Thai): Literally \"water from the heart\". Being very nice and helpful without expecting anything back. * 关系 (Guanxi) (Mandarin): Your network of connections that help you get stuff done in life and business. This is perhaps another line of evidence to support the thesis of the article. Make no mistake though: Language is extremely useful for some types of thoughts, especially more abstract ones. Not everyone, however, uses it as their primary tool for thinking. ----- The above also helps explain some limitations of LLMs, such as their inadequate spatial intelligence. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) start to address these issues by using much more granular data than language alone. reply gyomu 12 hours agoparent> * 積ん読 (Tsundoku) (Japanese): Buying books and never reading them, just letting them pile up. i don't speak Thai or Mandarin, so I can't speak to the other 2, but this one is a pun (combining tsundeoku, pile up, and dokusho, book reading) that survived in the language due to its catchiness. A bit like \"hangry\" (hungry + angry) in English.

Consider Chinese 成语 (Chengyu) [1] or Japanese 四字熟語 (Yo Ji Juku Go) [2]: - 指桑骂槐 (Zhi Sang Ma Huai) - Pulling the shoots to make the rice grow = helicoptering - 拔苗助长 (Ba Miao Zhu Zhang) - Point at the mulberry tree to curse the locust tree = deflective criticism These condense a whole story with moral lesson in them, and they facilitate recall of that concept. The trick is omission of everything but 4 characters from the whole story. Sometimes they're just an enumeration: - 柴米油盐 (Chai Mi You Yan) Firewood, Rice, Oil, Salt = essential things for everyday life - 都道府県 (To Dou Fu Ken) all 4 types of Jap. prefecture = everywhere I think brevity is key for words that aim at aiding thinking. All languages allow composition; consider \"Eierschalensollbruchstellenverursacher\". But only if the word is short, can you quickly cast your thought into its form (as if speaking) and proceed to compose it with the next thought. You do this until your individual mental capacity runs out. It's also very important that others know the concept. I find myself often refer to \"that scene in Wolf of Wallstreet where Belfort _really safely_ drives his Lamborghini home\"[3] to express \"power is nothing without control\".

Tamarian does exactly that. There's a subclass of 成语 the sense of which you can't even guess at unless you know the story: - 塞翁失马 (Sai Weng Shi Ma) - Old man loses horse; a 5-fold story of riches-to-rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-riches = life is unpredictable - 自相矛盾 (Zi Xiang Mao Dun) - Resemble spear and shield = unstoppable force meets indestructible object The latter is so common that 矛盾 (Mao Dun) is the dictionary entry for \"contradiction\" in Chinese and Japanese. Because 矛盾 is so common, the story 自相矛盾 (=etymology) gets taught only later to native speakers. Similarly, consider the surprising etymology of word \"rob\", deriving from \"robe\" [1]. Consider also: - \"Seven at One Blow\" [2] = bamboozle This proverb everyone knows, yet nobody uses it. It only cumbersomely embeds in a sentence; \"bamboozle\" is briefer.

For me, a predominantly linguistic thinker, it's actually those concepts having words that make it possible for me to really think about them on their own. So \"buying books and never reading them\", yes, it's a phenomenon that happens and one could presumably talk about it, but it's hard to even think of in the first place - it's a complex set of ideas joined together in a specific way. Tsundoku, however, is a concept. A single word. A token. A point in the latent space. Something I feel existing independently in my mind, as a node that I can feel emotions about, that grows attachments. That's much easier to access, and thus much more common to talk about. Nam-jai, I already have an English word for this in my mind, \"pay -it-forward\". Yeah, it's one semantic unit in my mind. Funny enough, I'm ESL and I don't know a word in my native language for this (Polish); the concept exists in my head literally as \"pay it forward\", and brings up associations with some broken down car story, and Jesus for some reason. Guanxi - in English, isn't that a \"social network\"?

The existence of “rubber duck debugging”, and a whole bunch of studies on verbally explaining a concept indicate that language is essential for thought. In rubber duck debugging, programmers tell their problem to an object and this is beneficial in finding the solution. There are studies that show when we verbally teach material to someone we remember it better. Also the act of taking a test increases learning and memory, but why should this be if learning is secondary? 2. Everything we know about memory tells us that externality is essential for memorizing something. If there’s nothing visual, aural, or sensory then it is unlikely to be remembered. Language acts as an externality even as inner speech, meaning that thoughts can be said in language (ascribed onto the words) and remembered for short-term and long-term memory. A thought without externality seems more like a passing whim, unrooted in any more permanent mode of cognition and thus liable to be forgotten. I can imagine thinking in visuals, melodies, words, but if there is a kind of thought that isn’t occurring based off of these then it probably can’t be sophisticated. reply maizeq 5 hours agoparent1. This doesn’t indicate language is necessary for thought but rather that language is useful for refining thought. If anything it shows that some form of thought exists before it is articulated into language. I would assume inverse cases also exist, where articulation into language narrows a thought down into the vocabulary of a language. 2. I thought rare individuals who did not develop language abilities (e.g due to isolation) still had memories of their time prior to thought. The most obvious example to me is Helen Keller, who writes about her time prior to meeting her teacher. reply ordu 1 hour agoparentprevDisclaimer: I do not know, really, what role language plays in a thought process. I just want to point why your takes are not enough to make me to believe that language is a necessary prerequisite for a thought. 1. Rubber duck maybe just help with attention issues. All the studies I heard of do not try to untangle the mechanism. People tend to use language for a multi-brain thinking, and in this mode people do not think their thoughts fully, they propose ideas allowing other to support them or dismiss them. In this way they've got combined knowledge and experience to do the work, simplifying the early rejection of bad ideas. And I'm sure this mode of thinking shapes mind and in particular attention processes. You need to track which bits of information you told already and which you didn't, and you trained for that. Rubber duck can be just a trigger for that mode of attention. 2. I didn't hear about externalities, but to my mind what really helps to remember it is a number of associated details. I believe that ideas extracted from the memory when some of these details is popped up in your thought. It serves like a key in an associative map. When you name a concept with a word, and then use this word in different combinations with other words building associations, then sometimes your mind just like LLM will suggest the first word when you used words associated with it. It seems like externalities you talk about. Language plays its role with this, but you can achieve the same result without a language but thinking about all connected concepts of a concept you are trying to remember. You can build associations this way. reply BurningFrog 3 hours agoparentprevHow I think Rubber Ducking works for me: Explaining things to others - imaginary or not - engages the parts of my brain imagining how they will receive and understand it. This is primarily so I can phrase it in a way other people can understand. But that imagined model of other minds is often smart enough to imagine what they would answer. Which I guess means my \"social brain\" is smarter than my \"thinking\" brain in some ways. Don't know how universal that is.

Can anyone provide more context on what definition they're using? I ask because certain assumptions that seem to be built into the paper and its references seem to exclude a lot of things that I would personally consider other forms of language. For example, they say the subjects with impairments to the parts of the brain supposedly required for speech could \"follow non-verbal instructions\" and \"understand what another person believes\". What makes those exchanges distinct from use of language, albeit a poorly defined one? I know nothing about this field of study, so I assume there's some assumptions and definitions they aren't stating explicitly. It seems weird to me that they say \"these representations need not be specifically linguistic: they could be symbolic but non-linguistic (for example, ‘9’), and the use of symbolic non-linguistic representations does not engage linguistic resources (for example, mathematical reasoning elicits no response in the language brain areas and is preserved in individuals with severe aphasia\".

    "originBody": "After my dad died, I ran and sold his company (and I was completely clueless) June 19, 2018 · family From tech in NYC to chemical manufacturing in Nasik (India), here’s a guide that hopefully nobody ever needs. On April 17, 2017 my dad died. It was the worst day of my life. It was also the day I started to lead a second company – his company. (Note: the first company is CB Insights.) His company was in India (a country I knew little about) in the chemical manufacturing industry (an industry I knew nothing about). On June 1st, 2018, after running his company for 13 months, it was acquired. While I don’t think most people would ever find themselves in a similar situation (I certainly hope not), I thought I’d share the story and some of my learnings & observations from that time about business, M&A, teams, India, and assorted miscellaneous thoughts. Notes: This will probably be slightly rambly and stream-of-consciousness as there are lots of thoughts rolling around in my head. So, here we go… Warning: this is going to be long so a table of contents is below. Life comes at you fast Day 1 in my new gig What the F is the plan? Running a business you know nothing about Growth the old-fashioned way — cold calling and cold emailing prospects and customers The M&A buyers show up June 1st — Atlas is officially sold The official farewell What was the impact on CB Insights? The differences between CB Insights and Atlas Thoughts on M&A Thoughts on India Thoughts on technology & data Thank you’s Life comes at you fast As I was going with family to cremate my father in a traditional Hindu funeral, someone who I didn’t know came up to me and said in Hindi, “Saab, humara kya hoga?” That translates to “Sir, what will happen to us?” I didn’t know who it was. I assumed it was a worker from my Dad’s factory. I was a mess at the time. And I remember thinking to myself, “Why the F are you asking me about this right now?” But this wasn’t the time for anger or to even to think about this so I just knee-jerk responded in my heavily American-accented Hindi that “Meh dekh loonga” which translates to “I’ll look after it.” And so at that point, in addition to CB Insights, I knew I was going to run my Dad’s business. To be honest, I had already thought about this possibility when he was admitted to the hospital when the doctors said the situation was looking dire. But no matter my age, Dad was always the strongest, smartest person I knew, and so I assumed he’d pull through and things would go back to normal. With him tirelessly working on Atlas, the company he founded, and me going back to CB Insights. But then April 17th happened. And now, I was going to run his business. I was going to run Atlas. I wasn’t ready for this. Before we go further, a bit of context on Atlas, my Dad’s business. The company was recently renamed AIMS Impex, but it started and for most of its life, it was known as Atlas Fine Chemicals. Industry folks know it as Atlas, and my sisters and I grew up knowing it under that name so I will refer to it as Atlas going forward. Atlas is a manufacturer of specialty flavor & fragrance chemicals such as coumarin, 6-methyl coumarin, safranal, natural vanilla, and cyclocitral among others. Atlas’ customers include the world’s largest flavor & fragrance houses including IFF, Givaudan, Firmenich, Takasago, and Symrise among others. Atlas is based 4 hours from Mumbai in a city called Nasik (1.486 million people) and the manufacturing facility is about 35 minutes from Nasik in a small village called Sinnar. If there ever was a polar opposite to CB Insights, it’s Atlas. CB Insights is a technology company. Atlas is an industrial manufacturing company. (note: more on the differences below) But here we were. Day 1 in my new gig I don’t remember the exact day I went to the office for the first time as the weeks after April 17th were a blur of family, tradition, and emotion. Before even stepping foot in the office, I had asked the team to send me the reports they sent to Dad so I could get familiar with the business. TBH, I didn’t know what I’d do with these reports, but I figured that acting like I knew what I might be doing might provide some confidence to the team. Candidly, my only qualification to run Atlas at this time was that I was the founder’s son. I had tried to be the good Indian son back in 1998-2000 and work at Atlas so knew the biz a bit in its earlier days, but 18 years is a long time for a business and my mind was jammed with all sorts of other experiences and ideas since then. My time at Atlas was just a distant memory. In 1998, moving from the fun of NYC to small town India was tough especially as someone born and brought up in the US. Moreover, I was a know-it-all who had all the answers despite just graduating from college and so my dad’s inability to recognize my genius bothered me. And so after 18 months working with Dad, I left to join Kozmo.com. (Yes – that Kozmo that spectacularly failed. Clearly, I had great judgment.) I still wonder what Atlas might have become if I could have figured out how to be more of a student and less of an Ivy League douche when I was working with my dad back then. What kind of duo might we have been? So, in a strange and sad way, this was an opportunity to finally be the good Indian son and run Dad’s business. In late April, I finally went to the office. When I entered, everyone stood up to greet me. Nobody called me Anand. I was referred to as Sir, which is what everyone referred to my father as. Yup — this felt strange. I remember thinking this was odd at the time, and during all my visits to the office subsequently, but in many ways, this sort of cultural deference to the unqualified boss’ son is what enabled Atlas to carry on. I imagine if the same had happened in the US, there would have been many more questions about my qualifications and capabilities. At Atlas, those conversations might have very well happened, but I doubt it. Or, if they did, these questions weren’t directed to me. I got lucky here. Everyone, for better or worse, assumed I had a clue and was looking for me to develop a plan. What the F is the plan? So I needed a plan. Not on day 1, but pretty quickly. Not because anyone was asking for one, but for myself. For Atlas. How does one develop a plan when you don’t understand the business, the science, the industry, the country, and sometimes even the language? (I have passable Hindi but a lot of the local conversations at Atlas were in Marathi which I don’t understand.) In my view, there were 4 options for the business. Option 1 — Run the business and become this huge multi-industry conglomerate I entertained Option 1 for about 6 weeks. The ill-conceived idea was that I’d figure out how to run both Atlas and CB Insights, going forward with Atlas as the beachhead for a larger industrials business and CB Insights as the first part of a massive technology arm. Visions of grandeur and all that good stuff. This was some stupid, naive thinking. In India, you see all these families (Ambani, Birla, Tata, Godrej, Hinduja, etc) who are in every potential business line possible. I figured they all started somewhere. Maybe this would be my starting point. After about 6 weeks of trying to be present at CB Insights, but doing calls every morning at 6am with the Atlas team and emails every evening responding to the team or to Atlas customers, it became apparent that Option 1 wasn’t feasible. I kept this 6am morning call/evening email routine going for the last 13 months with CB Insights occupying the middle of the day and every other minute of idle brain time. Needless to say, I’ve aged immeasurably in the last 13 months. My desire to build a multi-industry conglomerate died because the idea was just too tiring. Option 2 — Sell the company for its parts For a second, I looked at what the company might fetch for its assets. Its land, plant, etc. I’d never done something like this but I remember hearing about it when Gordon Gecko talked about it in the movie Wall Street so figured, why not? If the strategy works in movies, it must work in real life too, right? But this wasn’t a real option ever and was discounted in a few hours. My dad built this company over 30 years with many of his team having been with him for 20+. Selling the company’s assets, even if feasible, would be me failing his team and him. Not going to happen. Option 3 — Find a young, aggressive, ambitious person to run Atlas The third idea was to see if there was someone who could run Atlas with some guidance from Dad’s team and me (assuming I could eventually understand the business). And then give this person the ability to earn more and more equity over time. Essentially, they’d run the company and eventually own it. This idea was appealing as it’d let my family continue to be involved with the business while also finding someone capable to take it to the next level. The problem here was that I had no network in India from which to even think about finding someone for this role. I spoke with a couple of candidates via introductions but nothing really stuck for them or me. Moving to Nasik was a challenge even for those in India, but that was just a symptom of not finding the right person. This would have been an amazing opportunity for the right person, but it wasn’t in the cards. Option 4 — Run the business until a buyer can be found Option 4 was ultimately the most practical. The challenge, however, was that Dad’s business didn’t have too many natural buyers and was considered a small market transaction making it even tougher. And so I didn’t have any control on the M&A side of things. I focused on running the business and hoped a suitable acquirer would show up. If nobody showed up, I’d keep running it. I gave myself 3 years to run both Atlas and CB Insights, thinking I could maintain the daily schedule of 6am calls and evening emails with India interspersed, with trips every 6-8 weeks before burning out. 3 years was a completely arbitrary timeline. About 6 months in, I realized doing both for that long really wasn’t sustainable for a number of reasons — health, family, and it wasn’t optimal for either CB Insights or Atlas. But I didn’t know the buyer market and couldn’t control it so I focused on what I could control. And that was running Atlas. Running a business you know nothing about Despite Atlas being very different than CB Insights, the answer about how to run it came to me easier than a lot of the other questions I had over the last 13 months. Or perhaps I just oversimplified it to make a decision quickly. I decided that business is about growth or margin. To grow, we could do 1 of 2 things: Sell more of our existing products — primarily Coumarin Add new products If we focused on margin, that’d mean focusing on: Increasing efficiency in manufacturing Reducing expenses I looked at the financials for Atlas vs peers in the industry and talked to some of my dad’s trusted advisors, and it was apparent that Atlas’ margins were best-in-industry. Dad was the ultimate bootstrapper. Atlas was efficient, and my dad obsessed about margins, foregoing business that was low margin to keep overall profit margins high. It was clear that focusing on the margin side wasn’t the best place for my time or energy. Plus, most of the efficiency to be gained was in the manufacturing process and that is where I was zero value-add. Dad was also the ultimate technical co-founder. I was as non-technical as they come in a chemical manufacturing setting. Plus, margin is hard to rally the team around. Growth is tangible. And I needed to paint a picture that the team could see. Improving margin by XX basis points wasn’t going to be what got anyone fired up. So I decided to focus on growth. Growth not via new products as that would also require Dad, the technical co-founder. I focused on growth of Coumarin — the company’s primary product. This was also the only way to run the company that I had a chance of being useful in. And it was also the way I could show the Atlas team we were doing well. And that I might have some value beyond being the boss’ son. Selling is something everyone sees, especially in a manufacturing setting. From the workers at the factory to the plant staff, if they see trucks coming in for product dispatches, they know the product they’re making is selling. If the staff in the office is busy generating invoices and fielding customer calls, they see the product is selling. And while I’m by no means a natural at selling, if armed with the right product, I can sell. And Atlas’ Coumarin was the best in the world. In the chemical industry, it’s unheard of to be a single product company for 30 years. But Atlas was able to do that because the product is hard to make, and they are the best at it. So growth it was. Note: It is worth noting that in a competitive chemical product, margins cannot be ignored. So while growth was the focus, I did focus on major expenses — raw materials, shipping, packaging. But this was only 5% of my time as the very capable team at Atlas managed these expertly. Growth the old-fashioned way — cold calling and cold emailing prospects and customers So with growth being the focus, I went about assembling a list of people and firms in the industry I should reach out to. I went through my dad’s emails to see who he’d interacted with and reached out to all of them. I visited various fragrance and flavor association and conference websites and took down their member and attendee names and reached out to them. It wasn’t a particularly structured process, but I wanted those that knew my dad to know that Atlas was still humming and they could rely on us for product. And for those that didn’t know us, the next time they had a need, they knew they could reach out to us. This was a lot of cold emailing and cold calling. I have heightened respect for what SDRs do at CB Insights or anywhere. It is hard work. But also incredibly rewarding when someone closes based on your efforts. At the same time, I also focused on price. Dad had built a high margin business which afforded me the opportunity to try to gain market share by being more aggressive with price. Coumarin is probably a 6,000 ton product per year. Atlas was about 10-12% of the global market, but we had capacity at the plant that wasn’t being used so I knew we could produce and sell more. There is some supply-demand curve, marginal cost calculation I could have done here, but I didn’t do any of that. I did some back of the envelope math in my head and had worked out a simple, rudimentary cost per kg formula in Excel to ensure we were always making something on a sale, but I ran Atlas on instinct a lot more than analysis. Atlas has a great team with lots of experience. I assumed if I was doing something really really dumb, they’d tell me 🙂 In the last financial year (April 2017-March 2018), Atlas had its best revenue in history. In November 2017, we dispatched 100 tons of Coumarin to customers for the first time in the company’s history. I remember taking mithai (sweets) to the site at the end of November when the 100 ton month happened and celebrating with the team. It was one of the proudest days I’ve ever had professionally. I was incredibly proud of the Atlas team who had seen a potentially company-sinking event happen with my dad’s death in April and who’d kept fighting and doing good work and then just had a historic month. So, things were going well with the company. What about a buyer? The M&A buyers show up As soon as I took over the business, the calls started coming from interested buyers or their investment banks. Dad had already been in discussions with 1 firm prior to his death, and I’d met them once with him. They re-engaged. The flavor & fragrance industry in India is big, but small at the same time. Everyone learned about Dad’s passing pretty quickly. As a result, various buyers expressed interest. I reached out to a couple of our large customers to feel them out. By the end of July, I had a group of buyers identified. I had done some basic research on the space so I understood the players and sounded at least reasonably smart. A report by investment bank Avendus on the flavor & fragrance industry was useful for a novice like me. Atlas was a base ingredient manufacturer. Our likely buyers were either larger base ingredient manufacturers or functional ingredient manufacturers who were interested in vertical integration. There were 5 buyers that either came to us or that I’d identified and gotten some expression of interest from. Buyer 1 – A publicly traded Indian firm that also makes Coumarin at much smaller volumes Buyer 2 – An Atlas client who was interested in potential vertical integration Buyer 3 – A wealthy family looking to buy a business for their son returning from the US Buyer 4 – A private-equity backed chemical company Buyer 5 – A family-held chemical company that also manufactured Coumarin Most of these buyers did not get very far. But I had conversations with all of them. Before digging into how things went with each buyer, it is worth understanding that there were certain criteria I had for a deal which made eliminating certain buyers easy. My 3 deal criteria were simple: They had to take care of the team — I wanted to find a growth-oriented company as ensuring the team that had helped build Atlas would be taken care of was critical. The biggest factor in any decision was this as I viewed it as intertwined with my dad’s legacy. He spent 30 years building this company with this team. It was important that this be maintained and hopefully taken to the next level. There is, of course, no way to know this for sure and this is where one’s gut and how the buyer across the table makes you feel is important. Simple deal — I was not interested in stock in a private company or an illiquid public company or a long earn-out or some other complex structure. Atlas wouldn’t be a big deal for any credible buyer. Complexity wasn’t required. I also didn’t have time to educate a buyer on the space. A fair price — When the founder/face of a company dies (my dad), a bunch of bottom feeding parasites can show up. I wasn’t expecting to get a top of the market price for Atlas, but I wanted a fair one. Moreover, the longer I ran Atlas, the more confident I became in my ability to run it. So the price was only going to go up with time. So now let’s look at each potential buyer. Buyer 1 — A publicly traded Indian firm that also makes Coumarin at much smaller volumes I met with one of the execs of this firm along with their investment bank once. I shared high-level data on Atlas with them but the conversation ended after that. They were saddled with lots of debt as I could see given they were public and so didn’t think a deal with them would meet the criteria I had on fair price, simplicity, or even ability to take care of the team. Not a good fit. One conversation and things were done. Buyer 2 — An Atlas client who was interested in potential vertical integration This was a client I’d reached out to. They were interested in Atlas. We talked a bit and they proposed a deal, but the structure was complicated and so I let this one go. They are a long-standing client and we were far enough away from any deal that it didn’t make sense to engage further. Buyer 3 — A wealthy family looking to buy a business for their son returning from the US This was an introduction from one of my dad’s advisors. They were a family with a large industrial business and were interested in expanding into new lines as their son was returning to India from the US. (I guess really wealthy people do things like this). They were super smart and impressive. The challenge here was that it’d require lots of education about the industry and the probability of success even after investing would be low. This wasn’t time I had. After a couple of conversations, it was clear this wasn’t a fit. Buyer 4 — A private-equity backed chemical company This was the firm my dad was already in discussions with. The firm had seen Atlas’ numbers and had actually given an offer to my dad prior to his death. They seemed the most promising at the outset given the diligence they’d already done. So I met them in May before leaving India. It was an interesting meeting. For an hour, they told me all the reasons Atlas wasn’t a great business. I listened as I’m probably too deferential to those older than me than I should be. And after listening for a while, I asked them, “You’ve told me all the reasons Atlas is such a bad company. So why do you want to acquire it?” That seemed to reset the conversation a bit. Ultimately, there wasn’t a fit. Part of this may have been culture fit and part of this was likely ownership by PE which complicated decision-making on their side. It’s important to understand the decision-making criteria and process of a buyer when discussing M&A. The firm wanted to follow their process. I told them that process didn’t work for Atlas or me or my family. And I told them that process was what we needed to run. When they said no, I wished them luck and moved on. I was nervous doing this tbh. There wasn’t a huge list of buyers for Atlas and shutting one of them out seemed at times like it might be foolish. But you have to go with your gut on these things. Life went on. Buyer 5 — A family-held chemical company that also manufactured Coumarin Buyer 5 reached out via the company’s investment banker. I’d received lots of calls from bankers prior and I insisted they tell me who they were representing as many were just fishing. Buyer 5’s banker revealed the company’s name. I knew my dad had had conversations with them some years ago. We met in July and there was immediately a better fit. I explained my criteria, they explained their vision, they put a non-binding offer together that was clean/clear and we got moving on diligence. The rest is history. June 1st — Atlas is officially sold On May 31st, I flew back to India. It was my 8th trip in the last 13 months. I landed at 10pm. The offices of Avendus, the investment bank representing Eternis, the buyer, was the first destination. I arrived at 11pm and we worked until 5am to hash out final details of the deal. We went away for 4.5 hours to shower and get some sleep and resumed at Eternis’ office at 930am on June 1st. By 4pm that day, the deal was done. At 5pm, I left Mumbai for the 4-hour drive to Nasik. The news broke within the industry pretty quickly. During the 4-hour drive to Nasik, folks started calling and WhatsApp messaging me — customers, vendors, etc. And so did the Atlas team. I’d only disclosed the deal conversation to 4 people at Atlas prior. I was hoping to tell the team on Saturday (6 day workweek at Atlas) in the office so I felt bad that some of them heard about the deal on Friday evening through others. The next day, I went to the factory and members of the Eternis team came. Manu of the Eternis team addressed the office and factory staff and gave a great view into their goals and their company. The official farewell On June 4th, we decided that our family would officially say farewell to the entire Atlas team at the factory. We had everyone from the office come up. My mom, kids, and wife flew in from the States. I wanted my kids to see what their “Dada” (grandfather) had built at least 1 time before it moved onto the next chapter in its story. And we wanted to say thanks to everyone on the Atlas team. I had prepared a speech in English and my wife translated it to Hindi. My Hindi is not very good so beyond the emotion of this farewell, I was pretty scared of delivering a several minute speech in Hindi. I’d never done something like that. We assembled in the warehouse, and I stood on top of the chemical mixer and talked to the team. I fought back tears several times during my speech. My Hindi was intelligible enough that I had several others on the Atlas team also crying so I guess that my message was understood. My speech in English is below. It was delivered in Hindi, and the video is something I hope to show my kids when they are old enough to understand. Speech: My Hindi is not very good so please forgive me if I make any mistakes. Dad started Atlas 29 years ago. As my sisters and I were growing up, we joked that Atlas was his 4th child. But in reality, Atlas was less of a 4th child than a 2nd family to Dad. He loved working with you all. Whether it was increasing production or improving our Sali to Coumarin yield or solving technical challenges to figuring out how to keep Chinese Coumarin out of India to showing the plant to foreign visitors, there was nothing he liked more. And together with Dad, you all built something very special. Many of you have been with Dad for 20+ years. He and you grew up and built Atlas together. And now, Atlas Coumarin is known globally for being the highest quality coumarin in the world. All the leading multinational companies like IFF, Givaudan, Firmenich rely on Atlas. Within India, Atlas Coumarin has more than 50% of the market. And now, there are a group of new products such as 6-methyl coumarin, safranal, and cyclocitral which can make Atlas even bigger. Of course, as you all know, Dad passed away last April and since then, I’ve been managing what you and he built and it’s been a privilege to do so. Thank you for everything. I’ve never worked with a group as smart, talented, hardworking, and kind as you all. Although I didn’t know much about the business, you all helped me understand things and were patient and understanding throughout. I knew I’d never be able to be 10% as good as Dad but you never made me feel that way and for this, thank you. And in the last 13 months, we did a lot of good things. In November, we had Atlas’ first ever month where we dispatched 100 tons. I remember coming to the site that day and distributing mitthai and feeling so proud to be part of this team. On the way back to Nasik that day, I remember crying and thinking about how proud Dad would have been of this team for achieving this milestone. So, again, let me say thank you from me and my family for all of the outstanding work you do and the professionalism and kindness with which you do it. And now, we’re moving to the next chapter of Atlas. As most of you know, Atlas has been purchased by Eternis, a larger chemical company in the fragrance and flavor space. There was a lot of interest in Atlas after Dad died. I didn’t like any of those companies except Eternis. Eternis is family-owned and their personality and nature is similar to Atlas — humble and hardworking. And they are very focused on growth. Their goal is to take 50-60% of global market share for Coumarin. This means more opportunities and growth for Atlas which I’m excited to see. With their resources, Atlas can grow to new levels. I also expect that the Atlas team can and will teach them many things from how to improve their yields to their quality to the special style of Atlas jugaad that makes this such a special company. My family and I are very excited to see where you all and the Eternis team take Atlas and we hope to visit in the future to see how much the plant expands and how big the team gets. And finally, let me say that I’ve been overjoyed to see the impact that Atlas has had on education in some of your families. Dad always thought education was very important. He started a woman’s college in Rajasthan for this reason. He grew up in small village to a family of farmers. And education and hard work was how he achieved so much. And as I’ve gotten to know many of you who have been with Dad for 20+ years, I’ve learned that many of you have sent, for the first time, your sons and your daughters on to become doctors, engineers, chartered accountants, and more. I think this will be one of Atlas’ most lasting impacts on the community. And I know beyond Atlas, my dad was very proud of this given how important education was to him. I hope that you’ll continue to push your sons and daughters forward in education so that one day, they’ll build the next Atlas. Again, thank you for teaching me so much about business, India, and what a great team looks like over the last 13 months. I could not be more excited to see what you accomplish in the future and I know Dad is looking down on us today and smiling knowing that Atlas is going to become even bigger in the years to come. Thank you. What was the impact on CB Insights? It’s a bit unknowable to assess exactly the impact the last 13 months had on CB Insights. We are a big enough company that the show goes on, but we are still not so big that everything is all figured out (not sure that ever happens). The team continued to kick ass and we had a great year in 2017 growing revenue nearly 100% YoY again. But the CBI of April 2017 was 114 people. In the last 13 months, it climbed to over 200. And so we are a different company. So I’ll focus on the things that I know I didn’t do well over the last 13 months which may have had some impact, big or small, on CB Insights. Building relationships with the team — With our growth, I no longer know every person in the company (inevitable at some point). In the last year, I didn’t get a chance to build relationships with those new teammates. I also didn’t get a chance to grow existing relationships within the team. I missed lots of meetings and one-on-ones — Morning meetings with India or due diligence requests that required immediate attention caused me to miss lots of meetings or reschedule 1:1s. This was bad. I didn’t have my finger on what was going on as I always had before or know about challenges they were facing. I wasn’t providing enough feedback, direction, etc as a result. Internal communication suffered — Growing to 200 requires we change how we communicate with the team broadly and intra-team. Our methods here didn’t evolve over the last 13 months as much as we probably needed them to. It will be something we figure out now, but we are playing a bit of catch up. Physically there but not mentally there — My attention in conversations wasn’t where it always needed to be either due to being tired or just focused on something else — either CBI- or Atlas-related. Overly fast decisions — In the last 13 months, I valued expediency of decision-making more than I typically do. And while I will always believe that speed is a weapon that an insurgent company like CB Insights has on its side, decision-making esp as we scale must be well-considered and communicated. Time was always in short supply and so at times, I got into a mindset of let’s decide quickly without considering impacts to the org or teams or individuals. Didn’t create & communicate strategic vision/product roadmap of CBI internally — When you’re a smaller company, everyone kind of knows the plan, the vision, even if via osmosis. Also, when you’re smaller and the numbers aren’t as big and the growth expectations are more modest, you can just get to where you need to be by outworking everyone. But as you scale up, hard work is necessary but not sufficient. We need to be more deliberate about the markets we’re attacking, the products we’re building, how we’re going to get there, etc, and we need to communicate and re-communicate that. This didn’t happen as it should have. Didn’t talk to enough clients — I’d set a goal of 150 client conversations in 2017 (3 per week) and failed on that goal. We were revenue-funded for most of our lives and I continue to believe our understanding of client needs is one of our most secret weapons. And that requires talking to clients regularly about what they dislike about the product, about their workflow, about their ideas, about their problems, etc. I am thankful we have a customer success team that does a great job of gathering this type of feedback. But this is something I am looking forward to getting back to. Now that I’m back to 200% CBI, I hope to rectify the above. Finally, I am thankful to be part of this team. Despite my shortcomings over this last year+, they’ve been patient, kind, and understanding. When my dad passed, many on the team who’d dealt with similar loss reached out with words of wisdom, offers to chat, and support. Special thanks to Jon, my co-founder, for picking up the slack. The differences between CB Insights and Atlas While it might seem obvious that a technology company and a manufacturing chemicals company would be different, I didn’t appreciate the difference fully until now. Of course, being thrown into an industry I knew nothing about increased the perceptions of these differences. I imagine someone who grew up in chemicals or manufacturing would find software equally different or challenging. From my perspective, here are a few key differences between the two that I observed. Atlas was much more complex — With China cracking down on pollution, what might that mean for competitors? What is the impact on pricing if a raw material supplier’s plant has shut down? Should we buy more raw material as we think there might be a disruption in the future? If the rupee is getting weaker, what does that mean for our margins? The supply chain considerations alone made it much more complex and there were a lot more exogenous/industry factors that had to be considered than at CB Insights. Competing on price is hard — Atlas Coumarin is the highest quality in the world, but there are others that make coumarin. And so while some customers pay for that quality, for many, it came down to price. This was a big change from CB Insights where there is no clear substitute for the product or its human analysts which are way way more expensive. In the case of CBI, it’s all about showing a customer or prospective customer the value that the platform can provide and explaining that our pricing reflects that value. That is not possible at Atlas. Regulatory requirements — This makes sense given we’re talking about chemicals and a chemical plant. But coming from software where you can run your business without really having to ask any third-parties for permission, this was an observable difference. Long-term product development & planning is a different animal — Having a plan is important in any business. But in chemicals, adding a new product or expanding an existing product is a multi-month or multi-year process. In the last 6 months, the CB Insights team has rolled out patent analytics, market sizings, public company data, new profiles, market map maker and a ton of product capabilities that immediately help our customers and ultimately our top and bottom lines. This ability to stay close to customers and build product quickly for them and see it move the needle is one of the best parts of software. It is much harder (near impossible) to do this quickly in manufacturing. Touching the product makes it different — At CB Insights, we deliver data to customers. At Atlas, we deliver drums to customers. There is something unique and gratifying about making a tangible product which was new to me. Turning a bunch of raw materials into a finished product and watching them move from step-to-step in the production process is fun to see. Touching the product in the warehouse before it is dispatched to a customer is different. I’m not sure why or how, but it is. When I saw coumarin coming out of the dryer or the mixer and being packaged, it always made me smile. I remember when we started CB Insights, my dad would ask “What exactly are people buying?” And I’d explain SaaS and subscriptions, and he got it. But he’d also say “I like making stuff.” I didn’t understand it at the time, but I do now. The power of business — I’ve always thought business done right can have a massive impact on society, economies, etc. But with all the recent blather of technology companies changing the world, I’ve become a bit more jaded of late on the impact of business given folks are so quick and cavalier in how they define changing the world. Atlas reaffirmed for me the power of and the good that businesses can do in a community if it’s there long enough. There are several people on the Atlas team whose children have gone on to get degrees and become computer engineers, chartered accountants (equivalent to a CPA), and doctors. Some were the first in their family to do so. This is the type of impact that compounds over time and something that was exciting to see and hear about firsthand. Thoughts on M&A I don’t have a basis of comparison as this was the first company I’ve ever sold, but here’s some of my observations/learnings on the M&A process for those who may go through it. Should I have hired an investment bank? I didn’t have a bank representing me, i.e. I represented myself. Maybe I should have. I had access to data (thanks CB Insights) so knew valuation and transaction multiples. The bankers for the buyer served a project management function so I’m not sure if having bankers on my side would have helped on that front. Bankers might have helped negotiate a bit more, but given this was a small cap deal in India, the few bankers I met who deal in this range of the market were generally not of the caliber that I thought they’d add a ton of value. No clear answer here. Don’t let lawyers run the process — Lawyers, as they should be, are often about risk mitigation for both sides. But it’s important the parties in the deal be clear on what is valuable to them or understand how big the risks really are so that neither side gets bogged down in details or risks which are unimportant or have a low probability of happening. I think both sides did a pretty good job here in our deal, but it’s something to watch out for as letting the lawyers run the process costs you time and more lawyer fees. Know your goals. Communicate your goals — One of the things that worked well in this process was stating my goals to buyers upfront, i.e. the aforementioned deal criteria around taking care of the team, a simple deal and a fair price. It helped quickly determine if there was a potential fit with a buyer and also because I was dealing with people in the industry who we might work with in the future, it removed ambiguity and any sense of arbitrariness from our decisions. If someone started talking about private company stock or raising debt or doing dividend recap, I simply reminded them of the simplicity tenet. Don’t sweat the small stuff — The aforementioned decision-making framework/deal criteria also were very helpful in providing focus for me. If it wasn’t related to those 3 criteria, I tried to avoid worrying about it. This also prevented me from overcomplicating things at times which was incredibly helpful. “That’s industry standard” — This is one of the phrases to watch out for in negotiation. When a term cannot be defended on its merits, often the catch-all is “that’s standard in deals” or “that’s industry standard” is often trotted out by lawyers and bankers. That’s BS. Everything is negotiable, and just because others have gone with some nebulous standard doesn’t mean you have to. Again, that doesn’t mean negotiate for sport on every little thing, but it does mean that things should be supported with logic and reason and not the intellectually lazy “just because.” Conditions Precedent (CPs) — These are the conditions that have to be satisfied prior to a deal being closed— after the purchase agreement is executed but before it is closed, i.e., the money hitting the bank account. Pay attention to what is in the CPs and ensure you understand them, that they’re all meaningful, and that they can be achieved. Don’t do zero-sum negotiation — I believe both parties felt good about this deal and that was because the negotiations were generally solutions-focused. There wasn’t a zero sum mentality of “For me to win, you must lose.” I found this to be constructive throughout and made the general process more pleasant. Note: I wouldn’t describe the M&A process as fun, but I do think minimizing acrimony is good. We mostly avoided that. Thoughts On India India is an amazing place. India is a complicated place. Here are some simple, non-ground breaking thoughts. Regulatory overhead is still steep — India’s regulatory overhead is mostly well-intentioned but ill-defined. There are so many licenses and permits required but even experts in the industry can’t agree on what is what and what is required. Websites, especially regional ones, are not updated or clear. The World Bank ease of doing business rankings are below. India jumped 30 spots so things are clearly getting better, but there is still a lot of work to do. Overall, I’d say I found things at the national or federal level much better defined than at the regional level. This uncertainty creates angst for businesses as you never really know if you’re compliant with all the rules. It makes an M&A process much more difficult needlessly. Checklists here would be amazing. Women in the workforce are going to be a game changer — 2 of the 4 key management personnel at Atlas were women. Atlas is what it is because of their contributions, and this transaction wouldn’t have occurred without their steady hand. I’m impressed with my dad’s foresight here, especially in a city like Nasik, which is not as cosmopolitan as the big cities. But throughout the process, whether it was at Atlas, or our lawyers or our bank or various other parties related to the deal, I found the women I worked with to be among the most responsive, smart, and able to get isht done. India remains a very patriarchal society but change is steadily coming here which will unlock an immense amount of talent. There are lots of middlemen — In B2B, there are lots of consultants and brokers in India involved in everything from regulatory approval to pricing of materials to selling of scrap metal. Technology has been shown to be good at disintermediating middlemen. I think there is a lot of opportunity to use technology to do this in India. I’ve noted a bunch of ideas down for the future. Traffic is soul crushing — Mumbai traffic is an absolute horror. Everyone there seems to have become used to it with 1.5- to 2-hour commute times each way becoming normal. With smartphones and technology, one can still be somewhat productive, but the amount of personal productivity lost here on a daily basis is unfathomable. And this will only get worse. I’d imagine that a progressive employer who figures out a remote work strategy might be able to recruit and retain really great talent. There is so much opportunity — India is messy and complicated and the traffic is ridiculous and there is a whole litany of “things wrong with India,” but there is so much good there. As an Indian-American, I often focused on all that was wrong with India before (viewing everything from an American lens on how things should be). Managing Atlas for 13 months made me see this and also revealed the immense opportunities there in business, in education, and more. I’m excited to explore those in the future. Thoughts on Technology & Data It’s worth mentioning the impact of technology & data on me in the last 13 months. I could not have done this deal or managed Atlas without technology. Here are some of the technologies that made my life easier. Google — Dammit. Google is amazing. When researching some esoteric Indian regulation or trying to find flavor & fragrance companies who might be customers, Google was my go-to. Google Sheets was also powerful for collaborating with the team. WhatsApp — India runs on WhatsApp. Also, the calling feature saved me tons of money when I had to call India from the US or vice-versa. Dropbox — The Atlas team and I used this to organize documents before sharing it in the deal room. SecureDocs — This was the deal room software I used. The software just works. And their team was incredibly responsive. The sales folks weren’t pushy and were helpful. And the pricing was transparent and reasonable. Big fan. YesWare — To send mail merges, absolutely critical. Data — Going in without a banker to these conversations could have been intimidating but I had data so I knew deals, valuations, etc. It was good to be a customer of CB Insights for a bit. Thank you’s There are a ton of people to thank for all they did. Here goes. I apologize if I forgot someone. Family — First, my mom for her strength and for trusting me. She is the unheralded co-founder of Atlas. My wife who has been managing a career and 2 kids almost solo for the last 13 months and who would listen without judgment to me when I was frustrated or overwhelmed. My kids who got used to me being on the phone every morning talking to India instead of having breakfast with them. The Atlas team — As I said above, although I’m 10% as smart as my dad, you never made me feel this. Even after his death, Atlas kept humming because of your work. Many of you worked with Dad for 20+ years. It was good to work with you all directly to see firsthand how special of a company it is. Thanks especially to Mrs. Lakhpatwalla, Priti, and Nathe for all their help on this deal. Thanks as well to Abhay for constantly selling and talking to customers and to Kiran for driving so expertly throughout India and never once getting into an accident (driving in India is intense for those unfamiliar). Thanks to Mehetre and his leadership in the factory as well as to Jadhav, Nitin, and Anand in the plant. We have a group of veterans and young new stars that I’m excited about on the production side. Thank you to Pareshbhai for his friendship and steady advice on accounting and finance matters. The CB Insights team — This is a special company with an amazing team who continued to kick ass despite the impacts of my sometimes mental and physical absence. CB Insights newsletter readers — Since my dad’s death, the only constant has been the CBI newsletter. I didn’t miss a day since he died (although I’d queued up several prior so I was not writing them real-time for a while). Your pie charts, funny commentary, and even the haterade have always been a nice break. The deal players — M&A deals are a good amount of work and given the stakes and long hours can probably bring out the worst in folks at times. I can say I left the negotiation/experience with great impressions of everyone involved. Thanks to Manu and the Eternis team (Chetan, Ram, Rahul) for always being true to their word and a class-act. Thanks to the Avendus team, who although representing Eternis, were always solutions-focused and fair. Thanks to the Majmudar team (Kritika, Amrit, and Sinjani) for their work and counsel as our lawyers. Thanks to Geeta of Kotak Bank for always figuring out a way to get things done even at the very last minute. Finally, thanks to everyone for putting up with me always being tired.

A few years out of school, I took a detour from tech/entrepreneurship to work in my family business (overseeing operations in a construction manufacturing facility, in Egypt), mostly with my Uncle. In my case, though I fully prefer tech as an industry, the deal-breakers were a dismal economic/political climate and an... interesting Uncle. Apart from that, a lot of the article resonated. A few other things that stood out and made the transition hard for me were: corruption (in the construction industry, hard to avoid) and culture/hierarchy. reply goodJobWalrus 5 hours agoprevIn case the author is reading this, I am wondering why Dad did not have a succession plan, and was it ever discussed in the family what should happen after? What was dad’s plan? reply asanwal 5 hours agoparentHi - author here. This is a big question tbh and the lack of a succession plan is a function of many things: 1. This was my dad's baby. He loved the engineering and the science of it and so the idea of retiring from it was difficult for him to conceive. Doing that also requires thinking about one's mortality which I also believe was difficult for him. 2. This was a small market business in a tier 2 city in India. Attracting talent that could take it over was challenging. And myself and my siblings having been born and brought up in the States and being utterly clueless about the engineering/science of the company made us a non-starter. 3. As others have pointed out, he was thinking about succession/exit because he knew it was required for the biz to live on and grow. But life unfortunately had other plans and he was taken away from us unexpectedly. There are definitely lots of could haves, should haves, would haves, etc I've thought about afterwards, but this was clearly one of those \"play the cards you're dealt\" kind of situations. Thanks for reading. reply 999900000999 3 hours agorootparentThanks for writing a great article. I was honestly impressed with how much you cared for your employees. The American way would be to just sell it to the highest bidder without any concern for anything else. Does India have a different social contract? I'd never expect a company to actually look out for my best interest. It seems like you really cared for your team. Are lifers common in India? Back in my grandpa's time, you worked at the same place for 20 years, they gave you a gold watch, and then you retired. Now your expected to jump ship often or your leaving money on the table. reply asanwal 3 hours agorootparentThank you. I don't think there is an Indian social contract but having been born and brought up here in the USA, I'd be talking out of my a$$ on that topic :) This was maybe more of an implied or expected contract I had with my dad and mom who built the business and by extension the Atlas team. Job hopping is quite common in India, but that's probably more common in larger cities. In a tier 2 city like where my dad's business was, there are limited options for a plant engineer for example, and as far as I can tell, the skills they have in a fine chemicals plant may not be immediately transferable to a plastics manufacturer. And finally, many were with my dad for 10+ years so probably some amount of comfort in knowing the domain, the job, the boss, etc. reply jll29 3 hours agorootparentThanks for the story and for putting the employees first. M&A of your sort should always select suitors based on chemistry fit - so when I read your list of candidates, it was already clear to me you would sell to the one listed last, and I'm glad it worked. Selling to Private Equity is almost never what any founder would have wanted, as their job is to slice and dice, \"cut the fat\" and sell the pieces to different highest bidders. reply mattzito 1 hour agorootparentprevThere are lots of family owned businesses in the US that look after their employees.

This is a big problem with these kinds of businesses. A lot of these solo owners who build up a business over the course of many decades serious underestimate how hard they are to sell, and have an unrealistic idea of what valuation they'll be able to get. There is a whole industry of those bottom feeders the author referred to, who's business is precisely waiting for these sole owners to either die, or better yet become incapacitated to the extent they are forced to sell their businesses (but not so much that they can't hold a pen and read a sales contract), so that they can swoop in and offer them 2x or 3x - \"what's your best alternative?\". reply FredPret 4 hours agorootparentI'm not commenting on OP or their family business, but a multiple of 2x or 3x could be more than fair for a hands-on small business. Consider that there are large public companies with established management systems that you can buy and hold, completely hands-off, for multiples of 5x - 10x.

If something “worth” 1 rupee is not selling for 1 rupee,then the logical conclusion, absent collusion/cartel/monopsony behavior, is that it is not worth 1 rupee or even 99 paise, but rather the 33 paise that it is selling at. reply bell-cot 3 hours agorootparentThe established players - and occasional well-behaved newcomers - are buying at (say) 33 paise on the rupee. The \"1 rupee\" is what the business would be worth, in a highly efficient, open market. Which this market clearly is not. And the regulars are quietly colluding to keep it that way. reply lotsofpulp 2 hours agorootparentThe context of _rm’s post is not about the OP’s dad’s specific business in its specific regulatory environment which may or may not constitute a “highly efficient, open market”. > lot of these solo owners who build up a business over the course of many decades serious underestimate how hard they are to sell, and have an unrealistic idea of what valuation they'll be able to get. From this, I get the sense that _rm was talking about owners of niche businesses that are surprised to find a smaller market of interested buyers, and hence are surprised they cannot sell their business at a price they hoped to get. My point was simply that just because a seller cannot get a buyer to pay the price they hoped, that does not make the buyer a “bad” person. reply bell-cot 41 minutes agorootparent> My point was... Quite true. And it's possible that (due to regulatory/tax/social/etc. factors in India) small businesses could only be sold at large discounts to their \"Wall Street theoretical\" values - even in a perfectly efficient market. I originally commented in response to amadeuspagel saying \"If there's a whole industry of them, shouldn't there be lots of competition to buy these companies?\" - by pointing out a simple way in which the market could be very inefficient. Yes, even if there's a carved-in-stone rule that businesses sell for (say) 10X their annual profit, there will be plenty of business owners who imagine that their business is somehow the exception. Related is the problem of owners misrepresenting their businesses to potential buyers. Which would lead perfectly rational and honest buyers to offer them far below 100 paise on the rupee, due to the risk of being swindled. reply actionfromafar 4 hours agorootparentprevA whole industry of bottom-feeders buyers, but the companies they are buying are not necessarily in the same markets as each other, at all. reply daedrdev 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah his father probably had been receiving lowball and unserious offers for years if one were to find the right email folder reply lotsofpulp 3 hours agorootparentprevWhy are the buyers referred to in derogatory terms? By the same logic, the seller should also be referred to in the same derogatory terms, for holding out for too high of a price. Or one could do the sensible thing and leave emotion out of it, and realize business is just business. The market price is the price that results in a transaction. reply chmod775 3 hours agorootparent>Why are the buyers referred to in derogatory terms? Because they are taking advantage of the owner's impaired judgement due to their personal situation/ill health in trying to extract an unfair price. Such behavior is referred to as \"morally reprehensible\" at best, and is skirting the legal line of what would be considered a contract made under duress at worst. reply gedy 2 hours agorootparent> Because they are taking advantage of the owner's impaired judgement due to their personal situation/ill health in trying to extract an unfair price I think you are assuming way too much - a lot of older folks sell things \"because they are done\", and much is upside from when they purchased or started originally. Even when they are ill, many folks just don't care enough about the money enough to wait it out, negotiate, etc. reply lotsofpulp 2 hours agorootparentprevSo no one should ever buy from someone who is dying or ill? That’s crazy. Supply and demand curves are in constant flux. The seller didn’t like the market prices when they were healthy, that does not mean they are entitled to a minimum price. Everyone gets ill and dies eventually, and everyone knows it. They are free to sell before that at the market price. reply _rm 1 hour agorootparentprevEasy to see how specifically targeting the dead or dying for profit is worthy of derogatory terms. If you think otherwise, maybe you shouldn't view \"bottom feeder\" as derogatory? They keep the seabed clean do they not? It's all just \"business\". And yes, the sellers in this case are also in the wrong, best case being bad luck, mid case being failure to prioritize, through to ignorance, delusion, stubbornness, arrogance, etc. reply IshanMi 5 hours agoparentprevThe author mentions that his father was in touch with a PE-backed chemical company a month before he passed, who re-engaged a month after- sounds like that might have been his succession plan? reply codegeek 2 hours agoparentprevThis was in India where succession planning for small business is non-existent and if kids don't pick up their family business, it's over. However, even in America, this situation exists for small businesses. With so many baby boomers retiring from businesses like HVAC etc, their kids don't necessarily want to continue the business. reply jfdsaflkjv 4 hours agoparentprevThe Dad probably expected to live longer and run the business until then. Sounds like it was a big part of his identity. Besides, most closely-held businesses don't have succession plans anyway. reply confused_boner 2 minutes agoprevPitch it to Bollywood, has script potential reply iamgopal 9 minutes agoprevWow !! We have supplied machinery to this company, how wonderful to find such write up at other end of the spectrum. World is small and gol. reply electrodank 3 hours agoprevLeft field comment but I’d love to be thrown into an MBA-like simulator (HBS?) and have to figure out the industry and the company and stabilize it/make it grow and whatnot within some time window. Great read, thank you to the author who took the time to write up all that, it was very insightful and must have been fucking difficult in many ways. reply didip 1 hour agoprevThank you for sharing this unique story. Some parts of your story resonated with my life, hope you don’t mind me sharing: * At times it felt like the true sons are the companies they started. They live and breathe in them. I have a strange detachment to my own family because of this. * Thus, they have serious attachment issues and zero succession plans. * My mom later passed away too soon and missed out much of the life experience she could have had. Glad that she did travel around the world before death. * Even after all that, my old man still doesn’t have succession plan. Dunno what’s gonna happen to all the people working for him. And the clock is ticking. * Like OP, I spent most of my life in the US, so I too would be useless in dealing with the businesses. Even the real estate company (something I know a bit in the US) is far too different back there. Also, blatant corruption is simply not my cup of tea. I tried to help them multiple times. I offered to sponsor them green card, but they consistently refused. I offered if they need help finding private equity to liquidate and just retire. Sometimes I wonder if my mom could have been saved with US quality healthcare. Oh well, I did my best, there was nothing I could have done. reply amadeuspagel 5 hours agoprevFascinating article, but reading it I kept asking myself: Why not promote someone to CEO? Surely any top-level manager already working at the company will do a better a job then someone who's only qualification is working there 18 years ago. reply asanwal 4 hours agoparentAuthor here 1. He died suddenly so would have been a good thing to explore and do with time. It certainly would have made my life easier :) 2. Building a business that is small to medium-sized with no brand recogntion in a tier 2 city in India doesn't afford you access to tier 1 talent. India's talent and talent preferences are incredibly different than the USA. reply jfdsaflkjv 4 hours agoparentprevThe author had business experience having founded and running the successful CB Insights so it's not like some naive well-to-do kid took things over. By the end you realize the author 1) researched the industry, 2) improved the product mix 3) grew the highest-margin product and 4) sold to a buyer with values that protected his workers and his dad's legacy. Someone with that quality/ability is really hard to find, even at really big companies. reply amtamt 1 hour agoprevMaharashtra has a long history of cooperatives, some of whichquite successful. I wonder if employees brought up or were given a option to form a cooperative, if immediate liquidity was not a major requirement. reply kylehotchkiss 1 hour agoprevThis is such a heartwarming story. Thank you for sharing about this Anand. I loved the part about how your dad’s legacy is all the children of employees who could continue their education. reply mizzao 4 hours agoprev> Candidly, my only qualification to run Atlas at this time was that I was the founder’s son. It seems like an even more important qualification was that the founder's son was also a founder. Otherwise this would have been much less likely to work. reply peter_l_downs 3 hours agoparentMaybe. Frankly this is a very impressive outcome that is attributable both to the Father's business and management practices, as well as the Son's business and management practices. No matter how good you are at running a web business, if you inherit a totally fucked business with poor practices, very unlikely you could engineer this outcome. My condolences to the OP and I was happy to read such a well-written article describing a fantastic outcome for his father's company. reply CPLX 3 hours agoparentprevIt’s an odd sentence to be honest. Being the son of the founder of a business has been the strongest qualification for running that business for at least 3,000 years. On top of that he had worked in this same company for two years, had an Ivy League degree, had worked both in startups and large scale investment banking firms, and had founded and run an unrelated $100M+ enterprise. reply skybrian 2 hours agoprevThis is quite a good story. Since it happened in 2018, I wonder what’s happened to the business since then? reply johndhi 3 hours agoprevThis is incredibly well written (in addition to being substantively compelling). Bravo! reply langsoul-com 4 hours agoprevWonder if the author could speak about how him already being a founder played into the equation. Let's say he was a software dev, no team lead, no manager, individual contributor. How would things play out? reply asanwal 3 hours agoparentHi, Having founded and run CB Insights certainly helped mostly cuz I had some sense of where to focus. In this case, we had product-market fit to use a tech term. My dad's product was great. And so I didn't need to worry about that. If I had to worry about that, this probably doesn't unfold as it did. That meant I just had to worry about 2 things: 1. Making sure we were buying raw materials at rates that allowed us to sell the product profitably 2. 'Ringing the register' aka making sales. And that ultimately is not intellectually hard but just requires effort, i.e. researching, calling, emailing, etc. reply sureglymop 1 hour agorootparentHey. This is completely unrelated but I wanted to ask if you provide an RSS feed for your blog? I did find a /feed page but I'm unsure if it's working. reply asanwal 1 hour agorootparentI set this blog up 24 hours ago and just started moving old writings to it and still have another 200ish to go.

Thanks reply tibbydudeza 4 hours agoprevAmazing story - shows the importance of succession planning - worked for a family-owned company but the apples did not fall close to the tree - the sons and daughters could not match the father. Like what happened to Wang. Today they are technically bankrupt and reluctantly handed over control to seasoned management and they are spinning out parts of the company to raise capital to save the core business. reply renewiltord 2 hours agoprevSorry to hear about your dad. Seems to have been a good and smart man. This was a pretty insightful story. Thank you for sharing it. reply jacknews 3 hours agoprevWouldn't it have been better if ownership of the company, essentially comprised of the workers and managers, actually passed to the workers who knew what they were doing? To me this just highlights the absurdity of capitalist ownership. reply OJFord 2 hours agoparentFor them sure, not for OP and family? It wasn't run on a total profit share before OP's father died, it would be weird (and very bad incentive) if that suddenly changed. No doubt that sort of thing happens sometimes, or especially donating an inheritance to charity, but it being the default would be more absurd to me, when it was already in 'capitalist ownership'. reply sspiff 4 hours agoprev [–] > While I don’t think most people would ever find themselves in a similar situation (I certainly hope not), I'm not sure what the author means by this. Sad though it may be, most people will experience their dad dieing. And inheriting control of a company sounds like a 1%'er problem if I ever heard one. What is OP wishing to spare the rest of us from, exactly? reply stavros 4 hours agoparentI think he meant \"inheriting a company in a sector you know nothing about\". reply jfdsaflkjv 4 hours agoparentprev [–] I know exactly what the author meant by that. He meant losing a parent at a young age. It doesn't happen to most people. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

The metro area surrounding is ~5.7 million. The metro area grew by ~100k in the past four years. They are freeing up ~10,000 houses over the next four years with this legislation. Barcelona built ~15,000 new properties between 2011 and 2020. The math don't math. It's a drop in the bucket. The entire impact of AirBnB + all housing built in the last decade does not offset the last half decade of population growth. Housing must be built more quickly than your population is growing to keep prices down, or you must concede that you live in a nice area where people wealthier than you wish to be and that those people are going to gentrify the area and displace locals. It's an unpleasant reality of the world. EDIT: some good feedback in the responses. thanks! I'm being a bit dramatic by saying it's just a drop in the bucket, this action frees up more housing than was built over the same timespan, and it's possible to have effects on pricing greater than what would be inferred by the raw numbers because economics is tricky. cheers. reply sangnoir 22 hours agoparent> The math don't math. It's a drop in the bucket. Since this is HN, I was expecting a little more rigor in proving the math not mathing: how many people can be housed in 15 000[1] + 10 000 houses? How small is the drop and how big is the bucket? From sibling comment, average density is 2.51 people per home * 25k houses which works out to 62 750 housed people out of the 100 000 population growth. If my math is correct, that is significantly more than a drop in the bucket, considering the Airbnb component is 40% of that number, or just over 25k people - which is a big drop indeed for a 100k bucket [1] Edit: I later realized your comment has numbers from multiple time windows. Substitute \"15 000\" with whatever number of houses were built/added in the past 4 years. reply SeanAnderson 22 hours agorootparentThe 15k houses were built over 10 years, but the 100k growth is over 4 years. So 4/10ths of 15k ~= 9k/47k housed. I think it's fair to say I'm being dramatic by saying it's a drop in the bucket. The action frees up more housing than Barcelona built over the same time period. This is good. However, it's still not a long-term solution. This is a one-time action that when taken, and combined with the housing being built, fails to provide for even 50% of the people moving to the city. Voters want a solution that makes living more affordable not just one that makes it less affordable less quickly. As an aside, I think people can become complacent when a one-time solution to a problem lessens the pain momentarily. Suddenly the issue isn't as high of a priority and so the underlying situation continues to exacerbate the problem. What will voters do in a few more years when this lever doesn't exist to pull? Ban all foreigners? reply jll29 22 hours agorootparentI only hope this does not replace one problem with another: Because Spain's high unemployment, in particular youth unemployment and the construction sector, actions that reduce tourism lead to fewer jobs and less income flowing into the city. I'm not against the measure (last time in Barcelona I was in a hotel and my friends rented an AirBnB apartment instead; they had fun and I had to move hotel rooms because the guy above me flooded the bathtub), and excessive tourism (Barcelona, Edinburgh, Amsterdam all suffer from it) is annoying even putting housing prices and lack of availability to the side, but I just wonder. reply kranke155 22 hours agorootparentTourism is a shit industry. You could mostly annihilate it and replace it with productive things most of the time. reply robocat 21 hours agorootparentIn New Zealand, Tourism gross operating surplus (profit) looks to be about 20% from graph in https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/tourism-satel... As a share of the total number of people employed in New Zealand, direct tourism employment was 6.7 percent. I think the main problem with tourism is that it is a luxury service and tourism income shrinks when the world economy stinks. The other issue is that many tourists are rude and unthankful, so it can be unpleasant working in a service industry, being a servant to well-off tourists. New Zealand needs export income. Some of our product exports are worse for New Zealand than tourism (some farming particularly has negative effects and can have poor profits). I wonder if part of the reason why Barcelona has population growth is because it has tourism income and jobs? Remove tourism and what happens next? And it sucks in New Zealand that some of the most beautiful places are crowded and almost owned by tourists. Literally owned by tourists when we let foreigners buy property here and our current government wants to allow that again. reply kranke155 20 hours agorootparentThe pay in tourism is terrible, usually minimum wage, except for the owners of capital, who gain enormous returns on investing in hotels / airbnbs / tourist aimed businesses. That means it has an awful return for the ones most in need which are the poor. It’s not a distributive industry. On top of that, it can cause a “resource curse” type phenomenon where great beaches or some other attraction causes enormous amounts of investment in tourist infrastructure leading to a lack of opportunity for other businesses which could thrive with investment. Tourist gives you such great returns on investment it doesn’t make sense to do anything else if you have capital reply senordevnyc 18 hours agorootparentTourist gives you such great returns on investment it doesn’t make sense to do anything else if you have capital Yep, I'm considering buying a vacation home to Airbnb for this reason. I have mixed feelings about it though, because I don't want to be part of the problem. But I live in NYC and I can't move (shared custody), nor can I buy a suitable home in the city, meanwhile the national housing market is exploding. I need some way to hedge for real estate inflation, and vacation rentals have better ROI. reply dkasper 14 hours agorootparentThere should be easier ways to hedge real estate inflation than owning an airbnb. reply geonineties 13 hours agorootparentWouldnt a residential reit work for that?

Just that it’s not a particularly good industry for a country, particularly poor countries.

But it shouldn’t be in charge of that economy, in which case I’d say you’re looking at a “resource curse” type economy where only the rich prosper. reply JumpCrisscross 19 hours agorootparent> Can tourism be A PART of a healthy economy ? Sure. But it shouldn’t be in charge of that economy This is true of any sector. New York get volatile when over-reliant on FIRE; San Francisco goes into a depression when valuations dip. Also, this is a story about Barcelona. An industrial city. Tourism is a minority. reply atoav 9 hours agorootparentprevHaving lived in two tourism-heavy cities over my life, I don't think most cites are fundamentally opposed to tourism per se. But — and that is a big \"But\" it is a question of the amount and the kind of tourism. Too much of the wrong tourism in the wrong area of the city can be a negative thing for living quality, for life outside touristic seasons, for the general development of neighborhoods etc. So it is within a cities interest to have some degree of control ofer the amount and kind of tourism. And controlling the number of accommodations is a pretty good lever. reply chipdart 3 hours agorootparent> Too much of the wrong tourism in the wrong area of the city can be a negative thing for living quality, for life outside touristic seasons, for the general development of neighborhoods etc. If that was really a concern, cities like Barcelona would be railing against hostels and would impose a higher baseline for tourist taxes to eliminate the economic feasibility of projects catering to low-cost party tourism. reply oyashirochama 22 hours agorootparentprevTourism has its uses, and is a service industry like most modern country industries including most \"productive\" ones. reply syspec 22 hours agorootparentprevI know your comment is a \"hot take\", but the thing is about Tourism as an industry, is that the places where that /is/ the industry end up not gaining any other industries. So they become stuck as a \"tourism\" industry place reply phatfish 21 hours agorootparentSimilar to a country sitting on a large amount of natural resources like oil/gas. You don't have to bother about making your population productive. Allowed all your productive jobs to be offshored? Mine the natural resource of tourists, as long as there was a golden age that left something interesting for them to visit. reply kranke155 20 hours agorootparentThat’s exactly right. It is exactly like oil and “resource curse”, for many poor countries. The pay is generally minimum wage and the only ones who see big returns are the owners of capital. It’s not a distributive industry. If you have too much of your country’s economy invested, I’d say you’re almost always looking at an unhealthy economy. reply dnissley 20 hours agorootparentI would argue that while there are some similarities, there are also many differences, and that claiming it's not distributive is incorrect. The number of workers I interact with (and to whom the money I spend flows) as a tourist is quite large compared to the number of people who benefit from use of an extracted natural resource. reply kranke155 19 hours agorootparentIt’s not as bad, but fundamentally the vast majority of tourism workers earn minimum wage. So you can have some tourism to keep some people employed, sure. But if it’s +15-20% of your economy, I’m not sure that’s a good idea. reply chipdart 3 hours agorootparentprev> I know your comment is a \"hot take\", but the thing is about Tourism as an industry, is that the places where that /is/ the industry end up not gaining any other industries. This discussion is about Barcelona. Barcelona is one of the richest regions in Europe. It's hardly a third-world hellhole or a banana republic. reply chipdart 7 hours agorootparentprev> Tourism is a shit industry. You could mostly annihilate it and replace it with productive things most of the time. That's a bold statement, as if the whole world invests in tourism because they don't know better. Spain's tourism sector represents a double-digit chunk of their GDP and is one of the rare sectors which has a direct effect in reducing unemployment, specially in the low-skilled, NEET cohort which is extremely problematic in countries such as Spain. Claiming that a country like Spain could simply annihilate it and replace it with something else is an extraordinary thing to say, specially as it lacks any support. reply Retric 20 hours agorootparentprevThey don’t need a long term solution. The larger context is Spain’s population is flat with declines in the last 24 months and trend likely to continue in the coming decades. Barcelona’s population peaked in 1979 and only recently recovered to the level seen in 1990. So they likely don’t actually need to add significant housing long term. Freeing up AirBnB apartments in the short term looks like a reasonable solution until population decline kicks in and removes the need for extra housing. https://datacommons.org/place/wikidataId/Q1492?utm_medium=ex... reply chipdart 7 hours agorootparentprev> I think it's fair to say I'm being dramatic by saying it's a drop in the bucket. I don't think it's dramatic. The whole anti-tourist arguments are based on, to put it charitably, politically-motivated specious reasoning. In this particular example, this whole argument is based on these assumptions: * making available each and every single one of those 15k houses for long-term rentals or sales instead of making them available for short-term rentals would prevent or significantly attenuate the existing housing crisis, * Demand for short-term rentals has no positive impact on the housing market by creating demand for real estate investments and urban renewal programmes, * Regulating away short-term rentals would not shift demand to classic HORECA offerings, which results in replacing whole residential buildings or even city blocks right in the city center. See for example Hotel Arts Barcelona or W Barcelona. The whole anti-tourist sentiment is based on nonsense, like assuming that just because a luxury suite is on AirBnB it would otherwise be made available as affordable housing for working-class family. And should I point out the \"tourists go home, refugees welcomed\" self-defeating propaganda piece? reply diggan 7 hours agorootparent> * making available each and every single one of those 15k houses for long-term rentals or sales instead of making them available for short-term rentals would prevent or significantly attenuate the existing housing crisis, We can maybe both agree that doing something is better than doing nothing? Hopefully this is just one of the steps in a larger plan. Not a single thing will solve the current issues, but a combination of steps just might. At least someone is trying, which is a step in the right direction. > Regulating away short-term rentals would not shift demand to classic HORECA offerings, which results in replacing whole residential buildings or even city blocks right in the city center. See for example Hotel Arts Barcelona or W Barcelona. How is Hotel Arts or Hotel W examples of replacing whole residential buildings or city blocks? Both of them were built on previous undeveloped land (or sea in the case of Hotel W) and were new constructions when built, not reformations of existing buildings. > The whole anti-tourist sentiment is based on nonsense People's feelings are always \"nonsense\" if seen from a scientific/engineering perspective. People are hurt in numerous ways, and try to put the blame somewhere. They're being priced out of their homes, they see AirBnbs all over the place and you cannot walk outside without hearing loud tourists screaming in English and being awful, hard to blame people from drawing the lines between these things. reply chipdart 4 hours agorootparent> We can maybe both agree that doing something is better than doing nothing? Yes, that's the whole point. Doing something clearly better than doing nothing. Railing against short-term rentals does absolutely nothing to fix the problem. That does not grant anyone the right of fabricating scapegoats that do nothing to solve the actual problem. This is exactly what's happening regarding short-term rentals. Blaming short-term rentals for the lack of affordable housing is one of the stupidest and miopoc scapegoats that can ever be put together. Airbnb is not the reason why your neighbor rents the apartment. Airbnb is not attracting new tourists. Worst-case scenario, Airbnb eats away at the profit margins of industrial-grade hotels. The lack of affordable housing is caused by the lack of real estate investment, urban renewal programs, and even social housing. If most want to buy an apartment but they can't afford one, that's a telltale sign of short supply. You only fix this problem by significantly increasing supply. It's also a politically motivated scapegoat. Barcelona's previous mayor built her whole platform on that scapegoat. She could have implemented urban renewal programs to actually increase the number of homes available in the market, she could have implemented public transportation programs to bring mass transit to low-density areas to attract private investment, she could have created a municipal tax on short-term rental to finance social housing programs or even subsidized low-income rental programs, etc. But no. She did absolutely nothing even though the railed frequently against short-term rentals. Because that's the point: fabricate a convenient scapegoat to direct and focus the anger of the electorate. But that same electorate is only mobilized as long as the housing problem prevails, and thus they do absolutely nothing to fix it. > How is Hotel Arts or Hotel W examples of replacing whole residential buildings or city blocks? They aren't.

Not to mention that most tourists don't even sit around the local area, but rather go to the city attractions. Airbnb and resident housing areas are just not compatible, they have different needs and require different infrastructure. Hotels are built around infrastructure supporting tourism and are much healthier for cities. reply TheOtherHobbes 21 hours agorootparentAnd then there's the effect on property prices. AirBnBs charge international prices, which creates a property market skewed by international investment. I live in a tourist area, and prices here have gone up by between 100% at the low end to over 500% at the high end. These are mostly holiday homes and holiday rentals, and the locals can't afford to live here any more - either renting or buying. One of the results has been a huge political shift rightwards, with increasing hostility to tourists and immigrants.

The only other thing that offers this feature set is private rooms in hostels, and those are both rare and nearly always fully booked.

Pricing is primarily driven by the immediate demand and supply situation at a given time. Small changes in availability can have a dramatic effect. Good ways to understand this is to look at underlying data of auctions (richest in data) but pretty much any demand supply granular transaction data will show rhis. For eg. this is why small hoarding locally in emerging markets (where giant supermarkets will not immediately or easily truck in containers of products running short) also generates massive profits for traders. Housing is of course a bit more complex - pricing is more sticky on the upside than downside (as home owners don't like to rent for less than before and may let units sit idle etc) and \"instant\" usually windows over weeks but fundamentally similar mechanics work. As an example, in Singapore, the government raised excise duty for non Singaporeans to purchase housing to 65% when housing became overheated. The number of rich foreigners buying property has always been small in absolute but was growing fast in rate as rich family money and bankers from Hong Kong started flowing to Singapore. Prices and also rentals across all classes of housing, not just the super premium properties favoured by the wealthy came down and people who had been pushed down at the margins into less than their preferred value housing (including ourselves) moved back up. reply lostlogin 23 hours agoparentprevFor what it’s worth, it’s a little closer than your numbers imply.

But again, it's kind of a pointless endeavor, because of the arbitrary nature of the boundaries chosen -- why Paris and not Paris metro? etc. I guess ideally you'd have a function density(person) giving you the population density of any given person and you'd want to look at the distribution of that function, specifically the average per country of that function. reply barrkel 21 hours agorootparentThe question being raised in this thread is if Spain has dense housing.

They’ve also added a land tax on second homes to disincentivize hoarding of property (though this has had some perverse effects, notably, reducing long-term rental stock and moving into the owner-occupier segment). It’s too early to evaluate outcomes, but this general approach seems more sensible than an outright ban.

Objectively, this policy should be good for what it purports to do: reduce housing prices for permanent residents. This policy actually impacts both supply, forcing these 10k units to either languish unproductive or return to market as rental units or for sale, and demand, reducing sales demand for conversion to short term rentals. Now, will this actually make a huge difference? Probably not. It’s only 10k units at most that return to the market in a city of 1.6M that likely has a lot of demand. reply davidw 23 hours agoparentprev> I’d assume that the solution is to build more housing to increase the supply Demand for tourist housing is probably a bit more elastic than for residential housing, so it'll probably help a bit, but in general, I agree that growing the pie is better than bitter fights over how to cut the pie up. reply chongli 23 hours agorootparentElasticity of demand is the elephant in the room for build-more-housing advocates. Let's say NYC's mayor rubbed a genie's lamp and wished to double the city's housing supply overnight. Yes, rental and real estate prices would crash through the floor due to the glut of supply. But then millions of people would move to the city and buy up all that supply. This would rapidly double the population of the city which would cause tons of businesses to move there to hire everyone and then commercial real estate would skyrocket. At the end of the day, the city would be twice as large and more overcrowded than ever. Sure, they'd be more efficient in terms of infrastructure (plumbing, electricity, transit) but rents would skyrocket to capture that extra efficiency for landlords. reply davidw 23 hours agorootparentThe elephant in the room for people who are against building enough housing is that they're all convinced that everyone would move to their particular locale. I have heard that \"everyone\" would move to * San Francisco * Bend, Oregon * Boulder, Colorado * Seattle * Austin, Texas * New York City * Santa Barbara, California * Hawaii * Montana * and on and on and on You know what? No, not everyone is going to move to New York or Bend or San Francisco. Building more housing keeps rents in check. And if some more people get to live in a place they want to be, that is a good thing. reply chongli 22 hours agorootparentIf you could get all cities to build more housing simultaneously then you’d be in great shape. The question is: how do you do that? Most of the biggest problems facing humanity are coordination problems. The answer to all these problems can’t be “everyone should just do X.” In reality, your best hope is to get one city to build a lot of housing. Then everyone moves there and we’re all unhappy. This, by the way, is the reason homelessness is so bad in San Francisco despite their government spending enormous amounts of money fighting homelessness.

But there's also something of a ratchet effect as places copy what's working in other places. And no one reforming because they're all waiting would be catastrophic. And really, not everyone is going to move somewhere. You could not pay me enough to live in NYC or San Francisco. People who love NYC would probably be bored in my small city. Burdensome parking mandates are being eliminated or reduced across the country, as one example.

Not likely, they'd just pay more to hotels (and thus have less money to spend on other things - vacation budget is usually limited, but it's distribution between various types of expense is not predetermined). Would it make Barcelona a less popular destination for non-natives? Not likely, unless it objectively becomes worse place for natives too. NYC, Barcelona and any major city that hasn't gone the way of SF and Portland, have the same problem - a lot of people like to be there, either temporarily or permanently, but the number of accommodations, both temporary and permanent, is not infinitely scalable and runs out pretty fast, especially if the city managers aren't actively working on fixing that problem by increasing the supply - which they often don't. Increasing the supply is hard and leads to a tangle of its own challenges. Blaming somebody else - especially somebody that doesn't even vote in the local elections - is much easier, and by the time it turns out it doesn't help - which will be some 10 years ago from now - the managers could fail upwards, retire or think about some other scapegoat to blame. reply walterbell 23 hours agoparentprev> rent in NYC hasn’t gone down NYC hotel and housing prices have been artificially inflated by government buying accommodations for homeless during 2020/2021, then migrants. reply lostlogin 23 hours agorootparentSo prices have been inflated by people living in them?

No washer-driers, no elevators, but a good number of mice and rats. You could absolutely take these buildings down and build back something better. And that better could have more apartment units. I live in one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in NYC and in the world. All buildings are new (post 2000). If you replace the rest of the city with such buildings, you can certainly have enough housing for 30 million people. But the foreign investors don't buy to come and live here. You can just build, sell, and not deal with the crowding. And that could result in lower construction costs too. Why are new apartments so expensive? Because we don't know how to build anymore.

At its current size the city seems to have hit a sweet spot of desirability which caused prices to skyrocket, and it brings a lot of tourist money to the same residents who are protesting.

Two categories where people don't want pricing to go down: If you have plans to move and prices aren't falling everywhere, the proceeds of a sale aren't enough to buy elsewhere.

In many places they're based on property value, and in many of those places if your property value goes down you can apply to have your home re-assessed and get taxed according to the new value.

Spain is not the US. Neither Spain nor any other Mediterranean country has large surface area that could accommodate housing demand at such high levels - there is already scarce land that you can build on across the Mediterranean as there are limited shorelines and deltas that were created by rivers etc, and the rest is immediately mountainous or hilly landscape that is very difficult to build on. These countries could easily cope with their local demand, but allowing foreigners to buy housing caused a large influx of foreigners exacerbating the demand for housing and crowding out these places way beyond their capacity. The investment funds that scoop up housing to profit worsen the situation. Maybe the US could handle such a demand with its gigantic surface area - solely Texas is larger than ENTIRE Western Europe, mind that. Or Russia. Or China. But other countries in the world, especially the Mediterranean ones, don't have the space to even start comparing with those. The only solution is to limit the demand to the carrying capacity of each locale, province and country. reply ilikeitdark 22 hours agoprevI've been living in Barcelona for a long time.

It's because the rising interest rates cratered the buyers' budgets -- the result is a mild downward trend in prices, definitely no crash. Building companies sit on a large supply on finished unsold apartments but steadfastly refuse to lower prices even a bit. New construction has halted completely. Seems like the construction sector will rather hold their finished stock and wait for the demand side to pick up due to necessity (people still move in to the city), or due to interest rates eventually going down. reply pembrook 21 hours agorootparent“Oversupply” is in the eye of the beholder. There’s a market clearing price for everything. The builders can hold out for a while, but the shoe has to drop eventually. Builders only make profit when building, and if your credit is extended on old projects you can’t start new ones, hence why construction has halted. The problem is covid. Pretty much everyone in any developed economy believes the inflation+interest rate increases will be temporary. So they’re betting inflation will go back to what it was, interest rate policy will loosen again, and people’s budgets will increase again. I think they might be in for a very rude awakening. And not only that, housing preferences for the highest income professionals have fundamentally changed due to WFH. They could all get stuck dumping the wrong stock on a weak market all at the same time in a year or so. reply distances 20 hours agorootparentIndeed, it's a waiting game now.

Even though the professional AirBnB hosts are doing all the functions that hotels do. Why not the reverse. reply mjhay 23 hours agorootparentThey recognize it exists. I'm even hearing podcast ads from Marriot or similar touting how much more reliable they are. AirBnBs I've stayed in the past few years have all been janky, weird, and not really any cheaper than hotels. I don't have to do chores at hotels, and I can always get (and return) the key promptly. I've also been told on several occasions not to let anyone else in the building know I was an AirBnB guest. AirBnB used to be better, but the advent of \"professional hosts\" with many properties really degraded things. They often have the typical landlord mentality of expecting a lot of reward with little work or risk. reply bpodgursky 22 hours agorootparent> AirBnBs I've stayed in the past few years have all been janky, weird, and not really any cheaper than hotels And yet, you stay in them. reply Clamchop 22 hours agorootparentHow else would you make or reaffirm a first-hand impression?

I will go out of my way to avoid them if it's all up to me. reply r00fus 21 hours agorootparentprevIf you have a family of 5 or more, hotel rooms suck - either someone sleeps on the floor or you have to find a \"suite\" that accommodates that. Or multiple rooms. The major travel sites all push you to multiple rooms - but lots of hotels now don't have \"adjoining room\" access (compared to say 30 years ago), and in one case, our 2 rooms were on different floors because of check-in time. The travel sites are picking up on this and competing with airbnb as well. Typically my experience with those rented homes is a) cheaper than airbnb and b) better service. However, I'm sure they are the same type of superhost company that would be banned in Barcelona. reply bpodgursky 20 hours agorootparentYeah I choose AirBnbs that have a bedroom for kids aren't impossible to cosleep in.

Additionally, they provide 24/7 reception, a breakfast room, optional maid service, much like a hotel. This has become a popular option in Europe recently. reply xvaier 23 hours agorootparentprevThey do exist and are increasingly common for new hotel builds, at least where I live. Here is an example of one in Montréal that I stayed in last autumn: https://griffintownhotel.com/en-us/apartments/ reply abdullahkhalids 22 hours agorootparentThese still look [1] like artificial sanitized places.

As soulless as a hotel room, sometimes more if they're trying to seem personal but clearly aren't. reply laGrenouille 22 hours agorootparentprevHotels with similar amenities are usually priced at absurdly high rates for corporate clients. The place you linked to has the equivalent of a studio apartment with no laundry machine going for over 9000 CAD for a month. AirBnB has plenty of one bedrooms going for a third of that. reply jfim 23 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you mean by a hotel that feels like an Airbnb? If you want to stay at a place that has a kitchen, and multiple bedrooms, there are suite hotels (eg. Homewood suites) and extended stay hotels. If you want someone to host you, then a bed and breakfast is another type of accommodation. reply JoshTriplett 23 hours agorootparentThere's a wide variety of possibilities here: - Not wanting staff or service. - Wanting something that looks and feels like a home rather than a hotel room. This isn't available everywhere. - Wanting something that isn't shared with a bunch of other hotel guests. (Aside: I have no problems with apartment buildings banning AirBnB/VRBO, because that's much more \"cheap hotel substitute that might bother neighbors\" than \"unique offering that isn't likely to bother anyone\".) - In general, wanting something unique that doesn't tend to exist as a hotel. reply Jaecen 23 hours agorootparentprevIt's difficult to quantify. Perhaps it's something as intangible as a space optimized for _living_ (like an apartment) as opposed to a space optimized for _profit_ (like a hotel). Whatever the case, despite the existence of the options you list, Airbnb's are still popular. There's clearly some significant differentiator between them and an Airbnb. reply abdullahkhalids 22 hours agorootparentIt's definitely the vibe. A lot of it is how the space is decorated. The random assortment of furniture and other stuff in an AirBnB contributes quite a lot to the atmosphere people are looking for. But there is a psychology to it that is, as you say, hard to pin dow. A hotel that has a random assortment of plates and cutlery in the kitchen (like my last AirBnB did) would feel cheap and tacky. The AirBnB didn't. reply distances 22 hours agorootparentprevOr, holiday homes. These are furnished short term rental apartments with kitchens, often washing machines and dishwashers, etc. Common in parts of Europe. But at least in Germany they are well regulated and you actually sign a rental contract for your stay. I suspect that makes them a lot less accessible for tourists from abroad. reply ebiester 22 hours agorootparentprevAs far as I can tell, these do not exist in any meaningful number in Barcelona. They also rarely exist in city centers, at least everywhere I've seen in Europe. That's why entire buildings were turned into AirBNB. reply jupp0r 23 hours agorootparentprev1. An actual kitchen that's good for cooking complex meals. This is great for family trips on holidays. 2. 3+ bedrooms. Good luck finding that in Hotels. 3.

Then you gave the budget hotels with skeleton staff and almost no common areas and facilities What do you mean exactly by \"feels like an Airbnb\"? reply rokhayakebe 23 hours agorootparentprevI recently stayed in aparthotels in Milan and Casabalanca. It was fantastic. reply notacoward 21 hours agorootparentprevI don't know if you meant specifically in Barcelona, but I'm in just such a unit in Montreal as I type this. Physically it's a 2BR apartment, with its own washer/dryer and full (though small) kitchen, but it's booked and run as a hotel. There's hotel-like housekeeping, not a note hidden somewhere that says I have to clean up myself before leaving or incur a hefty extra cleaning fee (on top of the one that's already buried elsewhere in the fine print). There's not much of a lobby, no concierge, no room-service menu, so it's not a four star hotel, but I'd still say it's a hotel that feels like an AirBnB and I think places like this are rapidly taking over that part of the market. The move that Barcelona just made might actually be kind of like closing the barn door after the horses have escaped. Good political theater, I guess, but not really moving things in a direction they weren't already going. reply senordevnyc 17 hours agorootparentIt's a little unclear to me why this category wouldn't escape regulation, since it's clearly just an entire apartment building where they converted each apartment to an Airbnb for economies of scale around cleaning, maintenance, etc. They're displacing just as many residents as the same number of equivalent Airbnbs spread around a neighborhood. Whereas most traditional hotels feel purpose built for that and couldn't easily be apartments. reply notacoward 16 hours agorootparentWhen talking about a matter of law or regulation, phrases like \"feel purpose built\" don't carry a lot of weight. Looking at legal definitions of \"hotel\" across many jurisdictions, it looks like a lot of of them center on the concept of temporary or transient usage. Intent to operate on that basis also shows up fairly often too. Here's a handy compilation (NB not the only source I consulted). https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/hotel Note that style of construction does not seem to be a factor. Many hotels offer freestanding villas or cabins, practically small (sometimes even not so small) houses, and have for a long time. Chains like Residence Inn, Homewood Suites, or Extended Stay America have likewise offered hotel accommodation in the physical form of an apartment for almost as long. Personally, I think the inclusion of housekeeping services during a stay is a big differentiator, perhaps because it demonstrates intent to serve a transient clientele. By contrast, a \"dual use\" house or apartment that is owner occupied part of the time and rented out part of the time does not show such intent. Neither do the illegal sublets that are behind many Airbnb rentals. In other words, the physical similarity between a suite hotel (like the one I'm in) and apartments doesn't seem determinative. Rather, what seems to matter is the financial difference between a nightly (or perhaps weekly) guest vs. a longer term lessee. I'm not saying whether it's right or wrong, but it does explain why different types of levels of regulation are applicable to each. P.S. The ones \"escaping regulation\" are the Airbnbs, not the hotels. Hotels are subject to much more stringent standards wrt safety, sanitation, privacy, billing, etc. reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparent>Personally, I think the inclusion of housekeeping services during a stay is a big differentiator, perhaps because it demonstrates intent to serve a transient clientele. Yes, although a lot of hotels moved away from daily service during the pandemic and stayed there. Which is just fine by me. If I were to stay longer than a week I'd probably cast my lodging net a bit wider. But hotels (or regular B&Bs, especially outside of cities) meet my needs pretty well for the most part. I have used AirBnB but I'm guessing the standard deviation is higher though I haven't had a bad (small sample) experience. Even laundry which a number of people mention isn't really a big deal for the most part. I tend to optimize things that can be given a quick wash in the sink. I have stayed in ApartHotels with a laundry room and at B&Bs that will run a cheap load for you for longer trips involving more mud etc. And I've used a wash and fold place on a few occasions. Even as a very light packer, I've never felt the need to do laundry every few days. reply mattrighetti 23 hours agoparentprev> Tourists should sleep in hotels and locals should sleep in their flats. What if we let people decide what they should/n't do with their own property instead? reply thinkingtoilet 23 hours agorootparentBecause we're adults that realize garbage dumps shouldn't be next to schools. And sometimes as society we make decisions that are good for the majority of people. I'm sure you'd love it if someone poisoned your ground water, but they did it by burying toxic materials on their property. reply mattrighetti 22 hours agorootparentWhen Airbnb landlords won't rent to locals at all because it's not convenient enough for them do so what will you do for the good of the majority of the people? Forcefully seize their apartment because people need it? reply lnrd 22 hours agorootparentThat's very hyperbolized. It's still convenient to them, just less profitable. If they have mortgages less profit is better than no profit in all scenarios. I knew an Airbnb host in Italy, he shared with me that by renting to tourist compared to the normal market prices to locals he would make 3 times more. It's a no brainer, but he would gladly accept 1/3 of that if the alternative is 0 (and he did during the pandemic when tourism stopped)",

Do your InfoSec teams sign off on it? What's the risk of downloading what's supposed to be a release binary of this off GitHub, where the release binary includes something nefarious not found in the open codebase, that steals your company's source code when you use it to compile? In today's geopolitical climate, how does anyone trust non-Western projects? reply 9dev 4 hours agoprevSo, I decided to try this for a real-world project and compare the results. This is for a full production build with no cache, taking the best of three runs each. Vite: 2166 modules transformed. built in 28.21s Farm: [ Farm ] Build completed in 13350ms FULL EXTREME! Resources emitted to ./dist. [ Farm ] Public directory resources copied successfully. So that is 28.21s vs. 13.35s, or a 53% decrease in build times. This is certainly neat, but I'm not sure whether it is worth the dependency on a new player. reply threecheese 59 minutes agoparentA halving of build time, for even a medium volume project, could be a big cost reduction. If those builds were much longer than 30sec, compounding through a CI pipeline with many changes, leads to much shorter cycle times, faster time to prod, faster to find and fix defects, which translates to much more than just infra cost reduction benefits. I created a visualization once, of the release pipeline for a big project, showing the feedback loops that exist and the compounding effects of small improvements like that. It was eye opening for me, and everybody. reply kamikaz1k 49 minutes agoparentprevBuild time isn’t the only benefit, but consider that the author is from ByteDance and how large their projects are. Another important callout is how in Vite, native ESM modules are used in dev which makes it very slow for large apps with thousands of modules. So cold start of dev can be important too. In practice HMR is mostly what you need and Vite has it covered. But slow tends to accumulate slow. reply TikolaNesla 9 hours agoprevI have mixed feelings about this project. It appears the author primarily aimed to rewrite Vite in Rust and then found justifications for doing so. From my experience, Vite is already sufficiently fast for most needs. Adopting a new and potentially unstable project for marginal performance improvements doesn't seem justifiable. reply klabb3 7 hours agoparentAnother way to view it: slow builds is a poor man’s feature, that punishes you for bringing in too many deps. The JS ecosystem (speaking as an omnivore using many languages) suffers two big problems: 1. Tooling is too fragmented and complex and poorly designed. This includes even the standard tools and formats like npm and package.json. 2. There’s a weak culture of API stability. Leave a project for 3 months and there are new config files, plugin formats, etc. It’s improving slowly through standardization with things like ES modules. But it’s still a Wild West. reply sroussey 2 hours agorootparentWe could have locked down all the libraries, APIs, and tools to what they were in 1999, but then people would complain about that. :p But really, you can just use skip it all and write your own code.

I started using esbuild instead via its Typescript lib, but then noticed I was spending a lot of time working around the problems with the JS ecosystem (terrible file system watcher in node.js, lots of underpar libraries and as someone not intimate with every domain, it's nearly impossible to know which library may be well written and maintained without spending lots of time investigating, weird APIs, silent errors, I just can't believe some people can cope with all of this instead of just moving to a saner language).... and as esbuild is written in Go, I rewrote my code in Go and now it's much, much nicer to work on, much faster, can be shipped as a single binary etc. If there was a bundler written in Rust I might have chosen that, as despite not having anything against Go, the momentum seems to be strongly shifting to Rust (and even in the little Go I did, I already feel the pain of its error handling), and Rust definitely gives you better tools to write reliably applications. reply mark38848 12 hours agorootparentprevBun would be cool if it worked.

What specific optimizations do these tools offer that others can't, and why can't the slower tools simply adopt these optimizations in future updates? Is this a result of a lack of consensus within the community, leading to the creation of new forked tools, or is there a larger strategic context that I'm missing? reply rty32 9 hours agoparentWant to understand this as well. I was looking at using Rust for some static analysis of JavaScript files recently. My impression is that despite there being multiple parsers written in Rust -- the ones in swc, rslint and maybe others -- they are not as production ready as something like acorn, in terms of passing test262, features, documentation, and simply the amount of example code out there. There are bugs like https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2038 that haven't been fixed after a few years. (I am aware that swc is \"production-ready\" in the sense that it is already used by Next.js, but that's not a high bar if you look at all the fallbacks and limitations) These projects also seem to be very broad but don't have enough developers to support them. They are aiming to provide an \"all-in-one\" solution with the parser, transpiler, bundler etc all in one place. Which means they have perhaps too much work to do. While in the current JavaScript ecosystem, there are many projects for each part of the toolchain, the unexpected upside is that there are many people working on one thing to make it really good. Just look at webpack. It's not the best thing out there, but the sheer amount of features and the support for almost every use case is amazing. For parsers, acorn is very good, because the author can focus on the parser instead of also working on the bundler. As an end user, I would much rather see effort concentrated to make the toolchain really good to make it more production ready, rather than seeing another tool popping up. reply magnio 8 hours agorootparent> There are bugs like https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/2038 that haven't been fixed after a few years.

But if that's true, it's the problem isn't it? If some of the most important information about a critical part of the toolchain isn't up-to-date, how can I have confidence in this? (Also for my specific use case, I need to set an ecmascript version, something that is common in JS based parsers, but it's not available in swc ecma parser. At least I didn't find it.) For context, I contributed to acorn to fix an issue I found while using it in one of my projects. But that happened because I extensively used acorn in the first place. I don't quite have the confidence to adopt these Rust based tools yet. reply genuine_smiles 8 hours agorootparentprev> They are aiming to provide an \"all-in-one\" solution with the parser, transpiler, bundler etc all in one place.

The performance gains in the recent past have mostly been due to moving away from single-threaded JavaScript to multi-threaded compiled languages. This requires a complete rewrite, so existing tools rarely take this step. We see this optimization in Farm alongside \"partial bundling,\" which strikes a performance-optimal balance between full bundling (Webpack) and no bundling (Vite) in development. Vite abstracts over a preconfigured set of \"lower-level\" frontend build tools consisting of a mixture of older single-threaded JavaScript tools and newer multi-threaded compiled language tools. Vite can adopt the partial bundling of Farm, but dispensing with its remaining JavaScript tools is a major breaking update. reply genuine_smiles 11 hours agorootparent> The performance gains in the recent past have mostly been due to moving away from single-threaded JavaScript to multi-threaded compiled languages. This is overly simplistic. Parcel had far better performance than Webpack before they added native code or threading.

I struggled with the ordering since each section is somewhat mutually dependent; this is arranged more like a thematic history than a chronological one. Tree-shaking naturally fits under bundling, and I'm afraid that explaining it earlier will make tree-shaking's explanation itself contextless since without bundling there is nothing to tree shake.

They're the same but that actually tells you what it is. reply egeozcan 6 hours agorootparentTree shaking is the removal of unused exports, a very specific thing for JS. Dead code elimination is a broader term which includes tree shaking, but is usually used for the elimination of code after the compilation (or transpilation/minification in js/ts case) in the front-end world. A practical example would be that tree-shaking wouldn't remove the variable b in \"export function foo(x) { let b = 10; let a = 20; return x + a; }\" but if this export isn't imported anywhere, then it would remove the whole function definition. Uglify.js, which does dead code elimination would remove the unused b variable. reply aaaaaaabbbbbb 12 hours agorootparentprevSince tree-shaking is a common term across frontend build tooling documentation, I adopted it as well. Dead code elimination in its traditional form also runs during code minification, which is a separate build step from bundler tree shaking. Having separate terms avoids ambiguity. reply snthpy 12 hours agorootparentprevThank you for this. This looks like just what I was looking for! reply snthpy 13 hours agoparentprev+1 for this. I've just watched some videos on this but it's still nebulous to me. It has something to do with hydration, and bundling only components used in the app, but making it compatible with ES modules while also allowing for hot reloading of your app during development, ... or something like that.

And that the JS community attaches a lot more importance/status/recognition (or uses social media to talk about the ecosystem more, and that leads to the former?) than happens in other languages. Rust and Ruby too, to a lesser extent. But you don't see this nearly as much in Python or C++ or Go IMO. (I can name Guido van Rossum and Herb Sutter. But who wrote pytest for example? If it were Javascript and I used it I'm sure I'd know. And fwiw I've worked professionally with python for years and not really JS much at all, but I'd recognise more JS names and hear about people far more for JS than python.) reply Muromec 8 hours agoparentprevThere is webpack, it's bloated, tedious to configure, slow and does breaking changes in configuration with every version. Configuration is basically write only, then don't touch and hop it still works after minor upgrade. It does solve the whole development cycle from dev server with hot reload (which on a usual fe project is subtly broken half the time). Then there are wrappers for webpack to provide sane defaults to end user. Then there are library bundlers, which don't solve the same problem as webpack. There is also vite which doesn't bundle for dev environment, but serves individual modules separately and is fast. Why webpack is bloated you ask? Well, because there isn't single javascript, but a mixed bag of esm, commonjs, vue, ts, css, scss and whatnot used in a combination with one another (you can have a vue file which contains ts script and scss styles and a vue file with javascript which imports ts file and css modules). Webpack tries to solve all that, plus caching and developer webserver, but relies on plugins to do a lot of stuff. So yeah, dutch tape, a lot of. Then somebody decides it's enough and tries to rewrite the whole thing is rust because it's faster and implements 80% of their own needs on day 1, but gets burned by the long tail of annoying issues. Since it's not a product in itself, somebody has to sponsor it or make in-house thing and opensource. In-house mainters could move to a next bigcorp and the new shiny thing will not go forward with original vision and same enthousiasm. So yeah, welcome to frontend.

They have a WeChat group, and a QQ address. So I’m going to assume they are based in China. This Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_(business) has a list of abbreviations used for incorporated businesses. For example in Norway we use “AS” (Aksjeselskap). In Germany GmbH (“Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung”, limited liability company), and AG (\"Aktiengesellschaft\", business association with shares), are the most similar to the corporations in the US. In the UK they have a bunch of different ones. China uses WFOE (or WOFE), to refer to a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise (WFOE). This is the most popular form of business entity for foreign investors wanting to set up a company in China; it is a limited liability company. The article doesn’t mention what Chinese owned companies in China use as abbreviation. In fact, on the whole list as far as I can see it seems that only three countries use the abbreviation “Inc”: USA, Canada, and the Philippines. The article as a whole only mentions a few countries though, so I had a look elsewhere as well. Another website talks specifically about Chinese company structures. https://learn.sayari.com/understanding-chinese-corporate-str... > In China, the limited liability company (LLC; in Chinese, 有限责任公司 or 有限公司) structure is generally for smaller and less restricted companies. Chinese LLCs may not have more than 50 shareholders > company limited by shares (股份有限公司 or 股份公司) structure is generally used by larger companies, including publicly traded companies (which must be companies limited by shares) > One-Person Limited Liability Company (一人有限责任公司) This type of corporation has similar rights and responsibilities to a standard LLC, but may only be established by a natural person. And quite a few different ones in addition to those, but none using “Inc” as abbreviation. Back to the topic of countries where Inc is used. 1. United States: The most prominent user of \"Inc.\" for incorporated entities. 2. Canada: \"Inc.\" is commonly used alongside \"Ltd.\" (Limited). 3. Philippines: Companies frequently use \"Inc.\" to indicate incorporation. 4. Australia: Although \"Pty Ltd\" (Proprietary Limited) is more common, \"Inc.\" can also be used for non-profit organizations. 5. New Zealand: Similar to Australia, \"Inc.\" is used for non-profit entities. 6. Japan: The term \"Kabushiki Kaisha\" (K.K.) is the standard, but \"Inc.\" is sometimes seen in international contexts. 7. South Korea: The term \"주식회사\" (Jusikhoesa) is typical, but \"Inc.\" is occasionally used for international recognition. 8. Taiwan: Companies might use \"Inc.\" in English contexts, though the local term is \"有限公司\" (Youxian Gongsi). These countries utilize \"Inc.\" to denote an incorporated company, often within international business contexts. Anyway. If they really are an incorporated company I think it would be helpful to mention what country they are incorporated in, and provide some kind of registration number that you can use for looking up details about the company. And conversely, if they are not an actual incorporated business then don’t pretend to be. reply evantbyrne 5 hours agorootparentYeah it doesn't exist under that name in the US or China, so the obvious conclusion is that it's a fake name given to make it look more American. reply c0balt 8 hours agoparentprevTheir GitHub Org profile, https://github.com/farm-fe, marks them as Chinese.

    "originBody": "Your Own Constant Folder in C/C++ 2024-03-21Neil Henning I was talking with someone today that really really wanted the sqrtps to be used in some code they were writing. And because of a quirk with clang (still there as of clang 18.1.0), if you happened to use -ffast-math clang would butcher the use of the intrinsic. So for the code: __m128 test(const __m128 vec) { return _mm_sqrt_ps(vec); } Clang would compile it correctly without fast-math: test:# @test sqrtps xmm0, xmm0 ret And create this monstrosity with -ffast-math: .LCPI0_0: .long 0xbf000000 # float -0.5 .long 0xbf000000 # float -0.5 .long 0xbf000000 # float -0.5 .long 0xbf000000 # float -0.5 .LCPI0_1: .long 0xc0400000 # float -3 .long 0xc0400000 # float -3 .long 0xc0400000 # float -3 .long 0xc0400000 # float -3 test: rsqrtps xmm1, xmm0 movaps xmm2, xmm0 mulps xmm2, xmm1 movaps xmm3, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI0_0] # xmm3 = [-5.0E-1,-5.0E-1,-5.0E-1,-5.0E-1] mulps xmm3, xmm2 mulps xmm2, xmm1 addps xmm2, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI0_1] mulps xmm2, xmm3 xorps xmm1, xmm1 cmpneqps xmm0, xmm1 andps xmm0, xmm2 ret The optimization flow here in LLVM is: That under fast-math conditions, sqrt(x) == x * rsqrt(x), so it uses rsqrtps instead. But that has precision issues between Intel and AMD due to a high ULP tolerance for the rsqrtps instruction. So LLVM does two newton-raphson iterations anytime it calls rsqrtps to correct the precision between the CPU implementations. The ‘fix’ here is just to use inline assembly to guarantee you’ll get the instruction selection you want always: __m128 test(__m128 vec) { __asm__ (\"sqrtps %1, %0\" : \"=x\"(vec) : \"x\"(vec)); return vec; } But there is one additional thing I’d advocate you do if you need to use inline assembly - write your own constant folding. See the one downside to the inline assembly above is that if test is inlined and vec was a constant, it wouldn’t constant fold it. For example: __attribute__((always_inline)) __m128 test(__m128 vec) { __asm__ (\"sqrtps %1, %0\" : \"=x\"(vec) : \"x\"(vec)); return vec; } __m128 call_test() { return test(_mm_setr_ps(1.f, 2.f, 3.f, 4.f)); } Will produce: test: sqrtps xmm0, xmm0 ret .LCPI1_0: .long 0x3f800000 # float 1 .long 0x40000000 # float 2 .long 0x40400000 # float 3 .long 0x40800000 # float 4 call_test: movaps xmm0, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI1_0] # xmm0 = [1.0E+0,2.0E+0,3.0E+0,4.0E+0] sqrtps xmm0, xmm0 ret So that even under inlining, when we could have constant folded it away entirely, we are still calling sqrtps when we don’t have to. So what is the fix? LLVM has an intrinsic is_constant which can be got at via the Clang-supported GCC extension __builtin_constant_p. If we extend our test above to check when vec is constant, we can call _mm_sqrt_ps when it is constant, and benefit from the constant folder doing its thing and removing the call entirely. So our code becomes: __attribute__((always_inline)) __m128 test(__m128 vec) { if (__builtin_constant_p(vec)) { return _mm_sqrt_ps(vec); } __asm__ (\"sqrtps %1, %0\" : \"=x\"(vec) : \"x\"(vec)); return vec; } __m128 call_test() { return test(_mm_setr_ps(1.f, 2.f, 3.f, 4.f)); } And we get: call_test: movaps xmm0, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI11_0] # xmm0 = [1.0E+0,2.0E+0,3.0E+0,4.0E+0] sqrtps xmm0, xmm0 ret What the heck?! It hasn’t constant folded! Turns out GCC is a bit picky with this builtin, and it looks like LLVM has inherited that funky behaviour. You cannot use it with a vector - even though LLVM happily has the support in the IR for it. But there is a workaround, an ugly one: __attribute__((always_inline)) __m128 test(__m128 vec) { if (__builtin_constant_p(vec[0]) && __builtin_constant_p(vec[1]) && __builtin_constant_p(vec[2]) && __builtin_constant_p(vec[3])) { return _mm_sqrt_ps(vec); } __asm__ (\"sqrtps %1, %0\" : \"=x\"(vec) : \"x\"(vec)); return vec; } __m128 call_test() { return test(_mm_setr_ps(1.f, 2.f, 3.f, 4.f)); } Will produce: .LCPI15_0: .long 0x3f800000 # float 1 .long 0x3fb504f3 # float 1.41421354 .long 0x3fddb3d7 # float 1.73205078 .long 0x40000000 # float 2 call_test: movaps xmm0, xmmword ptr [rip + .LCPI15_0] # xmm0 = [1.0E+0,1.41421354E+0,1.73205078E+0,2.0E+0] ret Nice! We’ve got the constant folding we want. And also nicely, if we mark test as noinline instead, the code for test is: test: sqrtps xmm0, xmm0 ret Meaning the branch is folded away. In both cases we now get the behaviour we want. We’ve wrote our own constant folder. Nice! You can see the full example on godbolt. It’d be nice if we could just use the vector in __builtin_constant_p, but I think the LLVM folks have purposefully tried to match what GCC would do. I’d personally advocate for a loosening of the builtin, and I might file a GitHub issue about just that. Verse Transactional Memory →",

Rust's über-strict type-safe math operations have you use matching types to get the euclidean non-negative remainder of x mod y. When you have a float-point x value but an integral y value, the operation can be performed much more cheaply than when y is also a floating point value. The problem is that you end up promoting y from an integer to an f64 and get a much slower operation. I ended up writing my own `rem_i64(self: &f64, divisor: i64) -> f64` routine that was some ~35x faster (a huge win when crunching massive arrays), but as there are range limitations (since f64::MAX > i64::MAX) you can't naively replace all call sites based on the type signatures. However, with some support from the compiler it would be completely doable anytime the compiler is able to infer an upper/lower bound on the f64 dividend, when the result of the operation is coerced to an integer afterwards, or when the dividend is a constant value that doesn't exceed that range. So now I copy that function around from ML project to ML project, because what else can I do? (A “workaround” was to use a slower-but-still-faster `rem_i128(self: &f64, divisor: i128) -> f64` to raise the functional limits of the operation, but you're never going to match the range of a 64-bit floating point value until you use 512-bit integral math!)

I'm asking as a C++ developer of 6+ years in high performance settings, most of this article is esoteric to me. reply plq 4 hours agoparentThey have a computation to do, and they want to do it using a particular instruction. That's the only reason they are fiddling with the compiler. You would have to do so too, if you had decided to solve a problem at hand using a similar method. The author is talking about a way to get a particular (version of) C/C++ compiler to emit the desired instruction. So I'd call this clang-18.1.0-specific but not C/C++-specific since this has nothing to do with the language. Also such solutions are not portable nor stable since optimization behavior does change between compiler versions. As far as I can tell, they also would have to implement a compiler-level unit test that ensures that the desired machine code is emitted as toolchain versions change. reply joosters 6 hours agoparentprevIs this really C++ specific though? It seems like the optimisations are happening on a lower level, and so would 'infect' other languages too. Whatever the language, at some point in performance tweaking you will end up having to look at the assembly produced by your compiler, and discovering all kinds of surprises. reply tialaramex 4 hours agorootparentLLVM isn't perfect, but the problem here is that there's a C++ compiler flag (-ffast-math) which says OK, disregard how arithmetic actually works, we're going to promise across the entire codebase that we don't actually care and that's fine. This is nonsense, but it's really common, distressingly common, for C and C++ programmers to use this sort of inappropriate global modelling. It's something which cannot scale, it works OK for one man projects, \"Oh, I use the Special Goose Mode to make routine A better, so even though normal Elephants can't Teleport I need to remember that in Special Goose Mode the Elephants in routine B might Teleport\". In practice you'll screw this up, but it feels like you'll get it right often enough to be valuable. In a large project where we're doing software engineering this is complete nonsense, now Jenny, the newest member of the team working on routine A, will see that obviously Special Goose Mode is a great idea, and turn it on, whereupon the entirely different team handling routine B find that their fucking Elephants can now Teleport. WTF. The need to never do this is why I was glad to see Rust stabilize (e.g) u32::unchecked_add fairly recently. This (unsafe obviously) method says no, I don't want checked arithmetic, or wrapping, or saturating, I want you to assume this cannot overflow. I am formally promising that this addition is never going to overflow, in order to squeeze out the last drops of performance. Notice that's not a global flag. I can write let a = unsafe { b.unchecked_add(c) }; in just one place in a 50MLOC system, and for just that one place the compiler can go absolutely wild optimising for the promise that overflows never happen - and yet right next door, even on the next line, I can write let x = y + z; and that still gets the kid gloves, if it overflows nothing catches on fire. That's how granular this needs to be to be useful, unlike C++ -ffast-math. reply nickelpro 1 hour agorootparentIf you're using floating point at all you have declared you don't care about determinism or absolute precision across platforms. Fast math is simply saying \"I care even less than IEEE\" This is perfectly appropriate in many settings, but _especially_ video games where such deterministic results are completely irrelevant. reply gpderetta 4 hours agorootparentprevYou can set fast math (or a subset of it) on a translation unit basis. reply cozzyd 3 minutes agorootparentOr even on a per function basis, at least with gcc (no clue about clang...) reply gpderetta 0 minutes agorootparentIn principle yes, you can use Attribute optimize, but I wouldn't rely on it. Too many bugs open against it. tialaramex 2 hours agorootparentprevBecause the language works by textual inclusion and so a \"translation unit\" isn't really just your code this is much more likely to result in nasty surprises, up to and including ODR violations. reply gpderetta 1 hour agorootparentYes, if you try hard enough I'm sure you can find ways to screw up. From a practical point of view it is fine. reply nikic 1 hour agorootparentprevLLVM actually also supports instruction-level granularity for fast-math (using essentially the same mechanism as things like unchecked_add), but Clang doesn't expose that level of control. reply pandaman 27 minutes agoparentprevIndeed, C++ is different from most languages (other than C) because \"knowing C++\" does not mean just knowing syntaxis and standard library API but implies understanding of how the source code is turned into bytes inside an executable image. A Python or Java or whatever programmer could be writing books and praised as the language expert without slightest idea how is memory allocated, a C++ programmer who does not know that is probably going to work in some legacy shop supporting an ancient MFC/Qt data-entry app. reply parasti 6 hours agoparentprevA lesson I learned very early on: don't use -ffast-math unless you know what it does.

Turning it on for selected portions of code would be a completely different game. reply swatcoder 3 hours agorootparentYou're mistaken. You can/would just use it in the translation units where you want it; usually for numerical code where you want certain optimizations or behaviors and know that the tradeoffs are irrelevant. It's mostly harmless for everday application math anyway, and so enabling it for your whole application isn't a catastrophe, but it's not what people who know what they're doing would usually do. It's usually used for a specific file or perhaps a specific support library. reply adgjlsfhk1 5 hours agorootparentprevJulia has this (via a @fastmath macro) and it's so nice! reply hifromwork 6 hours agoparentprevEverything in this post applies to C too, so it's not C++ specific. And the same gotchas apply for every case when you use inline assembly. I wouldn't call it a trick... Just an interesting workaround for a performance bug in Clang. The post can be boiled down to \"Clang doesn't compile this intrinsic nicely, so just use inline asm directly. But remember that you need to have a non-asm special case to optimize constants too, and you can achieve this with __builtin_constant_p\". reply GrantMoyer 5 hours agorootparentI wouldn't call this a performance bug in clang.

This implementation is slightly faster on old Intel machines, for example. reply flohofwoe 6 hours agoparentprevThis is a Clang or even LLVM code generation issue and entirely unrelated to the C and C++ standards (-ffast-math, intrinsics and inline assembly are all compiler-specific features not covered by the standards). Most other language ecosystems most likely suffer from similar problem if you look under the hood. At least compilers like Clang also give you the tools to workaround such issues, as demonstrated by the article. reply almostgotcaught 6 hours agoparentprev> How is a non-expert in the language supposed to learn tricks/... things like this? just like everything else in life that's complex: slowly and diligently. i hate to break it to you - C++ is complex not for fun but because it has to both be modern (support lots of modern syntax/sugar/primitives) and compile to target code for an enormous range of architectures and modern achitectures are horribly complex and varied (x86/arm isn't the only game in town). forgo one of those and it could be a much simpler language but forgo one of those and you're not nearly as compelling. reply Conscat 1 hour agoparentprevIn my opinion, `__builtin_constant_p()` is not that obscure of a feature. In C, it is used in macros to imitate constant functions, and in C++ it is useful for determining the current alternative that has lifetime in a `union` within a constant function. Granted that `__builtin_is_constant_evaluated()` has obsoleted its primary purpose, but there are enough ways it's still useful that I see it from time to time. reply tonetegeatinst 5 hours agoparentprevI'm a security student. My main experience has been python and java....but I have started to learn c to better learn how low level stuff works without so much abstraction. My understanding is that C is a great language, but I also get that its not for everyone. Its really powerful, and yet you can easily make mistakes. For me, I'm just learning how to use C, I'm not trying to understand the compiler or make files yet. From what I get, the compiler is how you can achieve even better performance, but you need to understand how it is doing its black magic....otherwise you just might make your code slower or more inefficient. reply vlovich123 4 hours agorootparentFirst order optimization is always overall program architecture, then hotspots, then fixing architectural issues in the code (e.g. getting rid of misspeculated branches, reducing instructions etc), and then optimizing the code the compiler is generating. And at no point does it require to know the internals of the optimization passes as to how it generates the code. As for the compiler’s role in C, it’s equivalent to javac - it’s taking your source and creating machine code, except the machine code isn’t an abstract bytecode but the exact machine instructions intended to run on the CPU. The issues with C and C++ are around memory safety. Practice has repeatedly shown that the defect rate with these languages is high enough that it results in lots of easily exploitable vulnerabilities. That’s a bit more serious than a personal preference. That’s why there’s pushes to shift the professional industry itself to stop using C and C++ in favor of Rust or even Go. reply torusle 4 hours agorootparentprevNah, it is not that bad. Sure you can mess up your performance by picking bad compiler options, but most of the time you are fine with just default optimizations enabled and let it do it's thing. No need to understand the black magic behind it. This is only really necessary if you want to squeeze the last bit of performance out of a piece of code. And honestly, how often dies this occur in day to day coding unless you write a video or audio codec? reply vlovich123 1 hour agorootparentThe main flags to look at: * mtune/march - specifying a value of native optimizes for the current machine, x86-64-v1/v2/v3/v4 for generations or you can specify a specific CPU (ARM has different naming conventions). Recommendation: use the generation if distributing binaries, native if building and running locally unless you can get much much more specific * -O2 / -O3 - turn on most optimizations for speed. Alternatively Os/Oz for smaller binaries (sometimes faster, particularly on ARM) * -flto=thin - get most of the benefits of LTO with minimal compile time overhead * pgo - if you have a representative workload you can use this to replace compiler heuristics with real world measurements. AutoFDO is the next evolution of this to make it easier to connect data from production environments to compile time. * math: -fno-math-errno and -fno-trapping-math are “safe” subsets of ffast-math (i.e. don’t alter the numerical accuracy). -fno-signed-zeros can also probably be considered if valuable. reply nalrqa 6 hours agoparentprev> How is a non-expert in the language supposed to learn tricks/... things like this? By learning C and inline asm. For a C developer, this is nothing out of the ordinary.

And if you do there is enough transparency (ie ability to inspect the assembly and ask questions) that you can solve this one issue without knowing everything under the sun. If you had an application where this sort of thing made a difference in JavaScript, the problem would likely still the there, you’d just have a lot less visibility on it.

Clang transforms sqrtps(x) to x * rsqrtps(x) when -ffast-math is set because it's often faster (See [1] section 15.12). It isn't faster for some architectures, but if you tell clang what architecture you're targeting (with -mtune), it appears to make the right choice for the architecture[2].

For example, with 128-bit RCPPS/RSQRTPS at five-cycle latency and one-cycle throughput or with 256-bit implementation of these instructions at seven-cycle latency and two-cycle throughput, a single Newton-Raphson iteration or Taylor approximation can achieve almost the same precision as the (V)DIVPS and (V)SQRTPS instructions (emphasis mine) reply dooglius 4 hours agorootparentThat's a different case where one is trying to calculate rsqrt(x) from 1/sqrt(x) whereas the article involves computing sqrt(x) from x*rsqrt(x) and in this case you don't need the divps instruction for sqrt but do need an additional mul instruction for the rsqrt case. reply GrantMoyer 2 hours agorootparentI think you've misread the section: > it is possible to speed up single-precision divide and square root calculations using the (V)RSQRTPS and (V)RCPPS instructions reply TinkersW 6 hours agoparentprevOnly on some older hardware really, pretty dumb optimization from clang, people writing SIMD probably already know this trick and have a version of sqrt that is exactly this, so going behind their backs and forcing it when they requested sqrt_ps is very uncool. reply cozzyd 5 hours agorootparentArguably this is an incorrect default of mtune reply pkhuong 6 hours agoparentprevIt's less accurate. reply kookamamie 5 hours agoprev [–] It's just so fiddly - can't trust the compiler, not a good sign for a language or its implementation. reply ComputerGuru 4 hours agoparentYou can never trust an optimizing compiler. I’ve seen similar issues in pretty much every language I’ve written performance-sensitive code in. Point revisions change optimizations all the time, sometimes with horribly disastrous results. One example: every time rust upgrades the version of LLVM underlying the compiler backend, the team prepares itself for a deluge of optimization regression reports (though this has been somewhat \"mitigated\" by a massive regression in rustc's ability to convey sufficient information to the LLVM backend for it to optimize to begin with, thanks to a change made to improve compile times [0]). This is almost universally true across all languages. The behaviors you see are usually the result of countless heuristics stacked one atop the other, and a tiny change here can end up with huge changes there.

Don't be fooled by the name of this flag, if it were possible to just do math faster without compromising anything, it wouldn't be a flag, it would be the default. It seems that Julia has a flag with the same name but a different behavior. Okay? What's your point exactly? reply chongli 4 hours agorootparentBut in this case, -ffast-math actually results in slower math, so the flag is badly named. Naming things is important (and hard). The naive expectation of a flag named -ffast-math is that the math should never be slower, sometimes be faster, and potentially less accurate and/or error prone. The fact that it can also be sometimes slower means the flag really should be named -fdifferent-math or (uncharitably) -funreliable-math. reply tcbawo 4 hours agorootparentIt’s too bad that it hasn’t acquired the name of an author to describe this alternative functionality more concisely without being judgy (like Nagle’s algorithm).

    "originBody": "20 June 2024 Andrew S. Tanenbaum, professor emeritus of Computer Science at VU Amsterdam, receives the ACM Software System Award for MINIX, which influenced the teaching of Operating Systems principles to multiple generations of students and contributed to the design of widely used operating systems, including Linux. Tanenbaum created MINIX 1.0 in 1987 to accompany his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. MINIX was a small microkernel-based UNIX operating system for the IBM PC, which was popular at the time. It was roughly 12,000 lines of code, and in addition to the microkernel, included a memory manager, file system and core UNIX utility programs. It became free open-source software in 2000. Inspiration for LINUX Beyond enabling the success of Tanenbaum’s textbook, the impact of MINIX has been phenomenal. It was an inspiration for LINUX, which has grown into the most successful open-source operating system powering cloud servers, mobile phones and Internet of Things devices. MINIX was also the basis for the MeikOS operating system for Meikotransputer-based computers and runs inside popular microchips. A later version of MINIX, MINIX 3.0 is intended for resource-limited and embedded computers and for applications requiring high reliability. Beyond the direct impact of MINIX, Tanenbaum’s advocacy for microkernel design has impacted generations of operating system designers. The ACM Software System Award is presented to an institution or individual(s) recognized for developing a software system that has had a lasting influence, reflected in contributions to concepts, in commercial acceptance, or both. The Software System Award carries a prize of $35,000. Financial support for the Software System Award is provided by IBM.",

    "originBody": "HybridNeRF: Efficient Neural Rendering via Adaptive Volumetric Surfaces CVPR 2024 (Highlight) Haithem Turki1,2 Vasu Agrawal1 Samuel Rota Bulò1 Lorenzo Porzi1 Peter Kontschieder1 Deva Ramanan2 Michael Zollhöfer1 Christian Richardt1 1 Meta Reality Labs 2 Carnegie Mellon University Paper Abstract Neural radiance fields provide state-of-the-art view synthesis quality but tend to be slow to render. One reason is that they make use of volume rendering, thus requiring many samples (and model queries) per ray at render time. Although this representation is flexible and easy to optimize, most real-world objects can be modeled more efficiently with surfaces instead of volumes, requiring far fewer samples per ray. This observation has spurred considerable progress in surface representations such as signed distance functions, but these may struggle to model semi-opaque and thin structures. We propose a method, HybridNeRF, that leverages the strengths of both representations by rendering most objects as surfaces while modeling the (typically) small fraction of challenging regions volumetrically. We evaluate HybridNeRF against the challenging Eyeful Tower dataset along with other commonly used view synthesis datasets. When comparing to state-of-the-art baselines, including recent rasterization-based approaches, we improve error rates by 15–30% while achieving real-time framerates (at least 36 FPS) for virtual- reality resolutions (2K×2K). Overview Eyeful Tower We render novel views from the Workshop scene in the Eyeful Tower dataset. Since we train with HDR images, we are able to render the scene at different exposures. Eyeful Tower Comparisons WorkshopOffice View 1Office 1B We compare HybridNeRF to prior work (FPS shown for 2Kx2K rendering on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU). MERF, 3DGS, and VolSDF* (our implementation using iNGP accleration primitives) do not support training models in HDR and therefore do not support exposure adjustments. Our quality is slightly better than VR-NeRF while rendering over 10x faster. Our results are significantly better than faster rendering approaches, especially when modeling specular effects. ScanNet++ Comparisons 98b4ec142fb20a261fdf We evaluate ScanNet++ as another dataset built from high-resolution captures of indoor scenes. 3DGS struggles with reflections and far-field content. Our method performs the best overall while exceeding the 36 FPS target frame rate for VR. MipNeRF 360 Comparisons StumpTreehillKitchen We also evaluate HybridNeRF against the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, where our approach performs comparably to other state of the art methods. We render novel camera trajectories that show how volume-based methods such as iNGP \"cheat\" when modeling apparent surfaces. Our method renders faster and generates more plausible surface geometry.

From my experience, NERF works great, but depends on highly accurate camera location information. Unless the VR device has this baked in, one must run a Colmap-style or SFM-style process to generate those camera extrinsics. Is there anything special HybridNeRF does around this? reply refibrillator 7 minutes agoparentprevCongrats on the paper! Any chance the code will be released? Also I’d be curious to hear, what are you excited about in terms of future research ideas? Personally I’m excited by the trend of eliminating the need for traditional SfM preprocessing (sparse point clouds via colmap, camera pose estimation, etc). reply ttul 2 hours agoprevDoes anyone else look forward to a game that lets you transform your house or neighbor into a playable level with destructible objects? How far are we from recognizing the “car” and making it drivable, or the “tree” and making it choppable? reply naet 16 minutes agoparentMy parents had a floor plan of our house drawn up for some reason, and when I was in late middle school I found it and modeled the house in the hammer editor so my friends and I could play Counter Strike source in there. It wasn't very well done but I figured out how to make the basic walls and building, add stairs, add some windows, grab some pre existing props like simple couches beds and a TV, and it was pretty recognizable. After adding a couple ladders to the outside so you could climb in the windows or on the roof the map was super fun just as a map, and doubly so since I could do things like hide in my own bedroom closet and recognize the rooms. Took some work since I didn't know how to do anything but totally worth it. I feel like there has to be a much more accessible level editor in some game out there today, not sure what it would be though. I thought my school had great architecture for another map but someone rightfully convinced me that would be a very bad idea to add to a shooting game. So I never made any others besides the house. reply totalview 1 hour agoparentprevI work in the rendering and gaming industry and also run a 3D scanning company. I have similarly wished for this capability, especially the destructability part. What you speak of is still pretty far off for several reasons: -No Collision/poor collision on NERFs and GS: to have a proper interactive world, you usually need accurate character collision so that your character or vehicle can move along the floor/ground (as opposed to falling thru it) run into walls, go through door frames, etc. NERFs suffer from the same issues as photogrammetry in that they need “structure from motion” (COLMAP or similar) to give them a mesh or 3-D output that can be meshed for collision to register off of. The mesh from reality capture is noisy, and is not simple geometry. Think millions of triangles from a laser scanner or camera for “flat” ground that a video game would use 100 triangles for. -Scanning: there’s no scanner available that provides both good 3-D information and good photo realistic textures at a price people will want to pay. Scanning every square inch of playable space in even a modest sized house is a pain, and people will look behind the television, underneath the furniture and everywhere else that most of these scanning videos and demos never go. There are a lot of ugly angles that these videos omit where a player would go. -Post Processing: of you scan your house or any other real space, you will have poor lighting unless you took the time to do your own custom lighting and color setup. That will all need to be corrected in post process so that you can dynamically light your environment. Lighting is one of the most next generation things that people associate with games and you will be fighting prebaked shadows throughout the entire house or area that you have scanned. You don’t get away from this with NERFs or gaussian splats, because those scenes also have prebaked lighting in them that is static. Object Destruction and Physics: I Love the game teardown, and if you want to see what it’s like to actually bust up and destroy structures that have been physically scanned, there is a plug-in to import reality capture models directly into the game with a little bit of modding. That said, teardown is voxel based, and is one of the most advanced engines that has been built to do such a thing. I have seen nothing else capable of doing cool looking destruction of any object, scanned or 3D modeled, without a large studio effort and a ton of optimization. reply modeless 25 minutes agorootparentI think collision detection is solvable. And the scanning process should be no harder than 3D modeling to the same quality level. Probably much easier, honestly. Modeling is labor intensive. I'm not sure why you say \"there’s no scanner available that provides both good 3-D information and good photo realistic textures\" because these new techniques don't use \"scanners\", all you need is regular cameras. The 3D information is inferred. Lighting is the big issue, IMO. As soon as you want any kind of interactivity besides moving the camera you need dynamic lighting. The problem is you're going to have to mix the captured absolutely perfect real-world lighting with extremely approximate real-time computed lighting (which will be much worse than movie-quality path tracing, which still wouldn't match real-world quality). It's going to look awful. At least, until someone figures out a revolutionary neural relighting system. We are pretty far from that today. Scale is another issue. Two issues, really, rendering and storage. There's already a lot of research into scaling up rendering to large and detailed scenes, but I wouldn't say it's solved yet. And once you have rendering, storage will be the next issue. These scans will be massive and we'll need some very effective compression to be able to distribute large scenes to users. reply knicholes 47 minutes agorootparentprevMaybe a quick, cheap NeRF with some object recognition, 3D object generation and replacement, so at least you have a sink where there is a sink and a couch where you have a couch, even though it might look differently. reply andybak 33 minutes agorootparentprevI think you're generalising from exacting use cases to ones that might be much more tolerant of imperfection. reply w-m 1 hour agoparentprevRecognizing what is a car in a 3D NeRF/Gaussian Splatting scene can be done. Also research from CVPR: https://www.garfield.studio/ reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agoparentprevI dreamed of that since being a kid, so for nearly three decades now. It's been entirely possible even then - it was just a matter of using enough elbow grease. The problem is, the world is full of shiny happy people ready to call you a terrorist, assert their architectural copyright, or bring in the \"creepiness factor\", to shut down anyone who tries this. reply jsheard 2 hours agorootparentThere's also just the fact that 1:1 reproductions of real-world places rarely make for good video game environments. Gameplay has to inform the layout and set dressing, and how you perceive space in games requires liberties to be taken to keep interiors from feeling weirdly cramped (any kid who had the idea to measure their house and build it in Quake or CS found this out the hard way). The main exception I can think of is in racing simulators, it's already common for the developers of those to drive LiDAR cars around real-world tracks and use that data to build a 1:1 replica for their game. NeRF might be a natural extension of that if they can figure out a way to combine it with dynamic lighting and weather conditions. reply smokel 1 hour agorootparentprevHaving destructible objects is in no way possible on contemporary hardware, unless you simplify the physics to the extreme. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your statement? Recognising objects for what they are has only recently become somewhat possible. Separating them in a 3D scan is still pretty much impossible. reply idiotsecant 1 hour agorootparentDestructible environments have been a thing for like....a decade or so? There's plenty of tricks to make it realistic enough to be fun without simulating every molecule. reply chefandy 31 minutes agorootparentA whole lot of manual work goes into making destructible 3D assets. Combined, I've put nearly a full work week into perfecting a breaking bottle simulation in Houdini to add to my demo reel, and it's still not quite there. And that's starting out with nice clean geometry that I made myself! A lot of it comes down to breaking things up based on voronoi tessellation of the surfaces, which is easy when you've got an eight-pointed cube, but it takes a lot more effort and is much more error prone as the geometric complexity increases. If you can figure out how to easily make simple enough, realistic looking, manifold geometry from real world 3d scans that's clean enough for standard 3D asset pipelines, you'll make a lot of money doing it. reply swiftcoder 1 hour agorootparentprevWe've had destructible polygonal and voxel environments for a while now, yes.

Which are now larger than chips and rectangular, so wasted edges from a 300mm wafer are high. The proposed size is much larger than chip-grade ingots. They don't need perfect silicon. It can be grown on a continuous ribbon which is sliced into panel sizes like they do for solar cells. If they need a perfect surface they can deposit some pure Si to finish it. Maybe we will eventually see that replace ingots for chip grade. reply smokefoot 33 minutes agoprevThe industry moved to 300mm 25 years ago. It’s going to take a lot to get off that standard.

I presume Apple invests in a lot of the capital costs? Apple needs to put it's cash somewhere and they can align that with exclusive contractual access to production of leading edge CPUs. Note that I haven't actually read anything about Apple's investment - I'm just hypothetically assuming it. We do sometimes hear about the exclusive contracts with TSMC.

In other cases I've read about Apple owning machines used by their manufacturers. reply bostik 1 hour agorootparentFor what it's worth, Apple has been doing that for ages. Back in 2007/2008 nobody could get their hands on a capacitive touch screens at any meaningful scale. Apple had bought the entire world's manufacturing capacity and 100% of the supply for about two years ahead. They showed with iPhone that it was possible to do multi-touch screens well - and the consumers took notice. \"Pinch to zoom\" was a product differentiator back then. What the consumers couldn't know was that nobody else could possibly match Apple's offering even with the best engineering workforce on the planet, because it was impossible to get hardware capable of multi-touch beyond tiny lab batch sizes. And you had to fight even for those.[ß] ß: I had the privilege of working directly for a Nokia fellow from 2007 until 2011, and got a ring-side view into the supply chain problems for high-end mobile devices. I also learned to dislike NXP with a passion, because that company has a funny habit of withholding spec sheets unless you are buying their SoC systems by the millions... reply wmf 1 hour agorootparentI always wondered why the N900, which was designed in response to the iPhone, used a resistive screen. Supply chain would explain it. reply bostik 1 hour agorootparentYeah. That device came with a stylus for a good reason. I think my main contribution to the N900 software stack was a bug report I dealt with during N800/N810 development cycle. I dove deep into the stack to understand and explain exactly why a certain annoying usability snag (dreadful UI latency in media player) was not possible to fix without ripping up larger parts of the UI toolkit layer. After my dissection the bug was eventually marked as WONTFIX, with a remarkable note: \"we do not dare fix this bug\". For N900 that part of the toolkit was rewritten. As a result the latency bug was finally possible to tackle, and the large arrows in N900 media player were actually pretty responsive. My guess is that whoever in their UI team had had the bright idea to specify which exact GTK widgets were to be used for the navigation buttons was either told off or removed from their effective decision chain. And I actually used N900 for some time as my mobile media terminal. It worked really well. (Coworker got its GPS chip working reliably without a SIM card, but that feature was never released. To the very end, GPS state machine in N900 required AGPS to expose its position, even if the chip itself had managed to get an accurate fix on your location.) reply newswasboring 5 hours agoprevOn a lighter note, this is actually a career threatening news for me. So much of my job is to figure out what to do with the end of the round wafer (partial dies), that I can't imagine what my whole department will do if we go for rectangular wafers :'). Made me realize how specific my engineering has been for the last 5 years. reply klysm 5 hours agoparentWhat do they do with the leftovers? I’m curious I mean even if they do start using rectangular wafers for _some_ things, there is so much supply chain momentum in circular wafers that surely you have some fairly significant job security. reply jallen_dot_dev 5 hours agorootparent> What do they do with the leftovers? Gather them up into a ball, then flatten them into a new wafer using a rolling pin. reply ceejayoz 2 hours agorootparentFold it over a few times and you get a croisSiant. reply newswasboring 5 hours agorootparentprevYou're right. But, I work in lithography, and there are only positives for going to rectangular wafers. We will be able to clamp is better, I think acceleration stresses will be easier to manage, modeling will be easier because it will be per field exactly the same, and so on. Litho industry (which basically means ASML at this point) might jump on this. But I'll reiterate I mean all this on a lighter note, don't think it will happen within my career :). Edit: Didn't read the question you asked in the first sentence. The left over parts are usually just taken along in the process till the end and are scapped when we get to the cutting stage. The problems arise because the structures on the partial dies are not the same as the full dies in the middle of the wafer. This causes a bunch of weird stresses on the edge and in my small corner of engineering we optimize the fuck out of the edge dies so their stresses are less weird. reply daniel_reetz 5 hours agorootparentI'm facing an engineering problem that amounts to stresses accumulating on the edges of a layered substrate. Are there any references, process notes, books, or industry approaches that you could point me to? High level and/or general are OK. reply brennanpeterson 3 hours agorootparentLithography lives in the thin film approximation anyway. Timiosheko is a good reference. There are papers from Barnett or Nix that are very nice, but edges will probably end up a fem solver domain. reply newswasboring 4 hours agorootparentprevLithography takes a more abstract approach to it, we are not actually calculating stresses, we have pretty powerful sensors which measure the wafer surfaces and then my department models the surface. reply kowalski7cc 7 hours agoprevWhy not hexagons? reply BluSyn 4 hours agoparentGood for tessellation only if chips are also hexagons. Arguably chips themselves could be hexagons for better pin density and potentially thermal properties.

Triangles would work but would be even more inconvenient to design cut and process into normal chips. So squares it is. reply londons_explore 4 hours agorootparentWater jet cutters or EDM cutters could both be used on silicon and there is no need for either to cut straight lines. When silicon area is expensive and performance can be maximised by reducing average on-die wire length, hexagons sound like they might make sense. Obviously current layout tools prefer X-Y area splits, so a lot of tooling would have to be redesigned to make use of a probably rather small performance gain. reply eightysixfour 3 hours agorootparentIt isn’t a question of cutting at an angle, it is a question of cutting in a specific direction all the way across the water. Hexagons demand that you change directions multiple times while cutting at chip level precision across a wafer you are trying to hold in place with the same amount of accuracy. reply krisoft 3 hours agorootparentprev> Water jet cutters or EDM cutters could both be used on silicon Wouldn’t they contaminate the just fabbed silicon surfaces?

The scrap from that process, since it is pure silicon, can just go back into the pot the boule was drawn from (it might need some cleaning steps first), so there is effectively no wasted silicon. reply jagged-chisel 20 hours agorootparentI would imagine, as it stands today, that packing rectangular chips into elliptical wafers has a certain amount of waste that can also be recycled. Actually, I suppose it would be less wasteful to fill the ellipse with rectangles up to the safe edge than it would to lop off entire sides of a boule to make a rectangle for filling. I don’t mean to insinuate you are wrong - I need an education on how this rectangle business is better. Maybe they’re just trying to remove the “lop the sides off” step? reply pclmulqdq 20 hours agorootparentPacking rectangular chips onto circles has waste, but that waste cannot be recycled. It has been processed through a lot of different steps that contaminate it. I'm not sure if it gets recycled, but it's going to be a lot harder to recycle than large chunks of pure silicon. reply jagged-chisel 20 hours agorootparentAh, makes sense. I hadn’t even considered the process of etching the chips. Pretty high contaminant-to-silicon ratio for sure. Thanks for answering! reply ginko 5 hours agoprevMy understanding is that round wafers are cheaper to produce since the silicon purification process produces cylindrical rods that are then cut into circular wafers. With fabrication becoming more and more advanced I can see that this original cost advantage of round wafers becomes less significant compared to everything else. reply klysm 5 hours agoparentThat makes sense, but I wonder if it would still be better to cut out a rectangle from the circle. reply smokefoot 38 minutes agorootparentThe cost of silicon is less than insignificant in an advanced semiconductor product. reply justinclift 7 hours agoprevhttps://archive.md/aWHFT reply tonetegeatinst 23 hours agoprevIs their any blogs or videos about how these ingots are produced?

The process of drawing the ingots leads to inherently round waffers. This is something that is not done by the foundary, but by a vendor. reply throwup238 23 hours agoparentThe spin coating process that applies etch resist also favors round wafers but if they've figured that part out, it's a win because their precision positioning equipment is limited to a square X/Y stage. With round wafers, they lose quite a bit of that space and the wafers are so cheap that wasting some edges isn't a big deal compared to the reduced overhead per chip. reply LeifCarrotson 21 hours agorootparentWhy is the precision positioning equipment limited to a square stage? Or is it actually a rectangular stage? Couldn't they use an r-theta circular positioning system instead of linear? Their optics are fundamentally circular constraints, seems like that should drive everything else to a circle. reply adolph 23 hours agorootparentprevBy squaring the circle, they gain by holding less non-addressable space in the etching step? reply jjk166 22 hours agoparentprevSure but cutting down larger ingots only affects the vendor, and these rectangular wafers could be handled by the same (or at least similarly sized) equipment for all the other downstream processes.

    "originLink": "https://blog.javascripttoday.com/blog/hacking-a-web-application/",
    "originBody": "Security Tutorial OWASP Juice Shop: Hacking A Modern Web Application JavaScript Today January 28, 2023 In this article, we’re going to hack a realistic web application called Juice Shop. It’s a very neat project, created by Björn Kimminich, project leader at OWASP and IT security lecturer at Nordakademie, and also developed/maintained by many other developers. OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! This is by far one of our favorite projects available on GitHub. It features all of the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities along with many other security flaws. It offers both web developers and penetration testers an excellent environment to test their security skills. If you’ve never learned how to secure your web applications, it’s probably a very good idea to learn as soon as possible. TryHackMe is a great place to start, providing real-world scenarios and top-notch tutorials. The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook is also a must, as it is probably the most extensive book available on web security. If you’re still thirsty for knowledge, another excellent book is The Tangled Web: A Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications, This article is going to demonstrate just one of the vulnerabilities within Juice Shop, as we don’t want to ruin the fun – there’s nothing more satisfying than discovering them yourself! Disclaimer: Everything contained within this article is for informational and educational purposes only. The word “Hacking” is to be regarded as Ethical Hacking. Performing hack attempts (without permission) on computers that you do not own is illegal. This site holds no responsibility for what you do with the information contained here, or anywhere else on the site. Installing Juice Shop Before we begin, make sure your system has Node.js installed. To do so, open up a terminal and type node --version. If Node is installed, you should see the version number. Else, head on over to the website and install it on your system. Okay, Node is installed. Visit the GitHub repository and clone the project. To save you some time, you can just copy and paste the following into your terminal: git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git Once this process is finished, cd into the directory and enter npm install. Great. The packages are installed successfully. Enter npm start and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. It’s time to start hacking! Note: If you don’t want to clone the repo, there’s a version available online. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) We’re going to focus on perhaps the easiest type of attack, the XSS attack. From OWASP: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. As stated above, this is the only attack we’ll perform in this article (there are many more for you to discover). Specifically, we’ll be performing a reflected XSS attack. However, before we show this attack, research it, and see if you can find the vulnerability yourself. It’s really quite easy. You might find this XSS Cheat Sheet useful. Anyway, let’s get hacking! The target for this attack is the search bar. Let’s test it. Enter juice into the search bar and click enter. If we look at the URL, we’ll see localhost:3000/#/search?q=juice. The interesting part here is the key-value pair q=juice. The result of our query is also displayed on the page. Interesting. It would be pretty cool if the inputs weren’t sanitized (the process of removing specific characters from user input), and we were able to inject some code onto the page, right? Let’s try something. In the search bar, let’s enter the following: juice Click enter. Notice that there’s now a link element on the page? If we click that link, we’ll be sent to google.com. You might be wondering why or how this is dangerous. The answer is in the URL. localhost:3000/#/search?q=%3Ca%20href%3D%22https:%2F%2Fgoogle.com%22%3Ejuice%3C%2Fa%3E. If this was a real website, say, a banking website – the possibilities for damage are evident. A bad actor can put any code they want into the URL, and then send it out to someone. To put it in a better perspective, we can imagine some bad actor has executed an XSS attack on a banking site. They’ve added code to send the credentials from a login page to themselves. However, it won’t work unless they can trick an unknowing victim into clicking the link. They might set up a fake email account, and just mass deliver an email explaining to users that their account has been compromised, log in to fix it! An unknowing victim won’t notice the URL: bankingsite.com/login?username= But when they click it, bad things will happen. As web developers, we must always sanitize user input, both on the frontend and the backend. Conclusion In this article, we explored an incredible project and looked at one of many ways to attack it. We’ve also explored XSS attacks and discussed how they work. A lesson we can learn from this is to always sanitize user input. To learn more about input sanitization, there’s a great article here. There are many more vulnerabilities to discover throughout the application. Check out the resources listed and have a great time hacking this application!

That verbal style works because verbal communication is real-time and you can provide correction and feedback when something doesn't work as expected. In other words: because you're able to babysit the process and answer questions. Unfortunately, you don't have that luxury in a written medium. I find that what works better in a written context is to have a concise list of instructions at the top with zero explanation. Below that, you can write a step-by-step explanation of the motivation and intent of each step. This allows a reader to skip what's obvious and jump to the explanation they need to fill in a gap in their understanding. I would also suggest you choose a specific target audience that can be expected to understand some things without explanation and who needs only a little explanation to understand a single new idea (e.g. XSS vulnerabilities, but not how to set up a project). Another minor tip: Make fewer value judgments and use fewer superlatives—don't write 'X is the best' or 'Y is a great'. Unless X or Y is the subject at hand, it's fine to simply say 'X is a {concise, matter-of-fact description}'. My impression is that you have a lot in your head and that you're very excited to share that knowledge, which is awesome, but you need to share your knowledge patiently and methodically. That's a good thing though: it means you have a deep well to draw from if you enjoy writing technical articles :) reply bradly 3 hours agorootparentprevSorry for the assumption.

Neither the devil you know nor the devil you don't (permalink) Spotify's relationship to artists can be kind of confusing. On the one hand, they pay a laughably low per-stream rate, as in homeopathic residues of a penny. On the other hand, the Big Three labels get a fortune from Spotify. And on the other other hand, it makes sense that rate for a stream heard by one person should be less than the rate for a song broadcast to thousands or millions of listeners. But the whole thing makes sense once you understand the corporate history of Spotify. There's a whole chapter about this in Rebecca Giblin's and my 2022 book, Chokepoint Capitalism; we even made the audio for it a \"Spotify exclusive\" (it's the only part of the audiobook you can hear on Spotify, natch): https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/12/streaming-doesnt-pay/#stunt-publishing Unlike online music predecessors like Napster, Spotify sought licenses from the labels for the music it made available. This gave those labels a lot of power over Spotify, but not all the labels, just three of them. Universal, Warner and Sony, the Big Three, control more than 70% of all music recordings, and more than 60% of all music compositions. These three companies are remarkably inbred. Their execs routinely hop from one to the other, and they regularly cross-license samples and other rights to each other. The Big Three told Spotify that the price of licensing their catalogs would be high. First of all, Spotify had to give significant ownership stakes to all three labels. This put the labels in an unresolvable conflict of interest: as owners of Spotify, it was in their interests for licensing payments for music to be as low as possible. But as labels representing creative workers – musicians – it was in their interests for these payments to be as high as possible. As it turns out, it wasn't hard to resolve that conflict after all. You see, the money the Big Three got in the form of dividends, stock sales, etc was theirs to spend as they saw fit. They could share some, all, or none of it with musicians. The Big Three's contracts with musicians gave those workers a guaranteed share of Spotify's licensing payments. Accordingly, the Big Three demanded those rock-bottom per-stream rates that Spotify is notorious for. Yeah, it's true that a streaming per-listener payment should be lower than a radio per-play payment (which reaches thousands or millions of listeners), but even accounting for that, the math doesn't add up. Multiply the per-listener stream rate by the number of listeners for, say, a typical satellite radio cast, and Spotify is clearly getting a massive discount relative to other services that didn't make the Big Three into co-owners when they were kicking off. But there's still something awry: the Big Three take in gigantic fortunes from Spotify in licensing payments. How can the per-stream rate be so low but the licensing payments be so large? And why are artists seeing so little? Again, it's not hard to understand once you see the structure of Spotify's deal with the Big Three. The Big Three are each guaranteed a monthly minimum payment, irrespective of the number of Spotify streams from their catalog that month. So Sony might be guaranteed, say, $30m a month from Spotify, but the ultra-low per-stream rate Sony insisted on means that all the Sony streams in a typical month add up to $10m. That means that Sony still gets $30m from Spotify, but only $10m is \"attributable\" to a specific recording artist who can make a claim on it. The rest of the money is Sony's to play with: they can spread it around all their artists, some of their artists, or none of their artists. They can spend it on \"artist development\" (which might mean sending top execs on luxury junkets to big music festivals). It's theirs. The lower the per-stream rate is, the more of that minimum monthly payment is unattributable, meaning that Sony can line its pockets with it. But these monthly minimums are just part of the goodies that the Big Three negotiated for themselves when they were designing Spotify. They also get free promo, advertising, and inclusion on Spotify's top playlists. Best (worst!) of all, the Big Three have \"most favored nation\" status, which means that every other label – the indies that rep the 30% of music not controlled by the Big Three – have to eat shit and take the ultra-low per-stream rate. Only those indies don't get billions in stock, they don't get monthly minimum guarantees, and they have to pay for promo, advertising, and inclusion on hot playlists. When you understand the business mechanics of Spotify, all the contradictions resolve themselves. It is simultaneously true that Spotify pays a very low per-stream rate, that it pays the Big Three labels gigantic sums every month, and that artists are grotesquely underpaid by this system. There are many lessons to take from this little scam, but for me, the top takeaway here is that artists are the class enemies of both Big Tech and Big Content. The Napster Wars demanded that artists ally themselves with either the tech sector or the entertainment center, nominating one or the other to be their champion. But for a creative worker, it doesn't matter who makes a meal out of you, tech or content – all that matters is that you're being devoured. This brings me to the debate over training AI and copyright. A lot of creative workers are justifiably angry and afraid that the AI companies want to destroy creative jobs. The CTO of Openai literally just said that onstage: \"Some creative jobs maybe will go away, but maybe they shouldn’t have been there in the first place\": https://bgr.com/tech/openai-cto-thinks-ai-will-kill-some-jobs-that-shouldnt-have-existed-in-the-first-place/ Many of these workers are accordingly cheering on the entertainment industry's lawsuits over AI training. In these lawsuits, companies like the New York Times and Getty Images claim that the steps associated with training an AI model infringe copyright. This isn't a great copyright theory based on current copyright precedents, and if the suits succeed, they'll narrow fair use in ways that will impact all kinds of socially beneficial activities, like scraping the web to make the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine: https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/13/spooky-action-at-a-close-up/#invisible-hand But you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs, right? For some creative workers, legal uncertainty for computational linguists, search engines, and archiving projects are a small price to pay if it means keeping AI from destroying their livelihoods. Here's the problem: establishing that AI training requires a copyright license will not stop AI from being used to erode the wages and working conditions of creative workers. The companies suing over AI training are also notorious exploiters of creative workers, union-busters and wage-stealers. They don't want to get rid of generative AI, they just want to get paid for the content used to create it. Their use-case for gen AI is the same as Openai's CTO's use-case: get rid of creative jobs and pay less for creative labor. This isn't hypothetical. Remember last summer's actor strike? The sticking point was that the studios wanted to pay actors a single fee to scan their bodies and faces, and then use those scans instead of hiring those actors, forever, without ever paying them again. Does it matter to an actor whether the AI that replaces you at Warner, Sony, Universal, Disney or Paramount (yes, three of the Big Five studios are also the Big Three labels!) was made by Openai without paying the studios for the training material, or whether Openai paid a license fee that the studios kept? This is true across the board. The Big Five publishers categorically refuse to include contractual language promising not to train an LLM with the books they acquire from writers. The game studios require all their voice actors to start every recording session with an on-tape assignment of the training rights to the session: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/09/ai-monkeys-paw/#bullied-schoolkids And now, with total predictability, Universal – the largest music company in the world – has announced that it will start training voice-clones with the music in its catalog: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/umg-startsai-voice-clone-partnership-with-soundlabs-1235041808/ This comes hot on the heels of a massive blow-up between Universal and Tiktok, in which Universal professed its outrage that Tiktok was going to train voice-clones with the music Universal licensed to it. In other words: Universal's copyright claims over AI training cash out to this: \"If anyone is going to profit from immiserating musicians, it's going to be us, not Tiktok.\" I understand why Universal would like this idea. I just don't understand why any musician would root for Universal to defeat Tiktok, or Getty Images to trounce Stable Diffusion. Do you really think that Getty Images likes paying photographers and wants to give them a single penny more than they absolutely have to? As we learned from George Orwell's avant-garde animated agricultural documentary Animal Farm, the problem isn't who holds the whip, the problem is the whip itself: The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which. Entertainment execs and tech execs alike are obsessed with AI because they view the future of \"content\" as fundamentally passive. Here's Ryan Broderick putting it better than I ever could: At a certain audience size, you just assume those people are locked in and will consume anything you throw at them. Then it just becomes a game of lowering your production costs and increasing your prices to increase your margins. This is why executives love AI and why the average American can’t afford to eat at McDonald’s anymore. https://www.garbageday.email/p/ceo-passive-content-obsession Here's a rule of thumb for tech policy prescriptions. Any time you find yourself, as a worker, rooting for the same policy as your boss, you should check and make sure you're on the right side of history. The fact that creative bosses are so obsessed with making copyright cover more kinds of works, restrict more activities, lasting longer and generating higher damages should make creative workers look askance at these proposals. After 40 years of expanded copyright, we have a creative industry that's larger and more profitable than ever, and yet the share of income going to creative workers has been in steady decline over that entire period. Every year, the share of creative income that creative workers can lay claim to declines, both proportionally and in real terms. As with the mystery of Spotify's payments, this isn't a mystery at all. You just need to understand that when creators are stuck bargaining with a tiny, powerful cartel of movie, TV, music, publishing, streaming, games or app companies, it doesn't matter how much copyright they have to bargain with. Giving a creative worker more copyright is like giving a bullied schoolkid more lunch-money. There's no amount of money that will satisfy the bullies and leave enough left over for the kid to buy lunch. They just take everything. Telling creative workers that they can solve their declining wages with more copyright is a denial that creative workers are workers at all. It treats us as entrepreneurial small businesses, LLCs with MFAs negotiating B2B with other companies. That's how we lose. On the other hand, if we address the problems of AI and labor as workers, and insist on labor rights – like the Writers Guild did when it struck last summer – then we ally ourselves with every other worker whose wages and working conditions are being attacked with AI: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/01/how-the-writers-guild-sunk-ais-ship/ Our path to better working conditions lies through organizing and striking, not through helping our bosses sue other giant mulitnational corporations for the right to bleed us out. The US Copyright Office has repeatedly stated that AI-generated works don't qualify for copyrights, meaning everything AI generated can be freely copied and distributed and the companies that make them can't stop them. This is fantastic news, because the only thing our bosses hate more than paying us is not being able to stop other people from copying the things we make for them. We should be shouting this from the rooftops, not demanding more copyright for AI. Here's a thing: FTC chair Lina Khan recently told an audience that she was thinking of using her Section 5 powers (to regulate \"unfair and deceptive\" conduct) to go after AI training: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mh8Z5pcJpg Khan has already used these Section 5 powers to secure labor rights, for example, by banning noncompetes: https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/25/capri-v-tapestry/#aiming-at-dollars-not-men Creative workers should be banding together with other labor advocates to propose ways for the FTC to prevent all AI-based labor exploitation, like the \"reverse-centaur\" arrangement in which a human serves as an AI's body, working at breakneck pace until they are psychologically and physically ruined: https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/17/revenge-of-the-chickenized-reverse-centaurs/ As workers standing with other workers, we can demand the things that help us, even (especially) when that means less for our bosses. On the other hand, if we confine ourselves to backing our bosses' plays, we only stand to gain whatever crumbs they choose to drop at their feet for us.

    "commentBody": "Creative workers deserve better than a choice as to who rips them off (pluralistic.net)91 points by dougb5 2 hours agohidepastfavorite82 comments djoldman 13 minutes agoA fantastic economist-sniping article with lots of spicy invective, proletariate vs bourgeoisie fun, and undercurrents of protectionism. All economic agents (producers, consumers, companies, living people) all want to pay nothing and get everything. There is little new or special here. 1+1 = 2 and generally the sky is blue. That being said, yes, the way for creators to capture more of the economic pie is fairly simple if not easy: join up and negotiate en-masse. Especially in industries with powerful entrenched oligopolies like music. reply pfdietz 2 hours agoprevWhat this is saying is that creativity is privileged and (unlike other forms of labor) should be given more than the market says it's worth. Why should non-creatives go along with this? reply bostik 1 hour agoparent> more than the market says it's worth. If you control the market, and have a direct way of influencing what the law considers the market, that is by definition not a competitive (and/or mostly free) market. The name for this scenario is known as \"Hobson's Choice\"[0]. Also, the word for a market where you have only a couple of buyers (all colluding with each other) is called a monopsony. 0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_choice reply roughly 37 minutes agoparentprev> more than the market says it's worth. The market’s got nothing to do with it. The music industry is a cartel. Look at the profit margins of the big 3 music companies: that’s a lowball on what the market says the art is worth, but it’s not making it back to the artists. reply pdonis 27 minutes agoparentprev> more than the market says it's worth It isn't. The market says it's worth a lot. But the vast majority of that \"a lot\" doesn't go to the actual creators. It goes to middlemen. Unfortunately, the only fix for that, from the creators' point of view, is for them to own the middlemen themselves. But creators generally have neither the time nor the desire to do that, and doing it detracts from their ability to create. reply tom-_- 1 hour agoparentprevNo, the author is saying the share of revenue the distributors (tech, music industry) are receiving is misaligned with the value they're adding. Compare content creators with a SWE. They both produce the product being sold, what percentage of the revenue should they receive? reply mdorazio 1 hour agorootparentThis “people should be paid based on the value they create” myth comes up a lot on HN. Compensation is only tied to value creation as a maximum level. The actual compensation level is whatever people are willing to work for while doing good-enough work. If you want to price your work based on value, you need to run your own business. reply pfdietz 29 minutes agorootparentMarkets are how economic value gets defined. Trying to define it otherwise is fraught with often disastrous difficulty. This is one of the reasons central planning fails. I think one of the reasons so many creatives feel cheated is there's far too much creativity, so the marginal value of more is low. In that situation of overabundance, some other step in the value chain will deliver most of the value, and reap the reward. This feels like exploitation, but it's just the market telling creatives they need to be producing something else. reply xboxnolifes 18 minutes agorootparentIf economic value is defined through markets, how then does one argue against markets' ability to assign value? What words should be used other than value? reply pfdietz 14 minutes agorootparentYou want to do something that makes no sense? You figure it out. reply xboxnolifes 5 minutes agorootparentwhat you're saying right now is that markets are beyond critique. ip26 45 minutes agorootparentprevIt’s a thought experiment. What are the reasons you aren’t paid for the value you create? Can you fix some of them? In this case, it’s postulated the biggest single factor is a monopsony. reply pdonis 20 minutes agorootparentYes, and the only way to fix the monopsony is for creators to own their own distribution channels so they can sell directly to their customers instead of selling to middlemen who take the vast majority of the profits and pay them peanuts. reply anukin 44 minutes agorootparentprevMajority of the so called creatives or influencers in the tech platforms produce sub standard material. There are cases of people like sssniperwolff etc whose entire content is rehashing on other peoples work and making money of it. And then there are people who produce life vlogs and shopping hauls. Are they worth more than a software engineer or a farmer who produces actual tangible assets for consumption? reply lovethevoid 22 minutes agorootparentYou speak as if software engineers are different. Vast majority are nothing more than marketers who know python. In essence, the same value as shopping haul video makers. Yet their compensation is very different. It should be obvious to most that what you are paid is nothing about value or efforts or risk. reply Ekaros 28 minutes agorootparentprevAnd when you really get into it. What about factory workers producing high margin products? Don't they deserve larger cut as without them there would be no money coming in... Surely that is much more valuable than what is now paid? reply navane 51 minutes agorootparentprevBecause the creative marketplaces have turned into effective monopolies or oligopolies at best (YouTube, Spotify), the market is broken. Note that an effective market has multiple vendors of similar commodities. Because the market is broken, value is payed not where it is due. This is intentional however, every big corp tries to break the market and lobbies for laws that allow that. reply whimsicalism 54 minutes agorootparentprevif you think it is a raw deal, don’t use the platform. reply lotsofpulp 1 hour agorootparentprev> what percentage of the revenue should they receive? Wherever the supply and demand curves intersect. Otherwise, society is less efficient in allocating resources. reply tomrod 1 hour agorootparentThe deeper question is how much control labor has over its provision of supply (monopoly) and how much control firms have over their demand for labor provisioning (monopsony). Both can be inefficient operators in the Econ 101 view of the world. reply rayiner 1 hour agoparentprevIt’s especially hard to defend given that the barriers to entry for creatives today (thanks to cheap editing equipment and Internet distribution) is extremely low. reply pjmorris 52 minutes agorootparentYes, tools are cheaper, but the big barriers to entry remain the hours invested in learning whatever creative craft is at hand. reply rayiner 12 minutes agorootparentI mean barriers in the sense of market access. Studios used to be able to gatekeep the market because they controlled expensive studio time and distribution networks. That’s not true anymore. reply portaouflop 1 hour agorootparentprevThe barrier to getting paid is significantly higher though, so in the end it’s more or less the same: if you want to make a living off creative work you’re going to have a hard time reply rayiner 14 minutes agorootparentWhat are the barriers to getting paid, in this era of online streaming and PayPal? reply whimsicalism 55 minutes agorootparentprevlow barrier to entry lowers cost, so this is exactly the desired outcome reply anigbrowl 40 minutes agorootparentBut also quality. For example, YouTube pretty much forces people toward lowest-common-denominator filler content, because if creators don't upload new content frequently enough they'll drop out of recommendation lists even for subscribers. Creative software tools are easily available and distribution is free, but YouTube has a monopoly of information and so creators have very little insight into what/when/how people see the creative product or how revenue is calculated. reply drpossum 2 hours agoparentprevIt's not market value, it's the forces in the middle skimming off the top as much as they want and then using that to enforce their position as a de facto monopoly. Did you even read the article on how much the market is paying and how much is actually going to artists? reply Dalewyn 1 hour agoparentprev>Why should non-creatives go along with this? We shouldn't. Art has historically been vastly overvalued and I like that its perceived/demanded value has been sharply declining over the past several decades and especially now with the advent of \"AI\". I'm sorry if anyone reading this is an artist and I just twisted your pantaloons, but artists don't serve any valuable role in society. Artists exist strictly because society can afford to waste surplus time and resources on frivolous occupations, art is an intangible luxury. reply vunderba 58 minutes agorootparentJust a clarification, art has never been overvalued historically. In point of fact, artisans and musicians were considered a fairly lower class as a mere trade within the medieval time period outside of a few rockstars such as Beethoven and Liszt (later in the 18th and 19th centuries). reply whimsicalism 53 minutes agorootparentartists were not lower class compared to the vast majority of the population and that generally remains true. reply jfengel 1 hour agorootparentprevI'd read this but I'm too busy playing video games. I'll read it after I watch this movie. reply pdonis 17 minutes agorootparentprev> artists don't serve any valuable role in society I assume then that you don't listen to any music, don't watch TV or movies, don't read any books, don't have any pictures on your walls, live in a concrete box with no artistic design applied, and so on? In other words, that you get no value from art in any form? reply pjmorris 46 minutes agorootparentprev\"I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain.\" - John Adams, 2nd US President reply nope1000 1 hour agorootparentprevThere is no value in music, books, movies, video games? Or did you just think about paintings? reply pjmorris 45 minutes agorootparentI'd add all software to video games; despite all the optimization and mechanization it remains a creative endeavor. reply zogrodea 48 minutes agorootparentprevI think you would enjoy reading this which seems to agree with you somewhat. https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1cCymY7GRLn-PDwh948WC... reply financltravsty 25 minutes agorootparentRefreshing. Where can I find more -- do you know who the author is and title of this work? Edit: Found it. The Principles of Art by Robin George Collingwood reply pfdietz 1 hour agorootparentprevIndeed. To a large extent, art was a means of displaying your social status, a way of demonstrating your wealth and buffing your ego. It was used as a justification for colonialism and imperialism. Our society is so advanced; look at the art it produces; obviously we're superior so we should dictate what others do. reply anigbrowl 35 minutes agorootparentRight, right, nobody but the social elites ever wanted to decorate anything, be entertained, or engage in cultural practices for mere enjoyment. Folk music? Dancing? mere impositions of social organization. These people think they're having fun, but that's because they lack true consciousness. reply MourYother 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't think you realize what a hellscape the world without art would be. reply SR2Z 1 hour agorootparentHumans create art like snails exude slime. Not getting paid for art doesn't mean no art is gonna get made. reply wincy 1 hour agorootparentprevWe’d go outside? Derive pleasure from being around people near us instead of seeking external validation and watching shows crafted by Hollywood midwits? Maybe we’d have more hobbies and do sports? reply grugagag 0 minutes agorootparentArt isn’t keeping you inside, actually technology has made our lives more comfortable indoors, not that it’s always a bad thing. A world without art would be an industrial world where things only have utility and what the look like does not matter. Think everything being painted the same drab color because it’s efficient and cheap. Think people wearing the same clothes, same colors even because who would care about esthetics?

No it isn't. It's the nature of about 30% of people, who can't be happy without knowing that someone else is worse off. Many of the characteristics that you ascribe to stupidity are actually examples of selfishness, and you're leveraging the existence thereof to rationalize your own selfishness. https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1600451 Your wealth likely derives from a mixture of raw talent, hard work, luck, and preferential attachment, and imho wealth and fitness (in the technical sense) are poorly correlated in modern society. reply mbrumlow 1 hour agorootparentActually. I find it the opposite. The 30 percent you speak of don’t care and are not in the web yelling eat the rich. The real problem is the 70% who can’t be happy knowing that others are better off than them. (It’s actually not 70% most don’t care but anybody who says eat the rich is the problematic person) reply anigbrowl 56 minutes agorootparentI didn't pull that number out of the air, but from the attached paper. I disagree with your second comment in that your position suggests any criticism of the rich is unwarranted. The startling upward transfer of wealth pursuant to the pandemic, for example, is a rather stark illustration of a particular social group exploiting a general tragedy for profit. https://siepr.stanford.edu/news/qa-how-pandemic-savings-are-... Consider the recent phenomenon of 'shrinkflation', where consumers are sold a lower volume of a commodity product for the same price they were paying previously. I find this interesting because it's not a pure supply-and-demand situation where the price of a bulk good changes and you get less product in a box or bottle; companies have to invest money in changing packaging and retooling their production lines. In other words, they choose to spend money on concealing the change in value proposition, whereas if cost inflation was the only economic factor they'd keep selling the same product but raise the price. reply bequanna 1 hour agorootparentprev> Your wealth likely derives from a mixture of raw talent, hard work, luck, and preferential attachment This is a disturbing viewpoint to see on HN. We already went down this path (a few times) and it resulted in >100 million deaths in the 20th century. reply anigbrowl 1 hour agorootparentTry arguing with substance instead of hyperbolic (and specious) comparisons. Preferential attachment is a well-documented economic phenomenon, for example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment reply bequanna 46 minutes agorootparentThis is a feature, not a bug. In our system, capital tends to concentrate and flow to people who are good stewards of it. Many of the rich train their children to provide value and allocate capital efficiently. This is somehow a bad thing? The comment I responded to was the typical collage freshman “eat the rich” bs which is rooted in communistic ideation. Those ideas are generally worthless and go down a shitty path for both the individual and society. Those ideas result in misery literally every time we try them. reply MourYother 1 hour agorootparentprevUnironically stealing this for pasta; what a content. reply Rinzler89 1 hour agorootparentIt's flagged, can you share it? reply anigbrowl 1 hour agorootparentYou can turn on 'showdead' on your HN user page.

It's not the toy 'supply and demand' model of economics classes or anything resembling a pure meritocracy, it's heavily shaped by cartels and asymmetric contractual relations. reply pfdietz 1 hour agorootparentHow about no? The evidence is that markets are essential. Attempts to use central planning instead have been universally disastrous, for reasons that were predicted ahead of time. reply MourYother 1 hour agorootparentIf only we could somehow regulate the market to keep the greedy fucks in check. But no, it can't be done because, apparently, the only alternative to raging free market is apparently central planning and violently shakes fingers in front of your face \"Boo! communism!\". reply nradov 58 minutes agorootparentWhat specific market regulations would you suggest in this industry? reply bequanna 1 hour agorootparentprevCentral planning of anything is generally very inefficient and results in the concentration of power. So far, we haven’t been able to find a way to concentrate power without corruption. The lesson is: only give the government as much control as necessary, never more. In a system that is more socialist, the people forfeit their power to the party. Super easy for one party to dominate in these systems so votes mean little and you enter a doom loop of inefficiency caused by corruption. In a system that is more capitalistic and consumer-based, the people retain a good amount of their power through purchasing choices.

Enjoy. --------------------------------------------------------- A Forth Story Allen Cekorich Walnut Creek, California Forth Dimensions, July/August 1995 In 1975, I was fresh out of college with a bachelors degree in physics and a need to find a job that paid enough to support myself. After a six-month search, I landed an entry-level position at MDH Industries in Monrovia, California, where they promised to increase my minimum wage starting salary once I proved myself useful. I was to work with the president and owner, Dr. Howard Marshall, Ph.D., on a project to develop an instrument to measure the real-time sulphur content of a coal stream by detecting and analysing the prompt gamma ray spectrum resulting from the absorption of thermal neutrons from a Californium 252 radioactive source. The opportunity sounded exciting to my naive ears, as it was my first professional job. I was finally in the real work world of adults and ready to go on to do great things. Remember, this was twenty years ago and I was only twenty-two years old. I had no previous experience to guide me in the situation I was in, no mentor to teach me, no helping hand and no idea of where to begin or what to do. Like most good engineers, I decided to fake it until I understood my value. I spent the first Year or So understanding the design parameters of a Sulphur meter, which involved creating a computer model on a Tymshare IBM 370 System accessed with a Teletype terminal at the fantastic rate of 30 characters Per second. This was a revolution from the punch cards I had used in college on a CDC 3150 that could be viewed through a glass window in the foyer of the computer department. MY degree in physics mandated that the modelling language would be Fortran, and I naturally enjoyed programming, which was probably related to my ability and love for mathematics. I had completed the coursework for a degree in mathematics with a 4.0 average in college. I was proud of the growing complexity and depth of my simulation, which was now consuming hours of computer time during the night hours when the cost was lowest. It came to pass by the natural events of the development process that construction of a sulphur meter prototype was to take place. Howard Marshall had earned his doctorate in physics from the California Institute of Technology, which is very much in bed with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. His contacts encouraged a computer- based instrument and recommended a strange language called Forth that was floating around the lab. They convinced him it was possible to build a small, Z80-based controller that could acquire the spectrum from the sodium iodide detector and maintain real-time signal processing rates to compute the actual sulphur content. Somehow, outside my area of responsibility, an S100-bus system showed up from the Empirical Research Group. My electrical engineer office mate had been assigned the task of fooling around with it for development purposes, but no progress seemed to ever be at hand. After some time had passed, a fellow named Martin Smith showed up from the Cal Tech network. He brought with him a Forth running on a Monolithic 280-based multi-bus system, and progress toward a controller began. I was preoccupied with designing the sulphur meter based on my Fortran simulation. but the natural need to verify the model from real data taken from the prototype was growing important. With the help of Marty, I started playing with the Forth computer. This was the first time in my life that I had actual, physical contact with a computer. Those big, eight-inch Shugart floppy drives that held a whopping 120K bytes, and the awesome 64K of fast RAM, along with the character-based video display terminal, intoxicated me. What what was more puzzling was this strange way of talking to the computer, called Forth. I had taken a computer language survey class in college which included Fortran, Algol, PWM, Cobol, Trac, Lisp, and APL, but had never heard of anything called Forth. It was strange and unnatural without program statements. I could not find the compiler, linker, or listing output. I could not figure out how it worked, but I realized that I now had direct contact with the CPU without the need to learn complex system manuals. I finally had a computer under my control and I went to town. Over the next few years, I had a good time writing programs on that small Forth system to do data preprocessing for input to the real, grown-up IBM Tymshare computer for comparison to my simulation. I taught myself the Z80 assembler in the Forth, which gave me access to the computer hardware. I played with serial comms, DMA for the disk drive, video display controller, interrupts, and, most important of all, the AMD 9511 floating-point coprocessor. I wrote linear matrix functions, least squares routines, statistical measures, data filters, and data stacks for working with the gamma ray spectra. I used that little 64K computer to its limit to complete the calibration of the first delivered sulphur meter. I also became an expert in using Forth, although I still did not fully understand what I was doing. About this time, around the beginning of the eighties, a recruiter called me searching for a Forth programmer. I was not a Forth programmer in my mind. I did not see myself as a Forth programmer. I was a physicist using a tool to do a job. Anyway, I went on an interview to Forth, Inc. in Manhattan Beach, California, and met a man named Edward Conklin. We talked about what I had been doing with Forth, I showed him some of my listings, toured the offices, and shook hands upon departing. A few days later, the recruiter called saying I had been offered a job for more money than I was making and encouraged me to accept. I was puzzled. I was not a Forth programmer. Why did they want me? What would it be like? I just did not understand where I would fit in. I declined the position, Over the years, I have wondered what direction my career would have taken if I had just said yes. Looking back, it is easy to see now that I was an exceptional Forth programmer, as following parts of my story will reveal; but remember, I was still in my twenties, working on my first job, which limited my view of my career horizon. My destiny would take me to other places and back again, to Forth. My job was winding up with the completion of the first sulphur meter. Martin Smith had left earlier, going back to a previous job at Technicolor in Hollywood. I had grown as an engineer, becoming more than could be supported by the twenty-five person company that was owned by a single person. The end of my first job had come, so I resigned and, that weekend, I bought a Victor 9000 personal computer. I did have the vision to see that what I had done with that small 280 computer spelled the death of my cherished IBM 370 computer running Fortran over the phone line. The future was in small, personal systems that clearly exceeded the power of the off-line dinosaurs. I did not know what I would be doing, but I knew what I would have to do and that was to learn the basics of the smaller machines. As fate would have it, Many called me the following Monday, and a week later I was working for Technicolor. It was now May of 1983. I had taken the job as a computer programmer who would develop the control software for a film printer. This was a special kind of printer to reduce the cost of choosing the RGB color light levels for a film scene by printing one frame of scene onto the positive, thereby saving the cost of developing a complete print just to check the production parameters. I had to learn Intel's version of PL/M and assembly for the 8086, which was the heart of the Intel 88/40 multi- bus board computer controller. I was back to compilers, linkers, and locators, and got to play with in-circuit emulators. I discovered real- time control that enables computers to interact with the physical world. I learned multitasking, interrupt response times, and control inputs and outputs from A/D and D/A chips, counters, and parallel lines. I got to play with big servo motors. I had a ball. I almost forgot about Forth. But not completely. I obtained the fig-Forth listing for the 8086 with the intention to boot a Forth on my Victor 9000. 1 spent many nights and weekends typing in the listing as I learned about DOS and just how the PC worked. I gathered documentation, bought some software, and joined the Victor 9000 users group. Time passed. Work went well with the nearing completion of the proof printer. Then Hollywood came into the picture. Hollywood is not in the real world, they make it up as they like. The engineering director and the chief engineer got themselves fired for no apparent reason other than a pompous power play which I never understood. The upshot was that my project was cancelled, leaving me in limbo. I chose to resign a month later, simply because I no longer had a defined job. It was July of 1984. I spent the next five months working twelve-hour days at home on my Forth system. I booted the kernel as a DOS executable, and promptly rewrote it to my liking, including redesigning the inner interpreter. I was forced, by finally understanding the true nature of Forth, to add an 8086 assembler of original design, an interface to DOS for files and display control, floating-point words for an 8087 coprocessor, and many utilities to work with my system. Looking back, I wonder why I did it. Why would I create a complete Forth development system for the PC? I had no use for it, nor any future plans for the system. I believe the answer was just to learn how personal computers work. Forth gave me direct access to the machine, and freedom to explore designs that felt right to me. I did not have to depend on a vendor to show me what I could do. My physics training led me to explore fundamentals of computer operation much as I explored the fundamental laws of the physical world. I also began reading Byte magazine every month to keep up on the technology, and I read books such as Donald Knuth's Art of Computer Programming. Forth gave me freedom to explore beyond the limitations of a fixed compiler with a straight-jacket syntax. I had finally caught the Forth bug. The realities of living without an income finally caught up with me. In December of 1984, I found a job with Litton Industries. The fibre optic department under Mike Suman had a contract with Western Geophysical to build a demonstration underwater fibre optic microphone towed array for oil exploration. The job was to complete an Intel multi-bus computer demodulator for five sensors. The software was written in PL/M-86 and assembler, and was presented to me as almost done. I learned quickly that the statement was politically correct but entirely false from an engineering perspective. I had wandered blindly into defence engineering for the first time. I redesigned the computer system to use three single-board computers in a multi-bus backplane, and wrote the software from scratch to multiplex the three 8086 CPUs to accomplish the demodulation. Four months later, it was finished, complete with a real-time video display of the sensor outputs for the all-important demo. The next day, the contract was cancelled due to the oil glut of the mid-eighties. I wondered if I had a job. The major part of the fibre optic directorate was involved in fibre optic rotation sensor development for military applications. The program seemed to be headed by a man named Dr. George Pavlath, who was a Ph.D. in physics from Stanford University. He had a problem with the testing of the rotation sensors on the rate tables which used H-P BASIC controllers. He knew from my resume that I had experience with Forth, and he had heard from his friends at Stanford that it was a very neat control language. I told him I had developed my own Forth system for the PC, and we agreed to try it out for rate table control. I brought in my system and spent a few months porting it to the IBM PC, adding drivers to read IEEE-488 instruments via a Metrabyte card, and rate table position from a CTM-05 counter board. I completed a fully automated rate table test station and began to test fibre optic gyros. The application of Forth to a flexible test environment was perfect. I went much further and added online data analysis, and began constructing my own unique plotting additions to Forth based on Brodie's MAKE DOER construct. My Forth system grew to maturity as different problems demanded solutions. I quickly returned to my physics roots to contribute to the new technology of fibre optic sensor development. All was not well, though. I encountered the first resistance to the Forth way of doing business. The Forth development environment was so efficient that the H-P BASIC controllers were made obsolete. This led to resentment by engineers who had invested their time learning H-P BASIC. I offered to teach them Forth, but remember, this was a system I had personally written. It was my creation, and no one could understand it as well as myself. Why should they invest part of their careers learning a tool that was the personal property of one engineer? They did have a point. But the fact was that my system was doing things that nobody thought possible before. It was even worse than that. It turned out that someone in a different Litton division was using Forth for production test station control for the same reason, its efficiency and power. This person was upset that I had brought in a new dialect. He had his box of tools and would not look at mine, and we could not share code. As the years passed, my system became entrenched in the fibre optic directorate and enabled a lot of progress to be made, even though I spent most of my time concentrating on the physics of the devices. A few people finally learned my system, which became quite powerful, but the lingering resentment remained. Other engineers felt I had cheated by using Forth, that it was unfair to them. I even published my Forth system, called AFORTH, through the Victor 9000 users group. I was told that up to forty people bought copies, and the head of the users group eventually got a job writing Forth. Sometime in the eighties, I got it in my head that Forth could be applied to build fast demodulators, especially since the advent of Forth chips. I convinced George Pavlath to send me to a company called Novix to check out a Forth-based CPU. It was on this trip that I met Charles Moore. He and I talked for half an hour about possibilities. I had a hard time believing that this was the creator of Forth. I played with a Novix development system, unaware that the chip was not yet real, in the sense that one could not buy one. In truth, I felt I was sticking my neck out by suggesting a Forth design when other engineers wanted my head for what I had accomplished in the testing area. The reality was, it did not matter - I ordered a Novix chip which was never delivered, since the company eventually folded. I felt relieved. I went on to work with DSP processors such as the TMS320C25, which were now capable of implementing complex demodulation designs and provided me with new areas to explore. Then the Berlin Wall fell. The defence build-up was over in a day, but it took several years of excruciating pain for many innocent people to accept the change in their lives. I held out until September of 1991, when I finally admitted it was time for me to leave. I could no longer pay the price required to survive. In January of 1989, I had replaced my ageing Victor 9000 with a Dell 386 computer. I briefly went into consulting with my Forth system. I worked several months for the Physical Optics Corporation in Torrance, California, automating their production holographic testers. I realized again that I was sticking them with a custom solution that could not be updated without me. It was just not viable. Even though they were delighted with the results of my work, I never got called back; probably because the engineering staff had changed in the interim. I was out of work until May of 1992, when I got a call from Systron Donner in Concord, California. A half-dozen Litton refugees had found jobs there, and they were eager for me to join them. I moved from Los Angeles to beautiful Contra Costa county, and thought I had found a wonderful place to work. The CEO was Dick Terrell, who came from Litton marketing, and was converting the company to quartz sensor technology. It turned out that I was the last one hired before the defence downsizing began in earnest at the company. I had to relive the experience at Litton during the next year and a half. I was hired to do DSP software for the Quartz Inertial Measurement Unit, but the military requirements for software quality control were beyond the resources of the company, so the project was cancelled a month after I arrived. Instead, I was asked to work on a substitute IMU for a contract delivery that was not going to happen on the current schedule. One of the main problems was that the rate table test station, which was being coded in C, would not be ready in time. I volunteered my Forth system for the interim station, and completed the work in several months. Once again, I experienced the wrath of engineers who said I cheated because they were forced to use the \"correct C approach,\" while I used this thing called Forth, which obviously made the work too easy. Go figure. I should have known better; the truth was, nothing mattered, because the company was being downsized with a vengeance, and when the CEO was replaced, I soon lost my job in December of 1993. Among the people who joined me going out the door was a guy who wanted to start a company with a product, based on the Systron Donner rotation sensor, which would measure body movements for medical purposes. I met with him and agreed to program a prototype piece of equipment using my Forth system, in exchange for a future piece of the company. In one month, I had a prototype that displayed real-time rotation movement and medical parameters for Parkinson's syndrome. It was demonstrated to the Parkinson's institute and was well received. However, I told my partner that the final device could not be programmed in Forth. Why would I say such a thing? Simply because technology had passed Forth by, in my opinion. It was no longer possible for one person to develop all the software required in a graphical environment. I needed to buy the tools I needed to leverage my time for a professional job. I could no longer play the role of the maverick programmer, nor did I want to. I need to be part of a collaborative community in which I can give and receive work. I do not see Forth as a viable solution as of today. The start-up company never happened, for financial reasons, so I have been unemployed since then. I am also forty-two years old, and am looking at my life from the midway point. I have spent nearly twenty years doing this Forth thing, and I do not know if I want to continue with it. A year ago, I bought the Symantec C++ development package for Windows. I have yet to use it. It does not excite me like Forth did, because it does not give me the freedom to create those program constructs which enable my ideas. I guess I am still undecided on the issue of Forth, so I will renew my subscription to Forth Dimensions for at least this one last time.

If you do something odd, and it's more successful, then it's \"cheating\". You have to go through this punch cards, through the printed out listings, compilers, linkers, etc., and it has to be hard and awkward, and using Forth instead and getting the job done quickly is just cheating. You may be allowed to do so when you are a top programmer, and sweap the ground with your fellow programmers in any other language, too, because then, it's your superior knowledge, no longer cheating. But then, their excuse is \"we are mere mortals, we can not program in this super-hero language\". Humans resist change. Forth, 40 years ago, was extremely odd. It lost a good part of its oddness, since the classic compiled programming language is on a global retreat. It is still odd with its stack and its lack of syntax or typing system, but strong typing is no longer popular, either. Apart from this psychological aspect, the resist of change, which leads to loners doing their stuff in Forth (because a loner does not care about the herd), there is nothing that prevents cooperation in Forth. Like with any other language, good cooperative programming is a management issue, not a technical issue. You have to identify which person fits which role in the team (people are not all equal), and you have to make people communicate (they often don't on their own). You have to set guidelines, and common coding style (it is much easier for a group of people to read each other's code if it uses the same style - and that works, regardless if it's Forth Inc.'s terse horizontal style, or a more elaborated vertical style found elsewhere). -- Bernd Paysan \"If you want it done right, you have to do it yourself\" http://bernd-paysan.de/ A.

In Germany I worked twenty five years self-employed, using Forth since 1984. Several times I programmed things where people said it can't be done. When it was done, they simply said \"seems to be it can be done!\" Having developed a precision transformer ratio measurement system using RSC-Forth on the Mitsubishi M38049, I came to the United States nine years ago by invitation of the company for which I developed this instrument. My last project was a three phase PWM, using an ARM micro with MPE-Forth doing the PWM, and a M38049 with RSC-Forth as front end to communicate with a PLC. To see what the PWM was doing when a PID program was added, with Win32Forth I programmed an eight channel oscilloscope to show different digital values inside the program as analog waves. When I lost my job after having a successful cancer treatment, I started to upgrade Win32Forth-ForthForm to visualFORTH, because I didn't like to wait any longer for a visual Forth. Now I am retired and work with little micros on TI's LaunchPad. I had to start with C, which I avoided all of my former life, and I am glad to have a Forth for these little buggers now: http://www.4e4th.eu/ You have such a great experience in working with Forth, having done much more exciting things than I ever did. It would be a pity if all your knowledge would get lost. You wrote \"I do not see Forth as a viable solution as of today\" - I say: We will have a Renaissance of Forth. You wrote about all your work you have done and about the experience you had. I don't know how you found Comp.Lang.Forth, but with c.l.f you found a collaborative community which will welcome you, I am sure about this. I am welcoming you.

My own take: in a world of mechanized agriculture, where a \"farmer\" is someone who sits in a control booth operating a fleet of remote controlled tractors through a microwave satellite feed, Forth is like planting potatoes in the raw soil with your bare hands. It's spiritually enriching and in some cases maybe it's even the most appropriate way to grow potatoes on a limited scale. Whether it can meet the bottomless demands of corporate traffickers trying to fill container ships with potatoes is a different matter, but luckier users don't have to worry about this. ;-) dirk....@usa.net unread, Apr 5, 2012, 1:54:14 AM   to di...@bruehlconsult.com On 4 Apr., 07:19, Mark Willswrote:   Please let me know what you think is missing with Forth.

Oral tradition told me that, when they were too poor to get the right tools, they \"rolled their own\", improvising spades from suitably shaped pieces of wood that they furnished with improvised blades made from old tin cans beaten into shape with rocks and slotted into locking notches (think cotter pin, with the metal wrapping around the end of the wood).

Sure, but also consider that many programmers are increasingly uneasy about this widening distance.

Thanks for the clarification. I assumed that is what you meant. I concur 100% with your \"not their money and \"no accountability\" affecting attitudes in gov't contract work. That begs the question, if the contract contained a \"clawback\" clause such that a portion of the fees must be returned if the system fails to meet specification, would these projects have different outcomes? It is possible that they would not, if the people \"in charge\" don't really understand the errors or low level decisions early on make it impossible to achieve the design goals. Of course \"meet specification\" is a lawyers dream so it would still cost the taxpayer in the end. Just paid to a different entity. B",

The use of two stacks, one for data and one for sub-routine linkage had not been seen to my knowledge, before Moore. Forth is not a language. It's an extensible instruction set. You like RISC. Are 31 instructions \"RISCy\" enough? :-) I have wondered what Chuck's CPU designs could have become if they had been given more financial and intellectual support at the level that we see for the dominant machines in the world. Chuck's first CPU NOVIX 2000, performed multiple instructions per clock without pipelining, Interrupt handling in 2 clocks, sub-routine calls in 1 clock and return was 0 clocks on many instructions. That was done with a ridiculously small number of gates. In later years Chuck realized that a dogmatic use of only the data stack was not ideal and he added an a address register and a loop counter register to make the machines faster. It would be cool to see someone carry these concepts forward to see what's possible. reply le-mark 4 hours agoparentThis company purports to sell a forth inspired 144 core chip I haven’t seen discussed much at all; https://www.greenarraychips.com/ Apparently they had angel funding of some sort at some point. reply lebuffon 4 hours agorootparentYa that chip is really weird. Each core is so minimal that people struggle to understand how to use the chip. I think something less \"fanatic minimalism\" would be better but hey that's just me. reply astrobe_ 25 minutes agorootparentIt's not really \"fanatic\". The minimalism has a purpose: less transistors so less power, smaller size and cheaper. The previous designs from Moore focused on speed at the time when MIPS was what people were looking for (e.g. the F21 [1]) I can see this chip being used instead of \"system on chip\" (SoC) designs. Namely GA144 + a general purpose processor (if the \"business logic\" of the application is too large/complicated for a GA144). When you look at typical ARM-based SoCs, a lot of the integrated controllers are just bit-banging stuff from and to peripherals. But this is all carved in silicon, and to maximize flexibility you have a lot of additional complexity (both for the chip and the programmer) for configuration. Plus, because those chips are often used in mobile computing, you have a lot of complexity to power up and down unused parts. It seems to me that a GA144 or two, you have more flexibility (because it's all software) and low-power usage (due to its design). What this chip probably needs is libraries to talk to common peripherals (I2C, SPI, SSC, SD card controlers, LCD controlers, flash controllers...).

It is strange for the time of the story, OP's teammates didn't pick up his system and made theirs (as a team). But yeah. When a guy comes in and is allowed to do things differently and succeed when you didn't because you had to follow arbitrary rules, you have to make a conscious effort not to take a passive-aggressive stance against them and under-estimate what they are using and doing. I know that feeling. These days certainly aversion to risk makes it extremely difficult to go that route (although Forth, Inc. mentioned in TFA is still alive). The unavoidable complexity of today's software is not really a major problem that the author points out near the end, as you can fight with the same tools as everyone else in Forth, e.g. dealing with a stupidly complex thing like XML by just using one of the zillions of C XML library from Forth.
