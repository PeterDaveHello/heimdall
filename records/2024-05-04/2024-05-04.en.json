    "originBody": "DNS traffic can leak outside the VPN tunnel on Android May 3, 2024 Privacy App We were recently made aware of multiple potential DNS leaks on Android. They stem from bugs in Android itself, and only affect certain apps. On Monday 22 of April we became aware of a user report on Reddit of a DNS leak. The report detailed how the user managed to leak DNS queries when disabling and enabling VPN while having “Block connections without VPN” on. We immediately started an internal investigation that could confirm the issue. The investigation also led to more findings of scenarios that can cause DNS leaks on Android. Findings Identified scenarios where the Android OS can leak DNS traffic: If a VPN is active without any DNS server configured. For a short period of time while a VPN app is re-configuring the tunnel or is being force stopped/crashes. The leaks seem to be limited to direct calls to the C function getaddrinfo. Apps that use this way to resolve domain names cause leaks in the scenarios listed above. We have not found any leaks from apps that only use Android API:s such as DnsResolver. The Chrome browser is an example of an app that can use getaddrinfo directly. The above applies regardless of whether Always-on VPN and Block connections without VPN is enabled or not, which is not expected OS behavior and should therefore be fixed upstream in the OS. We’ve been able to confirm that these leaks occur in multiple versions of Android, including the latest version (Android 14). Improvements Our app currently does not set any DNS server in its blocking state. When our app fails to set up a tunnel in a way that is not recoverable, it enters the blocking state. In this state it stops traffic from leaving the device. However, it does not set any DNS server in this state, and as a result the above described DNS leaks can happen. We will work around the OS bug by setting a bogus DNS server for now. You can expect a release with this fix soon. The leak during tunnel reconnects is harder for us to mitigate in our app. We are still looking for solutions. We can potentially minimize the amount of times a tunnel re-configuration happens, but we currently don’t think this leak can be fully prevented. It should be made clear that these workarounds should not be needed in any VPN app. Nor is it wrong for an app to use getaddrinfo to resolve domain names. Instead, these issues should be addressed in the OS in order to protect all Android users regardless of which apps they use. We have reported the issues and suggested improvements to Google and hope that they will address this quickly. Steps to reproduce The following steps reproduce the second scenario above, where a VPN user changes the tunnel configuration, e.g. switching to another server or changing DNS server. Here we use the WireGuard app since it has become a reference Android VPN implementation. It should be noted that the leaks can probably be reproduced with any other Android VPN app also. We use Chrome to trigger the leaks since it is one of the apps we have confirmed uses getaddrinfo. Download spam_get_requests.html Install the WireGuard app & Chrome Import wg1.conf, wg2.conf into WireGuard Enable the wg1 tunnel in the WireGuard app and allow the VPN permission In Android VPN Settings enable “Always-on VPN” & “Block connections without VPN” for WireGuard Start capturing data on your router by using e.g tcpdump $ tcpdump -ihostSplit the screen to show both WireGuard & Chrome side by side Open spam_get_requests.html with Chrome & press “Start” Toggle back and fourth between wg1 and wg2 in the WireGuard app until you see the leaks in the next step. Observe DNS traffic similar to this on the router: 11:50:27.816359 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.53353 > OpenWrt.lan.53: 11200+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19282-11-50-27-519z.mullvad.test.lan.

(61) 11:50:27.816625 IP OpenWrt.lan.53 > Pixel-Tablet.lan.16747: 44584 NXDomain 0/0/0 (61) Since “Block connections without VPN” was active, nothing except encrypted WireGuard traffic should have left the device, but here we see plaintext DNS leaving the device. Conclusions and recommendations DNS leaks may have serious privacy implications for users, and can be used to derive users' approximate location or find out what websites and services a user uses. These finding also shows once again that “Block connections without VPN” does not live up to its name (or documentation) and that it has multiple flaws. Apps may still leak DNS traffic during the conditions mentioned above, and as previously reported it still leaks connection check traffic. Depending on your threat model this might mean that you should avoid using Android altogether for anything sensitive, or employ other mitigations to prevent the leaks. We aim to partially mitigate these problems in our app, so make sure to keep the app up-to-date.",

They openly said it's not for sale: https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2021/9/16/ownership-and-future-m... Not everyone's in it for the money. Assuming they're not operating at a loss, even less so. reply selectodude 18 hours agorootparentThere are billboards for Mullvad all over Chicago which kind of weird me out. reply kfreds 16 hours agorootparentI'm sorry you feel that way, but I can relate. I initially had mixed feelings about it as well. On the other hand the campaign we did in Stockholm last year worked out quite well. It managed to affect both domestic and EU legislative discussions at the time. Or at least our campaign contributed to moving the discussion in the right direction. How much is that worth? I'm not sure, but the reason we started Mullvad in the first place was to conduct political action through entrepreneurship, specifically regarding mass surveillance and censorship. If nothing else it seems to amuse a lot of people, including me and my colleagues. When I first heard of the idea of plastering privacy propaganda all over some major U.S. cities my initial reaction was more or less \"lol, we can just do that?\". As it turns out we can. :) reply j0e1 15 hours agorootparentThank you for sharing that! I am definitely part of the HN group think that tends to be irked by mass marketing- mainly because of baggage from the past of false advertising. However, I do agree that getting the non-IT geek's attention is what would actually move the needle for political action. I was amused (mostly surprised) to see a billboard while driving down the 110 in LA. More importantly, it led to a cool discussion with my non-tech wife who now appreciates your guys' brand more. :) reply chefandy 15 hours agorootparentAs frustrating as it is, even great products don't sell themselves. I find much, if not most marketing for subscription-based services pretty scummy, but it's not like it has to be, and I'd much rather see physical ads than how most stuff gets surreptitiously slipped into my surveillance-capitalism-sponsored life. reply walterbell 14 hours agorootparentprev> plastering privacy propaganda all over some major U.S. cities The ads are great to see in NYC subway and giant billboard near NY Times HQ. Is there an online page with all of the ads? Maybe a video tour of the ads \"in the wild\" in different cities? reply kfreds 11 hours agorootparentThanks! I don't think so unfortunately. It's a great idea though. reply walterbell 11 hours agorootparentSince there's no existing compendium, maybe a social media contest for people submitting photos of anonymized objects (e.g. in a box), books (hardback with custom cover), humans (costume/mask/etc) with Mullvad ads / billboard in the background. Crowdsource field reporting and motivate discussion about metadata in online and offline privacy. reply gaudystead 15 hours agorootparentprevOkay, this comment was the comment that got me sold on Mullvad. I was looking for a VPN I liked anyway and if you also use your business entity to help drive legislation toward a more privacy focused end, I'm in. reply trelane 12 hours agorootparentFor me, (one of) the moments was when there figured out how to do remote attestation of the server to check that what it was running was what you expected, so you could check its privacy yourself. Rather a neat subversion of the common corporate use of remote attestation, to preserve user privacy and security rather than curtail it. reply kfreds 11 hours agorootparentThank you! You are of course referring to System Transparency. I feel obligated to point out that we have yet to fully implement that idea. I've been working on it, and the related projects Sigsum and Tillitis, for the past six years. There have been lots of detours, but we are making progress towards the vision outlined in the blog post I wrote in 2019: https://mullvad.net/en/blog/system-transparency-future Two years ago we moved the OSS projects System Transparency and Sigsum to its own organization: Glasklar Teknik AB (glasklarteknik.se). The OSS and OSHW project TKey was moved to Mullvad's other sister company Tillitis AB (tillitis.se) reply SturgeonsLaw 11 hours agorootparentprevhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sousveillance reply anakaine 7 hours agorootparentprevThank you for the service that you and the rest of the team provide. I've found it to be excellent, and you're one of only a very slim number of transparent VPN providers who seem to be in it for the right reasons. reply pyinstallwoes 15 hours agorootparentprevHow did you measure the effectiveness of physical ads to issues and other key metrics? I’m just curious what it takes to measure those as it’s always been mysterious to me. It seems like it needs to include a coupon code or something? Also interesting re: legislation. How so? reply kfreds 14 hours agorootparentTo my knowledge we don't measure it, at least not in the way I think you mean. I can't speak for my marketing colleagues but I would assume they reason about it. It seems like a complex system to me, which means the approach kind of has to be (1) forming an understanding of the system and (2) deciding whether one is comfortable with the uncertainty. One aspect that makes the cost/benefit assessment quite a bit easier is that we don't only care about how many new paying customers we get. It's also fun to do this kind of advertisement. How many interesting conversations about privacy have been had as a result of people seeing our billboards? That's worth something too. reply nickburns 16 hours agorootparentprevthank you for offering up in this forum at least your own personal contributions to your organization's position on its advertising campaigns. not sure if any official statements on the matter have been made elsewhere, but you've assuaged at least my own slight concern about it with this one. truly. (and by 'truly' i mean i've been meaning to stuff some cash in an envelope addressed to you guys!) transparency is absolutely a corporate virtue. reply ziddoap 18 hours agorootparentprevThey do traditional advertising (billboards being one example) instead of paid reviews, affiliate/influencer advertising, etc. https://mullvad.net/en/help/policy-reviews-advertising-and-a... reply neuronexmachina 16 hours agorootparentOh wow, I wish more companies had pages like that summarizing what sort of marketing/advertising they do/don't use. reply ziddoap 16 hours agorootparentI’m fanboying at this point, but I honestly believe Mullvad should be the poster child for a lot of things other companies should be doing. Transparency, accountability, data minimization, thorough documentation, publicly available audits, etc. reply hughesjj 15 hours agorootparentI've been a happy expressvpn customer since dec 2016 but I'm sincerely considering switching to mullvad at this point reply starttoaster 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat is it about a company spreading awareness about their product that weirds you out in particular, I'm curious? Billboard advertisements are an awareness type of advertisement. I'd be much more concerned to learn about paid endorsements, which they document on their website that they specifically do not do. Endorsements are a much more sensitive form of advertising, where once money trades hands for an endorsement, it stops being a useful third party assessment and starts being an advertisement disguised as a third party assessment. Awareness advertisements just make good business sense, so I'm genuinely curious why those would shy anybody away. reply int_19h 14 hours agorootparentI agree with you, but I also understand where GP is coming from. For the past 20 years, what people are mostly exposed to is internet ads, which are, to put it mildly, pushy. As a result, all ads now have to deal with considerable negative sentiment as a baseline simply by virtue of being ads. reply epcoa 16 hours agorootparentprevI saw them on the side of a CTA bus for the first time the other day. I don’t think it is bad at all, but the initial reaction for me as an American used to typical bus advertising it was exactly as if seeing an ad for 4chan there. It just isn’t the expected modality for the product. (Seeing the reply down thread from a Mullvad rep, this is not unexpected) reply nick238 17 hours agorootparentprevnext [7 more] [flagged] ziddoap 17 hours agorootparentHoly unsubstantiated accusations, batman. This can be instantly disproved by examining the cases where valid warrants were presented to them by LEAs and they were unable to provide any user data. reply lambdaxyzw 17 hours agorootparentAlso they actually make it easy to use their services without providing any data - you can use them by paying Monero over tor, and the only thing identifying you is a short unique \"identifying number\" - no emails, no names, not even an account. reply yencabulator 16 hours agorootparentI find their gimmick of \"buy a physical gift card from Amazon, scratch to reveal one-time code\" to be pretty genius. It's just a bulk pile of cards, Amazon records you bought one but doesn't know which one (and the actual code is under a scratch-to-reveal surface). Even if a three-letter agency intercepted your package and swapped your gift card with a known code, I believe Mullvad is not recording the connection between specific gift code and the account number. You can also exchange unscratched gift cards with friends and strangers. reply ziddoap 17 hours agorootparentprevIndeed. They even accept cash via envelope -- just provide an account number to put the cash towards. reply nick238 14 hours agorootparentprevI'm not saying it's substantiated at all, it just feels very sudden and too weird. reply kfreds 16 hours agorootparentprevIt's quite simple really. 1. We launched Mullvad 15 years ago. During those 15 years people's interest and awareness of online security and privacy has grown considerably, as has the consumer VPN market. 2. Our strategy is quite different from most of our competitors'. As a result we've grown slower than several of them, but we have nevertheless continued to grow year after year. 3. The costs of the campaign are perhaps lower than you assume. tl;dr We've slowly grown over many years and are now making enough money to plaster privacy propaganda over your city. Hopefully it's an interesting change from the usual bus ads. Enjoy! reply ph0ny 14 hours agorootparentprevThey are making bank. Thank you open Swedish data: https://www.allabolag.se/5592384001/mullvad-vpn-ab reply Groxx 19 hours agorootparentprevNot everyone telegraphs if they're in it for the money. In some lines of business, like (purely hypothetically) security, it might actually be a bad thing for your business if you do. I also use mullvad because I don't really think this is the case, but bad actors are generally hard to conclusively identify by design. And VPNs are pretty far out in the \"just trust me bro\" realm of handing over all your browsing habits with no ability to check their real behavior. reply yencabulator 16 hours agorootparentMullvad is trying pretty darn hard to be as far from \"just trust me bro\" as is feasible. If you do take their word for how they run their systems (/are working toward), their servers are diskless (what logs?), will only run software signed by their infrastructure team, and will remotely attest that their software has not been tampered with. This is so very, very, far away from the typical VPN company that any such comparison sounds ridiculous to me. Just the pretense of doing all this work costs so much that a greedy biz bro simply wouldn't. https://github.com/mullvad/system-transparency https://www.system-transparency.org https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29903695 reply kfreds 16 hours agorootparentThank you for noticing! System Transparency is taking way longer to figure out, design and build than I expected. On the other hand the project is quite ambitious, and our work on ST has sprouted two additional OSS projects: - https://www.sigsum.org (a transparency log with witness cosigning) - https://tillitis.se (an open-source hardware FPGA-based security key with measured boot) reply fragmede 14 hours agorootparentprev> a greedy biz bro simply wouldn't. On the other hand, if it were an NSA honeypot, doing all that work would easily be worth the cost. Personally, I don't think they are, so I'm merely pointing out that there are angles other than totally above-board honest legitimate reasons, and \"greedy biz bro\". reply yencabulator 14 hours agorootparentFor sure. Them being Swedes with a long track record decreases that probability a lot. reply kfreds 16 hours agorootparentprev> VPNs are pretty far out in the \"just trust me bro\" realm of handing over all your browsing habits with no ability to check their real behavior. Yes. It is quite an interesting situation, really. It's also a fun challenge! To what extent can we prove that we are trustworthy, and using what tools? Do those tools exist or do we have to invent them? reply fragmede 13 hours agorootparentYou'd have to invent this one at least, as it currently doesn't exist. As the DNS server operator, you can view all my DNS queries. In a zero-trust environment where I don't trust you not to log all user queries and forwards them to the NSA, you'd need to use homomorphic encryption and create a DNS client and server than can do a lookup, without you, the DNS server operator, from finding out what the DNS lookup was of. https://github.com/menonsamir/spiral-rs claims to have implemented this at a level that's practical for real world applications, with a demo for a wikipedia server, but it's far too slow, as demoed, for use as DNS server. Now, the fact of the matter is that you can map my account ID back to the IP I'm connecting from, but with very limited way to map from my IP to my identity protects that in many ways, but data-mining at scale, knowing how many users connecting to one proxy server from city X, would be worth something to advertising and related companies who are more interested in large habits of users. If it turns out no one uses the pirate bay anymore, but use torrent site XYZ, I know where I'd place my advertising dollars for, say, a VPN product. This is on the extreme end, but you asked for a fun challenge! :) reply kfreds 12 hours agorootparentThanks! :) I should've been more clear. The questions I posed above are rhetorical. I've spent well over half a decade obsessing over them. See my mention of System Transparency, Sigsum and Tillitis elsewhere in this thread. reply fragmede 5 hours agorootparentThank you for your hard work. You've spent way more time on the problem than I. Didn't realize it was rhetorical! Mostly I wanna see homophobic encryption happen in practice. :p reply Groxx 7 hours agorootparentprevtbh I don't think they exist. And I'm, like, half okay with that - it's entirely justified paranoia, bad actors of all skill levels undeniably exist and they hide successfully for many years, but I do believe good actors exist. It's why I chose mullvad. At best you have stuff like attestation... but we all know those have a long history of being flawed and are subject to loads of side channels that can't be attested against. Plus VPNs are such a honeypot in every conceivable way that TONS of state-actor-level efforts are entirely reasonable, and that could easily include cheating on basically all attestation systems imaginable. We're just kinda stuck trusting history and lack of public leaks / correlated actions / whistleblowers IMO. Or, frankly, the Mozilla partnering counts for a lot to me. I won't use their setup because it doesn't have non-vpn-app options, but they're a group I mostly trust to have people's safety at heart. Personally, stuff like Tor (where by construction you only need to touch a couple good actors to be reasonably secure, and anyone can contribute) is about the only mostly-actually-trustworthy kind of system. You can expect malicious actors to participate there, and still have a reasonable level of privacy, particularly if you check a few personally (which is feasible because anyone can contribute). Tor and similar have plenty of issues, but structurally they're much more sound by design than any centralized VPN can ever be. Now if only they were even a tiny fraction as usable... reply reaperman 19 hours agorootparentprevI think legally they would have to change their ownership directive document in Switzerland to allow the board of directors to allow the two founders to sell more than 50% of their shares.

I live in nyc and in the last few months I’ve seen a _lot_ of ads from them. Huge billboards in high-traffic areas. Full-sized ads on a side of a bus. A whole subway car just with mullvad ads. Some of the ads also felt deceptive making it seem like it will prevent all your online tracking, even though we know that’s not the case. reply kfreds 16 hours agorootparent> Some of the ads also felt deceptive making it seem like it will prevent all your online tracking, even though we know that’s not the case. I'm sorry to hear that. For what it's worth our marketing colleagues make a big effort to minimize the risk of such interpretations. Sometimes a really snappy string of words can be interpreted multiple ways. There's also only so many words we can put on an ad before it gets messy. We do try hard to make the nuances clear on our website, which ultimately is where any new users will have to go in order to buy the service. reply woodruffw 15 hours agorootparentI’m a big fan of your service, but I agree with GP. I rode the subway yesterday and saw a Mullvad ad that strongly implied that a VPN is adequate protection against data brokers and data collection on websites. It certainly wasn’t the most egregious VPN ad I’ve ever seen, but it was disappointing to see Mullvad imply privacy properties for VPNs knowing that ordinary people don’t understand cookies, sessions, fingerprinting, or JavaScript. reply kfreds 11 hours agorootparentDid the ad in fact talk about the VPN by itself, or in conjunction with the Mullvad Browser? In any case we make the most important nuances clear on our landing page, and in other places on our website. reply woodruffw 8 hours agorootparentI believe it just said Mullvad, which I interpreted to be the VPN. It was on the NYC subway. reply wepple 14 hours agorootparentprevSorry, not buying it. To claim that you stop online ad networks is a downright falsehood and you know it.

Mullvad and a few others have had to disable this feature because it turns out it’s super useful for hosting malware C&C servers, phishing pages, etc reply Gormo 13 hours agorootparentI sort of understand their reasoning, then, because acting as a reverse proxy for externally-initiated inbound connections is not typically within the scope of VPN services per se, and especially outside the scope of Mullvad's particular mission of offering VPN services for the purposes of protecting privacy and suppressing censorship. There are other solutions for your use case, with or without a third-party VPN, that wouldn't require port forwarding.

Unlike a firewall-based implementation, the Network permission toggle prevents apps from using the network via APIs provided by the OS or other apps in the same profile as long as they're marked appropriately. >The standard INTERNET permission used as the basis for the Network permission toggle is enhanced with a second layer of enforcement and proper support for granting/revoking it on a per-profile basis. > To avoid breaking compatibility with Android apps, the added permission toggle is enabled by default. However, the OS app installation UI has been extended to show the toggle as part of the installation confirmation page so users can disable it when installing an app. > when the Network permission is disabled, GrapheneOS pretends the network is down. It shows the network as down in various APIs, returns errors showing a network connectivity issue rather than a revoked permission and avoids running scheduled jobs depending on the network. This results in apps handling it as if the network is down rather than crashing or showing errors from trying to use the network and being unable to do it. reply sureglymop 14 hours agorootparentprevNope. GrapheneOS is an AOSP fork (with not so many modifications) intended to be more secure. It doesn't do it in a hacky way, these apps just don't get the internet permission.

What are your thoughts on that? reply strcat 12 hours agorootparentMaking userdebug builds with ro.adb.secure=1 to have root access via ADB with the rest of the security model intact is officially supported by GrapheneOS. Using Magisk massively rolls back the OS security model and is strongly discouraged. Using ADB on a production device isn't recommended with or without root, but it's officially supported if you want to do it. If you only grant ADB access to the computer you use for building and signing the OS, it's not a big deal. You need to be aware that you need to heavily secure that computer and shouldn't use it for anything else though. reply NotPractical 14 hours agorootparentprevNot OP, but I think that their concerns are legitimate for the most part. One example they've brought up is that, with root, a single bug in the display server could lead to complete and immediate compromise of the entire device (assuming root access is gated by UI prompts as is common on most rooted ROMs). Additionally, with verified boot, persistent changes to the OS made via root would cause the phone to be unable to reboot, which limits what you can do with root (assuming you still want verified boot). GrapheneOS standards are much higher than on desktop Linux, where root can be acquired as easily as injecting a fake `sudo` into ~/.bashrc. Basically the idea is that there should be no need for root if everything is nicely gated by permission controls and high-level APIs. If every component of Android were actually well-designed, this idea would have more merit, but unfortunately there are still a few big gaps in what you can do with a rooted versus non-rooted device, e.g. custom firewall rules (which could provide a hotfix for the issue at hand here). When asked to expose more fine-grained firewall control to the end user, the Graphene devs basically responded that it's extremely difficult to set up firewall rules properly such that leaks are impossible [1], which may be true, but I'd like to think it's better than nothing. Also, because root access would break Android's protection against end user application tampering, that would likely rule out the possibility of GrapheneOS receiving special support from banking apps, which is something they hope to see in the future [2]. Anyway, this particular issue is definitely a bug in AOSP, and will hopefully be resolved promptly. It's being tracked here: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/337961996 [1] https://discuss.grapheneos.org/d/4113/6 [2] https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-gu... reply strcat 12 hours agorootparentIt's app accessible root with a massive portion of the OS trusted with giving out access to it that's a huge problem and massively rolls back OS security against compromise. It also means an accessibility service can trivially escalate to root with no way to revoke it beyond reinstalling the OS or doing a wipe from recovery. You also lose the main security properties of verified boot, which is based around avoiding trust in persistent state. Raising the bar for physical attacks is a secondary purpose of verified boot, not the main one. GrapheneOS already has fine-grained firewall support exposed to the user via the standard VPN service feature which despite misconceptions can be used while also using an actual VPN and there are multiple apps supporting this. It's not simply difficult to set up firewall rules where leaks aren't possible but rather it doesn't really work because not everything is done via direct socket access from the apps. This is why we have our Network toggle in the first place, which does a lot more than blocking direct socket access both to block indirect access and preserve compatibility by pretending the network is down for the most important APIs. These DNS leak issues which were reported to us earlier may be an app bug which can be worked around by the app. The OS could be changed to prevent this happening but that doesn't imply that it's an OS bug. More investigation is required to determine the cause and solution. We're also aware of a local network multicast leak that's not covered in Mullvad's post, which is very likely to be an Android OS bug but we aren't certain about that yet either. It's worth noting that neither the DNS leak issues or local network multicast leak issue impact the built-in VPN support. They're only happening with VPN apps. It's likely that some of this is caused by bugs in the Android VPN service app support (particularly the multicast packet leaks) but the DNS leaks are quite possibly an app flaw. Mullvad's post acknowledges they found a way to address one of the forms of leaks with changes to their app, which may be possible for the rest since there aren't leaks when the VPN is down but rather when it's in the process of reconnecting. It looks a lot like a race condition where the VPN is being activated before everything is in place, which could be a bug in the OS but could also be a bug in the app where it's doing something in a different order than what's intended. reply NotPractical 10 hours agorootparent> GrapheneOS already has fine-grained firewall support exposed to the user via the standard VPN service feature which despite misconceptions can be used while also using an actual VPN and there are multiple apps supporting this. Interesting, didn't know that. Maybe I should file an issue with the official WireGuard app asking them to support this. It would be nice if \"multiple VPNs\" was provided as an OS feature. > It's not simply difficult to set up firewall rules where leaks aren't possible but rather it doesn't really work because not everything is done via direct socket access from the apps. This only applies to rules intended for specific apps and not system-wide rules, no? I'd hope so, since as you said people are already applying system-wide (or at least user-wide) rules using the VPN interface. reply commoner 15 hours agorootparentprevAnyone who prefers root access on Android with a locked bootloader (on the OSes that support it) can use avbroot: https://github.com/chenxiaolong/avbroot Works great with CalyxOS and GrapheneOS. reply strcat 12 hours agorootparentThis doesn't work with GrapheneOS but rather you can create a derivative of GrapheneOS without the core security model intact. Instead of a tiny core portion of the OS being trusted with root access, a massive portion of the OS is trusted with that. It's much easier for an application to compromise the OS. An attacker doesn't need exploits for privileged persistent compromise anymore but rather that's a given since the verified boot security model is no longer intact. The purpose of locking the bootloader is enabling verified boot, which is no longer intact with this approach. CalyxOS doesn't have a complete verified boot implementation for the OS like GrapheneOS and rolls back the standard security model a fair bit, but doing this rolls it back far more. You cannot have your cake and eat it too in this case. If you want modifications to the OS, you should use the official build instructions and avoid replacing the core of the OS with a rootkit trusting a massive portion of the OS to give out root access and trusting persistent state with root access. reply commoner 7 hours agorootparentavbroot is not officially supported by CalyxOS or GrapheneOS, but it does work with both OSes. The point of avbroot is to make root access available to trusted Android apps while leaving commands such as \"fastboot flash\" and \"fastboot erase\" disabled. There will always be a subset of users who prioritize functionality over security. This includes anyone who would root an Android device (and anyone who would use a desktop computer running most distributions of Linux, macOS, or Windows). I'll be glad to reconsider using root on Android if all of the functions of App Manager's \"block trackers\" feature[1] and Basic Call Recorder[2] were available on Android without root. [1] App Manager: https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/AppManager [2] BCR (Basic Call Recorder): https://github.com/chenxiaolong/BCR reply sureglymop 12 hours agorootparentprevWhat about OTA updates? Do they preserve it? reply strcat 12 hours agorootparentNo, it's not compatible with receiving official over-the-air updates. Similarly to if you build and signed the OS properly, you'll need to make each of the updates yourself. Unlike building and signing the OS properly, you will not have the basic security model intact but rather will be massively rolling back security and trusting a huge portion of the OS with root access. Giving root to a massive portion of the OS destroys the fine grained access control and isolation model used throughout the OS. It makes exploitation much easier to do and much easier to hide. It also makes persistence a given since persistent root access can be given out which means an attacker doesn't need any verified boot bypass anymore. It's odd to go through all this effort to continue signing the OS for verified boot while losing the main verified boot security model which makes it useful. If you want root access, build and sign userdebug builds with ro.adb.secure=1, which is officially supported by GrapheneOS and only exposes root access via ADB which you should only use from the computer where you're building the OS. It would be possible to add some kind of key combination at boot to disable loading user installed applications, etc. and instead making a terminal with root access available. Not clear how that's really useful though. Instead, what these projects are doing is giving out root access to a massive portion of the OS in order to be able to give out full root access to apps. This is used as a shortcut to implement features in a way that massively reduces security even if you never use it. Implementing those features properly integrated into the OS following the principle of least privilege is the proper approach. Most of the features people believe they need this hack to achieve are doable without it, such as filtering traffic with your own firewall rules while also using a VPN which is a standard Android feature available to apps. reply commoner 8 hours agorootparentprevNo, over-the-air updates are not supported.

Weiss May 02, 2024 Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn Lithium-free sodium batteries exit the lab and enter US production Blue has become Natron Energy's signature color owing to the patented Prussian Blue electrons it uses for the fast, frequent transfer of sodium ions that underpin its claims of 10 times lithium-ion's cycling speeds and a 50,000-cycle lifespan Natron Energy View 3 Images 1/3 Blue has become Natron Energy's signature color owing to the patented Prussian Blue electrons it uses for the fast, frequent transfer of sodium ions that underpin its claims of 10 times lithium-ion's cycling speeds and a 50,000-cycle lifespan Natron Energy 2/3 Natron has begun production at its Holland, Michigan facility Natron Energy 3/3 Natron is targeting industrial backup power applications with. products like the BlueRack 250 battery cabinet, designed to scale from a kilowatt to multi megawatts Natron Energy View gallery - 3 images Two years ago, sodium-ion battery pioneer Natron Energy was busy preparing its specially formulated sodium batteries for mass production. The company slipped a little past its 2023 kickoff plans, but it didn't fall too far behind as far as mass battery production goes. It officially commenced production of its rapid-charging, long-life lithium-free sodium batteries this week, bringing to market an intriguing new alternative in the energy storage game. Not only is sodium somewhere between 500 to 1,000 times more abundant than lithium on the planet we call Earth, sourcing it doesn't necessitate the same type of earth-scarring extraction. Even moving beyond the sodium vs lithium surname comparison, Natron says its sodium-ion batteries are made entirely from abundantly available commodity materials that also include aluminum, iron and manganese. More Stories Materials Copper coating turns touchscreens into bacteria killers Biology Wild orangutan engaged in never-before-seen wound-healing behavior Furthermore, the materials for Natron's sodium-ion chemistry can be procured through a reliable US-based domestic supply chain free from geopolitical disruption. The same cannot be said for common lithium-ion materials like cobalt and nickel. Sodium-ion tech has received heightened interest in recent years as a more reliable, potentially cheaper energy storage medium. While its energy density lags behind lithium-ion, advantages such as faster cycling, longer lifespan and safer, non-flammable end use have made sodium-ion an attractive alternative, especially for stationary uses like data center and EV charger backup storage. Founded in 2013, Natron has been one of the pioneers in this new wave of sodium-ion research and innovation. And while most sodium-ion designs remain in the laboratory, Natron has switched on one of the first major production operations globally. It celebrated the official production kick-off earlier this week with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at its Holland, Michigan manufacturing facility, calling it the first-ever commercial-scale production of sodium-ion batteries in the US. \"Sodium-ion batteries offer a unique alternative to lithium-ion, with higher power, faster recharge, longer lifecycle and a completely safe and stable chemistry,\" Natron founder and co-CEO Colin Wessells said at the event. \"The electrification of our economy is dependent on the development and production of new, innovative energy storage solutions. We at Natron are proud to deliver such a battery without the use of conflict minerals or materials with questionable environmental impacts.\" Natron has begun production at its Holland, Michigan facility Natron Energy Natron says its batteries charge and discharge at rates 10 times faster than lithium-ion, a level of immediate charge/discharge capability that makes the batteries a prime contender for the ups and downs of backup power storage. Also helping in that use case is an estimated lifespan of 50,000 cycles. We haven't seen a weight-based energy density figure from Natron itself, but a 2022 article from Chemical & Engineering News put its sodium-ion batteries at 70 Wh/kg, around the very bottom of the sodium-ion energy density scale. That aligns well with the company's stationary-only business plan, as sodium-ion batteries being pursued for potential mobility use have more than double that density. CATL showed a 160 Wh/kg sodium-ion battery in 2021 and has plans to increase that density over 200 Wh/kg to better meet the needs of electric vehicles. Natron's plans call for the Holland facility to crank production up to 600 megawatts annually at full tilt, serving as a model for future gigawatt-scale facilities. In the two years since we last looked at Natron's plans, AI has grown a whole lot more power-hungry so it's not surprising the company's initial target is AI data storage centers, where it's fast-cycling batteries could become an essential power management tool. It plans to begin the first deliveries in June. Natron intends to expand its focus to other industrial power markets in the future, mentioning EV fast-charging and telecommunications as targets.

You've stated: >\"Mostly from Australia and Chile\" seems like the opposite of baggage, that sounds like about the best you could hope for in a global commodity, so many of which come from unstable regions, conflict regions, or outright adversaries. So let's break it down with some facts (all easily searchable.) (1) The graph states that Australia is the largest producer of Lithium, and states that of their exports, 90% goes to China. (2) Australia exports the majority of its lithium. (https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/insights-australian-exports-...) (3) Lithium ion batteries are currently reliant on Cobalt for their cathode. (4) The DRC (Congo) is the largest producer of Cobalt, then Indonesia, then Russia. >\"seems like the opposite of baggage ... unstable regions, conflict regions, or outright adversaries\" From (1) and (2) we can see that the world is dependent on China for the only viable battery option for a range of modern applications. Thus the claim that this isn't baggage is not supported. Secondly China is also considered an adversary of the USA, by the USA. Thirdly the claim that this does not involve unstable/conflict regions is also not supported due to (3) and (4). Part two: you've also stated the below: >\"Building new Na-ion capacity outside China\" is probably even harder than \"building new li-ion capacity outside China.\" While this is a baseless comment, let's look at it anyway: (5) The article is specifically about the commencement of mass production of Na batteries in the USA. That already refutes the core premise of your statement, but let's follow it further. (6) The article notes that unlike Li batteries, the materials are trivially sourced domestically. That's an important difference from Li batteries, and significantly boosts the viability of competitive production in the USA (and other countries outside of China). reply topspin 13 hours agorootparentGood analysis, until you got here: > While this is a baseless comment, let's look at it anyway: It's not baseless. This is a golden boy startup, blessed with save the Earth kudos and highly subsidized. The DOE spun this outfit up in 2020 with $19M. Michigan and Whitmer have fast tracked the one, modest, token plant, delivered the tax breaks and signed the contracts for a sodium battery power facility in the state. VC money chased after all this as you would expect. Those are all temporary or one-time goodies. This is heavy industry and at some point all the love goes away: the subsidies go away, the exemptions go away. Then the foreign competitors steal your tech and undercut you.

There are some projects in Europe using overhead lines (for trucks) or power rails embedded in slots in the road surface (usable by cars or trucks) so that vehicles can recharge while moving. Building a network of electrified highways is expensive though. One way to reduce initial costs is not to electrify the whole length but to have, say, one mile of electrified road per every ten miles of highway. To get unlimited range from that 1:10 ratio, you need the vehicles to have batteries capable of absorbing power 9x faster than the vehicle uses it to maintain highway speeds. I could see EVs having a large lithium ion pack and, if this technology is really that good, a smaller sodium ion battery to act sort of like a capacitor to smooth out intermittent charging. I could also see low-capacity-high-power-density batteries being used in hybrids, though those need to be able to sustain high discharge rates as well as high charge rates, and I don't think the article mentioned discharge rates. reply dieortin 11 hours agorootparentCharging private vehicles while they move sounds very complicated reply elihu 9 hours agorootparentThis is one way to do it: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/12/worlds-f... Overhead cables are simpler and cheaper, but not easily compatible with cars (which would need a comically tall pantograph to connect to the cables). (Induction is a third option, but it's not really viable except in certain special cases because it's way more expensive, can't deliver as much power, and tends to be less energy efficient.) Electrifying highways may sound expensive or complicated, but consider what the alternatives are. We could stick with fossil fuels. The U.S. burns about 4 million barrels of gasoline and about 4 million barrels of diesel a day, most of which is used to push cars and trucks around. That's not simple or cheap, we're just accustomed to the cost. Another option is we switch to EVs and rely on big batteries for range. That kind of works, but battery manufacturing scale isn't there. It's also kind of wasteful to have a substantial portion of the vehicle weight being batteries. It means cars and trucks are heavier than they need to be, and they can haul less cargo. If we could get to the point where, say, someone could drive coast-to-coast without ever having to stop to charge with only 30 or 40 kwh battery, that would be huge. It would reduce EV costs dramatically, it would reduce average vehicle weight, and you might even get better performance. (This wouldn't completely eliminate the need for some long-range vehicles for areas not served by electrified highways, but for most uses it should be fine.) reply bufferoverflow 7 hours agorootparentprevTrolleybus is a technology from over 100 year ago. reply kube-system 4 hours agorootparentYes, but a primary advantage to private transportation is the ability to drive it in locations other than predefined routes in dense city centers. reply theendisney 9 hours agorootparentprevimagine this!

As long as the usage profile fits inside of the cache, it runs as though the entire system is cache. reply jdewerd 14 hours agorootparentprevIs charge time important because you can't install a L2 charger at home / apartment to keep it \"always charged\" or because your usage pattern is too heavy duty for a 30 minute break every 200-300mi? If it's just the former, the slow steady march of EV mindshare might solve your needs before the \"L4\" super-fast-charging battery. I am starting to see L2 chargers pop up in apartment parking lots, for example. IMO, \"always charged\" is significantly more convenient than short stops at a station, so it would still be desirable in a world where \"L4\" batteries and stations were common. reply silisili 14 hours agorootparentThe latter, actually. I'd much prefer to stop for five minutes every 2 hours than 30 minutes every 4 hours. reply pornel 13 hours agorootparentThe current state of the art is somewhere in between with 18 minutes per ~3 hours. It even helps to split charging into shorter sessions (2x 9 minutes), because batteries charge fastest when they're about 25% full. Keep in mind that EVs charge unattended, so you only spend a minute plugging in, and can leave to get a coffee, etc. reply r00fus 8 hours agorootparentLast time we had to fast charge on the way to Yosemite, we had lunch at a strategically parked taco truck in the same lot (they even had a picnic table).

I don't keep up with it like I probably should, but seem to often read that some chargers are outdated, and sometimes you have to 'share' if somebody else is charging nearby? reply pornel 9 hours agorootparentIn the EU, there are Ionity and Fastned networks that can guarantee their chargers will be fast enough for this (>=250kW), and together they have a pretty decent coverage along major highways. There are setups that have their max rated power per dispenser (“pump”), and halve it if two cars are plugged in to the same dispenser at the same time. Good chargers can do 300kW. If that splits to 150kW it’s not too bad - maybe 5 min slower, rather than double. That’s because the max speed the car can take is a curve, and that only flattens the peak. However, for the 18-min charging the biggest gotcha is the temperature. In Hyundai/Kia it requires the battery to be at 20-25°C. That’s easy in the summer. In the winter the charging speed can drop as low as 80kW. reply rootusrootus 13 hours agorootparentprevI'd prefer shorter times on road trip charging, too. But I still ended up buying an EV because I only need road trip fast charging a few times a year, and now I don't have to carve out 20 minutes every couple weeks to go find a gas station and fill up. The overall time savings for me is significant. reply jml78 11 hours agorootparentprevI also think the roadtrip inconvenience is vastly overblown. Had an EV since 2018. It is our roadtrip car.

The model is, go to a truck depot with a 300 gallon trailer, fill up trailer and truck, park the trailer at home. Then fuel the truck off the trailer until it needs to be filled again, repeat. Do understand that, you can get a larger tank, but anything over 1000 gallons requires a placard/permit to haul around. That's in a single tank, so, in theory, a legal length 5th wheel trailer could have multiple tanks under that and be compliant. If you want the tanks attached to a vehicle itself, the maximum size is 150 gallons, hence why semi trucks have multiple fuel tanks that are smaller than that. Really the only difficulty is finding a place nearby that is willing to sell that much fuel to an individual. reply eternityforest 10 hours agorootparentIs running a generator for long periods cost effective? If someone lived where the grid wasn't reliable, and could make the initial investment for all this fuel storage stuff, why not do solar? reply jtriangle 9 hours agorootparentUsually it's a backup thing, not a 24/7 thing. If you're really out in the sticks, solar/battery/genset is a very likely complete system. I know of a couple places way up north in Saskatchewan that have what amounts to a mining village running off a big portable genset backed up with batteries, and one of them I know was just on a very big genset, and they were able to pay for a battery bank by downsizing their generator significantly due to the disparity between peak load and average load. I'd share the article I read about it, but, in spite of my normally excellent google-fu, I've been unable to find it. Either way, people forget about this, because if you have any sort of power generation, doesn't matter the method, if you go over capacity, you have brownouts/blackouts/grid failure/etc. What is deployed now, for the most part, is sufficient genset capacity to ramp into peak load, and most of it is under-utilized the majority of the time. Batteries eventually pay for themselves because of this, as they allow for peak load handling in addition to allowing generating capacity to stay online and remain profitable outside of peak load events. It really is revolutionary. More or less, gridscale batteries are what dams/reservoirs were to water systems, and if you consider the impact of us as a species being able to save water for later use at-will, the promise we're looking at is going to really change the way we live. reply rossjudson 13 hours agorootparentprev\"You mean I can't just drive the car?

Having said that - if we can get cheap and safe batteries installed within the charging stations, this would make for an awesome improvement reply ggreer 14 hours agorootparentMost charging stations already have lithium batteries installed as a buffer for the grid, and those batteries tend to be safer designs since there's no weight/density penalty for fixed infrastructure. Sodium batteries would just make charging stations cheaper to build. A lot of people tend to think of the ideal charging station as a gas station, where lots of cars go to quickly add range. But gas stations have large capacity because of their disadvantages. Ideally if they were safe, cheap, and compact, wouldn't you want gas stations everywhere? I'd love to have a gas station at home, in every parking garage, and at every scenic viewpoint on the road. The reason we don't have that is because gas stations emit toxic vapors and have giant tanks of combustible liquid. They need tanker trucks to regularly refuel them. Charging stations don't have those problems, which is why you can make them much smaller and put them almost anywhere. You don't even need a grid connection.

It makes for such a difference: knowing that you don't need to worry about that 1%. reply karmajunkie 12 hours agorootparentThe argument against hybrids that's always resonated with me is that you get the maintenance costs of a gasoline engine with the upfront costs of a battery. I've owned a Leaf and found it relatively trouble-free but never a hybrid. Am I just buying into FUD there? reply tedd4u 9 hours agorootparentIt's easy to like plug-in hybrids (I do), but it does feel transitional. As you pointed out, you have the potential for higher maintenance costs, _plus_ during electric operation, you carry the weight of ICE, fuel, fancy transmission, etc. which makes electric operation less efficient. And vice versa, during ICE operation you have a big battery and motor to carry around, reducing fossil fuel efficiency. I guess you could add a boiler and coal hopper for tri-modal steam operation. One caveat is, depending on your workload, you might put only 25% of the time on the ICE per mile driven (since most short trips would be electric). I.e. if an ICE car runs the engine for 2,500 hours per 100,000 miles, a plug-in hybrid might only have run the engine 500-600 hours at 100k miles. reply brnt 3 hours agorootparentI used to think of it as transitional too, but 1% net use isn't really. That is a level that seems sustainable to me, perhaps even competitive after you subtract the production impact of an equivalent battery pack. reply cmrdporcupine 7 hours agorootparentprevIn the Voltec drivetrain when the ICE is running the whole battery system is complimentary to it, not a detriment. It is precisely what allows it to be efficient. It uses an Atkinson cycle ICE for higher efficiency, and then uses the electric motor to augment locomotion, and the battery as a \"buffer\" with regen, etc. I rarely use the ICE mode, most of my driving is within range, but when I do, it's very performant and efficient, and hard to tell you're switched to combustion if it wasn't for the noise. It still drives mostly like an EV. And honestly, the ICE itself isn't very heavy -- nothing compared to a battery -- and as I said elsewhere, maintenance hasn't been an issue in the 5 years I've had mine. Oil change every 2 years (or more if you use the ICE a lot... I don't), that's it. The heaviness argument is especially baffling to me. Carrying around a 60kWh battery pack that you only use for road trips is way heavier and less efficient. Most drivers are not using their whole battery pack in daily use, so it's just stupid expensive dead weight, much heavier than an ICE you use occasionally. I want an ICE-less future as much as the next person, but it kinda pisses me off how EV purists who actually knew very little about the Voltec drivetrain basically got that product killed off. Emissions on roads would be drastically reduced if vehicles were switched to that model (which is not a PHEV like the other junk hybrids, but more of a range-assisted EV) without the very high cost and weight of large battery packs. Very much a \"best is the enemy of the good\" situation. I'd like about 10kWh more in my Volt, and 6kW charging. Other than that, perfect car. reply twobitshifter 8 hours agorootparentprevHaven’t own an EV but I have done lots of research. For the BMW i3 which is another series hybrid with more range, it seems 60% of owners think the engine isn’t worth it, but the rest love having the engine. There is no in between.

Just an oil change every two years. Maybe I'm due for a coolant flush or something, I dunno. It has 120,000km on it. The most maintenance on this car ever has just been the breaks, because like most EVs, they're prone to corroding because they don't get used as much due to regeneration. The \"ICE is a maintenance problem\" thing is honestly kind of a bogus argument borne out by people's hunches, rather than reality.

Now I have two power trains and energy systems to maintain instead of just one. reply pkulak 15 hours agorootparentWell, hybrids sometimes get to replace the transmission with EV bits, like Toyota's system. Imagine an engine and exhaust system; now multiply the complexity by 100 and you have a modern transmission. Toyota hybrids (and GM/Chrystler/Honda) replace all that with a single planetary gearset, or with Honda, one clutch. Other systems, think Volvo, pop the EV bits in the back of the car and replace where the drive shaft used to be with batteries. That seems like a decent trade to me as well. Still have a transmission, but at least it's not purely additive. AND one man's added complexity is another's redundancy. If the charging module goes bad in a hybrid, you can still drive. Or if you run out of gas. All that said... I still prefer EVs to hybrids. Do one thing, do it well, I say! reply mulmen 13 hours agorootparentModern transmissions can’t be two orders of magnitude more complicated than a modern ICE. If they are then I need to get into transmission design. An automatic transmission is basically just a series of planetary gears anyway. I would expect the marginal complexity between an ICE transmission and a hybrid transmission to be within a multiple of 2, but closer to parity. They’re both extremely reliable but an EV transmission (gearbox) will be even simpler. reply hnav 12 hours agorootparentThe thing that mechanically totals modern crap cars (think cheap Nissans and Subarus) is often the CVT.

They haven't gotten simpler. Lot's of cars are sporting 10-speeds these days. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission#/media/... reply mulmen 12 hours agorootparentThe number of speeds is a function of the number of planetary gearsets. They’re just connected in series. More speeds isn’t more complex, it’s only a larger part count. By the time the transmission is computer controlled and has two speeds it’s as complex as it’s going to be. Modern ICE are also extremely complex. Turbo systems, sensors, air management, heat management, the list goes on. So yeah, a modern transmission is complex but a modern ICE isn’t simple. By comparison they’re very similar in terms of complexity, the ICE possibly being even more complex. reply serf 7 hours agorootparent>By the time the transmission is computer controlled and has two speeds it’s as complex as it’s going to be. I don't disagree with your posts greater point, but I disagree with this. There is an endless amount of variable complexity in the engineering behind friction materials, actuation styles, the control systems within the computer control, the material selections.. the list goes on. I mean entire branches of metallurgy were more or less founded in the pursuit of finding stronger alloys for gearbox work. entire branches of metrology were developed for the sake of gearbox failure analysis -- there is a lot of complexity. It's stupid to get into a pissing contest between engines and transmissions, they're both astoundingly complex. reply mulmen 5 hours agorootparentI don’t buy that transmissions are somehow unique or even exceptional in motivating improvements in design and materials science.

Suppose 90% of your miles are electric. After you've put 250K miles (400K km) on the car, you've only got 25K miles (40K km) on the engine. Rarely do you have significant engine trouble at that mileage. Also, the engine design can probably be simplified if it's just acting as a generator. You don't need a turbo to provide extra bursts of power. Nor things like variable valve timing for good performance across a wide range of RPMs. Maybe you could even use an air-cooled engine like old VW Beetles and Porsches. reply bonton89 14 hours agorootparentI wish they'd just sell/rent little trailers with a charging engine on them you could take on long trips. reply jtriangle 13 hours agorootparentI know that tesla's won't allow you to drive while charging the car.

Series will have ICE generate and the only thing attached to the wheels is electric motors. Parallel (like the prius) the electric motor and the ICE are connected to the wheels. There are reasons for both, but freight trains in the US are series. In my opinion, series is probably the best, since you can engineer the ICE to be as clean and efficient as possible at exactly 1 RPM setting - making them last longer to boot. I apologize for forgetting the benefits of parallel hybrid systems, but i know there are some, including needing a smaller ICE, all things equal. reply kayodelycaon 14 hours agorootparentprevFor most Toyota hybrids they use a single planetary gear set to combine electric motors and a gas engine into a single unit.

It's LESS systemically reliable than either a purely ICE or purely electric powertrain, and yet STILL Toyota hybrids are some of the most reliable cars you can buy. Their engineering is just that insanely conservative. They just make giant, absurdly understressed engines. You can pull a 2.5L 4cyl engine out of a Camry, designed to make 180 horsepower, replace only a few components, and make 400hp with the reliability you would normally expect from an engine built for endurance racing.

But not there yet. reply sanderjd 16 hours agorootparentprevNo big deal if you set it on the ground and never move it! reply GrantMoyer 15 hours agorootparentprevDo you mean heavier per energy capacity, or am I misinterpreting \"heavier by weight\"? reply naruhodo 6 hours agorootparentYeah. Unless he means that a pound of lead is heavier than a pound of feathers. reply idontwantthis 17 hours agorootparentprev> Natron says its batteries charge and discharge at rates 10 times faster than lithium-ion, a level of immediate charge/discharge capability that makes the batteries a prime contender for the ups and downs of backup power storage. Also helping in that use case is an estimated lifespan of 50,000 cycles. From everything I've read about existing Lithuum battery storage, this is already their strongpoint. Is it helpful to be 10x faster that the current speed? reply chefandy 16 hours agorootparentI can't think of many things where a 10x improvement in its strongest important metric wouldn't be useful? I imagine dumping a lot of current into something very quickly and recovering it 50k times would be pretty useful in bursty workloads-- industrial processes, solar-powered gates and lifts, alarms, ignition systems, etc. And that's just gravy considering the real selling point is being made from commodity materials. Even if they're too heavy or something for electric cars, it would be great if it was a viable replacement for lead-acid car batteries. reply rangerelf 17 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely. Instead of stopping to charge my car for half an hour (up to 80%), I can stop for 5 minutes? Sign me up. reply justahuman74 16 hours agorootparentprevChange rates of lithium batteries are a huge negative compared to pumping gasoline reply hedora 13 hours agorootparentprevFor grid storage, it's unclear if faster charge/discharge matters. We ended up sizing our batteries to meet wattage demands for our appliances. I wish we had ~ 2x as many kWh as we do. Anker has a home battery whose main selling point is that you can add kWh without adding peak wattage. For use in vehicles, faster charge rates are a big win. Faster discharge probably doesn't matter much for cars (0-60 times are already ridiculously low). They might for drones / planes though. reply kragen 15 hours agorootparentprevyes, enormously helpful, if true (no figures are given, and they may be comparing to low-power lithium-ion batteries instead of high-power ones). an equally valid way to say '10 times faster discharge rate' is '10 times higher power for the same capacity' or '10 times higher power density' there are available li-ion batteries with a charge and discharge rate of '15c', which is to say, 1 hour ÷ 15 = 4 minutes. they are used in drones. (there are some advertised as '30c' but i suspect those are maybe just a fraud? like the notorious amazon million-lumen flashlights https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceA5xL6ggEw) if they really reach '150c', you could discharge 10% of the battery in 2.4 seconds, which is closer to a firework rocket engine than a conventional battery. but, a rocket engine that you can recharge 50000 times a charge rate of '150c' would mean you could charge the battery halfway in 12 seconds, and there are a lot of scenarios where that would be useful you could imagine '150c' batteries displacing much larger supercapacitors from many uses, rather than displacing conventional batteries. the number given in the article of 70 watt hours per kilogram is, in si units, 250kJ/kg. if you divide that by the 24 seconds implied by '10 times faster than lithium-ion' you get a power density of 10.4 kilowatts per kilogram. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_density says supercaps are in the 15 kilowatts per kilogram range. quadcopter drone electric motors are typically in the neighborhood of 4–5 kilowatts per kilogram, so this would make the drone battery much smaller than the motor instead of bigger more likely, though, it's a press release lie, where they're saying something that's technically true (there are lithium batteries with a '1c' charge and discharge rate, which have higher energy density than the higher-powered ones, and their batteries reach '10c', i.e., 6 minutes) but creates a false impression of something that would be a huge breakthrough if it were true reply hcarvalhoalves 18 hours agoparentprevEven if it isn't as high-capacity, a longer-lasting and safer battery over a thinner smartphone isn't a _bad_ trade-off, specially considering chips and screens get more efficient. This might have more market than stationary batteries. reply GuB-42 17 hours agorootparentBut who wants a fat smartphone with lower battery life? Smartphones are where people want as much energy density as possible. Smartphones are also expensive devices with a relatively small battery, so it makes sense to add a few dollars for more energy density. Also most smartphone manufacturers are very much into planned obsolescence, so much that countries are starting to legislate, they don't really want long lasting batteries, especially not if it compromises the user experience. There could be a market for power tools, where having more batteries of lower capacity for the same price can be desirable. Also maybe for hybrid vehicles. reply hilbert42 16 hours agorootparent\"…smartphone manufacturers are very much into planned obsolescence,…\" E-waste laws at some point will become inevitable, so planned obsolescence will be under scrutiny. Devices will have to have a minimum design life etc. Moreover, user-replaceable batteries—whether long life or high capacity—are likely to be mandatory as a result of such legislation. My old Nokia used to have a replaceable battery which also served as the back of the phone, a quick release button meant the battery could be replaced within seconds. Manufacturers can't use the argument that it can't be done because it was common practice with Nokia 20 years ago. Nowadays more modern design practices will make that even easier to implement. reply mschuster91 16 hours agorootparent> Manufacturers can't use the argument that it can't be done because it was common practice with Nokia 20 years ago. Nowadays more modern design practices will make that even easier to implement. The problem is water resistance. Your old Nokia (except the indestructible 3310) was dead if you managed to let it fall into water, most phones up until the end of the headphone jack had the same problem - and secure-boot stuff has made it virtually impossible to recover data if the phone doesn't boot up any more. Water resistance and non-sealed phones don't really mix, unless you're going for really bulky things like the CAT lineup or Samsung's Active Tab series. reply GuB-42 14 hours agorootparentI don't know where this myth came from but there are many smartphones that are water resistant and with a user replaceable battery. One of the first in the mainstream was the Motorola Defy, there is also the Samsung Galaxy S5. Neither were particularly bulky. Interestingly the Galaxy S6, which followed the S5 was neither waterproof nor has a removable battery. I currently have one of the very few remaining smartphones with a removable battery (Galaxy XCover 7) and it is water resistant. It is a bit bulky (because it is rugged) but no more than the average phone when you add a case. Sealing a battery compartment in a way that doesn't hinder replacement is a solved problem, they do it to diving watches that are actually waterproof at depth, not merely water resistant. And phones cannot be completely sealed. That's why none are really waterproof (and warranty doesn't cover water damage). The biggest issues are speakers and microphones, getting the sound through and keeping the water out requires some compromises. Then there is the port(s), SIM tray, buttons, barometer,... By comparison, a battery cover is easy. reply hilbert42 6 hours agorootparent\"Sealing a battery compartment in a way that doesn't hinder replacement is a solved problem,\" Right, splash resistance through to full hermetic sealing is well developed engineering, so it's a non issue. That's not to say one has to go to extremes for a phone. For example, there's no reason why a phone cannot be constructed in a modular fashion where the key electronics is essentially sealed against the ingress of moisture and its peripheral connections, jack, mic, speakers, battery connectors are part of the case. For maintenance, simply snap out the electronics and put it in a new case. Similarly, jacks are easily made waterproof with connections going through hermetic seals. Diaphragms on mics and speakers can actually be part of the seal and so on. Compromises can be made to suit the circumstances, and none of this is complicated manufacturing. Making phones more robust against the environment makes sense, it would not only extend their life but dovetail neatly into Right-to-Repair laws—laws which I reckon will eventually become inevitable. Phone manufacturers will be dragged kicking and screaming but they've already had it too good for too long at customers' expense. reply mschuster91 13 hours agorootparentprev> I don't know where this myth came from but there are many smartphones that are water resistant and with a user replaceable battery. They do exist, but usually (at least for Samsung and CAT, I owned both brands) come at the cost of flimsy backplanes that come loose when falling and/or are prone to break off the tiny snaps when you need to access the SD/SIM card or battery. reply GuB-42 12 hours agorootparentI actually find these Samsung \"flimsy\" backplanes really great and not actually flimsy. I never broke these tiny snaps even though it sometimes feels like they will. I have broken snaps many times while opening devices but not those from Samsung backplanes. For me, that they come loose when falling is actually a feature. The energy of the fall has to go somewhere, and having that back cover and sometimes battery fly off means that energy is not dissipated elsewhere where it could be more damaging. reply MrDrMcCoy 17 hours agorootparentprevPersonally, I wouldn't mind a fatter phone. It actually might be easier for me to hold. I've never seen the appeal of phones so thin I could shave with them. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparentThe appeal is about being able to slide easily into pants pockets (esp. front pockets) without creating big uncomfortable tight bulges. Not as much of an issue with loose men's chinos, but definitely an issue with standard slim men's jeans, as well as with a slimmer-cut chino. And if you want to see if a fatter phone is easier to hold, that's what cases are for. You don't need them to make the phone fatter. In reality, most thin phones aren't all that thin anyways once people put a protective case on them, as many (most?) people do. reply genewitch 13 hours agorootparentthis is why purses were invented. If you go out in public pay attention to visible phones sticking out of pockets and what sort of person that belongs to. I just commented on this last night, in fact. Wife's phone half out of her pocket, and it's a smaller iphone than my brick of a 1+, but my phone sits midway down my thigh in my pocket. I make no judgement on the pants people wear (or don't). reply JumpCrisscross 17 hours agorootparentprev> never seen the appeal of phones so thin I could shave with them For people who wear slimmer-fitting clothing, this matters. Also, it’s more about the weight: you want a phone light enough that holding it up isn’t tedious. reply fallingsquirrel 16 hours agorootparentThis isn't playing out in reality though. 10 years ago we already had the tech for smaller phones (and yes the battery life was fine, 1-2 days typical). Just check out any flagship from the 2010-2015 era, e.g. https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i9500_galaxy_s4-5125.php If people actually care about slim, light phones... why has almost every company stopped making them? reply JumpCrisscross 16 hours agorootparent> If people actually care about slim, light phones... why has almost every company stopped making them? It’s not the sole factor. But ceteris paribus, most consumer prefer a thinner, lighter phone. reply MrDrMcCoy 17 hours agorootparentprevI suppose. Then again, so long as it's not so heavy as to cause pain, I think there would be a least some market for such devices. I thought the Steam Deck would be prohibitively heavy to use for it's weight, but the ergonomics made up for much of that. reply craftkiller 16 hours agorootparentIf I use the steam deck for more than a couple of hours then I feel it in my wrists the next day. I still love the steam deck but it could go on a diet. (There are lighter alternatives, but I bought the steam deck specifically to financially support Valve's Linux gaming efforts) reply baq 14 hours agorootparentThis should be nicely solved with something like the xreal glasses. Lie the deck down and have the display right in front of your eyes regardless of how you hold the input device. reply MrDrMcCoy 4 hours agorootparentSadly, there's no way to use those glasses while also charging. I'd buy one instantly if there were a readily available solution for that. reply rich_sasha 18 hours agorootparentprevAre they safer? Sodium is also very highly reactive. Otherwise agreed, I'm very happy with form factor of 5-10 year old phones. reply troymc 18 hours agorootparentHere's Natron's page about safety: https://natron.energy/our-technology/safety I don't think the battery is a big block of pure sodium. That would be unsafe. The battery electrolyte contains sodium ions, but the same is true of salt water and Gatorade. I think the industrial source of their sodium is sodium hydoxide, a common industrial feedstock. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide reply majoe 18 hours agorootparentprevOne of the claimed benefits of sodium based batteries, that I remember from the press statements of CATL, is that they don't burn, even when you but them in a fire. The also should work in a wider temperature range, which is especially interesting for cold regions. In the article it says, that they are using a \"patented Prussian blue\". Isn't CATL also using Prussian blue in their first generation sodium batteries? reply thejohnconway 17 hours agorootparentprevFor iPhones, at least, I believe that period was when they were thinnest (the iPhone 6 is the thinnest one, 2014). reply pfdietz 11 hours agorootparentprevI believe sodium here is always in the oxidized +1 state, like the lithium in Li-ion batteries. It's not present as a metal. The things being oxidized/reduced are transition metals in one or more electrodes. reply hcarvalhoalves 18 hours agorootparentprevThe battery made by the company mentioned uses an aqueous electrolyte construction which is theoretically safer from what I read, but I don't know if it can be made small for a portable. The fact it supports more cycles and tolerates a broader temperature range than Lithium counts points towards safety too. Lithium isn't happy above like 30 Celsius, which a fast charging portable device can _easily_ reach. reply justinclift 17 hours agorootparent> Lithium isn't happy above like 30 Celsius, which a fast charging portable device can _easily_ reach.

I just walked home from a quick grocery trip a couple of blocks away. And that's not an atypical temperature (at least for the warmer months of the year; we're supposed to be in the colder months now, but the climate's been all wonky lately). If my phone's battery didn't like ambient temperatures above 30°C, it would have failed long ago. There's no air conditioning in the street. reply hcarvalhoalves 15 hours agorootparentIt doesn't fail abruptly, but it doesn't achieve optimal performance either. It has pretty strict optimal temperature range, something like 10C to 30C. reply rini17 17 hours agorootparentprevSince na-ion cells are available on aliexpress, youtubers already did puncture tests, and indeed they did not catch fire. Seems like sodium is better \"hidden\" in the cathode/anode so it won't react witth the air so quickly as lithium when battery innards are exposed. reply BenjiWiebe 12 hours agorootparentWere they actually sodium batteries? Maybe they were fraudulently labeled Li-ion. Also it's my understanding that neither sodium batteries nor li-ion batteries have metallic sodium/lithium in them (besides small amounts which build up in heavily used li-ion cells or something). reply rini17 2 hours agorootparentThey have specific discharge curve which would be too much effort to fake. reply demondemidi 18 hours agorootparentprevNaCl is pretty safe. ;) reply strangattractor 16 hours agorootparentMy cardiologist doesn't think so :( reply pkaye 16 hours agorootparentLow NaCl in a human body is also really bad. reply tharkun__ 17 hours agorootparentprevDepends on the quantity and who you ask what the safe level is ;) reply addaon 18 hours agorootparentprevIf customers were supportive of this trade-off, why would we not already see companies exploring it with LTO batteries? reply londons_explore 17 hours agoparentprev> cheap as dirt There are lots of things left to make grid battery storage cheap. As well as the cells needing to be engineered to be cheaper, there are lots of changes to the battery packs that can be made, together with changes to inverters. For batteries, I'd like to see research into less consistent manufacturing and higher failure rates. Current packs the entire pack is unusable if just one cell fails in a way that leads to lots of heat production. If pack balancing circuits had the ability to take a cell or a parallel group of cells 'out of circuit' while still using the rest of the pack, then battery lifespans could be dramatically increased and it would be possible to manufacture cells far cheaper. For inverters, we should go for a direct-to-10kV inverter process. No transformers. At 10kV, currents are far lower and therefore wires can be far thinner (and cheaper). Consider making batteries ~15kV too - that reduces by ~30% the amount of expensive silicon needed, together with big reductions in copper costs, at the expense of extra design effort for much higher voltage batteries. At these higher voltages, you'd either use oil cooling, or you'd have ~10 separate coolant loops, one at each ~1500 volts of potential. reply garbageman 17 hours agorootparentWhile it would be neat to build batteries that handle manufacturing defects akin to a CPU with 4 cores but 3 useable, I suspect the additional complexity, wiring, and circuitry is limiting. Batteries today are almost (or actually?) a commodity. Detecting and simply replacing the entire battery is probably cheaper and easier at grid scale. reply londons_explore 17 hours agorootparentThe wiring and complexity isn't very much - you simply need a contactor that can 'short' the offending set of cells. It only needs to close once, so can simply be made from a spring and meltable material. And you need ~100 of these per 400 volt battery. Beyond that, all the complexity is in software. Software needs to monitor cell voltages and currents to detect a self-heating cell. Software then needs to stop balancing that cell up (ie. let it discharge). At the moment the cell voltage hits zero, software needs to close the 'short' across the cell, permanently taking it out of the circuit. This design might occasionally prevent charging the entire battery for a few minutes during this process. Specifically, when a cell is midway through being taken out of circuit, it can only be discharged, and would be dangerous to recharge. But a few minutes of downtime per year seems acceptable to me. reply nightowl_games 18 hours agoparentprevHopefully we can continue to lower the power requirements of our every day items and the lower capacity of these batteries will become less of an issue. reply ChrisMarshallNY 17 hours agorootparentLowering the power we use, is the only realistic goal. I wear an Apple Watch. On my wrist, is a small, Lithium-ion battery, that contains a great deal of power. That power is trickled out, over time. If it were to all release at once, I'd no longer have a left hand. Packing all that energy into smaller and smaller form factors, increases the risk; no matter what tech we use. Energy is energy. When it comes out quickly, we call those \"explosions.\" reply AustinDev 16 hours agorootparentOne little point I want to clarify is that if your Apple Watch battery did indeed short and none of the protections against shorts worked, you'd likely just have a burn on your wrist. 309mAH isn't all that much energy assuming a full charge. I once bridged a ~2,500mAH 18650 battery that was in my bag when my keys created a circuit between the anode and the cathode. The result was a small fire inside my bag that was quickly stamped out. Now, if I'm carrying batteries capable of dumping a lot of current quickly, I use cases. What excites me most about this new battery tech is home and commercial backup energy storage that's much 'greener' and cheaper than lithium. There is a lot of space in rural and grid settings, so the density of Li-Ion isn't really needed. reply ChrisMarshallNY 16 hours agorootparentWell, shorting out is a fairly realistic scenario, as opposed to a flash-boom, but it is still a relatively slow release. I was really talking about how much energy potential is stored in batteries. In batteries, the energy is generally stored as potential chemical reactions, so it isn't realistic to have a flash-boom. Supercapacitors, on the other hand, may have more of a boom potential. reply genewitch 13 hours agorootparentprevmost, and i do mean most 18650s have a circuit board in the endcap that manages the charging and discharging, so a dead short will generally cause that board to heat up and let out smoke. If you did manage to actually short an 18650 (it's not difficult, remove the plastic on the outside and jam a flathead in between the positive cap and the battery body, where the insulator is), it doesn't just \"make a small fire, easily stamped out\". if you'd like i can go dig out a 26650 that i have where i dropped it and the board part popped off; but i am sure there are websites with pictures already. reply AustinDev 11 hours agorootparentI didn't know this. I was wondering why it was such a tame event given the maximum discharge rate of those batteries. I was walking out of my building with a group of folks after work and some woman said, 'Excuse me sir but there is smoke coming out of your bag'. reply cogman10 13 hours agorootparentprev> If it were to all release at once, I'd no longer have a left hand. Well, super interesting. At first I doubted because the apple watch has very little energy, then I looked it up. Turns out the biggest ones have 2Wh worth of power. Doesn't seem like much until you consider that 2Wh is roughly 6000J. Bullets are launched in the neighborhood of 1000J. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparentprevNot really sure how much further there is to go. We've already got LED bulbs, heat pumps, and energy-efficient appliances. Washers and dryers still have to spin and agitate. Dishwashers still have to shoot jets of water. Ceiling fans still need to move air. And with the switch to electrification (cars, stoves, dryers, hot water heaters) electricity usage will increase, fortunately, to replace polluting gasoline. So I think future technological progress really is going to come down to increased battery capacity, not decreasing energy usage. Ultimately, the simple fact is that solar power isn't generated at night. reply nightowl_games 16 hours agorootparentI mean on the small scale where the object has a built in battery. On the scale your talking about, large sodium batteries on the grid to store power for renewables makes sense. reply twobitshifter 8 hours agorootparentprevJevon’s paradox says that will just lead to more energy usage.

    "commentBody": "As private equity dominates wheelchair market, users wait months for repairs (statnews.com)415 points by coloneltcb 16 hours agohidepastfavorite280 comments minusLik 13 hours agoWhat the article does not seem to mention is that an usual electric wheelchair costs about $65,000 (and is intended to be replaced every six years or so). This and the non-availability of replacement parts is why some wheelchair users started a project to open-source a wheelchair from standard parts: https://themif.org/ Louis Rossmann interviewed the founder of the project here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaAj59025Kk reply somethoughts 12 hours agoparentTo be honest - it actually seems like a risky Private Equity play as I bet the $65000 sticker price is due to the fact that Medicare is footing the bill. Medicare is likely what is requiring a regulation grade wheel chair, not the users themselves. I bet a huge segment of the user base could easily self purchase a mobility scooter and achieve the same quality of life if the price point was such that they could out of pocket the purchase and there was decent quality/repairability/safety. There do seem to be a fair number that are approaching \"geez I might as well just buy an over the counter version\" (i.e. sub-$2000) instead of going through the paperwork hassle of getting a free Medicare \"prescription\" for one. reply heyoni 11 hours agorootparentIn my experience, the chairs and how they’re built aren’t what adds to the price tag; the fact that an insurance company is paying is what is. My daughter literally just got approved for a talking device that would otherwise cost us $4000. It’s a Samsung tablet with $300 software and an attached speaker and comes with some sort of repair agreement. I can buy and break 20 iPads for that price…and we did end up buying one with the software on its own. If you want to know who’s causing waste, look to the ones who stand to benefit from it. reply newsclues 10 hours agorootparentIt’s similar to defence procurement. If the customer is government with endless budget, inflate costs, and use regulatory capture to maintain the cash flow. reply jandrewrogers 8 hours agorootparentI used to work at an org that audits defense programs. A surprising amount of the unreasonable cost is self-inflicted, which is a valid cost to the vendor. If it wasn’t, the auditors have the power to clawback the excess cost. In defense procurement the costs are frequently inflated greatly by the procurement process overhead and the government imposing last minute changes of scope, requirements, or delivery dates. The government customer is also often slow or delayed on their contracted deliverables, so they can end up spending a lot of money to essentially keep idle capacity warm on the vendor side while they sort out delivery of their part. And then there are the budget rug-pulls at the 11th after the vendor has already committed significant internal resources, which are often a pure loss to the vendor. All of this is endemic to the process. The government knows they are a difficult and expensive customer to work with, and they do try to compensate vendors for the overhead costs this imposes. People like to talk about $2000 hammers etc but if you actually look at the audits, more often than not the cost was justified. Not because a hammer should cost that much but because that is how much it ends up costing after you account for the government procurement process overhead and the way in which the government executed the contract. reply gregwebs 7 hours agorootparentSometimes this gets taken advantage of by the vendor. The government doesn't have the ability to design and specify things properly themselves when the deal is signed. The vendor might know that things are wrong at that point but wait until afterwards to point out all the problems and correctly claim changes in scope and requirements at significant expense. At least I was told that happened on the California rail project. reply WanderPanda 10 hours agorootparentprevJust that in this case the end-customer is a person that could shop around for what he/she needs.

An unregulated market has every opportunity to undercut a regulated market in almost every dimension. Do you expect that a highly regulated market would become sustainable let alone affordable? You may as well just demand that regulations are removed. The only way this works is if the government subsidizes the regulated market such that it is accessible (and sustainable) to an appropriate market. It also generally puts some populations at severe disadvantages, and usually those populations are disadvantaged to begin with.

(The Catholics and EU call that concept 'subsidiarity', handle everything as locally as possible and have the higher levels only there to help when the lower levels can't handle it.) Eg the FDA ought be to dissolved, and replaced with state level agencies. The state level agencies are, of course, free to cooperate and coordinate. Comparable to how the traffic signs work already in the US. It's good for Hawaii and New York to have the same road signs, but they can agree on that voluntarily. No need to have a central party force them. Similarly, it's good for both states to have the same or similar rules on drugs, but no need to force them.

It's a shame Medicare can't just give the users cash and allow them to choose their own wheelchair; both Medicare and the users would win. reply KennyBlanken 6 hours agorootparentAre you serious? Wheelchairs are not mobility scooters. I don't know much about them, but I can point out some obvious likely differences: 1)The chair has to be comfortable enough to be in almost constantly - for someone whose body may not be shaped the same as most other people's. It may need to be designed in a way that makes it easier for the user to get in and out of, unassisted. That means a substantial part of it is customized to each user, probably in consultation with medical professionals. It may need to carry medical devices/equipment. 2)The chair has to be navigable in indoor spaces with a fine degree of control, by someone who may have lower motor skills and range of motion than others. So it may need customizable response time, input smoothing, and acceleration. 3)The chair cannot, under any circumstances, make an un-commanded motion - which could easily kill the occupant (ie going into traffic, or down a steep hill, or off into water.) That has implications for the physical controls, the electronic controls, and mechanical drives (I'm guessing many chairs have electrical locking, and can use the motors for braking.) Similarly, the chair has to be very reliable, or that could kill the occupant (say, a fire or other emergency where they are) or otherwise be a major inconvenience. If you're unable to move much from your chair and, say, your cell phone is in another room - you're varying levels of screwed. 4)It has to be designed such that fire would be a very low risk. Are they probably more expensive than they need to be? Yeah.

Consider the risks of a battery fire you can't escape, a drivetrain that could grab loose clothing around a pair of immobile legs, or a user whose wheelchair dies on an empty street at night at -10°F because it couldn't handle the cold for long enough. This doesn't mean the incumbents aren't fixing the regulations to ensure they've got a manufacturing moat -- this being healthcare, I assume that's exactly what they're doing -- but the FDA definitely has reasons to make sure these are regulated. reply zmgsabst 11 hours agorootparentDo they? I don’t think the FDA is in a position to asses whether those risks versus the benefits of mobility are an appropriate trade off for any individual. The FDA is deciding that some people should have no mobility so that others have… what, exactly? The people who bought $65,000 chairs still could — and they’d be equally reliable. But because one person needs to use it in Alaska, all people need to pay a premium… even if they live somewhere that cold rating is completely irrelevant and adding a needless $5000-10000 to the price. While there’s a reason to regulate for truth in advertising and basic safety, eg, not catching fire on its own, the actual regulations extend far beyond that into adjudicating personal risk management without clear benefit. I’m not a fan of technocracy — I think people themselves know what’s best for them. reply harimau777 8 hours agorootparentUnder that model, what about the people who can't afford a more reliable wheelchair because insurance is no longer obligated to cover it? reply wolverine876 7 hours agorootparentprev> I don’t think the FDA is in a position to asses whether those risks versus the benefits of mobility are an appropriate trade off for any individual.

You likely can import and use these wheelchairs, but they can't be sold as medical devices and, subsequently, won't be covered by your insurance. The dumb thing is these super cheap wheelchairs would likely cost the end users more money than the expensive ones as they will buy them out of pocket vs having their insurance/medicare cover most/all of the cost. The reason these companies don't sell these wheelchairs in the US is likely because the marketing would run afowl of regulations about selling medical devices. You probably could sell these as bicycles and hobby chairs though. reply Spivak 8 hours agorootparent> they can't be sold as medical devices and, subsequently, won't be covered by your insurance. This is something I've never really understood. Wouldn't the insurance company be ever grateful to you if you accepted a non-medical wheelchair because it's 1/10th the cost. Hell, have 5! Is there any reason insurance can't pay for them? reply kazinator 7 hours agorootparentNot if it's owned by the same private equity firm as the wheelchair guys; then it's just another face of the same racket. Also, medical insurance is supposed to cover bona fide medical treatments and supplies. So this likely bumps up against regulation again. If something goes wrong with the out-of-regulation device that insurance paid of as if it were a medical wheelchair (e.g. safety incident leading to injury), they could be liable.

Because to me, the issue that is blatantly obvious is that we don't have enough regulations on PE. Let's say in this scenario you do import an electric wheelchair. You fork out a few thousand dollars on the expensive costs of said purchases. It breaks. No one in America can repair it. Or if they can repair it, you have to go through the PE-owned wheelchair market, whom charge a premium. Your options are fork out the money for repairs, import another wheelchair, or send it abroad for repairs. Assuming that instead you create a company designed around importing said wheelchairs, PE buys you out and then sells imported wheelchairs at monopolistic prices. reply akira2501 11 hours agorootparentprevThe regulation is what drives the ratio, here, though.

In a free market, \"moats\" like regulatory capture would not exist. In a market like this, where the customers--wheelchair users--are generally pretty savvy about what they need, a free market would have no trouble providing products that met customer needs at an affordable cost, because customers would have meaningful choices about who to buy from and who not to buy from, and customers would see the full cost of the products so they could make meaningful cost-benefit calculations. In capitalism such as we currently have, none of that is happening. The government aids and abets rich people who want to siphon off even more wealth than they already have by putting regulatory barriers in place that stifle competition, and it removes visibility into actual costs by forcing all medical products and services to be provided through health insurance, even when, as in this case, there is no insurable risk involved--it's an ongoing medical need that is already known (not a risk) and which is predictable (so insurance makes no sense anyway). The result, of course, is that the customers get shafted while rich people get richer. reply cyberax 13 hours agorootparentIn free market it's also OK to cut costs as much as possible, making chair that explode and kill the user one day after the warranty expires. That's why we have regulation: to establish the minimum standards.

Business seeks profit because the expectation is that it will pass the debt on to the stakeholders who will then call the debt and get something in return for their efforts. But it is people who participate in the market. If they demand profit continually, therefore not getting anything in return, that just means they're working for free.

Regulation is vital when the potential damage is irreversible. reply jjk166 9 hours agorootparentNor can regulation. But the idea is that, in seeking to avoid liability, people will avoid doing things that would foreseeably lead to such liability. Likewise regulation is limited to preventing foreseeable issues, and is often only implemented after somebody suffers damages. The difference is that regulations are imposed by a third party whose interests may not be aligned with those who are actually involved in the matter. This is good in circumstances where there are externalities, for example just because I'm okay with entering an agreement with a company to use my backyard to store toxic waste doesn't mean my neighbors would be very happy.

No, it isn't, because nobody will buy chairs from a company that does that. In a free market, no company can use the get out of jail free card of \"but I was following all the regulations\". Businesses have to actually meet customer needs. And in a free market, customers can't delude themselves that Big Brother is looking out for them (even though Big Brother is not actually doing that); they know that they have to enforce quality if that's what they want. That means customers know that it's on them to be savvy enough to be able to evaluate the quality of products and services. > That's why we have regulation: to establish the minimum standards. That's what regulators claim, but all history shows that claim to be wrong. The end result of regulations is to reduce the quality and availability of products, not increase them. The wheelchair market described in the article is a classic example: it's regulated up one side and down the other, yet customers can't get simple things like proper footrests. > Simple medical devices like wheelchairs (Class I or Class II) are also not super over-regulated, you don't need to do clinical trials to certify them. Doesn't this contradict your claim that regulation is the only way to avoid exploding chairs? If you don't do clinical trials, how do you know the chairs won't explode one day after the warranty expires? Of course the answer to this is that the regulators just, you know, look at the design of the chairs to evaluate them for certification. But customers could do the same thing for themselves, at less cost (what, you think those government regulators work for free?). So the regulations are actually adding zero value. But they're certainly not adding zero cost. > All-in-all it'll cost you around $10m, which is not at all a moat. So you'll be going into the wheelchair business then?

That's one aspect of capitalism, yes. But in capitalism as it is currently practiced, most of the people who are accumulating capital aren't people that are trying to start new ventures. They are people that are already rich but think they aren't rich enough, who are unable to start new ventures themselves because they have no actual skills at providing valuable products or services, so instead they find some existing venture and siphon off all its wealth. (This pattern is not new, btw; it's the same way the \"robber barons\" in the late 19th century operated.) > In a free marked that is absent of regulatory hurdles, it is far from guaranteed that costs would be affordable. Nothing is ever \"guaranteed\". But the article under discussion makes it obvious that with regulations in place, not only are costs not affordable, but even the very existence of products meeting customer needs is not happening. A free market couldn't possibly do any worse. > In a completely free market, devoid of regulation, wheelchair makers can get together and fix prices. Or buy each other. This would only happen if it were economically more efficient for wheelchairs to be made by a monopoly. I strongly doubt that is the case. It's not the case for the vast majority of products and services. If it's not economically efficient, the monopoly (or price-fixing cartel) will simply be out-competed in a free market, because it will have no way of keeping other companies from producing at a lower cost. Historically, virtually all monopolies have been the result of government interference. (The original meaning of the word \"monopoly\" was a royal grant of the exclusive privilege to sell a particular product or service.)

As an able-bodied nerd with a socket set and a few wrenches, I can repair an electric wheelchair. A disabled person usually can not do that. They can not even follow the (good) advice to use an external charger instead of the (garbage) charger built into most wheelchairs; they physically can not get to the relevant parts. Home oxygen companies send people out on short notice to debug, repair, or replace home oxygen equipment. If you want insurance to cover electric wheelchairs, then rent them instead of selling them and include service visits. The problem with shipping an electric wheelchair back for service is that this thing weighs almost 100 pounds without batteries and is a very odd shape. Before anyone complains, you want it to be heavy so it will not tip over when the human (who is high up) leans over, takes a corner, or drives sideways on a slope. If you want a less-insurance-intensive solution, pass a right-to-repair law that (1) requires all electric wheelchair parts to be marked with a manufacturer and part number, and (2) requires all electric wheelchair makers to sell parts for a decade or two after they stop selling the chairs. If they use industry-standard parts, and mark the parts as such, they should be relieved of the obligation to carry the parts for 20 years. Here's an example: Include a label on the chair saying that all bolts are either m6x60mm or m4x25mm and that all red and black electrical connectors are PP75 series Anderson Power Poles. Here is a case that drove me nuts: I was dealing with an electric wheelchair that had some odd version of Anderson PowerPoles connecting the batteries and motors. These connectors had been knock-offs, and the reseller of these (Chinese-made) connectors lost a patent lawsuit to Anderson (before their patent expired.) One connector broke and was impossible to replace. I would gladly pay $100 for a single connector, but they do not exist. Before someone says to replace both ends of the connector, this is a connector mounted in a custom bracket with almost zero clearance as the chair's seat fits right on top of the bracket, connectors, and wires. reply akira2501 11 hours agoparent> If they need a new set of 35 AH SLA batteries, they will throw their old chair away and ask for a new chair on insurance. > One connector broke and was impossible to replace.

So.. which is more prevalent.. users throw away their chairs because they expect to live high on the hog off insurance, or users throw away their chairs because any form of replacement is often met with these arbitrary and senseless complications? reply RecycledEle 5 hours agorootparentI can not say which is more prevalent. > So.. which is more prevalent.. users throw away their chairs because they expect to live high on the hog off insurance, or users throw away their chairs because any form of replacement is often met with these arbitrary and senseless complications? Those who can work on chairs themselves do so. Those who can not work on chairs do not. If you have on idea what kind of connector a 12V 35AH battery would have, and have no way to disassemble your chair to replace the batteries, then you can not realistically replace those batteries. Add in living off $1,400 a month and you see why someone would ask for a free wheelchair instead of paying $250 for an uncertain chance at repairing their wheelchair. reply xnyan 12 hours agoparentprev> One connector broke and was impossible to replace. This is not a solution that would help the wheelchair user, but if you have a set of inexpensive ($10 bought in the US, less from china) 3\" digital calipers, you could likely measure the socket and get it 3D printed.

A disabled guy with a screwdriver who never changed his own oil needs some help. I did a poor job picking examples. Let's take about the complicated parts. The joystick controller on most electric wheelchairs uses a very particular connector. If I do not know the brand and model number on that, I am probably screwed. \"Trim\" pieces are often required to prevent a disabled person's limp limb from being sucked into a gap near a tire. Trying to order replacements for those is almost impossible. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agoprev\"In 2005, CMS announced requirements for testing of electric-powered wheelchairs as part of efforts to modernize coding (5–7). In this century, CMS, in what might be classified by some as an uncharacteristic move, has provided leadership in evidence-based classification of wheelchairs. Globally, the International Standards Organization (ISO) manages the wheelchair standards. ISO and the RESNA standards committee work collaboratively. ISO and RESNA have often been driven by outside sources to expedite their work and to address needs of consumers and other organizations. In the 1990s, the European Community Medical Device Directive provided impetus to make a number of changes to ISO standards and to create new standards in response to stricter regulation. The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) went its own direction for a while and over time, CEN and ISO standards have begun to merge. American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/RESNA was a driving force for a long time and often had different standards than ISO. However, this has dwindled in the past decade. Concomitantly, the wheelchair industry has exploded over the past 10 years, and the standards have simply not kept pace. There is a clear and present need for change in standards development and support in the United States. Most of the participants in wheelchair standards development are employed by the wheelchair industry, an inherent conflict. Unfortunately, wheelchair users and clinicians have traditionally not had the financial support to participate in sufficient numbers. Interestingly, the same companies that participate in the standards committees develop internal tests not represented by ISO or RESNA as part of their product development programs to protect them against legal liability. Test laboratories do the same thing, creating a number of tests that differ from or improve on ISO or RESNA standards. None of the existing standards (ISO, CEN, or RESNA) is comprehensive enough to cover all areas of wheelchair evaluation.\" [1] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1929010/ 2006 reply JumpCrisscross 14 hours agoprevWhat's the barrier to entry? reply alistairSH 14 hours agoparentPower wheelchairs are regulated (FDA) as medical devices. reply TechWorld01 13 hours agorootparentI can buy an electric wheelchair at Walmart for $750.

The consequences are of course awful and it would be better that they didn't happen. But since they are happening, hopefully more people will start to realize it. When exposed to this kind of thing you can generally have one of two reactions: The first is that you say that this kind of thing is good. It's all part of capitalism. The market will work it out. People will say this kind of thing with a straight face. The second is to say that it is bad. But why is it bad? The first stage is you believe that there are bad apples. Private equity is simply a few bad actors who may or may not need to be dealth with by way of legislation, regulation and/or prosecution. Lots of people believe this because they still fundamentally believe in our current economic system. The second stage is you realize that private equity isn't an outlier and isn't a few bad apples. It is exactly what our system is designed to produce: to financialize and rent-seek in every aspect of our lives as a means of extracting wealth from the poor to the already vastly wealthy. Private equity is taking over every aspect of your life by buying up homes, mobile home parks, vets, medical practices, hospitals, etc. There probably isn't a single aspect of our lives that hasn't been tainted by private equity. And the playbook is exactly the same: 1. Jack up the prices, usually by cornering a market by either buying up all the competition or through legislatively creating enclosures; 2. Cut costs. Use noncompete agreements and and the like to suppress wages; and 3. Load up the entity with exploding debt and sell it to the market before the debt explodes. This is capitalism working as intended. No more, no less. On wheelchairs in particular, it's truly disgusting what we as a society put wheelchair users through. One of the most egeregious examples is how airlines will routinely destroy wheelchairs. We are steadily marching towrads a future where almost all of us will be a permanent underclass devoid of any kind of security. Every aspect of our lives will be at the mercy of our overlords.

This is very rarely good for the end customers or the employees who get outsourced. The owner gets millions though and it allows the PE firm to sell an asset class to investors. On the one hand, I don't think it's right to restrict the rights of the business owner. If they have a company with $20M in revenue and PE offers $60M to buy them out...fair game right? On the other hand, it takes perfectly profitable companies providing value, extracts that wealth from happy consumers of the product to people already wealthy and then leaves the consumer with a crappy, expensive, and barely supported product. If this happens just a few times...it sucks, but no big deal.

But another one assumes actors are free to make secret deals and private transactions, and concludes that the free-market doesn't have a cartel problem, because individual members will secretly defect and undercut so that it falls apart.

In v2, you could add profile pics, but the hard part would be finding artists similar to previously “liked” ones. Is there a foundation model for music yet?

I understand why people want to find things in the store. Younger generations don't really use the internet the way us old farts did. Discovery is no longer something that SEO and ad driven search makes organic any more, so discovery is nearly impossible. Instead of Yahoo style search of webpages, we have the curated search of apps via stores. Not that the app search is amazing, but it's still a smaller subsection than all of the internet which makes it easier. reply pg5 13 hours agorootparentprevA good chunk of my motivation for building this was to get learn React native and get experience with building out real-time messaging. reply winternett 13 hours agoprevDoes the app feature music by musicians? As a musician that's what I'd expect to see myself, because seeing a bunch of people only talking about what they do is useless in terms of conveying style and skill. It also enables scammers and fraud if people aren't required to at least upload a video of themselves in action. Back in the old days, we had a local paper that allowed musicians to connect from a classified section, and boy was it scary meeting some of the strangers that posted in there to jam. reply pg5 12 hours agoparentSince this is the first iteration, I went the easiest route where people link their SoundCloud/Spotify/or Youtube channel. I considered having MP3 uploads or even video uploads, but didn't seem worth it building a transcoding/streaming system, when someone could still upload things that is not them playing. Another idea is to \"verify\" linked Spotify accounts by having the artist place a short random code in their Spotify bio, to prove they are actually the artist. reply hyperadvanced 11 hours agorootparentIt’s awesome that you did the simplest thing. Whenever I’ve done these kinds of attempts to collab with strangers online kinds of things, I’ve always found that people will express a desire to be in a band but are awful at creating music. Just requesting that someone posts a sample through another channel is a great idea. Do you think this could become toxic though? Like people stealing tracks and trying to release them? My guess is no but you never know. Anyway - great call on the song requirement, for a lot of us, it’s important to know that the people we work with can operate a daw and solve their own problems and care about creating a finished product. Unless they’re incredibly talented instrumentalists (usually not the case, they find bands) at a certain point it becomes either a jam sesh (not interested) or you become a producer for someone who isn’t very good. reply wheels 9 hours agorootparent> Unless they’re incredibly talented instrumentalists (usually not the case, they find bands) at a certain point it becomes either a jam sesh (not interested) or you become a producer for someone who isn’t very good. For the case of instrumentalists finding bands -- the times I've used sites like this in the past are right after a move or considering stepping out of the music scene that I've been in (going from techno back to bass). Also I feel like the Tinder-like mechanics would be suited to cities with big music scenes. You're right that it's easy to just stumble into everyone in smaller places. What I've enjoyed some on musician-finding sites is the ability go genre shopping to some extent. Sometimes I run across stuff I think I'd enjoy playing that probably wouldn't have popped out of my social network. reply wheels 12 hours agorootparentprevYou're missing the bulk of the already small market if you're assuming people signing up for your app will universally have Spotify tracks up or their own YouTube channel. Soundcloud is more likely, but still not a given, as it's geared towards mostly finished tracks. Hint: the most sought after band members are bassists and drummers, and they don't tend to do solo tracks. You want people to be able to have a low quality video of them noodling or playing along to something for 30 seconds. reply jimbokun 10 hours agorootparentRecord a couple minutes of you playing something, upload it to your YouTube channel, and submit the link. You’re acting like young people wanting to join a band don’t know how to post things on the Internet. reply wheels 10 hours agorootparentAre you a musician? Have you ever used a site like this? My comments are literally based on the disappointments in using similar sites in the past. Most people don't add audio. Profiles without audio are useless. Making (and possibly providing minimal vetting?) people post audio would already be a big step in the right direction. reply hyperadvanced 11 hours agorootparentprevI think, fwiw, I would rather work with someone who has the drive and motivation to finish a track of their own than merely recruit a noodler. I think that from a management perspective, I would also abhor opening up any sort of video/audio sharing because then you’re a target for the majors and you get DMCA’d into the ground when kids start uploading their remixes of Taylor Swift songs or whatever. reply wheels 10 hours agorootparentI work in the music industry. An important thing said once to my arrogant twenty something self by a product manager: \"Our market is amateurs. The pro market is a unsustainably tiny.\" There's basically no product in the music industry that can be supported by just pros. There just aren't very many of them. And again, most drummers and bass players don't create complete tracks on their own, and they're the main thing people are looking for. And honestly, a lot of drummers and bass players don't want to come into a band where the guitar player has already decided what the bass and drum parts should be. You can get a lot from listening to sketches / noodling. (By noodling I mean mainly improvising something unaccompanied, not necessarily trying to win the gold medal at guitar gymnastics.) I'm a bass player. A younger version of myself lived from playing bass for a couple years. I still play quite a few gigs. I very, very rarely produce tracks (one every few years), and there's very little of my bass playing online. reply hyperadvanced 10 hours agorootparentInteresting. My perspective is pretty skewed as a semi-pro musician and someone who is mostly a recording artist and not a live band/jam guy. I think there are a lot of people who CAN do it all but might be open to collabs with the right person(s). You are correct that the pro market is vanishingly small but if OP thinks they’re making any money off of bassists who could just post on Craigslist I think they’re in for a surprise. reply wheels 10 hours agorootparentI've used sites that are trying something similar to find bands in the past. So I think I'm pretty close to the target market (or have been in my past). I don't want to post bass-player-looking-for-band on Craigslist or such -- did it once, and you get swamped by shitty bands who mostly still don't send any audio. As a bass player, I want to hear if the singer can sing, and if the sketches of songs are good. I can also play all of the standard band instruments at varying levels of competence, but I'm not much of a songwriter. What people expect from bass players and drummers is that they are good at catching things quickly and writing interesting parts. reply hyperadvanced 9 hours agorootparentFor sure. When I’ve played bass in bands or filled up a stage for a live show, that skill is indispensable. And I don’t mean to downplay the importance of gigging or band-formation for this kind of thing: OP should cater to as many people as possible. I was originally just saying that I understand the desire to outsource content hosting to avoid the long fingers of the majors or user-generated content controversies. reply jimbokun 10 hours agorootparentprevSo you don’t need an app like this in order to find gigs or collaborators. reply hyperadvanced 9 hours agorootparentI don’t know.

There's nothing to hide when it comes to finding musicians to jam with, so that's why I think a more traditional search & filter thing would be better suited for this. reply paul7986 11 hours agoprevI joined a similar app .. it has a lot reviews in the app store (not to say those are real lol) and i was excited to join and meet fellow local musicians. If you thought online dating was hard and judgemental ... finding musicians to play music is even more judgemental .. if you are a good to great singer for instance these apps will keep you busy. Personally i just wanted to connect and play music without the judgement (tho do want you to be able to actually play an instrument fairly well .. strum chords on guitar and lets sing along as we strum together). I posted songs i wrote where professional singers were singing them and those got people reaching out. Their messages were like good song and did you sing that (i noted i did not) but they became disinterested when they truly realized i was not the singer. reply throwaway22032 14 hours agoprevThe League of Legends role selection screen comes to mind... reply pg5 14 hours agoparentIs that a good or bad thing? reply throwaway22032 14 hours agorootparentRunning joke that if you pick support you'll match in 1 second reply liquid153 10 hours agoprevWhat a dumb app reply Minor49er 4 hours agoparentFound the guitarist reply Ylpertnodi 2 hours agorootparentAs a guitarist I tend blame the bass players of the world. reply ElevenLathe 13 hours agoprevCongratulations on yet another novel attempt to apply the swipe-based matching algorithm that has so effectively revolutionized hookups to the world of music creation.

Use it. reply chrisin2d 12 hours agoparentFurthermore, this photo-forward interface design pattern presents candidates' physical attractiveness as the most salient feature. While this is desirable in a dating app, this is probably not very relevant for assessing people for their potential as musical collaborators. From the top of my head, I'm going to guess people want (1) personable and agreeable bandmates with (2) compatible music styles, (3) musical talent and skill, and (4) can play instruments or roles that a band is missing. So the interface should support users in presenting and finding these traits. If I were to design it, I'd have: - Auto-playing music sample gallery. This is the most important thing to present. The current design asks the user to dig into Youtube and Soundcloud links — which is very high-friction and would have the user jumping between this app and other apps every few seconds. - One-minute self-introduction video. This helps the user grok the general 'vibe' of someone. - Allow users to connect their Spotify or other music accounts. Then show users their shared music interests. This can provide another clue about having compatible musical personalities. reply pg5 12 hours agorootparentI agree with pretty much all this.

If I was looking to start a band today, I'd definitely give this kind of thing a try. reply solumos 13 hours agoparentprevwait, why isn't there a dating app that has this? reply derefr 13 hours agorootparentBecause then people would drill down and either find their perfect partner quickly, or figure out there's nobody compatible with them on the app quickly; and either way, delete the app. Dating app monetization creates a principal-agent problem: both subscriptions (for paid apps) and advertising/data-brokering (for free apps) are revenue streams that depend on people engaging with the app as much as possible — which people who actually manage to find solid romantic relationships won't do. The only good dating app monetization model, would be a one-time-fee model. This would induce the correct incentives: as long as people are on the app, they continue to be a cost burden on the service with no further revenue — so, like people hogging a table at a restaurant, the service would be motivated to satisfy them and get them out the door! But AFAIK, nobody has ever done this yet. (I think it's just because such a site would make so much less money than the traditional \"milk your user base eternally\" type of dating site.

Even with millions of users, there's better ways to match people up than a simple swipe. It's to keep people at the mercy of an algorithm where spending money is the only way to get any sort of control over what you see. It exists only for shady monetisation. reply PaulHoule 13 hours agorootparentActually if you use the same interface for recommendation systems for content (say RSS feed items, videos, etc.) you get much better results than western content recommenders which don't get accurate negative samples. It finally hit me the reason I didn't understand a lot of the recommender literature is that it doesn't make sense and it's transformative to treat recommendation as a classification problem the way TikTok does. The real Dark Pattern is that YouTube and every other western app looks like https://marvelpresentssalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/id... where you can't conclude anything at all because a user didn't click on an item. (That and the scan-ignore-repeat UI paradigm that has kept RSS readers thoroughly out of the mainstream forever) Even if you want to have a search-based UI it would still make sense to show you one match at a time and let you thumbs up and thumbs down and have the system remember your choices so you can come back next week and look at new items without the considerable cognitive burden of ignoring. But say “see something once, why see it again?” and people look at you like you’re a psycho killer. The whole advertising economy though is based fundamentally on spamming you with the same crap over and over and a ‘dislike’ button that works (negative sampling) would end it overnight, i guess there’s a reason why you can’t explain something to a person whose paycheck is based on not understanding it. reply derefr 13 hours agorootparent> it's transformative to treat recommendation as a classification problem the way TikTok does Treating recommendation as a classification problem has all sorts of flaws, mostly down to normalizing the user's indications into a larger model. People will be more passive sometimes and more engaged at other times. Sometimes they'll blindly accept and watch everything that comes along (or blindly swipe right on every match, etc); other times they'll be very choosey. It's kind of the same problems that asking users for star ratings has — people interpret the meaning of \"one star\" or \"three stars\" or \"five stars\" differently; and there are selection biases on when people will bother to vote at all. (The Netflix Prize was a challenge for a reason!) You can avoid all these temporal and selection biases, though, because content recommendation is actually ultimately a ranking problem: any recommendation algorithm ultimately wants to generate a subjective ranking of its universe of items, such that everything gets put in a sequence, with the thing the user would most like to see next, first. And conveniently, we already have a mathematically-perfect way to do ranking: ELO. Or, in app UX terms: the classical HotOrNot design, where you're presented with exactly two options, and you have to pick one as being better than the other. And you get to see the each option several times, paired against different other options each time. In user-engagement terms, a HotOrNot interface would be just as much of a \"dark pattern\" as a Tinder interface. But in recommendation-tuning terms, the backend of a HotOrNot-UX app could build you a subjective scoring function that's much more accurate, much sooner. > you can't conclude anything at all because a user didn't click on an item The real negative signal that sites like YouTube (and to a degree, TikTok) use, is landing on something though a more passive engagement action (e.g. auto-play next) and this inducing engagement in a previously-passively-consuming user to \"get away\" from this content. reply PaulHoule 13 hours agorootparentClassification gives you calibrated scores that you can use together with other information. A classifier may not be the ideal recommender by itself but it is a good component. A probability score for “will he like it?” works as a ranking score in my experience with some caveats which aren’t so much about the score as a score but that recommendation is really a sequential problem. That is, if I get different versions of the same news article that all score 0.9, it might be OK to show me one or two articles from that list. I believe people’s satisfaction with an article is greatly influenced by being spammed with too much of the same thing and that is not so influenced by ranking scores. I’ll go so far as to say full text search should also be treated as a classification problem, in particularly you need a probability score if you want to make a service like “Google Alerts” where you tell people about new marching documents. Also if you are trying to combine several radically different searchers (like IBM Watson did back in the day) the probability score is essential. reply codetrotter 13 hours agorootparentprev [–] I mean. Tinder is pretty awful in general. But the UI does have some merit. It’s exactly the idea of not filling out pages and pages of details about yourself that is great. And likewise, being able in principle to randomly find potential partners that you would not had you gone the route of manually tweaking a bunch of search parameters that your potential partner has to fit.

The Brothers Grimm, who collected, committed to paper, and popularized many German folk tales, are considered some of the most famous folklorists in the world. A number of their works were considered to be permanently lost following World War 2. Read also: Unique online museum tells hundreds of stories of Ukrainians affected by Russia’s war However, recent research at the Adam Mickiewicz University Library led to an unexpected discovery — specialists managed to find 27 original volumes with rare prints and unique editions. All of them are a valuable resource for researchers. VIDEO OF DAY The volumes are contain a large number of footnotes by the authors, making them an even more important find. Presumably, the books were brought to the university library in Poznań in the post-war period, following the evacuation of many priceless literary works during the war. This discovery suggests that other libraries may also contain works from the Brothers Grimm's private collection. The news of this important historical discovery has caused considerable interest among literary researchers and folklorists, who can now more fully explore the legacy of the Brothers Grimm and their influence on world literature.

Why does an anthropomorphic needle go down the road? Heck if I know! The later versions, as explained in the preface of the above book, were sanitized and Christianized for popular consumption. reply hodgesrm 16 hours agoparentI think there are morals in Grimms Fairy Tales even in the earliest versions. What is striking to me when I read them is that many of the stories come from people at the bottom level of society and reflected their struggle for survival. These include terrifying consequences for misbehavior and that violating group norms (including those imposed from above) is a big no-no. A lot of the stories feature tricksters who cleverly got around these restrictions. These patterns don't show up clearly in individual stories. But it's pretty strong if you read them from end to end. reply octopoc 16 hours agorootparentYeah, this is definitely the case IME. It's easy to read these stories and go away thinking \"WTF.\" But it's important to remember that these stories come from oral societies, which means 90% of the communication is lost since it's only written on paper. But that communication can be reconstructed by a charitable mind. For example, in the first story in Grimm's Fairy Tales (at least the version I read), there's a mouse and a cat that are friends. The cat and mouse find some delicious food and they hide it somewhere far away from their house. The cat then proceeds to go \"visiting relatives\" (in reality he is eating up the delicious food) and the mouse is gullible and believes the cat. After a while the mouse discovers the cat ate up all the food and angrily accuses the cat of being deceitful. The cat then proceeds to eat the mouse. The end. I think this is a profound story on not ignoring the fact that the cat is the natural predator and the mouse is the natural prey in the relationship. The mouse has convinced itself that this time will be different. This has relevance for e.g. not dismissing signs of abuse. But it's so easy to read that story and be like, \"Well, I guess the point is that gullible people get screwed, so don't be gullible.\" Or even, \"It's a dog-eat-dog world.\" It's a good story to tell a friend who's trying to rationalize being passive in an abusive relationship. reply wongarsu 15 hours agorootparentTo me that story reads like thinly veiled political commentary. Peasants and feudal lords/nobility/local government working towards a common goal (e.g. paying taxes to fund defense against bandits, building grain stores for times of famine, etc). A person in power misappropriates the funds for personal gain, and any peasant who complains loses their head. Telling a story about a mouse and a cat allowed you to keep your head, and the situation was probably common enough for the fable to become widely known before it was picked up by the Bothers Grimm. It's not that different from Gulliver's Travels complaining about pointless religious wars under the guise of talking about far-away islands of tiny humans, or Star Trek criticizing the Vietnam War under the guise of talking about a primitive planet light-years away centuries in the future. reply mewpmewp2 14 hours agorootparentMy thoughts were this might also be on the World politics level. E.g. a case where a stronger country during wartime will co operate with weaker country, and then slowly infiltrate because it's easier than to do full on invasion. Then finally when weaker country starts to complain they will completely take over. The stronger country in theory could at any time swallow the weaker, it's just that it might be more beneficial for stronger country to do it in a slower, methodical, deceiving manner, until it can. Or when it actually needs to. In this case it seems to me it was strategic behavior by the cat to not immediately eat the mouse, but instead consume the fat first. Eating the mouse was a fallback in this scenario. But overall this specific scenario happens on so many levels of relationships including, but not limited to interpersonal, business, country level, World level, etc. The main key points in my view are that it is a cat, and cat always will want to eat the mouse in what you would think is pscyhopathic mannerism if it was between people, but it's most easily explainable on level of countries. Because ultimately countries as entities have to act in psychopathic ways with each other, because territories, resources are all clearly limited. Due to the complexity of World politics you have to co operate with your enemies as well. Both sides are lying to each other, keeping secrets, but at the same time co operating, because they have to or they otherwise will fall behind other countries. reply wolfi1 8 hours agorootparentI hate to break it to you but this is ahistorical, as this story is several hundred years old the peasants at that time had no concerns for world politics nor were they concerned by whom they were governed, the circumstances for them wouldn't change reply ReleaseCandidat 15 hours agorootparentprev> in the first story in Grimm's Fairy Tales It's the second story.

The cat pounces on the mouse and eats her up. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_and_Mouse_in_Partnership#P... The mouse says \"All-gone\" and is than eaten because of that.

This book collection, comprising rare prints and unique editions, is more than just a series of items of significant material of bibliophile value. It is particularly valuable primarily as a source of knowledge on the research methods used by the two researchers. In the footnotes and indexes to their publications of fairy tales or folk legends, both Jakob and Wilhelm were very meticulous in providing their written source material, i.e. the sources that they held in their book collection, the items of which had purposefully been acquired by the duo to preserve for subsequent editions of old relics European and German literature. Equally important for the research on the literary output and research activity of the Grimm Brothers is the analysis of hand-written underlining, notes and annotations that the texts were typographically enhanced by during the reading. The volumes from the portion of the working collection of the Brothers Grimm found in the Poznań University Library were long though to had been lost during the WWII, and now can be of significant value in their contribution to the development of modern research on the Brothers’ literary and scientific output. The very fact that they have been found allows us to believe that the book collections at the Library can hold other volumes that belonged to the private book collection of Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm still to be discovered. So it's not about books written by the Brothers Grimm, but books which they used in their research. reply ikari_pl 17 hours agoparentbest part about > Polish science news outlet Nauka w Polske reported is that \"Nauka w Polske\" is not correct Polish.

While most designs were eventually remade as phototypes, and later as digital type, many of them were only imperfectly preserved, so for example, rather than all the different hot metal sizes and variations, only a single phototype master usually exists, capturing only the state of a single size (usually a larger display size). reply mistrial9 17 hours agorootparentagree this is interesting and worthwhile.. notice however that the divergence of letter forms in Eastern Europe (into Central Asia) is really a reflection of the drastic cultural conflicts in that area over centuries.. from a distance, it seems that \"modern\" typeface, and the type it replaced, together really are not very old compared to the cultures that were using them... and those cultures merged by imperial forces from multiple directions. reply cafard 18 hours agoparentprevIf you are in Poland it ought to be painfully straightforward to remember the losses it caused. reply michael9423 18 hours agorootparentThe volumes of Brothers Grimm fairy tales found here were german.

Royalty also ruled Bohemia, Hungary, Wallonia (modern Romania), Sweden, almost got there in Moscow during \"the Troubles\", while at other times the German / Central European Wettin (Saxony) or Luxemburg (Bohemia) families also held the Polish Crown. Nevermind military alliances (Jan Sobieski's contributions to to lifting the Turkish Siege of Vienna in 1683 got him a memorial in the sky to this day ... the constellation of Scutum). The way to become King of Poland was not quite as elaborately ritualized as the German electorate, but not generally/universally hereditary either. But neither did Poland isolate itself from its neighbours, on the contrary. Up until internal strife and the great Nordic War, it involved itself a lot with both central and eastern Europe. And while one may look at the partitions as predatory, let's also remember that for 80 years before the Polish Duma flogged the crown to the highest bidder (August the nth of Saxony, for three generations), which, and realize it's a strong word, also sold the country. Let's remember \"predatory\" territorial expansions also a little in context; Turkey overrunning the Balkans and Hungary between 1300..1526 eradicated a dozen countries. Louis XIV's wars of reunion were very predatory and gained France territory the size of Switzerland. The Austria-Turkey wars after 1683 \"undid\" 200 years of Turkish rule in Hungary within two decades, as did Russia taking over the Cossack Hetmanates, Crimea; the wars of the Spanish and Austrian succession changed territorial \"ownership\" on a large scale as well. What Napoleon, in league with quite a few of the German states, did to \"countries\" in Germany was neither less disruptive nor, territory-wise, smaller in scale than the partitions of Poland. That doesn't make them \"right\". I would contest though that they were a \"uniquely polish\" sort of doom. Other countries lost their independence for centuries as well (Serbia, Hungary, Bohemia/Czechy, Lithuania if you like ...). The difference \"then\" was that such changes in overlordship only began to be associated with forceful removals of population - ethical cleansing - after the rise of nationalism post Napoleon. My country (Germany) did rather evil there, and can't blame others for having taken retribution. No need for \"love lost\". It's not deserved. The real evil was less the partitions and the \"ganging up\" on Poland, but the nationalism in the 19th century. The idea that within your country's boundaries, there shall be one language, one culture. It'd have been considered very odd up to ~1700 for sure. And it created all the evil between 1780 and 1945. Looking at Russia trying to eradicate Ukraine, maybe ... to this day. And yet, it's all _shared_ history. reply michael9423 13 hours agorootparent\"European Countries before the Napoleonic Age were quite a bit \"intertwined\"\" Excellent contribution. Marion Gräfin Dönhof talks about this, a descendant of both Prussian and newly turned \"Polish\" political elite and aristocracy. Some of her german ancestors adopted polish names and became thus polish. Before the rise of nationalism, there was not really such a gap between nations as today. Germans sometimes even ruled parts of Poland with no issues. There were also special laws and leaders in Poland exclusively for Germans, in other words, the Germans in Poland ruled themselves, living side by side respectfully with the Polish people. All of this makes one ask what nations really are and what national identity really is in the end, beyond political propaganda. National coherence was forced onto people everywhere, with dramatic consequences and suffering. People have lived hundreds or even thousands of years without the need for unified nations, often many different cultures coexisting with each other under a banner of a \"nation\", which was mostly just the culture of a given ruling aristocracy at that time. reply dzink 6 hours agorootparentIt’s money - taxes and tax collection a then the power of those with bigger coffers. reply surfingdino 12 hours agorootparentprevIt seems that creation of nation states was a way of scaling up tribalism. reply surfingdino 12 hours agorootparentprevThat's a very good summary. I would also add colonialism to the conversation. The idea that \"lesser\" nations' culture and language could be erased, their populations turned into slaves, and natural resources exploited for the benefit of the colonial powers was also an important contributor to what happened in that region in the 20th century. reply nick7376182 3 hours agorootparentWhereas prior to colonialism, the nobles would declare a new loyalty and life for the peasants would continue on as normal (or the nobles would be replaced). It seems that the Protestant reformation was a big contributor to change in this structure, with rulers having much more concern for how the peasants conducted their daily lives and holidays (and language?) not just taxes and fealty. reply rich_sasha 18 hours agorootparentprevFunnily enough a lot of Polish art was \"lost\" during WWII. Every now and then it resurfaces from someone's \"private collection\" in Germany. German government is kind enough to let Poles bid for the art they carelessly lost during that affair in the 1940s.

Your sarcastic overtone make it difficult to detect an actual argument. Your general remark that Polish art disappeared from Poland is true. Your implication that only Germany was responsible for that is wrong. The german state is generally cooperative, in contrast to the ex-soviet states, in giving back and trying to find solutions. Even from the private side is cooperation - some time ago some private owner gave back art to Poland, which rarely happens.

It sounds like you have a grossly misinformed view of this part of the world, with a clear sense of superiority of one culture over the other. So, here's a few facts for you: > Most likely on October 12-13, 1944, the Brandkommando of the Wehrmacht (Nazi German army) burned collections of the most valuable literary monuments from the National Library in one of the greatest losses to Polish culture in its history, and one of the greatest losses to written culture in history of the world. The National Library lost at least 39,000 manuscripts – and most likely more, perhaps as many as 50,000 – along with some 80,000 books from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, 100,000 books from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, 60,000 drawings and engravings, 25,000 musical scores and 10,000 maps. The great family libraries were almost wiped out, such as the famous collection of manuscripts of the Krasiński Library, of which just 78 volumes survived out of more than 7,000.¹ ¹ https://www.bn.org.pl/en/news/3855-75-years-ago-the-germans-... reply michael9423 12 hours agorootparent> Mr. Garber, the Second World War was also an inferno for German book and library culture. Do we now know more or less exactly what damage and losses occurred at which collection locations in Germany? > Yes, most of the damage is known and extends across the entire old German Reich, from Karlsruhe to Kiel, from Munich to Königsberg. The largest German library in the Reich was hit most spectacularly. In July 1943, the Hamburg City Library alone lost 700,000 volumes in “Aktion Gomorrha”. As far as the individual titles themselves are concerned, the relevant data is often still missing - unfortunately. There is no large and accurate work on the books and libraries that once existed and were lost or not returned during the Second World War. > How do you assess the historical and intellectual damage caused to our cultural memory by the absence of German books? > I will answer this question with a quote from the first expert on the subject from 1947: “It is a catastrophe that has no comparison in the history of libraries and in the history of science” (Georg Leyh). We have no account of the demise of German libraries. Germany has lost significant parts of its cultural memory forever. But who knows about it? Conversely, the greatest crime committed by Germany has led to an irretrievable loss of urban silhouettes and cultural witnesses. The answer? Never-ending mourning and never-ending work of remembrance. https://www.fr.de/kultur/literatur/eine-katastrophe-11007951... Generally, the cultural loss via burning down libraries and knowledge is inherent to war, and obviously does not only affect one country. The article also mentions the Library of Warsaw as an example of lost knowledge, but the loss of german culture \"has no comparison in the history of libraries\", per renowned librarian Georg Leyh. P.S.: Germany still does not own the Berlinka - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlinka_(art_collection) reply jakubadamw 11 hours agorootparentThe German losses were mostly collateral damage related to the bombings of the cities. The burning of the Polish collections and archives by the German army, on the other hand, was a conscious, deliberate act pertaining to the objective of destroying the culture of the Polish nation – I refer you, amongst other things, to Himmler's and Hitler's clearly expressed intent of razing Warsaw, the nominal, but also cultural and intellectual capital of pre-war Poland, to the ground. That intent is not inherent to war in a universal sense – for one, it is a war crime, for which Alfred Rosenberg was convicted during the Nürnberg Trials – and it looks like you are generally convinced the conduct of the German army in WWII was that like of any other, and that war as carried out by Germany in 1939-1945 was war like any other. At this point, my curiosity in continuing this conversation is limited solely to the question on where you received your history education. > P.S.: Germany still does not own the Berlinka - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlinka_(art_collection) It does not, the German state dropped it for safekeeping in Lower Silesia and according to international law, its ownership was transferred together with the legal status of the respective territories per the Potsdam conference. Any discussion on the possible return of parts of the collection would need to start with the return of the thousands of Polish works of art held in German collections, to which, unlike Poland's legal claim to the Berlinka collection, Germany has none. reply michael9423 11 hours agorootparentMy original argument was: \"and most of the knowledge lost in the war in todays Poland was actually knowledge of german culture and heritage\" to which I gave a reference that makes a good case for this to be indeed true. You chose to ignore it and instead resort to talking about something unrelated (intent), which is a straw man, and you also launch an ad hominem, another logical fallacy. You also resort to faulty generalizations. In case you have overlooked it, here's the most relevant part of the quotes I gave: > “It is a catastrophe that has no comparison in the history of libraries and in the history of science” (Georg Leyh). We have no account of the demise of German libraries. Germany has lost significant parts of its cultural memory forever. reply mathteddybear 9 hours agorootparentBut it's not a thesis of Die Deutschen Wissenschaftlichen Bibliotheken nach dem Krieg, it's just a quote, and it does not support that \"most of the knowledge lost in the war in todays Poland was actually knowledge of german culture and heritage\", this is out of the scope of Georg Leyh work reply throw_pm23 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's not like all this has happened in vacuum though.

The first is the uncontrollable explosion of bloodlust in a victorious mass uprising. The other is cold, calculated cruelty committed by a victorious state as a demonstration of power and intimidation. The two forms of terror normally correspond to revolution and repression. The first is revolutionary. It justifies itself by the rage and fever of the moment, a temporary madness. The second is repressive.

Not too say that Lithuania was not run by own nationalists, who also managed to get into military conflicts with Latvian \"brothers\". The moral is that the whole Europe was boiling in every own nationalism that culminated with WW2. Thinking that it can never repeat is as delusional as 100 years ago reply hnbad 13 hours agorootparentNationalism truly was the mindkiller that enabled WW1 and WW2. It's important to remember that although WW2 is rightfully remembered for the Holocaust, it was in essence an attempt at a European colonialism by Germany coupled with a Germanic ethno-nationalism (or more accurately: völkisch nationalism, which is still deeply entrenched today). The racist pseudoscience of the Germanic übermensch served the same purpose as the skull measuring scientific racism used to justify the enslavement and extermination of the native population in African colonies. \"Lebensraum\" was just a Germanized version of Manifest Destiny. The colonization of Africa, India and the Americas involved massive displacement of natives and mass killings that at least colloquially can best be described as genocides. Much the same way as forests were cleared to create farmland, native populations were cleared to create \"living space\" for settlers. Much like natural resources were exploited and brought back home, natives were used for manual labor until they were used up. Nationalism allowed leaders to use a national identity to rally their subjects against their neighbors. In an act of massive hubris and severe underestimation of technological advancements this nationalist fervor led to the mass death event that was WW1. WW2 in turn built on this but also brought colonialism home with the explicit goal of not only redrawing borders but also repurposing the land and eliminating any natives standing in the way. I.e. Poland may have engaged in nationalist assimilation in the form of Polonizing Lithuania but Germany explicitly wanted to remove anyone not part of the \"volk\", at the barrel of a gun if necessary. reply Amezarak 18 hours agorootparentprevYou're quite right about that, but it is true that the post-WW borders of Germany viz. Poland were a little ridiculous, and the Allies after WWII undertook a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing after the war against territories that had had major German populations for centuries in an effort to create ethnically homogeneous states. reply alkyon 14 hours agorootparentIt's worth remebering though that this was Stalin's plan to enlarge the Soviet Union (incidently also approved by the Western powers in the Yalta Agreement) at the cost of German territory. The expulsion of some millions of Poles from the territories of some newly created Soviet republics that now belong to Western Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania is just as well a striking example of campaign of ethnic cleansing against the territories that had major Polish population for centuries. Morover, the Western Poland was subject to Prussian ethnic cleansing policies for more than a century, not to mention the war itself. reply hnbad 13 hours agorootparentprevThe national myth of Germany actually obscures one of the biggest successful efforts in \"restructuring\" the Allies engaged in: the complete elimination of Prussia. Not only were parts of Eastern Prussia reassigned to other countries but also Prussian provinces within Germany were dissolved and remodeled into the German Bundesländer. Today \"Prussia\" as a cohesive identity largely only exists as something for Bavarians to differentiate themselves from. Well into WW1 German national identity was defined more by Prussia than anything else but the Allies completely eliminated it. Denazification was largely a farce and appeals by influential people were mostly rubberstamped but Deprussification is the secret success story. reply mzs 13 hours agorootparentprevOh some German books were burned, while most of Poland's then inteligencia lie in a mass grave courtesy said Russians. reply MOARDONGZPLZ 19 hours agoparentprevIn this case they had an idea of how many volumes there were before the war and then how many after. reply FrustratedMonky 19 hours agorootparentThink he is just making general case that it is easier to destroy than create, and during war, a lot is lost. reply MOARDONGZPLZ 14 hours agorootparentWith recent advancements in generative AI that balance is changing quickly. reply echelon 18 hours agoparentprev> but how can we possibly remember what it caused us to lose?

If you’d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so here. I’m at the Google antitrust closing arguments, and I’ll have some thoughts on that soon. But today’s piece is about some bombshell evidence that just came out on a giant post-Covid conspiracy in the oil industry. And I do mean giant, because there’s now evidence that price-fixingp in the oil industry alone may single-handedly be responsible for a little over a quarter of the total inflationary increase in 2021. Let’s dive in. Last Sunday, I wrote a piece alleging that U.S. shale oil producers colluded with the Saudi government from 2021-2023 to drive up gas prices. That essay was based on some reporting I had done, as well as a complaint from a savvy Kansas City class action law firm, Sharp Law, with special expertise in oil. The theory was that American producers, after a bitter price war from 2014-2016, got tired of competing on price with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC oil cartel, and at some point from 2017-2021, decided to join the cartel and cut supply to the market. This action had the affect of raising oil prices, costing oil consumers something on the order of $200 billion a year. Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission released evidence confirming that collusion played a serious role in hiking oil prices at that time. Pioneer Natural Resources CEO Scott Sheffield, a leader in the fracking field, “exchanged hundreds of text messages with OPEC representatives and officials discussing crude oil market dynamics, pricing and output.” Sheffield was explicit about his goal, saying that “if Texas leads the way, maybe we can get OPEC to cut production. Maybe Saudi and Russia will follow. That was our plan,” he said, adding: “I was using the tactics of OPEC+ to get a bigger OPEC+ done.” He talked to shareholders, publicly threatened rivals, and ultimately achieved output cuts across the industry regardless of price. “Even if oil gets to $200/barrel,” he said, “the independent producers are going to be disciplined.” By 2021, as the economy roared back from Covid, the independents had joined OPEC. “I don’t think the world can rely much on US shale,” Sheffield said. “It’s really under OPEC control.” There’s more about Sheffield in the FTC complaint, though a lot is redacted. Investment data bears out what the FTC found, with lower production despite variations in price. How much did this conspiracy cost the consumer? “We produced too much oil and competed with OPEC,” Sheffield said in 2023. “We actually lowered the price by $20 to $30 per barrel over the past 10 years to the detriment of losing our entire investor base.” Since the U.S. consumes 7 billion barrels of oil annually, the amount saved by shale oil drillers during their price war with OPEC was $140 billion to $210 billion a year. Once that price war ended, presumably so did the savings. The cost itself is likely a lot higher because pulling shale off the market when demand spiked probably caused prices to increase by much more than $20-30 a barrel. Anyway, we’re talking $500-1000 dollars of extra cost per year to Americans through direct and indirect effects of this conspiracy. This cost shows up most obviously in the form of more expensive gas, but higher oil prices increase the price of everything right down to potato chips because of gas being a primary cost in distribution of goods and services. For a family of four, that’s two to four thousand dollars a year in higher costs. With these kinds of numbers, it’s likely this conspiracy had macro-economic impacts. In late 2021, I noticed that the increase in corporate profits in aggregate was responsible for 60% of inflationary increases, using this chart and doing a bunch of rough calculations that have since mostly been borne out. The jump in profits in 2021 was about $730 billion, or $2,100 per person. How do you aggregate just the oil industry? Well, it’s pretty clear that in 2021 and 2022, the industry did fantastically well, with the “the top 25 companies [making] more than $205 billion in profits in 2021,” and an “even more astounding” amount in 2022. Of course, not all profits are due to price-fixing, but $205 billion is just the top 25, not the whole industry. And profits got much much better the next year. So let’s layer on a rough guess of a $200 billion increase in profits in 2021 that Scott Sheffield implies, which is 27% of the total corporate profit increase that year. That’s a pretty astounding amount, more than a quarter of the total inflationary increase being a result purely of a price-fixing scheme. In 2021-2022, many populists questioned whether oil companies were engaging in a conspiracy, which triggered intense pushback from economists like Larry Summers that market power as a cause of inflation is a silly theory, and that we needed a recession and cuts to government spending to bring down prices. Remember this comment? As it turned out, populists were right about corporate profits as a factor in inflation. And now we can see that it’s price-fixing in the specific sector of oil companies that kept prices high. Whither Antitrust? Ok, so now let’s talk about why the government uncovered this conspiracy, and what is likely to happen. The context for this investigation was the FTC looking into the $60 billion Exxon-Pioneer merger. And while the FTC did let the merger through, they conditioned it on Exxon disallowing Sheffield from serving on the board of the combined firm or having a role as an advisor after it acquires his company. It’s a pretty aggressive punishment for an executive, to essentially bar him from the corporation he helped build. The industry, especially in the executive suite, is apparently shaken. Still, the FTC allowed the Exxon-Pioneer merger through, probably because the case would be brought in Texas, the industry is generally supportive of oil mergers, and it’s hard to argue to a judge that a merger would grant market power over the price of oil when the witnesses in the industry don’t support a challenge. The conduct the FTC found is a conspiracy that violates price-fixing law, and the commission should be bringing a charge on that basis, not necessarily based on merger law. Plaintiff lawyers are already bringing price-fixing claims here, and the FTC action just made that case far more likely to draw blood. There’s also the politics, as these oil mergers are highly contested and partisan. Democrats are skeptical of “Big Oil,” while the Republican coalition is built around fossil fuel firms, Wall Street private equity who finance it, and Saudi wealth that benefits from expensive oil. Late last year, 21 Senate Democrats asked the FTC to challenge this spate of oil and gas mergers. Then, a few month ago, 37 Senate Republicans, led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, sent a letter demanding the FTC stay out of the industry’s merger spree, as that merger spree would, in their view, raise production. Within the commission, it was obviously a big deal. The settlement from the FTC kicking Sheffield off the board was a 3-2 commission vote that similarly broke down on party lines. FTC Chair Lina Khan, Commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter all issued separate statements, whereas Republicans Andrew Ferguson and Melissa Holyoak issued a joint dissent. Everyone agreed that the conduct of Sheffield was concerning, and Slaughter, Holyoak, and Ferguson called for a potential price-fixing suit. Ferguson and Holyoak argued the merger itself was fine, and the board position had nothing to do with the combination. There was an odd bit where they lauded Exxon’s ‘wise’ decision to not put Sheffield on the board. Bedoya, in his statement, rebutted this by pointing out that Exxon was going to put Sheffield on its board until the FTC acted. Khan’s argument was simple; when executives say they are trying to collude, regulators should have ‘regulatory humility’ and believe them. At any rate, this decision is a bit of a muddle. An oil CEO, a legend and decision-maker in the industry, got personally punished for price-fixing. That’s good. But a big merger went through, though it is relatively small in the global context. Still, the muddle is inherent, as there’s just no way to fix a harm that was so vast and far-reaching. So what happens now? Well fortunately there already is a private antitrust price-fixing suit, and it just got a huge boost from the FTC’s release of its complaint. That means years of litigation against not just Pioneer but seven different shale oil producers. Additionally, the FTC could bring actual monopolization claims against the shale producers, but that’s probably contingent upon a second Biden term, an uncertain proposition. And even with that possibility, we’re going to run into the same problem we see with all of antitrust, which is that it takes forever. Finally, there’s also likely to be some sort of political reaction, considering it’s an election year, and this is pretty good evidence that oil firms helped collude with Saudi Arabia to steal thousands of dollars from each American family. I can see Congressional proposals to fund oil-specific antitrust investigations, special rules proposed to prohibit communications with OPEC, or even pushing the Federal Reserve to start looking into the relationship between price-fixing and inflation. In 2022, the Biden administration pleaded with oil firms to invest in drilling more to bring down the price of oil, but they refused, claiming it was Biden environmental policies that were the cause of their low investment. The environmental constraints bit was in retrospect an obvious lie. And even the war in Ukraine, it turns out, was likely just an excuse for what was really going on, which was price-fixing. Americans were skeptical of big oil, and their instincts were correct. It really was a conspiracy against us by a small group. That said, even if all of these suits worked out, and the political proposals enacted, it wouldn’t be enough. There’s no way to make Americans whole for what oil executives did, but there needs to be a real penalty for schemes of this magnitude. What should happen is handcuffs, en masse, for every executive that set up the American branch of OPEC. Will that happen? I doubt it. But it should. Regardless, macro-economists should stop ignoring the dynamics of specific markets. Reality, as it turns out, matters. Thanks for reading!

(thebignewsletter.com)234 points by toomuchtodo 16 hours agohidepastfavorite147 comments mcconaughey 14 hours agoIgnoring the fact that this article doesn't clearly state the \"evidence\" that the FTC found in this \"conspiracy\", it misunderstands what occurred with US Shale producers from 2010-now. In the 2010s, US Shale Producers got hyped up on strong oil prices and the explosion of fracking. They massively overproduced, leading to the price cratering and a large majority of producers going out of business. Oil and gas was in severe distress from the late 2010s to the negative price drama in 2020. When prices rebounded in early 2020s, there was a lot of scar tissue in the industry about overproduction. Producers are now extremely conservative. They are also well aware that clean energy is on the horizon and want to draw out this good cycle as long as they can. Opposite to what the conspiracy theory states, OPEC and US Shale do not want prices to go too high in the short term, as this shock would accelerate the clean energy transition. They definitely want strong prices, but this $80-100 range is probably the sweet spot. Below $80, they might pull back, which is what we see from OPEC. But this certainly isn't some \"conspiracy\" to elevate oil to $200/barrel. These participants are sophisticated and are not that shortsighted. I think the typical Democrat-Party view that \"oil bad\" and \"oil corrupt\" lacks nuance. It also ignores the profligate government spending that is driving excessive consumption (travel, etc.) causing a lot of these market dislocations the past several years. Now, they want to point the finger at some grand conspiracy. This seems not far off from Q-Anon on the other side of the political aisle. reply wolverine876 13 hours agoparent> When prices rebounded in early 2020s, there was a lot of scar tissue in the industry about overproduction.

It all sounds very convincing, but the problem is that there are dozens of other equally convincing macroeconomic explanations. Somehow the ones people tend to pick happen to excuse every rich person from any accountability and foster a \"greed is good\" outlook, even though the other equally good explanations (left unsaid) would imply the opposite. You shrug off the FTC's evidence here, and put the word \"conspiracy\" in scare quotes to discredit it. But the FTC claims \"Sheffield sought to align oil production across the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico with OPEC+.\" and \"Sheffield, for example, exchanged hundreds of text messages with OPEC representatives and officials discussing crude oil market dynamics, pricing and output.\" It feels to me like you're disregarding any actual facts and evidence in this case for your favorite macroeconomic explanation instead. reply Teever 9 hours agorootparentI think what you're witnessing is a defense mechanism that comes about as a response to cognitive dissonance that is related to their deeply held personal beliefs about how the world works and their role in those workings.

And perhaps somebody else can fill in the blanks here, but so far as I can tell, the FTC is not alleging any sort of wrongdoing, but instead filing a complaint against a proposed merger between Exxon and another company, which could enable larger scale constraints on competition. Their evidence are the messages and comments from the head of the to-be-merged company, who made efforts to follow along with OPEC price standards (or even take the lead) as a means of maximizing profit. Where 'strategic pricing' ends and price fixing begins is not at all clear to me, especially in a field like this where global prices are actively controlled by a price fixing cartel.

Being opposed to the destruction of the planet does not mean I should not ask \"who actually benefits from economic trends that everyone complains about?\" Piketty argued that the share of growth that goes to capital vs labor will determine a great deal about how inequality changes over time, and insofar as artificial price increases are just increased revenues to asset holders, this behavior has importance not just today but in shaping the future. > Most stocks are not held by individuals Isn't that a distraction?

The first way is to raise interest rates. This is essentially a wealth transfer to banks and their owners while hurting individuals and businesses to stifle economic activity. This is what we always do. Why? Because capital owners demand it. The other way cannot be tolerated or entertained. The second way is taxation. Some countries (eg Spain) enacted a windfall profits tax. Unlike interest rate hikes, taxation only targets profitable corporations. It allows a government to redistribute wealth to those who most need it, fund infrastructure and so on. And it disproportionately affects those who price gouging for massive profits, such as in the case of the oil and gas industry. Companies may reinvest profits into their business to avoid these excessive taxes. Great. Perfect. Love to see it. This latest price-fixing scandal is going to turn into a huge deal. This is just the beginning. But it's not th esole reason for price hikes in 2020-2022.

There is no variance or selection. It's a onesie fits all solution to a dynamic problem. Electric water heating is interesting. You should look to install a tank and a tankless heater. It's called a booster configuration. Set the tank up to run during the day when you have free power and then only hit the tankless when it runs empty (or your variable costs are low).

Electric cars are in a similar bind - barely any government subsidies combined with falling gas prices, a lackluster / too expensive offering by everyone but Tesla and Tesla focusing more on the Cybertruck (that can't ever be certified to European standards) than on boosting Model 3 quality combined means that the % of electric cars on new registrations went downhill from 16% to 12% [2].

The author's evidence for his shocking headline is exclusively him assuming his own conclusion, and then adding a healthy helping of fudgery on top of that. From the article --- How do you aggregate just the oil industry? Well, it’s pretty clear that in 2021 and 2022, the industry did fantastically well, with the “the top 25 companies [making] more than $205 billion in profits in 2021,” and an “even more astounding” amount in 2022. Of course, not all profits are due to price-fixing, but $205 billion is just the top 25, not the whole industry. And profits got much much better the next year. So let’s layer on a rough guess of a $200 billion increase in profits in 2021 that Scott Sheffield implies, which is 27% of the total corporate profit increase that year. That’s a pretty astounding amount, more than a quarter of the total inflationary increase being a result purely of a price-fixing scheme. --- So he's assuming that 100% of inflation is caused by corporate profits (which is beyond absurd), and then stating that since the oil industry made up 27% of total corporate profits (using evidence that seems to be wildly hand-wavey at best, even though the exact numbers are readily available), that they therefore caused 27% of all inflation. And somehow, the giant price-fixing conspiracy (which is a gross misrepresentation of what the FTC is saying) was the reason they made these 27% of profits (which is absurd). reply NewJazz 14 hours agoparentprev\"smart people\" reply google234123 15 hours agoprevAnd our government has literally made it its mission to limit domestic oil production (canceling keystone, blocking permits, ceasing to lease federal land.

Nominal dollars per mile: gone down by about 10% on average since cars have gotten more efficient since 1993 Real cost per gallon: gone down by more than half, since we've had ~116% inflation since 1993 Real cost per mile: just multiply the two together and it's about 60% lower than it was in 1993.

Even if it means lowering some standards of living for a while, and spending money to move us out from the high consumption of fossil fuels, it's worth it long term both in economical and social aspects. You don't want a world where social strife due to mass starvation, mass migration, destroying societies that want to protect themselves from the potential millions that will seek refugee elsewhere where they can have food, is possible because it would be a little bit inconvenient to some of the richest folks on Earth. Those will also cause massive economical impacts, broken supply chains, less supply of some raw materials, more protectionism from nations wanting to hoard resources, wars between nations when water sources move borders or disappear altogether. Yeah, there might be some inconveniences that are required, but previous generations had to deal with much worse inconveniences: wars, famine due to crop failure, etc. It sounds really entitled to be offended by being asked to not drive your car so much, shop more locally produced food (and even stuff in general) if possible in your budget, change some ways of business to not require so many flights for simple meetings, so on and so forth.

Most of the oil and oil products China gets from Russia leave Russia on ships from Russia's European ports -- another long supply line. So for sensible national-security reasons that do not apply to the US (namely, making sure it can continue to transport things like food to all its citizens if its national-security competitor gets angry at it or if the Persian Gulf becomes unstable) China is interested in electrifying its vehicle fleet since China has plenty of coal with which to generate electricity.

The US literally produces more oil today than any country has in the history of the world. One of the main reasons its doing so is because oil prices are high enough to sustain production.

There’s an effort to divest from oil, shut down permitting, and discourage investment. And when companies respond to this by reducing investment, there are claims about “windfall profits” and “price-fixing”. There’s no grand conspiracy here. Shale companies over-invested in growth, lost their shirts in 2015, and got punished by investors (or went bankrupt). Then prices recovered, they over invested in growth, and got demolished again as oil prices crashed and even briefly went negative in 2020. Fresh off these two crashes, it’s not surprising at all that companies are exercising capital discipline and not taking on debt to drill. Shareholders don’t want them to do that! reply singhrac 14 hours agoparentI traded crude oil professionally until early 2022 and I remember that was how we justified low domestic production in mid 2021 as well (i.e. \"producers think these prices are temporary, so they aren't investing\"). In retrospect (and these are all guesses with hazy memory) we probably overestimated the cost of turning an oil well on and off. But exchanging text messages with OPEC to price-fix is damning.

    "commentBody": "CSS Text Box Trim (github.com/jantimon)208 points by bpierre 19 hours agohidepastfavorite48 comments alberth 18 hours agoTypography The two most needed CSS properties for better web typography are Text-Box-Trim, as well as Margin-Trim Please browser dev’s, implement both of these. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-trim —- Here’s a JS hack in the mean-time: https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize/ reply tshaddox 14 hours agoparentCapsize is great! It's worth noting that it's not really a \"JS hack\": it doesn't require you to ship JavaScript to the browser. Capsize is written in JavaScript, but it's just a function that takes information about a specific font and typography information and outputs static styles, meaning you can run Capsize at build time or even just copy the generated CSS straight from their web site. reply chrismorgan 6 hours agorootparentHowever, you can never guarantee the font text will be rendered in, so if you precalculate you may damage things. Web fonts may fail to load for a variety of reasons. Some users will force their own chosen fonts. In Firefox: Setting → Fonts → Advanced → untick Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above. I’ve done that for the last four years, as it makes the web so much better. reply MrJohz 14 hours agoparentprevI don't know that I really get the point of margin-trim - there are already plenty of other, arguably clearer ways of avoiding padding at the start and end of an element - using flexbox and the gap property, using :not, even the classic + selector works pretty well here. Is it designed to do more than just that, or is it just about avoiding gaps at the start and end of lines of elements? reply tshaddox 13 hours agorootparentmargin-trim is basically a simpler alternative to adding a margin-bottom to every child, then removing the margin-bottom from the last child with :last-child { margin-bottom: 0; } Flex with gap is also an alternative to that, and in my view should be the default thing you reach for. But there are some cases where the child margin approach has benefits, particularly if you're doing certain animations/transitions or if you want each child to essentially override its top or bottom gap. reply MrJohz 11 hours agorootparentBut can't you do .selector:not(:last-child) ? Or .selector + .selector ? Both of these seem clearer than adding an extra property just to handle this case. Like, I understand the situation, I've been in that place plenty of times. But I've never felt in want of a solution there. reply spdustin 9 hours agorootparentI often use the so-called \"lobotomized owl selector\" (* + *) in the reset I use for my own internal tools. More specifically: * { margin: 0; padding: 0; } * + * { margin-top: 1em; } reply murermader 19 hours agoprevRelated blog post, that was recently submitted to HN: Hardest Problem in Computer Science: Centering Things (https://tonsky.me/blog/centering/). This feature would fix alot of the problems with centering fonts (icon and text) vertically, which is currently not really possible, at least not easily. reply achairapart 18 hours agoprevThis will be very useful, especially for vertical aligning, but as of today is essentially unsupported: https://caniuse.com/css-text-box-trim reply reaperducer 18 hours agoparentThis will be very useful, especially for vertical aligning, but as of today is essentially unsupported: Looks like Safari beta is the only current option. It's always funny how Safari gets so much heat on HN for being \"behind\" on things, when it's so often ahead on features. For example, it's the only browser that supports hanging-punctuation, and supported JPEG2000 since 2011. reply mholt 17 hours agorootparentSafari IS often behind on things. It's the ONLY major browser that doesn't support 'overflow-anchor: auto' even though that's been the default in all other browsers for years now. https://caniuse.com/css-overflow-anchor Their TP finally implements it, but years late. reply hbn 17 hours agorootparentApple's hesitance on implementing browser features can also be a positive. They held off on web push forever which is a good thing because web push is horrible and just opened the floodgates for everyone's grandma's Samsung phone being constantly covered with online gambling ads. When Apple finally implemented it, they did it so it's only allowed for web pages saved to your homescreen like an app which I think is a good compromise. Safari is the only thing stopping Google from running rampant with implementing new \"web standards\" because all browsers on the iPhone are Safari, so everyone needs to make sure their site works in a browser other than Chrome. This is looking to be on borrowed time unfortunately because regulators are looking to force Apple to allow other browser engines. So look forward to Google's stranglehold on the internet being further cemented. reply ashtonmeuser 8 hours agorootparentprevSafari also entirely disables CSS multi-column when printing per this 17 year old bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15546. reply atonse 17 hours agorootparentprevI think Safari's priorities closely map Apple's priorities and DNA. So when it comes to presentation (how text is presented, typography, color spaces, HiDPI, etc, all things that benefit an overall design, user experience) Safari always seems to be way ahead of the rest. But when it comes to stuff that developers want (stuff that mostly makes devs more happy), it may tend to lag more behind. That mirrors Apple's general priorities of often prioritizing user experience over dev experience. And even though I'm a developer, I happen to kind of agree with that prioritization..... on most days :-) reply agos 17 hours agorootparentI remember something in the whatwg ideals saying something along the lines of: users before developers before user agent developers reply philistine 12 hours agorootparentApple prioritizes thus: Apple first, its users second, its devs third. They never stray from that. reply atonse 8 hours agorootparentWell, that’s all the browser vendors. Their interests first. reply wnevets 18 hours agorootparentprev> It's always funny how Safari gets so much heat on HN for being \"behind\" on things, when it's so often ahead on features. To be fair to HN this has been a relatively recent change. Jen Simmons and Webkit/Safari teams have really stepped up their game. reply robertoandred 17 hours agorootparentIt's not recent. Safari has always been pushing and adding things, just not what Google wants. reply afavour 16 hours agorootparentAll of these things are relative, let's not pretend they aren't. Safari has always been pushing _some_ things and has been significantly behind in others. From my own memory bank: Chrome implemented WebGL in 2010, Apple took until 2014 to finally bring it to iOS Safari. That actively held back work I was doing. It's very easy to dismiss any web improvement as being something Google is shoving down everyone's throat but it's not true, a lot of them are things developers are crying out for. reply philistine 12 hours agorootparentI can relate to your work being impacted by webGL not shipping on iPhone, but we both know why Apple took so long: because they invest less than Google in their browser, and the investment they make cannot regress speed nor battery life. I side with Apple on that view. They’ve recently started investing more in the browser, but haven’t moved on degrading battery life. I wonder why they’re suddenly investing (cough cough DMA) reply afavour 11 hours agorootparent“they don’t allocate resources to the project” is context, not a reason. We’re allowed to resent that choice made by one of the biggest companies in the world. reply wnevets 17 hours agorootparentprev> just not what Google wants. or what developers like myself want. There was absolutely a significant period of time where it felt like I was dealing with the new IE in the age of evergreen browsers. reply thekingshorses 17 hours agorootparentprevSafari is the only browser that doesn't support extending HTML element https://caniuse.com/?search=Custom%20Elements reply lelanthran 5 hours agorootparent> Safari is the only browser that doesn't support extending HTML element That's a pretty big thing. I did not know. I have custom elements on this web page, but I haven't had anyone complain that the image doesn't show (or shows up twice) under iOS: https://www.lelanthran.com/chap10/content.html reply amlib 16 hours agorootparentprevI remember having to jump trough a series of silly hoops just to get audio encoded in Opus to play on Safari browsers. They do indeed drag their feet on seemingly arbitrary things. reply k4rli 18 hours agorootparentprevAre the features actually useful though? Surely there's a reason why only Safari has them. This textbox trim seems like a fix for badly made fonts reply robinson7d 18 hours agorootparentIt depends on what one considers useful. E.g. they were also first to support the `:has()` selector/pseudo-class, which I think can be useful for avoiding JS in some cases. reply joemi 14 hours agorootparentprev> This textbox trim seems like a fix for badly made fonts That's not what it is. It's a typographic control that wasn't available in browsers before. It's got nothing to do with fonts being badly made. All textboxes (no matter which font) can be measured from many different places, and this lets you specify (via text-box-edge) which of those many different places you want to consider as the bounds of a specific textbox. reply littlestymaar 15 hours agorootparentprevJust because Safari can sometimes be ahead, it's still the browser that lags the most. And sometimes we're talking about years behind Chrome and FF (WebRTC being the example I directly suffered from). reply tsujp 17 hours agoprevFINALLY!! For 12 years visually vertically centreing text has required adding a padding or margin of a few pixels to the bottom or top, now (when adopted) it can be done properly. reply bbx 10 hours agoprevI hope this will finally stop developers from setting line-height: 1; on text inputs which cuts off the top and bottom parts of some letters. Even Google developers make this mistake. reply lominming 16 hours agoprevMuch needed feature for typography! The biggest pain is when I need to visually vertically center a text with an icon. If you have an [ICON] followed by upper case character (e.g. Hello), the (H) will always visually look too high to be vertically centered with the [ICON] because the actual height of the text that is calculated always account for hanging characters like \"g, y\", etc. reply dsego 14 hours agoparentIt's such a pain, there was a fantastic hn submission not long ago about the struggles with vertical centering. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40069599 reply mortenjorck 15 hours agoprevI had always wondered why Figma supports this when there doesn’t appear to be any support for it in the wild (web or native).

If only it was implemented today! reply Ian_Macharia 17 hours agoprevReally cool. I'm currently building a text animation library and this should solve a lot of the margin issues that I've faced reply recursive 18 hours agoprevI don't really understand what this is doing that margins aren't. reply alberth 17 hours agoparentBetter explanation here https://css-tricks.com/leading-trim-the-future-of-digital-ty... Note: this use to be called “leading-trim” reply pests 18 hours agoparentprevThis depends on the font and give you options on how the bounding box works. Margins would be error prone, manual, and unreliable. reply mixmastamyk 17 hours agoparentprevWas hard to understand until they got to the Use Cases section, should have led with that. TLDR: fonts are not vertically centered, but bottom aligned. This feature helps alleviate that by (typically) cutting off the top empty space. Yes, you can sometimes add a little space around the text, but this is a proper solution. reply cynicalsecurity 7 hours agoprevOkay, but first let's wait for 10 years until it's going to be supported by every device out there. Bookmarked, will get back to it in 10 years. reply baggy_trough 18 hours agoprevHow about a property for \"largest font size that will make this text fit in the box without wrapping\"? reply eclipticplane 18 hours agoparentIn a similar vein but not changing text size is text-wrap: balance. https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/css-text-wrap-balan... reply thepra 11 hours agorootparentNow this is going in any place with long format texts in my web apps, thanks reply fooey 15 hours agorootparentprevNice!

I wish there was chat history. Also if you click the \"New Chat\" button while an answer is generating I think some of the output gets fed back into the model, it causes some weird output [0] but was kind of cool/fun. Here is a video of it as well [1], I almost think this should be some kind of special mode you can run. I'd be interested to know what the bug causes, is it just the existing output sent as input or a subset of it? It might be fun to watch a chat bot just randomly hallucinate, especially on a local model.

Not sure) but it would be cool to have this run until you stop it, automatically changing every 10-30 seconds or so. reply threatofrain 7 hours agoprevIMO eventually users should be able to advertise what embedding models they have so we don't redundantly redownload. reply KeplerBoy 5 hours agoparentThat's not possible with current web tech, is it? Different webapps can't share common dependencies stored in localstorage afaik. reply JimDabell 1 hour agorootparentIt can probably be done with a browser extension. It can definitely be done by the browsers themselves. Eventually it will probably be done by the operating system, which the browsers will then expose. reply dannyw 5 hours agorootparentprevThis need wasn’t super prevalent in the pre LLM days. It’s rare to have a multi-GB blob that should be commonly used across sites. reply TeMPOraL 3 hours agorootparentIt was a real need given how almost all sites use large JavaScript deps. However, any hopes of sharing those were destroyed by adtech people timing resource downloads to track people. reply SXX 47 minutes agorootparentLots and lots of websites still use Google and other CDNs for JS deps, fonts, etc. reply JimDabell 11 minutes agorootparentThey are cached independently these days to avoid privacy issues. So if websites A and B both use the same JavaScript dependency from a public CDN and you visit them both, you will download the JavaScript dependency twice, even if you have it cached from your visit to the first website. reply KeplerBoy 3 hours agorootparentprevWho knows. Maybe the browser would be a more prevalent gaming platform if it could be assumed that loading a multi gigabyte game engine is no big deal, because everyone had one already cached.

So maybe the author forgot to include the high performance request, or your OS does not give the high performance GPU by default (as it might be in eco mode). This behavior can be changed in OS settings. reply lastdong 3 hours agoparentprevI think neither. You need to configure windows to use the RTX with Chrome.

I briefly tried it out and the demo felt much better than the original WebLLM one! On a side note, i've been trying to do something similar too for similar reasons (privacy). Based on my recent experience, i find that running LLM directly in the browser with decent UX (e.g. sub 1-2 second response time, no lag, no crashes) is still somewhat impossible given the current state of things. Plus, i think that relying on users' own GPU hardware for UX improvement via WebGPU is not exactly very practical on a large scale (but it is still something!) since not everyone may have access to GPU hardware But yeah, if there's anything to look forward to in this space, i personally hope to see improved feasibility of running LLMs in browsers reply littlestymaar 4 hours agoprevThis is very cool, it's something I wish existed since Llama came out, having to install Ollama + Cuda to get locally working LLM didn't felt right to me when there's all what's needed in the browser. Llamafile solves the first half of the problem, but you still need to install Cuda/ROCm for it to work with GPU acceleration. WebGPU is the way to go if we want to put AI on consumer hardware and break the oligopoly, I just wished it became more broadly available (on Linux, no browser supports it yet) reply knowaveragejoe 10 hours agoprev [–] Is this downloading a ~5gb model to my machine and storing it locally for subsequent use? reply sp332 10 hours agoparentModels sizes are listed here https://github.com/abi/secret-llama but yeah, > 4GB for the Llama 3 model. reply abi 9 hours agoparentprev [–] Yes, it only starts the download after you send the first message so visiting the site won’t use up any space.

On the one hand they are easy to explain, they are just numbers that have no factors other than one and themselves, but on the other hand they contain endless complexity. They show up in numerous places, ranging from mathematical concepts and conjectures to interesting looking visualizations and cryptography, underpinning many internet standards and security protocols we use everyday. Despite my fascination with primes I never really explored them in detail. So, I thought I would challenge myself, and what better way to explore primes than to use my interest in coding to generate prime numbers! The Challenge But what kind of prime should I generate? Finding the one billionth prime is too easy, and getting on the leaderboard of the largest known primes is way beyond what I think I can achieve in my first attempt. Combining primes with my interest in cryptography I came up with this - Generate primes that are capable of generating keys for the RSA Algorithm As of the writing of this article a good length for RSA keys is 2048 bits. RSA keys are generated by the multiplication of two primes, so to get a 2048-bit key we need two roughly 1024-bit sized primes. That narrows down the challenge to generate 1024-bit primes and now you know why that's the size in the title. In addition to the challenge, I also set up some rules for myself: The code has to be written from scratch - otherwise you could just openssl prime -generate -bits 1024 and be done! \"from scratch\" here just means no external dependencies. No fancy external hardware or cloud - so you can't just throw additional computing power at the problem. I will use my laptop with an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU and 16gb RAM. Generate the primes in \"reasonable\" time - deliberately left vague so that I optimize a little but not get caught in a over-optimization spiral. For the language I picked Rust, mainly because I happened to be learning it recently and this challenge looked like it would be good practice. I feel Rust is low level enough to play around with deeper concepts while being high level enough that the code snippets are relatively easy to understand. I won't be using any of the more complex features of rust because I am not familiar with them yet. With all that out of the way, let's get started! 16 bits, the easy bit! My plan is to slowly build up to 1024 bits, so I started at 16 bits as a bit of a warm up. In theory, the process to generate any N-bit primes is easy - while true { let number = > if is_prime(number) { break } } Just keep generating new random N-bit numbers until one that passes the primality test is found. Even before I can tackle primality tests though I have my first hurdle, where do I get my random numbers from? Rust has an excellent crate (aka library/package) called rand that can almost be considered part of the standard library. But before I break my \"no dependencies\" rule right at the start I thought I should at least try to do it myself. I remember hearing about /dev/urandom from somewhere, and upon further research it turns out this would fit my use case perfectly. The Linux kernel has a built-in Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) which can be accessed by reading from the pseudo device file /dev/urandom. It collects entropy from the user's environment and uses it to periodically seed a deterministic stream cipher called ChaCha20 (fun name!), which can then generate some \"true\" random bits. I was hesitant to use this at first but a certain article convinced me otherwise. This is the implementation I came up with - // rng.rs use std::fs::File; use std::io::Read; fn insert_random_bytes(mut bytes: &mut[u8]) -> std::io::Result { File::open(\"/dev/urandom\")?.read_exact(&mut bytes)?; Ok(()) } fn u16() -> u16 { let mut bytes = [0u8; 2]; insert_random_bytes(&mut bytes).expect(\"Cannot access /dev/urandom\"); u16::from_le_bytes(bytes) } Note: expressions without a semicolon placed at the end of rust functions act as the function's return value. insert_random_bytes() takes in a mutable array of bytes as input and fills it with the output from /dev/urandom. The u16() function creates a buffer of 2 bytes (16 bits), fills the buffer with random bits and then creates a u16 integer from those bits, with u16 in rust representing an unsigned 16-bit integer. u16() is then used like this - fn run() { println!(\"random no - {}\", rng::u16()0b1000000000000001); } The random number returned is OR-ed with 0b1000000000000001 to set its first and last bit to 1. The last bit set to 1 makes it an odd number and the first bit set to 1 ensures that it is a sufficiently large number which covers the entire range of bits I need. Here's it generating a few 16-bit random numbers - random no - 36111 random no - 52205 random no - 45689 random no - 33631 Now that I have my very own random number generator let's quickly finish out 16-bit primes. First, a fancy enum to store our results - enum PrimeResult { Prime, Composite, } Then, a basic primality test called trial division to check if a number is prime. It loops from 3 to sqrt(num) and checks if any of them is a factor of num - fn trial_division_simple(n: u16) -> PrimeResult { let root_n = (n as f64).sqrt() as u16; for x in 3..root_n { if n % x == 0 { return PrimeResult::Composite; } } PrimeResult::Prime } And a basic loop to finish it off - fn run() { loop { let num = rng::u16()0b1000000000000001; if trial_division_simple(num) == PrimeResult::Prime { println!(\"Prime found: {num}\"); break; } } } ➜ time cargo run --release Prime found: 44809 cargo run --release 0.03s user 0.01s system 99% cpu 0.038 total This works nicely and on average takes ~40ms to generate 16-bit primes. To confirm that my primes are actually prime, I am using a cool online tester written in WebAssembly (hosted here) along with this OpenSSL command - openssl prime . With this, we have refreshed some basic concepts and warm up is done. Now it's time to move on to the next step! 64 bits, 4 times the bits! After 16 bits I jumped straight to 64-bit numbers. 64-bit architecture is common nowadays on most modern hardware and with 64 bits we are well into the 20 digit numbers range (for context, 1 trillion is 13 digits). Would the simple trial division algorithm be able to handle such large numbers? ➜ time cargo run --release Prime found: 14288847644715868907 cargo run --release 30.27s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 30.294 total It does, kinda. 30 seconds to generate a 64-bit prime does not look great but this is not trial division's full potential. In this section, I will try to push it to its limits. First, here's a more optimized version of trial division - fn trial_division(n: u64, start: u64) -> PrimeResult { // assumption: n > 3 and start > 3 let root_n = (n as f64).sqrt() as u64; for x in (start..(root_n + 1)).step_by(6) { if n % x == 0 || n % (x + 2) == 0 { return PrimeResult::Composite; } } PrimeResult::Prime } Changes: It also accepts a start parameter for where to start the loop from. The loop steps forward by 6 instead of 1. Check n % (x + 2) == 0 in addition to n % x == 0. Basically, it only considers factors between start and sqrt(n) that are of the form 6k+1, to quote Wikipedia - This is because all integers can be expressed as (6k+i), where i = −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Note that 2 divides (6k+0), (6k+2), and (6k+4) and 3 divides (6k+3). So, a more efficient method is to test whether n is divisible by 2 or 3, then to check through all numbers of the form 6k±1 ≤ √n. This is 3 times faster than testing all numbers up to √n. Next, a function to generate a list of small primes using this improved trial division - fn generate_small_primes() -> [u64; N] { let mut primes: [u64; N] = [0; N]; primes[0] = 2; primes[1] = 3; let mut n: u64 = 3; let mut nth: u64 = 2; let mut i: usize = 2; let limit = N as u64; loop { n += 2; if trial_division(n, 5) == PrimeResult::Prime { primes[i] = n; i += 1; nth += 1; if nth == limit { return primes } } } } Add another possible state to our result - enum PrimeResult { Prime, Composite, Unknown, // (); loop { let num = rng::u64()0x8000000000000001u64; let mut result = PrimeResult::Unknown; for i in 0..N { if num % primes[i] == 0 { result = PrimeResult::Composite; break; } } if result == PrimeResult::Unknown { result = algos::trial_division(num, start) } if result == PrimeResult::Prime { println!(\"Prime found: {num}\"); break; } } } After all that work, here's the result - ➜ time cargo run --release Prime found: 12589778476493955313 cargo run --release 6.40s user 0.01s system 99% cpu 6.414 total That's a nice improvement from the 30 seconds it took previously. There's still some optimization potential left on the table, but if it takes 6 seconds for just 64-bit numbers then it's clear that this cannot scale to 1024-bit numbers. With this, we have to leave behind the safe cozy lands of deterministic algorithms and enter the realm of uncertainty with probabilistic algorithms! 128 bits, with a bit of a twist! This is where things start to get interesting. At first, I found the concept of probabilistic primality tests strange and tried to look for deterministic algorithms that could handle huge numbers. I did find two - APR-CL and ECPP. Both of these are so mathematically complex that I could not make sense of their research papers at all, and there isn't much accessible information about them on the internet for someone like me who is bad at math. After taking a look at discussions online, OpenSSL's source code and recommendations by NIST, I realized that almost everyone including RSA uses probabilistic algorithms. The catch is that if implemented properly, these algorithms have an extremely low error rate which is negligible. From this point on all algorithms that show up will not \"prove\" that a number is prime, but will say that it is a \"probable prime\" with a certain accuracy. The first of these algorithms I explored was Fermat's Little Theorem. Fermat's Little Theorem This theorem by Fermat states: If p is prime and a is any integer not divisible by p, then the number ap-1 is divisible by p. The same thing can be expressed in modular arithmetic as: ap-1 = 1 (mod p) We can pick different values for a where asrc/lib.rs:71:2971println!(\"{}\", base.pow(num - 1);--- ^^^^^^^ expected `u32`, found `u128`|arguments to this function are incorrect It took me a minute to realize that this was not an error on my part. The pow() function intentionally takes in a u32, as raising u128 to any higher power would already overflow the u128! Fortunately, our relation above is in modular arithmetic which means we can take the modulus at each step instead of at the end keeping the result less than u128. basically, a × b (mod m) = [ a (mod m) × b (mod m) ] (mod m) and so - ap-1 (mod p) = ((((a × a (mod p)) × a (mod p)) × a (mod p)) × ...... p - 1 times ) The algorithm to implement this is called modular exponentiation. I implemented it by directly following the pseudocode from Wikipedia, using the version that implements \"exponentiation by squaring\" for a more efficient algorithm. Here goes attempt #2 - fn run() { let num = rng::u128()0x80000000000000000000000000000001u128; let base = rng::u128_range(2, num - 1); println!(\"{}\", mod_exp(base, num - 1, num)); } ➜ cargo run ... thread 'main' panicked at 'attempt to multiply with overflow', src/utils.rs:38:16 note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace Oh well. Another thing I didn't realize is that even the multiplication of two u128 can easily become too large for a u128 to store. Defeated for now, I decided to move ahead by storing only 64-bit numbers inside the u128s. Roughly speaking the most amount of space needed for multiplication of two N-bit numbers is 2N, hence the decision to store 64-bit numbers inside u128. This idea of allocating twice the amount of bits needed will show up later too. Interestingly, the previous 64-bit step with trial division had no multiplications which is why it did not run into this issue. Adding another possible state to the enum - enum PrimeResult { Prime, Composite, Unknown, ProbablePrime, //PrimeResult { for _ in 0..k { let base = rng::u128_range(2, num - 1); if mod_exp(base, num - 1, num) != 1 { return PrimeResult::Composite; } } PrimeResult::ProbablePrime; } An interesting implementation detail here, the function rng::u128_range() implies that it uniformly selects a random u128 from between 2 and num - 1 but I found it more practical to directly return a random number that's a few bytes shorter than num. This greatly simplifies the logic while still giving us a mostly random sufficiently large number between 2 and num - 1. Moving forward this trick will be used whenever random values from a range are needed. Here's the full test! - fn primes_128bit() -> u128 { loop { let num = (rng::u64()0x8000000000000001u64) as u128; if fermat_test(num, 10) == PrimeResult::ProbablePrime { return num; } } } ➜ time cargo run --release Prime found: 9944209443870115157 cargo run --release 0.03s user 0.01s system 99% cpu 0.033 total That's quite a bit faster than the ~6sec runs we were getting previously for 64 bits, but the fact that it uses a \"probable prime\" result might already tell you there's a catch. The flaw in Fermat's Little Theorem is - \"pseudoprimes\". The relation defined by Fermat's Little Theorem is true for all primes but is also additionally true for some composites. If the RNG generates one of these special composites, the code would say it is prime even when its not. These composites, also called \"Fermat Pseudoprimes\", are rare but still numerous enough that we cannot rely on the accuracy of Fermat's test. Miller-Rabin Primality Test The Miller-Rabin test is an improved probabilistic primality test that works on the same principles as Fermat's test, but is much stronger and more practical to use due to a few key differences. For one, in this test no composite number is a strong pseudoprime for all bases at the same time in contrast to Fermat's where such composites exist (called the Carmichael numbers). Miller-Rabin also has a substantially better error rate that can be called \"insignificant\" in most cases. In fact when looking around for what other people use, like OpenSSL's source code and recommendations by NIST mentioned at the start, many sources recommend or are already using Miller-Rabin! The math behind Miller-Rabin is not that important for implementing the algorithm itself, but nevertheless I will try to summarize what I understood. Feel free to skip it and jump directly to the code. The relation we looked at in Fermat's test was: an-1 = 1 (mod n), if n is prime (1) A more general form of an-1 can be written as a2s × d, where: d = An odd number left after factoring out all powers of 2 from n. s = The power of 2 as the factor of n. which implies: n - 1 = 2s × d (2) Combining (1) and (2), we can say n is a strong probable prime if one of these conditions is true: ad = 1 (mod n). a2r × d = n - 1 (mod n) for some 0PrimeResult { let mut s = 0; let mut d = n - 1; while d % 2 == 0 { d = d / 2; s += 1; } 'main_loop: for _ in 0..k { let base = rng::u128_range(2, n - 2); let mut x = utils::mod_exp(base, d, n); if x == 1 || x == n - 1 { continue 'main_loop; } for _ in 0..(s - 1) { x = utils::mod_exp(x, 2, n); if x == n - 1 { continue 'main_loop; } } return PrimeResult::Composite; } PrimeResult::ProbablePrime } The first while loop factors out powers of 2, converting n-1 to 2s × d. Then \"main_loop\" does all the tests mentioned above, squaring x (raising power by 2) and testing until it reaches 2s-1. And, the usual loop to find primes - fn primes_128bit() -> u128 { loop { let num = (rng::u64()0x8000000000000001u64) as u128; if miller_rabin_test(num, 10) == PrimeResult::ProbablePrime { return num; } } } ➜ time cargo run --release Prime found: 15333511742700010117 cargo run --release 0.03s user 0.01s system 99% cpu 0.042 total It is as fast as Fermat's test but what about the \"probable prime\" thing here? Miller-Rabin's worst case error is bound to 4-k, but for large values of n, the error on average is much smaller like 8-k. What's the chance that a Miller-Rabin test with k = 10 returns a composite? ➜ python3 -c \"print(f'chance of error = {8 ** -10 :.15f}%')\" chance of error = 0.000000000931323% That is good enough for me :). For context that probability is exactly the same as the probability of getting all heads in 30 consecutive coin tosses (2-30). In real cryptographic use you have to be a bit more cautious though in how the random bases are picked and assume adversarial conditions. Finally, we have a way to generate random numbers and we have a primality test that is fast and efficient enough to work on big numbers. The only things missing are the big numbers themselves, so let's venture even deeper... 1024 bits, A bit of a detour? At this point it is obvious that we cannot go further than 64 bits by just using rust's built-in integer datatypes. What we need is a \"bigint\", or an implementation of arbitrary precision arithmetic usually called \"bigint\" or \"bignum\" in most languages. The sensible thing to do would be to import a bigint crate for rust and be done, but I am the one who gave myself the constraint of no external dependencies so I am going to follow it. I guess it's time to build a BigInt :P \"Build a BigInt\" is not the answer to \"how to generate big primes?\", but there won't be any big primes (or composites for that matter) without a BigInt behind them, so we are going to take a bit of a detour and figure out how BigInt works. Attempt #1 - BigInt as digits After a quick skim of the Wikipedia page for arbitrary precision arithmetic and a brief research session, I found out there are a few ways to go about this. The easiest method was to store all the digits of your big number in an array and so that's what I tried for attempt #1. At first it starts out really simple. The number is represented as just a list of digits, so implementing addition and multiplication is also easy and I copied the basic pen and paper methods that we learn in middle school into code. Once I reached division I realized that this is not going to be that simple, and after a few failed attempts I gave up. If you want a challenge, pause and try to think how you might implement the pen and paper long division algorithm in code. Attempt #2 - BigInt as binary After my failed attempt #1, I thought - why not store the numbers in binary? Or more specifically, why not store the number as a list of 0s and 1s? And so began my second attempt. This was my very simple BigInt, just an array of bool values - const N: usize = 2048; struct BigInt { bits: [bool; N] } The actual size is 2048 instead of 1024 because as we saw earlier multiplying two N-bit numbers needs at most 2N bits of space. Next we need some arithmetic. I still remember a few fragments of my logic and microprocessor class from university so what I did was basically implement a Full Adder in code to handle addition and subtraction. This is what addition looked like - fn bigint_add(own: &[bool], other: &[bool]) -> [bool; N] { let mut bits = [false; N]; let mut carry = false; for (i, (d1, d2)) in own.iter().zip(other.iter()).enumerate() { bits[i] = d1 ^ d2 ^ carry; carry = (d1 & d2)(carry & (d1 ^ d2)); } if carry { panic!(\"Attempt to add with overflow\"); } bits } impl Add for BigInt { type Output = Self; fn add(self, other: Self) -> Self { Self { bits: bigint_add(&self.bits, &other.bits) } } } impl AddAssign for BigInt { fn add_assign(&mut self, other: Self) { self.bits = bigint_add(&self.bits, &other.bits); } } Note: Here I am using the Add and AddAssign traits from rust to override the + and += operators for my BigInt type and will do the same for all other operators too. Next I implemented the shift left (>) operators. These just shift the entire list of bits left or right by the given amount, throwing away any overflow. fn bigint_shl(own: &[bool], amount: usize) -> [bool; N] { let mut bits = [false; N]; if amount > N { return bits; } let mut i = amount; for bit in own.iter().take(N - amount) { bits[i] = *bit; i += 1; } bits } fn bigint_shr(own: &[bool], amount: usize) -> [bool; N] { let mut bits = [false; N]; if amount > N { return bits; } let mut i = 0; for bit in own.iter().skip(amount) { bits[i] = *bit; i += 1; } bits } Onward to multiplication. A really good thing about working in binary is that multiplication becomes very easy. Binary can only be 0 or 1, so no matter how long a number is, the only two results of its multiplication with a bit can be either 0 or itself. This reduces the classic multiplication algorithm to a much simpler one called \"shift-and-add\" and now it can use the newly implemented \"shift\" and \"add\" - fn bigint_mul(own: &[bool], other: &[bool]) -> [bool; N] { let mut result = BigInt::zero(); let n1 = BigInt::from(own); let mut current; for (shift, d2) in other.iter().enumerate() { if !(*d2) { continue; } for i in (N - shift)..N { if own[i] { panic!(\"Attempt to multiply with overflow\"); } } current = n1([bool; N], [bool; N]) { let mut quotient = BigInt::zero(); let mut dividend = BigInt::from(own_bits); let mut remainder = BigInt::zero(); let divisor = BigInt::from(other_bits); if divisor == BigInt::zero() { panic!(\"Attempt to divide by zero\"); } let mut no_of_bits = N; while !dividend.bits[N - 1] { dividend = divisor { remainder -= divisor; quotient.bits[0] = true; } } (quotient.bits, remainder.bits) } After doing some testing to confirm the arithmetic works as expected I switched over all u128s in miller_rabin_test() and mod_exp() over to my BigInt, changed the RNG to fill 1024 bits, and ran the code. It didn't finish in a few minutes and it was getting late at night, so I left it running and went to sleep. The next day I woke up to this - ➜ time cargo run --release Prime found: 1100001101000111101111110011001111000010011111010110100010101011111110100010001100001101110101100100100110011110101100001000110010100011100101001010100110010110001101110111001110100110000001010111100000110111100010010010100110101011101010100101000100111110000001100000000011101111010100100101001111111100010010000110101010101000101010000011011110111101100011000010111011010000110101100111001101011000000001000100011001011100100000011110011011000000101000010001010001010010001101111100110001000011100110111100000010100000011101011100101101110100010111110000110000010111110000110101001110100100110101011101100111000100010110101001101110100111100010000000110000001001011100100100101001110100101100110110001001101110010100011011011110111100010011111011101010100010111010110101101010011110010111100100110111010111100101111111110010100101010111100111010001010101011100001000100101001111110101100101011100100001101111000100000001111100001001001010100101101111010000101001111111010110111111011101010100111011100111100001010101011101 cargo run --release 1959.67s user 0.09s system 99% cpu 32:44.90 total Or expressed in base-10 - 137130462909417371581865483489043797725909059024661411704723085022816692663284008207826785132470756353352621332808019668785759110990576815741502628035997147255459016128105305451010585699069674494217365521467940783164171729442866016775055913991624626502191730619275815532321664270492537447637102633611801007453 This is the first 1024-bit prime number I found! I have solved the challenge! But there was just one small issue - the runtime counter showed that it took ~30mins to find that prime. Although technically I have solved the challenge and also understood how to do it, taking 30 minutes per prime is not what I would call \"reasonable time\" especially when OpenSSL takes 30ms to do the same thing! The \"reasonable time\" limitation was part of the constraints because I want to learn both the skill of making it work and making it efficient :). Attempt #3 - BigInt as bytes The binary implementation I came up with in attempt #2 was immensely valuable. Not only did it give me my first 1024-bit prime, it was also an implementation that was proven to work correctly and I can test any further changes against it. This helped a lot with speeding up my experimentation and gave me the confidence to try some of the more difficult things. When I started looking into why binary was so slow, the first thing I found was that in an array of bool, each bool would occupy a byte in memory and not a single bit as I thought it might. This stackoverflow answer has the reasons why. This meant my bool array of size 2048 was not using 2048 bits of memory as I had assumed, but 2048 bytes! That's 2kb of memory just to store a single number. My binary implementation was probably spending almost all of its time waiting to read or write numbers from RAM due to L1 cache misses. I did not know at the time how to actually test this, but I thought let's try a more memory efficient version anyway and see if it improves things. The natural path to follow would then be, why not store the bits as byte sized chunks instead of individual bits in a list. It could store all 2048 bits in an array of 256 bytes. Surprisingly, addition/subtraction and multiplication worked with this new format without any major changes to the algorithms. Instead of adding bit by bit and using an extra bit as carry, it would now add byte by byte using an extra byte as carry. I switched multiplication from \"shift-and-add\" back to the pen and paper algorithm I initially had for digits, but using bytes in place of 0-9 digits, and it worked without any modifications too. For division I added a few extra lines of code to treat the list of byte chunks as a single list of bits and the rest remained unchanged. With all these improvements, I got my second 1024-bit prime at 4min 43sec. Nice improvement over the original binary, but still not enough. Attempt #4 - BigInt as u64 chunks While doing more research on arbitrary precision arithmetic trying to find other ways to optimize I made an interesting discovery. There is a reason why my arithmetic algorithms in attempt #3 worked directly with bytes instead of bits. What I had unknowingly implemented was a digit based BigInt similar to what I tried in attempt #1, but using \"high radix\" digits. Attempt #1 used base-10 digits, 0 to 9, what us humans are comfortable with, but a computer can work in any base you want it to use. You've probably heard of base-16 (or hexadecimal) where the digits are 0-9 and A-F, or even base-64 which consists of all alphanumeric characters as the digits. My code from attempt #3 was effectively using base-255, with each byte acting as a single \"digit\". For example, here's the same number expressed in different bases - base-10: 3,095,627 (7 digits) base-16: 2F3C4B (6 digits) base-64: LzxL (4 digits) base-255: 00101111 00111100 01001011 (3 digits) (If you are wondering how I got the base-255 version, it is literally the binary representation of 3,095,627 split into 3 bytes.) The funny thing is, I had read about this multiple times and dismissed it each time as being \"too complex a concept for me to understand\", but after implementing it accidentally it finally clicked in my mind. Once I understood it the next logical thing to realize was that there's no reason for it to be limited to byte sized digits and I can push it as far as it would go. So here's what my latest BigInt looks like - const N: usize = 2048 / 64; struct BigInt { chunks: [u64; N] } It uses a array of 32 u64 chunks to store upto 2048 bits. As usual it goes to twice the size we need so it has enough room to store the multiplication result of 2 BigInts. Similarly, the highest it can go for each individual \"digit\" is u64 as it would need to use a u128 to store the multiplication result of two individual \"digits\". The rest of the code remained mostly unchanged from attempt #3 with a few small changes, like changing the carry variable to u64 instead of a byte. At this point, the BigInt is using base-(264-1) or base-18446744073709551615 (🤯) and it only needs 16 \"digits\" to represent a number that uses 309 digits in base-10! This now takes roughly 60-90 seconds to generate 1024-bit primes, which is a vast improvement over binary but still not fast enough. Attempt #5 - BigInt as u64 chunks, but better At this point I decided to run some simple benchmarks to try to find out what was slowing us down. Here's the results:binary u64 chunks a + b and a - b 5537.35ns 123.57ns a * b 1292283.14ns 842.32ns a / b and a % b 733446.76ns 44440.12ns a > b 276.85ns 140.88ns ab 2506.02ns 58.91ns (All times average of 1000 runs measured in nanoseconds) This shows the significant progress made since binary, and rest of attempt #5 is going to be a list of things I did to make it even faster. Division The biggest thing that jumps out from the benchmarks is: division. Even though everything else has improved a lot, division is still using the same algorithm that it used in binary, still doing long division a single bit at a time. I have always seen people complain about division being slow, now I know why. Division really is a harder problem to solve compared to addition or multiplication. I saw multiple articles and sources pointing to a book - Handbook of Applied Cryptography when looking for better algorithms. I found it on the Internet Archive, made an account, and borrowed it for 14 days. This is what I found on page 598: Page 598, Handbook of Applied Cryptography On the one hand it's talking about \"radix b representation\" and by now I had done enough to understand that it was referencing the same \"high radix digits\" concept I had discovered earlier. On the other hand I understood nothing else at all and the book doesn't make it any easier as it didn't include any text explaining this algorithm. After staring at this page for 3 days straight and numerous failed attempts, I managed to write a working implementation. What I understood is that it is doing long division on base-N numbers, using the first 3 \"digits\" of the dividend and the first 2 \"digits\" of the divisor to estimate the current quotient \"digit\" in a loop until it finds the correct value, but I am not comfortable enough with the math behind it yet to explain it here. I have also heard that a very similar algorithm appears in The Art of Computer Programming, but there was no easy way to quickly refer it other than buying a copy, which I would get around to doing eventually. Spending the effort to figure this out did pay off though, it saves about 40,000ns (40μs) per division, and there are quite a lot of division and modulus operations that happen for a single run of Miller-Rabin and 1000s of Miller-Rabin runs before a prime is found. An additional optimization I did was to check if the divisor is a single \"digit\" (a single u64 chunk) and then directly do long division using u128 to catch any overflows. This skips the costly algorithm entirely and is another one of those cases that frequently appear in Miller-Rabin. fn bigint_div(mut dividend: BigInt, mut divisor: BigInt) -> (BigInt, BigInt) { if divisor.is_zero() { panic!(\"Attempt to divide by zero\"); } if dividend > lambda)); } // step 2, align and then subtract y from x until x >= aligned let mut aligned = divisor.clone(); for _ in 0..(n - t) { aligned = aligned { quotient.chunks[n - t] += 1; dividend -= aligned; } let one = BigInt::from(1); let mut x_3digit; let mut y_2digit; let mut q_u128; let mut q_digit; // step 3 for i in ((t + 1)..=n).rev() { q_digit = BigInt::zero(); // step 3.1 if dividend.chunks[i] == divisor.chunks[t] { q_digit.chunks[0] = u64::MAX - 1; } else { q_u128 = (dividend.chunks[i] as u128)x_3digit { q_digit -= one; } // move quotient \"digit\" from temp bigint to its place in quotient quotient.chunks[i - t - 1] = q_digit.chunks[0]; // precalc shifted y let mut y_shifted = divisor.clone(); for _ in 0..(i - t - 1) { y_shifted = q_digit * y_shifted { dividend -= q_digit * y_shifted; } else { dividend += y_shifted; dividend -= q_digit * y_shifted; quotient.chunks[i - t - 1] -= 1; } } // rewind shifts by lambda to get actual remainder dividend >>= lambda; (quotient, dividend) } Multiplication Next I looked at multiplication, the second biggest thing in the benchmarks. I had implemented essentially the same algorithm as the book, so no gains there. Rearranging the loop calculations cleverly to eliminate an extra BigInt I was using to store the intermediate results gave a 2x improvement to runtime. Since I had already added a function to calculate the size (number of occupied chunks) for division, I used the same function here to only run the loops for non-zero chunks and also added extra checks to skip loop iteration if one of the chunks is zero. Although this adds complexity and branching inside the loops, it still helps improve performance as most of the time BigInt is supposed to store 1024 bits or less and thus be half empty. This gave another 2x improvement. I could have gone to the Karatsuba algorithm or even fast Fourier transforms (FFT) which theoretically would give even better performance, but actually implementing it for a BigInt that I am building myself was too complex and my current multiplication was now fast enough that I did not pursue this path. fn bigint_mul(own: BigInt, other: BigInt) -> BigInt { let mut result = BigInt::zero(); let mut intermediate; let mut carry; let t = own.size(); let n = other.size(); if t + n + 1 >= N { panic!(\"Attempt to multiply with overflow\"); } for (j, chunk2) in other.chunks.iter().take(n + 1).enumerate() { if *chunk2 == 0 { continue; } carry = 0; for (i, chunk1) in own.chunks.iter().take(t + 1).enumerate() { if *chunk1 == 0 && carry == 0 { continue; } intermediate = ((*chunk1 as u128) * (*chunk2 as u128)) + carry; intermediate += result.chunks[i + j] as u128; result.chunks[i + j] = intermediate as u64; carry = intermediate >> 64; } result.chunks[t + j + 1] += carry as u64; } result } Addition and Subtraction These are already super fast, I was surprised to see even my custom implementation already runs relatively close to the time it takes rust to add two native u128. I tried a few things but (as expected) I was not as clever as the compiler and whatever magic it does under the hood. fn bigint_add(own: BigInt, other: BigInt) -> BigInt { let mut sum; let mut carry = 0; let mut sum_overflow; let mut carry_overflow; let mut result = BigInt::zero(); let own_iter = own.chunks.iter(); let other_iter = other.chunks.iter(); for (i, (chunk1, chunk2)) in own_iter.zip(other_iter).enumerate() { (sum, sum_overflow) = chunk1.overflowing_add(*chunk2); (sum, carry_overflow) = sum.overflowing_add(carry); result.chunks[i] = sum; carry = sum_overflow as u64 + carry_overflow as u64; } if carry != 0 { panic!(\"Attempt to add with overflow\"); } result } Miller-Rabin There were a bunch of optimizations that I found I could do in my implementation of Miller-Rabin. Here's what it looked like initially - 1fn miller_rabin_test(n: BigInt, k: usize) -> PrimeResult { 2 let zero = BigInt::zero(); 3 let one = BigInt::from(1); 4 let two = BigInt::from(2); 5 6 let mut s = zero; 7 let mut d = n - one; 8 while d % two == zero { 9 d = d / two; 10 s += one; 11 } 12 13 'main_loop: for _ in 0..k { 14 let base = >; 15 let mut x = mod_exp(base, d, n); 16 if x == one || x == n - one { continue 'main_loop; } 17 18 while s > zero { 19 x = mod_exp(x, two, n); 20 if x == n - one { continue 'main_loop; } 21 s -= one; 22 } 23 return PrimeResult::Composite; 24 } 25 26 PrimeResult::ProbablePrime 27} And here some of the major optimizations I did: The mod_exp() call on line 19 is no longer required as BigInt has enough memory to do x = (x * x) % n directly. On line 15 mod_exp() was replaced by an simplified inline version which saved a lot of function call overhead. The BigInt representation of \"2\" on line 4 was created just to do the even check on line 8. I wrote a simple num.is_even() function that only needs to check if the last bit is 0 or 1, and so removed a bunch of extra costly divisions and an extra BigInt allocation. Similarly, the division on line 9 can be replaced with a d >>= 1 shift operation. In this case replacing another bunch of costly divisions with shifts is actually very beneficial compared to native code where this change is usually not worth it. There are a lot of += one and -= one (where one is BigInt representation of \"1\"), I added special num.increase() and num.decrease() which for almost all cases would just do a u64 addition/subtraction on the last \"digit\", and only go to the full BigInt addition/subtraction if the last \"digit\" was either 0 or u64::max, meaning the rare cases where it actually needs the BigInt to handle the overflow from adding or subtracting 1. All of these and other changes not listed above individually account for just microseconds or even nanoseconds of advantage, but when they are run multiple times inside a loop inside thousands of Miller-Rabin tests it all adds up to a nice improvement in runtime. At least that is what I thought before I benchmarked them, and is_even() plus d >>=1 easily outclass everything else give a whopping 70,000ns advantage each! Here's the final improved Miller-Rabin - fn miller_rabin_test(n: BigInt, k: usize) -> PrimeResult { let zero = BigInt::zero(); let one = BigInt::from(1); let n_minus_1 = n.decrease(); let mut d = n_minus_1; let mut s = zero; while d.is_even() { d >>= 1; s = s.increase(); } let mut bytes = [0; (1024 / 16)]; let mut x; let mut base; 'main_loop: for _ in 0..k { rng::insert_random_bytes(&mut bytes).unwrap(); base = BigInt::from(bytes.as_slice()); x = one; while !d.is_zero() { if !d.is_even() { x = (x * base) % n; } d = d >> 1; base = (base * base) % n; } if x == one || x == n_minus_1 { continue 'main_loop; } while !s.is_zero() { x = (x * x) % n; if x == n_minus_1 { continue 'main_loop; } s = s.decrease(); } return PrimeResult::Composite; } PrimeResult::ProbablePrime } Primality testing logic I modified the logic for testing primes with changes inspired by step 2 (64-bit primes) to add an additional trial division check at the start, using a precomputed list of the first 5000 small primes. This was infeasible for the majority of the time I was working on BigInt as trial division uses a lot of divisions, which were extremely slow. The trick to make it work is that all first 5000 small primes are small enough that they fit inside a single \"digit\" (a single u64 chunk). This means all divisions inside trial division would fall into the special case I just added, where it can perform the entire division using long division and u128 and skip the costly BigInt division algorithm. The same trial division function can also be used to generate the initial list of the first 5000 small primes. Optimizing trial division at step 2 did have some use after all! Another change to the logic is that instead of reading /dev/urandom for each iteration of the loop and generating a new random number to test, it just adds 2 to the first random number to get the next candidate. Since the last bit is modified to be 1 we know it's an odd number, which means adding 2 would take it to the next odd number. This can be further optimized by adding a dedicated function num.increase_by_2() which like num.increase() will only do the full BigInt addition for the overflow case, and otherwise would just do a u64 addition. And finally, this is one of those problems that can be called \"embarrassingly parallel\" because there is no shared memory and no need to have any synchronization between threads. Instead of asking one CPU thread to find primes why not ask all 16 CPU threads and the fastest one wins! - - - Here are the same benchmarks after these optimizations:binary u64 chunks u64 chunks but better a + b and a - b 5537.35ns 123.57ns 123.62ns a * b 1292283.14ns 842.32ns 295.04ns a / b and a % b 733446.76ns 44440.12ns 831.77ns a > b 276.85ns 140.88ns 126.04ns ab 2506.02ns 58.91ns 58.50ns a / 2 (or aBigInt { const P: usize = 1000; let primes = utils::generate_small_primes::(); let zero = BigInt::zero(); let mut small_prime = BigInt::zero(); let mut bytes = [0u8; 1024 / 8]; rng::insert_random_bytes(&mut bytes).expect(\"Cannot access /dev/urandom\"); let mut num = BigInt::from(bytes.as_slice()) num.chunks[(1024 / 64) - 1] |= 0x8000000000000000u64; num.chunks[0] |= 1; 'prime_loop: loop { num = num.increase_by_2(); for i in 0..P { small_prime.chunks[0] = primes[i]; if num % small_prime == zero { continue 'prime_loop; } } if miller_rabin_test(num, 10) == PrimeResult::ProbablePrime { return num; } } } Call the above function in parallel threads - fn run() { let (tx, rx) = std::sync::mpsc::channel(); for _ in 0..16 { let thread_tx = tx.clone(); std::thread::spawn(move || { thread_tx.send(primes_1024bit()).unwrap(); }); } let prime = rx.recv().unwrap(); prime.print_decimal(); } And here are the results! - ➜ time cargo run --release 133639768604208228777408136159783586754136713880762782100572086187859339703910900715674773943439684405153138260262492990850200027881950953138966616704637409705491165541761840874200485820151419486204300434469857557841532664407934654743999891926036532834796558113864177048787433702650711105375897281079281724197 cargo run --release 0.58s user 0.01s system 690% cpu 0.086 total I can finally say - challenge solved! It takes on average 40ms to find a 1024-bit prime.

It forced me out of my comfort zone and pushed me to learn so many new things, both about programming and how to tackle new topics and do research. There are still tons of things and ideas left on my todo list for improvements I can make and things I could have done better, but I have to save at least some energy for my next project :D.

It turns out that ~8 years ago, a really fast primality test implementation could make you a lot of money. (For some period of time I was the author and maintainer of mining software for riecoin.

This article omits the number one optimization for fast primality testing: Montgomery multiplication https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_modular_multiplic... It forms the basis of fast practical modular exponentiation implementations. Niall Emmart, then in academia and now I believe at Nvidia, released a really, spectacularly fast GPU bigint library, CGBN: https://github.com/NVlabs/CGBN It's still the fastest batch modexp implentation that I'm aware of. It's breathtaking, if I can gush in geek for a moment. (Someday I should write up the story of how that helped me dominate production of a small cryptocurrency for about 5 years. Thanks, Niall - owe you a beer if we ever cross paths!) Also worth noting that python includes an entirely fine modexp in the three-argument form of pow(x, y, m) --> compute x^y % m With that, you can very easily implement a fermat or miller-rabin primality test if you want to roll your own, which is quite fun. If you don't, the gmp library provides a very nice mpz_probab_prime() function. Gmp is obviously faster, but it's hard to beat the fun of a two liner fermat test for playing with big primes. reply kwantam 9 hours agoparentGreat stuff dga :) Turns out, Niall was also involved in one of the winning ZPrize submissions for fast multi-scalar multiplication (closely related to batch modexp, although over an elliptic curve rather than mod a prime); I assume it inherits from his work on CGBN.

This is from a very ugly little toy implementation of RSA I wrote a long time ago: https://github.com/jcalvinowens/toy-rsa I found I could get away with the Fermat test, because the algorithm doesn't work if the primes aren't actually prime: the Fermat test is fast, and an encrypt/decrypt eliminates the extremely minuscule chance either prime is a fermat liar.

If someone preferred more randomness in place of speed it's an easy change to replace the +=2 with a rng() call. reply adgjlsfhk1 8 hours agorootparentIMO you really shouldn't be bottle-necked by random number generation speed. If the kernel calls are what's slowing you down, you could use a strong user space PRNG (e.g. aes based) that is seeded with urandom. The other approach that would be not perfect but a lot better would be to re-randomize the lower 64 or 128 bits each time. That would cut down your rng requirements by a factor of ~10 while keeping much better uniformity since your jumps would be random and much bigger than the gap between primes. reply TheDudeMan 7 hours agorootparentprevAnother option is to do N sequential candidate tests for each fresh random candidate. Where N is something that gets you most of the speed advantage of doing all sequential tests. Maybe like N=16. Nice write-up! reply dullcrisp 11 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think the parallelism really helps with this; you’ll still never find the second of two twin primes for instance. Are there any easy ways to mitigate this though? What about say adding 2^64 at each step instead of 2? reply glitchcomet 10 hours agorootparentThat's an interesting idea. I don't know enough to say if using a large offset would be enough to mitigate the downsides of +=2, i would have to read more about it. In actual use you can go directly to using random candidates for each test as a few extra seconds to generate 2 primes would be worth the benefits. In hindsight my simplistic rng() can also probably be better optimized (batch load random bits and cache) to make it faster as the slowdown primarily comes from repeated filesystem access. reply dullcrisp 9 hours agorootparentI guess so long as your increment is constant there are primes you’re never going to find. If a prime happens to be 2^64 from another prime you’ll still never see it with my approach. Probably the most reasonable thing to do would be to use a Mersenne twister or other PRNG to generate a stream of random bytes. Would be plenty fast and should hopefully have no relevant pattern. No reason you should need real randomness from the OS after the initial seed. reply aaplok 9 hours agoprevNice article, and nicely written. > My code from attempt #3 was effectively using base-255, with each byte acting as a single \"digit\". I think the author means base-256, not base-255. reply shanurrahman 2 hours agoprevThat was an excellent article. Particularly enjoyed the iterative improvements throughout. It clearly shows the significant performance boost that can be achieved through good engineering and optimization. reply AceJohnny2 7 hours agoprevThis sends me back. My first-year college project, a few decades ago, was to implement 4096-bit RSA encryption, the idea of my project-mate and friend (and later valedectorian) who implemented the core math. I recall how slow prime number generation was in our final implementation, taking ~20 minutes to generate on PA-RISC workstations. My friend, a math nerd, took it upon themselves to continue optimizing the code long after the project was over. I remember them reading papers on prime number detection, and bignum math implementations. For example, one huge improvement came when the code would detect if a number in a component multiplication was 0, then skip the multiplication and give a 0 result! reply kevin_thibedeau 6 hours agoparentOn slow hardware you're much better off generating elliptic curve keys. Otherwise you wait a long time or compromise on future proof security. reply opticfluorine 13 hours agoprev> The random number returned is OR-ed with 0b1000000000000001 to set its first and last bit to 1. The last bit set to 1 makes it an odd number and the first bit set to 1 ensures that it is a sufficiently large number which covers the entire range of bits I need. I can understand setting the low bit to 1 since an even number will never be a prime (edit: obviously except 2). But why set the high bit to 1 as well? Admittedly I don't know much about prime numbers or crypto, but it seems to me like this is just giving up a bit of entropy unnecessarily. What am I missing here? reply toast0 8 hours agoparentAnother factor is if your high bit is always set, and you encode the prime with that bit, your prime always takes the same number of byte to encode. Variable byte encoding can lead to problems, if you need to exchange the data between different software, unless the specifications are very clear, and well tested. (See problems with RSA based DHE if the server public key has leading zeros) reply glitchcomet 12 hours agoparentprevAs the other comments have mentioned, by setting the first bit to one it looses a bit of entropy but ensures that the prime is large enough. Another thing to add is that in RSA two primes are multiplied together. If one of them is 1024 bits the other can be ~200 bits (if i remember correctly) and still reach the required number of entropy bits for the key. So, having both primes be 1024-bit adds a bit of wiggle room too. reply kadoban 13 hours agoparentprevYou are giving up a bit of entropy, yeah, but you still have 1022, it's probably safer than wondering if a 1020 bit prime is fine even if they asked for a 1024 bit one. Eg we usually don't consider 00042 a 5-digit number. Technically probably depends on exactly what you're using it for which choice is optimal, but I'd think the one in the article is the safer default. reply lordnacho 13 hours agoparentprevSame as generating a 2 digit number. If the first digit is a zero, it is not a 2 digit number. reply opticfluorine 13 hours agorootparentFor the purposes of key generation, however, wouldn't you want the full n bits of entropy? Otherwise the search space for a brute force factorization (haha right) is 2^(n-1) instead of 2^n, or half as many possibilities. The domain of the product is still [0..2^(2n)] so the resulting key is the desired 2^(2n) bits. I guess another way to pose my question would be: is there an issue with sampling the entire 2^n space that makes us only take the highest 2^(n-1) subset of integers instead when selecting factors for a key? reply adgjlsfhk1 13 hours agorootparentyou want the nth bit to be set because otherwise there is a small but noticable chance that you generate a surprisingly weak prime. reply opticfluorine 13 hours agorootparentOut of curiosity, if it is known that the nth bit is set, don't I also have the same risk but in (n-1) bits? Genuinely curious here. Edit: Ah, nevermind, I see now why I don't have that issue. It's because I can't easily iterate the primes in that domain even though I can iterate the reduced number of bits. Thanks! reply bobbylarrybobby 13 hours agoparentprevLosing one bit of entropy to generate a prime that's definitely not only 50 bits long seems like a worthy tradeoff. reply Dylan16807 7 hours agoprev> My binary implementation was probably spending almost all of its time waiting to read or write numbers from RAM due to L1 cache misses. I did not know at the time how to actually test this, but I thought let's try a more memory efficient version anyway and see if it improves things. The text never comes back to this, but the answer is that a handful of 1-2KB numbers fit into L1 just fine, and even if they didn't there's a megabyte or more of L2 that takes about 3ns to access. > It goes without saying that probably none of this is actually cryptographically secure, but that was never the point anyway. Hmm. This is just the prime generation, so it avoids most RSA pitfalls, and urandom had better be secure. So if this code works at all then there's not much that could go wrong. RSA has a few issues with weak primes to avoid but I don't know if they're likely enough to matter here. reply pclmulqdq 8 hours agoprevOne quick thing to add to this: /dev/urandom does not generate \"true\" random numbers. TRNGs generate 1 bit out per bit of entropy they collect from the environment, while /dev/urandom will not stop generating random bits when it runs out of entropy. That makes it a CSPRNG that is seeded by a TRNG. For all practical purposes, a CSPRNG seeded by a TRNG is almost as good as a TRNG, but it isn't quite the same. Linux used to recommend /dev/random which actually was a TRNG (although its entropy collection would sometimes overestimate how much entropy it got, particularly on servers), but it wasn't practical to use as your primary cryptographic RNG because it was very slow. reply Jerrrry 5 hours agoparentpedantic trivia that everyone here knows. fyi.

(bsky.app)168 points by MiguelX413 12 hours agohidepastfavorite87 comments Animats 11 hours agoDiscord hasn't yet obtained approval for their contract from the American Arbitration Association. They're not on the list.[1] Until a company gets on that list, which has a fee, the AAA will refuse to run arbitrations involving contracts specifying AAA arbitration. The AAA does this to prevent companies from adding additional unfavorable terms to arbitration agreements. At least Discord specified AAA arbitration. They're considered legitimate. There are arbitration services that are much worse. One is a front for a debt collection company. [1] https://apps.adr.org/ClauseRegistryUI/faces/org/adr/extapps/... reply j-bos 8 hours agoparentSeems they can register at the last minute: >If a business has not registered its consumer clause prior to the filing of a consumer case, the AAA will require that the business registers its clause at that time. I reply Animats 6 hours agorootparentRight. Not being on that list, though, indicates that nobody actually went to arbitration rather than going to small claims court. Small claims court is always an option with AAA arbitration. Either party can take that route. reply chatmasta 6 hours agoparentprevI’m sure Discord spends more money on lawyers than I do, so I’ll take any edge I can get. reply lolinder 9 hours agoprevThis feels like a giant waste of energy that could be put into better causes.

Yes indeed, but resistance against unfairness is not like a coin purse; it is like a muscle. When exercised, it seems like it increases its capacity. reply lolinder 6 hours agorootparentMy sense looking at the last few years is that resistance is more like a habit than a muscle. It's not that your capability to resist gets stronger each time, it's that it becomes a reflex. The upside to having the reflex is that you stand up against unfairness more often. The downside is that it becomes a simple response to a stimulus rather than a conscious choice, which means you end up constantly caught up in the cause du jour without ever stopping to think about whether this particular case warrants your limited time or even whether it's actually a case of true unfairness. reply misswaterfairy 5 hours agoprevIf you're looking for an open-source, self-hostable, end-to-end encrypted Discord alternative, check out Spacebar.

Archived version of ToS from may 2020: https://discord.com/terms/terms-of-service-may-2020 reply jkaplowitz 12 hours agoparentIt is new again, actually - if you opted out previously, you have to opt out again to stay opted out, according to the wording of the new terms. One opt out per Discord account, if you have multiple, in each case within 30 days of registering that account or of April 15, 2024, whichever is later. This provision does not make reference to the first time you accepted a version of these terms with an arbitration clause, or a similar phrase that would obviate the need for a new opt-out. On the plus side, if you didn’t opt out before, you get a new opportunity to opt out, which according to the new terms will remove all disputes that have not yet been filed from the scope of previous arbitration agreements with Discord. Since the clause only applies if you are a US resident, it’s very unclear how that opt-out deadline applies to existing Discord accounts for people who relocate into the US after the deadline. The conservative approach is to opt out wherever in the world you live, in case you later move to the US. reply malka 11 hours agorootparentThanks for the info. Just in case, I setup a script to send a daily mail to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com reply jkaplowitz 10 hours agorootparentRisky … if it’s automated, they could argue that you’re not actually making a conscious decision and/or not actually doing it yourself, claiming that it doesn’t apply or isn’t an unambiguous indication of your intent to knowingly opt out of whatever the next revision of the arbitration clause may be.

I understand discord desires it because it helps prevent rulings becoming case law. But I am going through forced arbitration right now in a personal lawsuit, and part of it is bleeding to a third party that does not arbitrate, which means real court. By all accounts I have been assured by my lawyer we are in a better position pursuing arbitration over litigation. Both seem to be quite expensive options, though fortunately there is a clause for legal fees to the prevailing side (and in my case evidence in my favor is airtight). Any enlightenment would be wonderful. reply ncallaway 10 hours agoparentForced arbitration reduced your options. You can agree to arbitration if both parties desire it when a dispute arises. One of the biggest consumer protections that a forced arbitration clause can kill is a class action lawsuit. If a corporation harms each consumer for $.30, there’s no real way to bring an individualized case over that. A class action is a viable option to hold the corporation to account. reply appplication 10 hours agorootparentThat makes sense, thanks for the context. Though, I’ve been a part of maybe 10 class actions in my life so far, and all of them amounted to less than $50 each. I suppose they are more effectively punitive to the corp than compensatory to the aggrieved. reply eadler 10 hours agoparentprevI wrote this to explain the problem https://arbitrationinformation.org/docs/problems/ reply juped 9 hours agoparentprevCompanies mostly want it because it's a lot cheaper to do discovery in an arbitration, actually. Some kind of unfavorable precedent is extreme tail risk because no matter what you're almost certainly going to settle, that isn't really a factor in legal department decisions. But real civil discovery is an extremely lengthy and expensive process. reply olliej 2 hours agorootparentNo they want it because it stops class action lawsuits, arbitration is notorious for being biased in favor of the companies that pay them, and it removes your access to a jury trial (eg one where the judge is not being paid by your opponent). The claim businesses make is that it is more efficient than court for people, but if that were actually the case then they would not need to constantly try to add forced arbitration. Forced arbitration is only a win for the business, and the entire intent is to make it so that the amount of harm they have to do before it is worth anyone suing them has to be measured in thousands of dollars for any person. The only way corporations are held to account for the majority of their crime is through increasingly impossible class action lawsuits. reply teeray 12 hours agoprevIt really would be nice for some legislation to restore access to the justice system. reply jkaplowitz 11 hours agoparentSuch legislation has gotten proposed in every session of Congress in recent years.

I don't have a problem with binding arbitration if parties with equal leverage agree to it, but it should be flat out illegal to require it as terms of employment or part of ToS. reply hakfoo 7 hours agorootparentModern civil law seems to revolve around this quaint fiction of contracts being some sort of \"meeting of the minds\" of relatively equally resourced parties. This might have been viable in 1795, but it feels ill suited to a world where we have billion dollar firms, legal staff on retainer, and contracts that have been revised like a codebase... versus consumers with no formal legal training. Even if there wasn't an inherent inequality of field, the high cost of litigation also encourages a tendency to ask for the unreasonable. The people presenting the contract know there's probably not enough money in it for anyone but the wealthy and begrudged to try to challenge the contract, so there's little risk to asking for more permissions, less liability, and tighter binding on the consumer. In the worst case, the cost serves as an effective bludgeon for abusive behaviour: they'll go along because they can't afford to get a favourable judgement. I dream of a world where there's no surprises in contracts-- basically there'd be a book of standard contracts filled out in a Mad Lib fashion. This would collapse a lot of the possibilities courts would have to deal with, resulting in a faster, predictable, almost deterministic legal system. If someone actually wanted to bring out a new clause, it would have to go through a highly-visible, paperwork-intensive vetting and discussion process. The Discords of the world then have to face very public scrutiny of their actions and motives: what makes your needs so special that they can't be dealt with using the standard contract for data services? reply koolba 10 hours agorootparentprev> … or part of ToS. Let’s forget employment for a sec and just look at a product’s terms. Why can’t you just not use the product? “It’s popular” is hardly an excuse for something new if you’re picking the platform.

And again, consumers can vote with their feet by only agreeing to terms that are understandable. reply noodlesUK 10 hours agorootparentCountries regularly legislate and regulate against various forms of unfair terms in contracts, ranging from the deceptive and absurd to fairly mundane things. You can’t enter into contracts requiring illegal behaviour for instance. This is true in the U.S. and all other countries that I’m aware of. In the UK and other European countries, particularly regarding consumer goods or other kinds of contracts with an inherent asymmetry of negotiating power, there are lots of things you can’t agree in contracts, such as disclaiming general fitness for purpose and safety. Deciding that you can’t agree away your rights to redress through the judicial system seems like a reasonable extension of these kinds of rules. reply handoflixue 9 hours agorootparentprev> In my personal experience, it’s worked out fine.

    "originBody": "lock it down — Microsoft ties executive pay to security following multiple failures and breaches Microsoft has been criticized for \"preventable\" failures and poor communication. Andrew Cunningham - 5/3/2024, 8:25 PM Enlarge / A PC running Windows 11. Microsoft reader comments 54 It's been a bad couple of years for Microsoft's security and privacy efforts. Misconfigured endpoints, rogue security certificates, and weak passwords have all caused or risked the exposure of sensitive data, and Microsoft has been criticized by security researchers, US lawmakers, and regulatory agencies for how it has responded to and disclosed these threats. Further Reading Microsoft blamed for “a cascade of security failures” in Exchange breach report The most high-profile of these breaches involved a China-based hacking group named Storm-0558, which breached Microsoft's Azure service and collected data for over a month in mid-2023 before being discovered and driven out. After months of ambiguity, Microsoft disclosed that a series of security failures gave Storm-0558 access to an engineer's account, which allowed Storm-0558 to collect data from 25 of Microsoft's Azure customers, including US federal agencies. In January, Microsoft disclosed that it had been breached again, this time by Russian state-sponsored hacking group Midnight Blizzard. The group was able \"to compromise a legacy non-production test tenant account\" to gain access to Microsoft's systems for \"as long as two months.\" All of this culminated in a report (PDF) from the US Cyber Safety Review Board, which castigated Microsoft for its \"inadequate\" security culture, its \"inaccurate public statements,\" and its response to \"preventable\" security breaches. To attempt to turn things around, Microsoft announced something it called the \"Secure Future Initiative\" in November 2023. As part of that initiative, Microsoft today announced a series of plans and changes to its security practices, including a few changes that have already been made. \"We are making security our top priority at Microsoft, above all else—over all other features,\" wrote Microsoft Security Executive Vice President Charlie Bell. \"We’re expanding the scope of SFI, integrating the recent recommendations from the CSRB as well as our learnings from Midnight Blizzard to ensure that our cybersecurity approach remains robust and adaptive to the evolving threat landscape.\" Advertisement As part of these changes, Microsoft will also make its Senior Leadership Team's pay partially dependent on whether the company is \"meeting our security plans and milestones,\" though Bell didn't specify how much executive pay would be dependent on meeting those security goals. Microsoft's post describes three security principles (\"secure by design,\" \"secure by default,\" and \"secure operations\") and six \"security pillars\" meant to address different weaknesses in Microsoft's systems and development practices. The company says it plans to secure 100 percent of all its user accounts with \"securely managed, phishing-resistant multifactor authentication,\" enforce least-privilege access across all applications and user accounts, improve network monitoring and isolation, and retain all system security logs for at least two years, among other promises. Microsoft is also planning to put new deputy Chief Information Security Officers on different engineering teams to track their progress and report back to the executive team and board of directors. As for concrete fixes that Microsoft has already implemented, Bell writes that Microsoft has \"implemented automatic enforcement of multifactor authentication by default across more than 1 million Microsoft Entra ID tenants within Microsoft,\" removed 730,000 old and/or insecure apps \"to date across production and corporate tenants,\" expanded its security logging, and adopted the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standard for its security disclosures. In addition to Bell's public security promises, The Verge has obtained and published an internal memo from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella that re-emphasizes the company's publicly stated commitment to security. Nadella also says that improving security should be prioritized over adding new features, something that may affect the constant stream of tweaks and changes that Microsoft releases for Windows 11 and other software. \"The recent findings by the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) regarding the Storm-0558 cyberattack, from summer 2023, underscore the severity of the threats facing our company and our customers, as well as our responsibility to defend against these increasingly sophisticated threat actors,\" writes Nadella. \"If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security. In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems.\" reader comments 54 Andrew Cunningham Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

All of FAANG use discriminatory quotas behind the scenes for promotion and hiring, and often the lower level employees have no idea because these actions are done quietly by individuals or only discussed in verbal meetings to leave no records. Individuals make decisions that are discriminatory because rewards for them (senior managers and executives) are based on quotas (diversity goals). For example, in a few of these companies you aren’t eligible for a senior promotion unless your team has certain minimums on protected traits. reply stainablesteel 9 hours agorootparentprevyeah its super racist and illegal and somehow these companies keep doing it the ceo of ibm was on camera saying things exactly like this to everyone in the meeting, no idea where they get these ideas from reply greenthrow 8 hours agorootparentIf they were really doing racist and illegal things they'd be getting sued.

Speak to any higher level manager at big tech companies and you’ll hear the truth about various hiring and promotion programs that these companies never put in writing or talk about publicly. The reason these companies don’t get sued is those individuals are afraid of social and professional retaliation that may affect their careers, even though they’re on the right side of history. reply lcvw 10 hours agoparentprevThat seems highly illegal.

Even the article they link doesn’t say that, and mentions multiple times that there were no quotas. The most it says is “it seemed it would make HR happy” which as an interviewer I don’t know why I would give a shit about. Other than asks to throw another random candidate in the loop, which happens all the time for all sort of reasons, there is no more “push” because yeah that would be illegal. If you think that an increase from 6.5% to 7% in Hispanic employees or from 28.6% to 29.7% in women is all driven by requiring exec approval for straight white men, then you’re delusional. reply mikestew 10 hours agorootparentprevYou don’t have to believe, I read the whole goddamned linked “article”, and parent misrepresented even that.

They got other stuff from the link wrong, too. reply ein0p 9 hours agorootparentStraight white males are the only “non-diverse” demographic. So they aren’t mentioned specifically in diversity quotas, of course. But if you hire too many of them, you can kiss some part of your bonus goodbye on account of not meeting quotas.

None of this is sold as “we discriminate against white men” - too crude. Instead it’s “we hire more women and minorities”. Same thing, but sounds admirable. Note that I’m not necessarily tying years of hardcore DEI quota hiring per se to their recent failures. For all I know the two things might be unrelated. I’m just saying they already tie exec compensation to all sorts of other things some of which might conflict with one another. reply greenthrow 8 hours agorootparentDEI is not the same thing as \"you can't hire straight, cis white men without explicit approval.\" A policy like that is illegal. The fact that you would conflate them tells me you don't know what DEI actually is, and are just repeating right wing talking points. reply ein0p 7 hours agorootparentYes. And you only need approval if you aren’t already meeting the quotas. I know what DEI is. It’s discrimination reply greenthrow 7 hours agorootparentRequiring approval to hire someone due to any protected characteristic is illegal. That policy would result in massive lawsuits. You are making things up. reply blackeyeblitzar 7 hours agorootparentHe’s not making anything up. Frankly that you don’t believe something that is so widespread and well known tells me you’re not in the industry or at least not in management. Everyone knows what protected characteristics are but they still break the law because it’s unlikely they’ll get in any trouble. And that’s because everyone who is against these discriminatory programs is too afraid to speak up. reply greenthrow 6 hours agorootparentI have been in the industry for 25 years. I have hired dozens of people, including recently. We are not even allowed to ask someone's race, let alone consider it when hiring. The only people who think things work the way you and the other commenter do are delusional right wingers. DEI is about inclusion (that's the I) of people who have traditionally been excluded from opportunities. It's not about keeping anyone else out or down. Try actually educating yourself instead of repeating brain dead nonsense. reply blackeyeblitzar 2 hours agorootparent> The only people who think things work the way you and the other commenter do are delusional right wingers. You’re simply dismissing others’ experience, but I’m not lying to you when I say that many of us have direct experience with this. At the big tech companies this is normal practice. Also race questions are standard in the application process, even if optional, and even if you don’t answer them, internal diversity teams will guess at people’s races where they don’t have data. In hiring decision meetings, people definitely discuss protected traits as a reason to say yes. In promotion meetings, these diversity metrics are reviewed and tweaks are made based on protected traits. If you’re a junior manager you are not going to be in the room when that happens, to keep things secret. > Try actually educating yourself instead of repeating brain dead nonsense.

So clearly they’re doing something right, even if they have a history of poor security going back decades - way before any kind of diversity bias was the norm. Anyway, I read as much of the linked article as I could stomach, but I gave up at this point: > When I began my career, I believed that the systems for determining who got a job or a promotion at a company like Microsoft at least aimed at an ideal of meritocracy I have had these conversations with fuckhead managers in the past. How the hell can we have a meritocracy when non-cis-white-males have far less opportunity to gain the resume points necessary to compete? “Meritocracy” in this sense is, at best, nothing more than a cover for conservatism. A historical lack of diversity obviously has a compounding effect on the skills of a population and the only way to fix that historical wrong is to promote people who would not otherwise have had that opportunity. Instead of railing against diversity quotas, maybe instead you could think about why the fuck they are necessary in the fist place? reply rangestransform 7 hours agorootparentIt’s not the job of private industry to fix the past and current mistakes of government, namely segregation, property-tax-linked school funding, redlining, urban highway construction, etc etc etc reply nxobject 6 hours agorootparentIf only reparations had a remote chance of becoming policy in this country… not a chance. reply doctor_eval 1 hour agorootparentprevso why are they doing it? Could it be that the biggest company in the world benefits from these policies? By acknowledging that a resume might be affected by lack of opportunity, Microsoft gets to sample from a larger pool of potential excellence. It’s pretty simple really. Isn’t the success of Microsoft proof that diversity is actually beneficial to private industry? I’ve come to the conclusion that “meritocracy” - when used in the context of diversity - is just another code word for “racist fuckhead”, and honestly I’m sick of hearing about it. reply cjk2 11 hours agoprevPerhaps they should tie executive pay to customer satisfaction?

I've been working in/near enterprise sales for quite a while now. Security is considered unglamorous table-stakes: companies won't buy your stuff because you're doing all the right things, but they'll definitely not buy your stuff if you're not. Giant products like AWS and Azure are too big to grill about their security controls. If you try to ask an AWS rep about something, they'll direct you to their security portal where you can download a SOC2 report and a few other things. That's about all you'll get from them unless you're equally huge. The most you can really go by is their reputation. If you trust AWS, buy their product. If you don't, don't. That's all the prior research a typicalQ: Do you use multi-tenant databases? > A: : you'll be deploying our product on your own server. That's actually a perfectly fine answer!

Will Shanklin Contributing Reporter Fri, May 3, 2024, 4:00 PM EDT·1 min read 0 Nintendo Nintendo sent a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice for over 8,000 GitHub repositories hosting code from the Yuzu Switch emulator, which the Zelda maker previously described as enabling “piracy at a colossal scale.” The sweeping takedown comes two months after Yuzu’s creators quickly settled a lawsuit with Nintendo and its notoriously trigger-happy legal team for $2.4 million. GamesIndustry.biz first reported on the DMCA notice, affecting 8,535 GitHub repos. Redacted entities representing Nintendo assert that the Yuzu source code contained in the repos “illegally circumvents Nintendo’s technological protection measures and runs illegal copies of Switch games.” GitHub wrote on the notice that developers will have time to change their content before it’s disabled. In keeping with its developer-friendly approach and branding, the Microsoft-owned platform also offered legal resources and guidance on submitting DMCA counter-notices. Nintendo’s legal blitz, perhaps not coincidentally, comes as game emulators are enjoying a resurgence. Last month, Apple loosened its restrictions on retro game players in the App Store (likely in response to regulatory threats), leading to the Delta emulator establishing itself as the de facto choice and reaching the App Store’s top spot. Nintendo may have calculated that emulators’ moment in the sun threatened its bottom line and began by squashing those that most immediately imperiled its income stream. Sadly, Nintendo’s largely undefended legal assault against emulators ignores a crucial use for them that isn’t about piracy. Game historians see the software as a linchpin of game preservation. Without emulators, Nintendo and other copyright holders could make a part of history obsolete for future generations, as their corresponding hardware will eventually be harder to come by.",

Any modern game console has some form of decryption, which can be argued to prevent access. This is when we run into the chicken/egg problem because you can't write emulation without violating 1201. It is also in part the argumentation Nintendo used in the yuzu case. reply d_tr 1 hour agorootparentprevIsn't the whole emulator a circumvention? It circumvents the hardware which \"effectively controls access to a work\", which is the console itself. reply dannyw 53 minutes agorootparentNot exactly. Clean room reimpmentations are fine, and has been upheld in court. I think the copyright office even has a published exemption for it.

Whether or not it's good DRM is irrelevant. The classic example would be DVDs that are encrypted with CSS and 40-bit keys. Because you need to be able to decrypt the DVD to be able to play the video, if your software doesn't have permission to playback (encrypted) DVDs, you're circumventing DRM. A DVD ripping software maker has lost this in court: https://w.wiki/9yNu So like how DVDs are encrypted, all Switch games are encrypted. Except with good AES encryption and proper key sizes. This started with games in the Wii/PS3 generation, so emulators for systems before that would be fine. Also I've now learned that wikipedia has a URL shortener. Because Hacker News eats the period at the end of the wikipedia article title. reply miohtama 40 minutes agoprevThe solution is decentralised Github: https://radicle.xyz Radicle gives a decentralised Git network that is much more immune to any legal action. This makes it much more difficult for Nintendo to take such action. Because it is a civil dispute, not a criminal one, the trick is to make it more costly for Nintendo to abuse the legal system (it is unlikely the legal system abuse will be fixed in long term, or ever). When DMCA and such laws were designed, it is unlikely the lawmakers intended it to be abused like this.

    "title": "A Journey of Discovery: From Web Development to Bike Repair",
    "originLink": "https://tegowerk.eu/posts/bicycle-repair/",
    "originBody": "It was the 28th of June, 2020; the perfect summer day. I remember it distinctly because of two important events that took place on that day. The first was the unfortunate discovery that I am highly sensitive to the venomous hairs of the Oak processionary caterpillar. If you’ve never wished you could use a cheese grater to remove the skin off your arms and legs just to be rid of the itching, then you can’t really understand how I felt for two whole weeks that summer. The second thing that happened on that 28th of June was the seemingly inconsequential purchase of two secondhand bicycles. My wife and I drove out to a local park to test ride a couple of ’90s-era Trek 970 bikes that a guy had restored in his garage. We didn’t know a thing about bicycles, but we liked what we saw; the bikes worked great and felt very nice to ride around the park–the fact that I also happened to ride through a floating cloud of Oak-processionary hairs would only become apparent the next day. So we took our new old bikes home, and we started riding them around. We got into bicycle touring too around that time, and that’s worth an entire future post on its own for the joy it’s brought us, but for now I’d like to get back on track. See, I kept thinking about the guy we bought the bikes from. I don’t know if he did this as a hobby, side business, or what, but I became increasingly fascinated by the idea of fixing up and restoring old bicycles. As I said, at that time I didn’t know a thing about bikes; I couldn’t even change a brake cable, but I’d always wanted to pick up a hobby that would take me away from the computer, something that would get my hards dirty at the same time, so why not give this a try? Back then I still had my previous bike too, gathering dust and cobwebs somewhere in the basement. It was a Cube Aim that I’d had for at least a decade and had practically never serviced. It worked like crap, but I suspected most of it was just lack of maintenance and proper adjustment. In fact, it was in a lot of ways a nicer bike than the one I’d just bought. So I set a goal for myself: I would take the bike apart, down to the last bolt; I would clean everything up, change whatever parts were broken, and put it back together again. After all, how hard could it be? At its core, a bike is a very simple, very old machine. The basic operating principles have remained virtually unchanged since the first “safety bicycle” of the late 19th century: you push on the pedals to rotate a crank arm; a chain transfers the power to the rear sprockets; the sprockets turn the rear wheel. That’s it, that’s all there is to it; a wonderfully simple device that is nonetheless the single most energy-efficient mode of transportation humanity has come up with. Of course, modern bikes are a lot more complicated than that: inflatable tires; the freewheel; derailleurs; suspension; hydraulic disk brakes; electric motors and electronic gear shifting. Every major technological advancement has brought with it increased safety, ease of use, and performance, at the cost of adding extra layers of complexity on top of the basic initial machine. It’s increasingly rare now for people to know how to repair their own bicycles, and bicycle mechanics themselves have more and more skills to learn if they want to keep on top of the fast changes in their field. Which brings me back to my modest Cube. I grossly underestimated just how complex a task I’d set for myself, of course, but at the same time I also underestimated just how much I would love doing it. I had never considered myself mechanically inclined; my dad didn’t teach me much, and by that time I hadn’t yet truly internalized something that has since become one of my main mantras in life: what one man can do, another can do (by the way, if you haven’t watched The Edge yet, you really should). Thankfully, we live in glorious informational times that our forefathers didn’t even dream of. A trove of knowledge of incalculable value is available at the fingertips of every self-learner, and bicycle repair is no exception. YouTube channels like Park Tool or RJ The Bike Guy provide a visual, hands-on learning experience that is comparable to the tragically fading practice of apprenticeship. Internet forums like /r/bikewrench give one the ability to pick the brains of real-life professional mechanics (although, just like every other subreddit, it does have its idiots that one needs to learn to steer clear of), and no list of bike repair resources could be complete without mentioning the Bible, the website of the late Sheldon Brown. May he rest in peace. Eventually, I finished the project. It didn’t go smoothly at all. On more than one occasion I realized I was missing some vital tool, or some tiny part that I hadn’t even known existed until I suddenly needed it–like cable ferrules, or a star nut–and without which the whole project ground to a halt. Nevertheless, the bike progressed, then finally it was done, and from that moment on I knew I was hooked. I’ve been working as a web developer since 2006. Coding has always been my great passion. I have literally lost count of the number of apps and projects I worked on for the past sixteen years. But let me tell you something: not a single launch has given me the same high, has been as memorable or as character-defining as rebuilding that cheap bicycle in 2020; I simply had to have more of it. Almost two years have passed since then. I’ve rebuilt almost twenty more bikes in that time. I’ve learned to reliably build wheels, and I’ve become the go-to guy for bike repair in my circle of friends–and even for some folks who I didn’t even know before. There isn’t a single bicycle repair task that scares me anymore. I’ve gone from not being able to change a brake cable, to bravely taking apart complex components or hacking them for use-cases that they weren’t designed for. We have since sold the bikes we bought back in 2020, and both my wife and I are now riding bikes that I’ve built from scratch. The pride I feel when we go out on a ride cannot be overstated, and I love biking now more than I ever did as a result. I realize this may sound overblown, but the changes this hobby has wrought in me go beyond just teaching me a fun and useful skill. Learning to fix bicycles has changed my outlook on manual labor, on the nature of work, and ultimately on life itself: Thinking versus doing Looking back, I realize I had a terribly naive perspective on manual labor. I lived with the misconception–drilled into me since childhood–that work can be neatly split into two categories: knowledge work and manual work; that there are those who think, and those who do, and by extension (and it greatly shames me to admit this) that there is a clear difference in value between the two. I have since realized that the line that separates thinking from doing doesn’t actually exist; instead, the two are facets of the same coin, and neither can exist in isolation. This came to me when I noticed that there is just as much thinking going into solving a bike repair problem as there is in solving a bug in my code (and, incidentally, the same high when I finally crack it). I later ended up reading Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry Into the Value of Work, by Matthew B. Crawford; it was an eye-opening read that eloquently put into words a concept I had merely sniffed the edges of. I highly recommend you give it a read. What one man can do, another can do I touched on this a bit earlier in the text. I have a lot more courage now in tackling all sorts of repairs around the house, not just on bikes. This is because I now know that I have the capacity to learn the necessary skills, but more importantly, it’s because I’ve learned to look at objects and see them. Something has shifted inside me, and it has altered my perception of the world. Before, I used to look at an object and only see it on the surface; I saw the function it performed and nothing more. Now I see the bolts, the screws, the cables, the hinges, the motors, and I know that each one of those can be fixed or replaced independently of the object as a whole. Maybe this has always been obvious to you, but as I’ve already said, I didn’t learn much of this stuff growing up; it’s a failing I put on my shoulders and the shoulders of my father both, and it’s something I’m only truly making up for now, in the fourth decade of my life. Better late than never. Tangibility, of objects and people At work I build websites. Well, that’s not strictly true. I build web apps, I write unit tests, I manage databases, I architect and set up the cloud infrastucture, I set up continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines, and sometimes I even help my colleagues fix the Docker setup on their machines. My daily conversations are peppered with such acronyms as PHP, TDD, CI, CD, K8s, SQL, JSON, AWS, GCP, CF, SSH, SSL, and on and on and on. If you’re not an IT person, most of these words won’t mean anything to you, and therein lies my next point. Conceptually, it’s easier for humans to relate to occupations that produce something you can point a finger at. The further removed a person is from the results of their own work, the greater the disconnect they feel, and the greater the chance they’ll conclude they’re working in a bullshit job. Now, I don’t actually believe I’m working a bullshit job. I don’t really believe they exist. I believe jobs provide value even when the value is not immediately, tangibly apparent. But I do believe in the disconnect that makes people feel this way, and I do believe that’s a distinct hallmark of the modern service-oriented industries. You’ll never hear a baker say their job is bullshit. And it’s not just the tangible aspect of the work itself, either. The same can be said of the people who ultimately benefit from the work. Websites that I’ve built are being used right now by hundreds of thousands of people, yet for some reason I still feel I’m making a greater impact when I see a person ride away on a bike I’ve just repaired for them. It’s senseless, yet there it is.",

    "commentBody": "A love letter to bicycle maintenance and repair (tegowerk.eu)154 points by victorstanciu 4 hours agohidepastfavorite100 comments freetime2 28 minutes agoI love cycling but absolutely hate maintenance. I’d always prefer to be riding my bike than working on it. Two recent enhancements that significantly improved my life are electronic shifting, and wax lube. I haven’t had to mess around with gear indexing once since I bought a bike with electronic shifting (SRAM Rival) a couple years ago, and it always shifts perfectly. I do have to keep the batteries charged, but one charge a week is more than enough with daily riding - so never had any issues there. With wax lube (I use Squirt) I spend a lot less time cleaning my chain. What used to be a pretty annoying weekly process of degreasing and lubing my chain now takes a minute or two: use a dry brush to scrape off any excess wax buildup and then apply more wax. Much quicker and much cleaner than the old dry lube I used to use. And the chain is cleaner and quieter too. Other than that, I basically hose off the bike and wipe it with a towel after every ride, and align/clean the disc brakes occasionally. My ratio of ride time to maintenance time has never been higher. reply fulafel 10 minutes agoparentThere's also the old low-maintenance way that is common for people who commute daily on city bikes - internal gear (or single speed) hub, and just ignore your chain apart from adding oil when it starts squeaking, and get it serviced once a year or so or when a problem appears. A newer variation is belt drive instead of chain. reply ndsipa_pomu 14 minutes agoparentprevI'm at the other end of the spectrum and am always fettling my bikes and looking to upgrade parts etc. However, I've switched over to just using Squirt lube on my chain (on my road bike at least) as I previously tried the full wax treatment. That involved cleaning a new chain to remove the factory applied grease (using a cheap ultrasonic cleaning machine) and then using a cheap pan to warm up paraffin wax to which I added some micronised graphite (bought off eBay) for extra lubrication, although it turns the wax and your drive-train black. Soak the chain, then pull it out and let it cool off until the wax has hardened. I found that a treated chain would last for about 100 miles or so before needing a top-up (of squirt lube) or another dip in the wax bath, so I was alternating between two chains. However, when I was topping-up the treatment with Squirt, I thought why not just use the Squirt and not bother with the whole waxing business. The problem I have is not being good at looking after my bike straight after a ride and here in the UK, that means the chain tends to get rusty so I end up getting through more chains than I should. reply Quothling 20 minutes agoparentprevI think bike maintenance is one of those things that is similar to how you read about programmers who pick up woodworking here on HN. I know it's a zen thing for me, similar to other \"craftmanship\" (I'm not sure if this is the right english word for things like machanics, carpenters, plubmers and so on) like home improvement DIY, gardening or even cleaning the damn house. It's just very zen. Both because it tends to relatively less tasking on your executive functions, is physical and provides tangible results that you can see and \"feel\" relatively quickly. It may also be because programming is frankly a craftmanship for the most parts. There are a few projects where I'm doing Computer Science, but for the most part I'm a digital plumber. reply leke 2 hours agoprevI got into bikes after moving to a cyclists' town.

But what changed most sceptics, that i met, mind were bikes that actually worked. I understand the fear when people see the price tag and think they could buy a second hand car for that, but once they sit on a good bike they just enjoy it. And if they then learn how to do basic maintenance themselves so that it just stays good and doesn't creak all the time, they fall in love with them. I love bikes. reply stavros 33 minutes agorootparentI have a shitty bike that I bought for 150 € ten years ago. It creaks everywhere, is hard to ride, and a thief once actually moved it out of the way to steal the bike behind it. I use it every day but I'm not going to get a better one, because I don't want to be constantly worried that someone will steal it. I want to use it as transportation, leave it wherever, and know that it will still be there because it's not worth stealing. Plus, being hard to ride means I get extra exercise for my fixed-length rides. reply UnserMannInK 1 hour agorootparentprevTrue, the price tag might buy you a second hand car. But if you factor in the maintenance cost of cars it comes in cheap in comparison. I’ve just had to replace the clutch in my car (~2200€), whereas having the whole transmission (all sprockets and the chain) in a bike fixed is around 250-300€. Less if you do it yourself.

Above the very cheapest bso (bicycle shaped object) a reasonably priced bike can be amazing, but it might need striping and rebuilding properly. There could be a correlation here between higher priced bikes being likely to have been assembled by a more competant person and them 'being better'.

Maintaining your primary mode of transportation completely yourself is very satisfying. Most of our bikes were incredibly cheap (sometimes \"cyclists should yield at all times and have a sixth sense to avoid getting killed by impatient or distracted drivers\". And that is literally true. Yes, cars should be more careful, but it's a fact that it's easy to overlook a cyclist.

Each one costed like dirt and could be rebuilt/repaired in a couple hours with a bag of instruments hanging below the seat. Then I rode it few months without service. Most of my bikes died due to fatal injuries or were stolen. Modern bikes is something I don’t understand. Complex aggregates, systems and subsystems, spaceship furniture, etc. And the cost of a low-end car, sometimes mid. Plus all the “niceties” of the modern market, like planned obsolescence, milking the customer, necessary extras and so on. Feels like you’re meant to more touch yourself about how much of a cyclist you are than to ride. Say that these bikes are softer, easier, cadence friendly. Doesn’t matter, all off this is bs to me.

Even the paint was pretty bad so I went all the way of stripping the old paint, cold-setting the rear dropouts (thanks to Sheldon Brown's website) so that it will take the modern wheels, painting the frame, and assembling everything with new parts. It took me two years because I had to learn a lot how different components fit together and all sorts of specific spacings. Now, I have a very unique and beautiful bike (people on the street tell me). But above all, I know every detail of that bicycle and how to fix it. The reason why IT people love this stuff (also woodworking, gardening, etc.) so much is that there's routine. Most of the bikes are very similar. If you've rebuilt one, you have the competency to build another one. In software, every project is a new challenge. It's more like building a new technical object all the time. I think software development could benefit from rewriting stuff every now and then. Many of my former projects would benefit a lot if I had a couple of week to take apart all the functions and assemble them in a better way that consideres everything I've learned so far. reply victorstanciu 2 hours agoparent> Now, I have a very unique and beautiful bike (people on the street tell me).

For most of the stuff I can't or don't want/have time to do, I take into the shop. And generally, they throw up their hands and say it needs to be replaced. Did that with two dropper posts this week. (One needed a rebuild that would cost more than replacement. The other had a (luckily under warranty) faulty cartridge). I will also say that e-bikes are much more fun than I would have thought. And not very serviceable. reply gsora 2 hours agoparentOne should choose their bike components carefully. I have been able to service every single component on my mountain bike, excluding suspension since that requires knowledge and time I don’t have time to acquire (yet!). As a general rule choosing mechanical components instead of electronic ones has been rewarding on the longevity and repairability fronts. That said some components are consumable, like the dropper post cartridge you mentioned, but to arrive at the point it requires replacement you either used it a lot (I’m jealous!) or it was simply faulty :-/ Might also be a good idea looking for other bike shops in your area. Mine is always trying to recycle and repair components. reply Onavo 3 hours agoparentprevYou have to factor in labor costs. The marvel of modern logistics is that it's often cheaper to ship a new part over from across the Pacific than it is to do a proper repair where the faulty part is taken apart and hand repaired. Take a look at the local rate of machinists and mechanical engineers and then decide whether you truly want to have your bike part \"repaired\". reply petre 2 hours agoparentprevDropper posts are notorious for beaking. Just choose something with a replaceable cartridge. reply zeristor 2 hours agoprevMonty Python’s Mr Bicycle repairman. https://youtu.be/Tq_xTeWiv6I I remember first seeing this and thinking in some way it is more than funny, a more equal world. reply ThomasBb 3 hours agoprevThankful I learned to fix a flat tire at 5 and steadily built experience in bike repair since, from where my first moped and car repairs felt like basic extensions… The blog comes very close to quoting ‘zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance’ -I wonder if the author read that… reply victorstanciu 3 hours agoparent> The blog comes very close to quoting ‘zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance’ -I wonder if the author read that… I did! But I did so long before I started with bike repair, so at that time I couldn't really connect with it. Thank you for reminding me that I should give it a second read! reply iamthemonster 3 hours agoprevBeautifully written, but I couldn't disagree more. Bicycle maintenance is an annoying chore to me that gets in the way of my enjoyment of cycling. I even have good bicycle shops near me that did maintenance far quicker/cheaper/better than I would do. It just all seemed like such a hassle. I finally ended up buying a belt-drive hub-geared hydraulic-brakes medium/fat-tyre bicycle and my maintenance woes appear to be massively reduced. I love the concept of bicycles that are deliberately built to be low maintenance. reply alisonatwork 1 hour agoparentThis. I think it's worth mentioning that cycle touring doesn't have to be complicated either. I was always scared to take a bike ride longer than a weeked because so many people in that scene appear to be major gear nerds. Then I met a hobo who had just jumped off a train with a battered up omafiets and he inspired me to strap a bunch of crap to my cheap hybrid and cycle all the way across North America. Turns out you don't need the latest and greatest anything, you don't need to spend a zillion dollars on tools, or sit around tinkering every day. If you can change a tube and oil the chain, that's about all you need to know how to do. Even with broken spokes or a snapped cable you can hobble along for a couple days, till the next town with a bike shop. And if your bike is cheap and generic, every bike shop will have the replacement parts already in stock. When I cycled through Colombia I did it on a Buffalo Bike which was slow, heavy and pretty much indestructible. Took ages to get anywhere, but who cares? Rather spend my time pootling along slowly than trying to fix stuff. Fixing stuff is my job, that's the last thing I want to do in my personal time. reply mckn1ght 2 hours agoparentprevI’m kind of stuck in the worst spot between both. Maintenance is a chore, but I still prefer to DIY vs taking it to the shops near me, which are various combinations of rude, unreliable (both in terms of scheduling and quality of work), and expensive. So I just suck it up and try to fit the work in when I can, which is almost never. reply matsemann 2 hours agorootparentYeah, the \"LBS\" thing has been slowly dying. Maybe because of online shopping, but it also feels weird to pay premium for subpar service. Perhaps a spiral of death of sorts. There is no bike repair in walking distance from me, so taking a bike in for repair means having to find other means of getting home and back there. To me, that's the biggest hurdle. Also, they give Littles guarantees to when they will actually work on the bike, and I don't want to be without it for an indefinite time. If I instead could book a slot, come there, deliver it, walk around some other shops for an hour or two, then pick it up and bike home, I would've probably given them more business. I enjoy most of my bike repairs, but some of them I can do without. For instance switching to studded winter tires, my tire+rim combo is a hassle to get on. reply ThomasBb 3 hours agoparentprevYou’re on to something here - as a Dutch person, luke any of my friends, I have a ‘ daily driver’ bike with a in-hub set of gears, enclosed chain, drum brakes - and the thing is near indestructible. It spends its days in the street in front of my house chained to a bike rack ans still barely ever needs anything fixed. The typical ‘road bikes’ with derailleurs and rim brakes are fun when performance counts -but if you’re just getting around, who cares? reply victorstanciu 3 hours agoparentprevInteresting point of view, thank you! For me maintenance and repair have enhanced riding rather than diminish it. I find it's similar to how cooking enhances eating, or yard work enhances laying around the yard. Of course I hate having a malfunction while riding as much as the next guy, but I also ride with more confidence because I know I can handle pretty much anything that can go wrong, even on the go. reply enneff 1 hour agoparentprevThat’s why I favour simple single-speed bikes for commuting. Almost nothing can go wrong with them, and you can fix almost anything that does go wrong with a small bike tool. It’s also nice that they’re so cheap you don’t really care too much if it gets stolen, so there’s no stress about locking it up somewhere a bit dodgy. reply julian55 2 hours agoparentprevI agree with you. I've also found that themore modern a bike is the more difficult it is to maintain Take hydraulic disc brakes for example, when they work they are great but when they fail they don't work at all. You then have to bleed them which is fiddly, messy and requires special tools then you'll probably have to do it all over again after a few rides. Tubeless tyres are similar. reply tpm 1 hour agorootparentMy experience with tubeless is that once I found a good setup, it's set and forget. I don't get punctures (none at all), maybe once a week top up the pressure, once a year top up the milk and that's it. It was like that with Panaracer GK+ tyres, but they have to be under pressure when I don't ride for longer periods, otherwise there are issues. Now I use Pirelli Cinturato Velo tlr and it's the best tyre I ever had. reply petre 1 hour agorootparentprevSpecial tools: a bleed kit (funnel, syringe, silicon hose), two Alen wrenches an insert press and a hose cutter but you can also get away with a hammer, a vice, yellow holding blocks provided with the hose kit and a regular cutter. For tubelees you need a syringe and a tire booster. reply vundercind 2 hours agoparentprevBicycle maintenance is what got me out of the habit of riding. You don’t ride for a little while and soon trying to pick it back up first means tires need a lot of air… oh that one’s going flat before the end of the block… Christ, it’s the rear one, there goes the whole afternoon expecially since I’ll for-sure mess up other stuff in the process. Guess I’ll do it next time. Then I don’t, and stop riding. It’s crazy that my car beats every bike I’ve owned handily in both maintenance-hours-per-hour-of-use and (obviously, by a loooong shot) maintenance-hours-per-mile. And it has complex electronics and has to contain little explosions and has parts than spin thousands of times per minute! And a damn air conditioner, which is a whole thing all in its own! Plus only cost as much as a surprisingly small number of allegedly-minimally-decent bikes despite requiring way more mass in materials and far more complex manufacturing. Hell, the precious metals in it alone… the bikes have none or practically none of that. I love riding bikes though. Negative interest in spending any time maintaining them, and taking them to the shop all the time’s impractical (now the costs are really crazy, plus I have to transport them there and back) [edit] fwiw when I eventually get over the sticker shock at what bikes with any nice features at all cost, I’ll probably get a low-maintenance bike like yours. Do wanna try those airless tires some companies make first, though. Shit’s always going flat, it’s the worst, hardly worth it if I’m still gonna have that problem or if the airless tires are terrible in other ways. reply lloeki 2 hours agorootparent> You don’t ride for a little while and soon trying to pick it back up first means tires need a lot of air [...] Shit’s always going flat I don't know what it is about this, I've owned bikes for 30 years to ride in a mix of conditions (from mountain trail to city) and I've had like 5 flats, tops. One because I failed to bunny hop a curb and blew the whole thing, busting the wheel in the process, and the others because I drove over something that punctured the tube. My last bike I've had for about 10 years til it was stolen last year, at some point I left it unattended for like 3 years, and when I picked it up again it wasn't at perfect pressure, but certainly wasn't flat at all, far from it, and definitely ridable. I know because my el cheapo pump was bust and I rode it to the nearest shop. By the time it got stolen, only the front tube had a change a couple years before because of a puncture (rode on shattered glass) but the other was still factory and perfectly fine at holding air. This experience has been consistent with all my bikes, and friends that ride good hardware have a similar experience. Some others though, they keep on regularly being flat but from what I gather it's a) cheaping out on the hardware and b) being mind boggingly careless about what they ride over. reply matsemann 2 hours agorootparentprevI've never had problems with flats, other than once where I had got lots of metal shavings in my tire which gave me flats for a few days until I caved and bought a new tire. So your problem doesn't really sound like one most people have. I normally get flats like every other year or so. And that's with thousands and thousands of kilometers of riding each year. reply jamesdepp 3 hours agoparentprevPriority Continuum Onyx by any chance? Those things are absolute beasts. Fantastic commuter bikes. reply kashyapc 2 hours agoparentprevThat's the reason I use a single-speed bike (not to be confused with a \"fixie\") for commuting. I absolutely love the simplicity of it: no gears to muck around with, much less maintenance, light, and hassle-free. Perfect to deal with the \"frequently stop and start\" biking in a city. In a (flat) city for commuting short distances, you simply don't need gears if you're below 50. It's a nice to have. It also helps that I live in the \"Low Lands\" (Flanders, Belgium), so no hills around here, and it's a bicycle-first city. reply bombela 45 minutes agorootparent> you simply don't need gears if you're below 50 And here I am with all the gears; on a nice road bike; and I struggle to maintain 30 km/h on flat. reply criddell 13 minutes agorootparentIs maintaining 30 km/h important? Why not leave a little earlier? reply rsingel 2 hours agorootparentprevSeconded. Love that my single speed rarely needs anything other than some air in the tires. I've got a converted 70s Raleigh that has been bomber for almost 20 years, with the only exception being a busted crank arm. Replace those old hollow aluminum things if you go this route. Even got my dad a single speed e-bike. If you live somewhere mildly flat, that's a fantastic choice for durability with an ebike. So many bikes end up unridden because the gears went wonky. reply ultrablack 2 hours agoprevZen, and the art of bicycle maintenance? reply sourcecodeplz 3 hours agoprevWorking on the bike for me is therapeutic. It’s like trimming the plants/trees. reply matsemann 2 hours agoprevBack in time as a student, I had to stay in the student city over summer due to an internship. Everyone else left, so the evenings were quite free. I ended up buying a cheap old bikes and refurbish it completely. Like, take every single piece apart, clean, sand and possibly paint. It gave me an admiration for the cleverness but also the simplicity of the design. Truing the wheels felt like an art, and I got so interested in the concept that I ended up writing my thesis around lacing patterns for the spokes on the wheels. It actually got posted to HN at the time https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10410813 I do all maintenance on my bikes now. Always a good excuse to buy some new gadget, right? This other week I applied new bar tape and bled my brakes. I originally wanted some repair shop to do it, but that would mean bike there, get to work somehow, then get back there and then be able to bike home. Seemed more hassle than just fixing it myself, given I'm dependent on my bike. reply SebFender 43 minutes agoprev\"You’ll never hear a baker say their job is bullshit.\" Disconnection from our work and results in general is a people killer - It always surprises me more aren't sensitive to this great truth of life... reply xkcd1963 3 hours agoprev [–] But it is true.
