The journalist uploaded 237.22 TB of video to his google drive when the \"unlimited\" plan existed. When google phased out the unlimited plan, he&#x27;s not paying for a non-unlimited plan, and his account entered a read-only state. Now, the account is scheduled for termination since he&#x27;s not paying for a valid current account.It would cost the guy $5000 a month to store his data on S3 and he doesn&#x27;t want to pay that, so he now needs to find someone to bear the cost of storing his video files before his account terminates. reply frognumber 18 hours agoparent> The actual headline is slightly less inflammatory: \"Google Promises Unlimited Cloud Storage; Then Cancels Plan; Then Tells Journalist His Life’s Work Will Be Deleted Without Enough Time To Transfer The Data\"Correct. 7 days is not enough time to stream >200TB of data, let alone find a place to stream it to. This puts a human being in a crisis position.He doesn&#x27;t need to just find someone willing to store his data. He need to get his data out. Trying to get my data out of Google, I&#x27;ve gotten ~1TB out in ~1 week. This is about a year&#x27;s worth of time to not lose it.The facts are not \"even less inflammatory.\"A decent company would drop $2000 on HDD, or a bit less on optical &#x2F; tape media, and ship (rather than delete) the data to the customer they fired, at their own cost, or at the very least, at customer cost. A company which provides literally no way to get data out and offloads expenses is a POS company. reply garblegarble 18 hours agorootparentHe had ~6 months to download his data, not 7 days: they told him on the 11th of May 2023 (or thereabouts they gave him a 60 day period ending on the 10th of July 2023) that he had exceeded his quota.They should, of course, have given a clear timeline for deletion at that point, but does he seriously expect other people to believe he was naive enough to think Google would continue to store his data forever after they withdrew the unlimited service he was using?I&#x27;m no fan of Google, and I agree with you that a good service would have offered an at-or-slightly-above-cost data export for that volume of data... but he&#x27;s deliberately misrepresenting the situation here (either that or is painfully naive)Edit: as somebody else pointed out downthread, he also would have received numerous e-mails throughout 2022 telling him that the unlimited service was being shuttered reply ollien 18 hours agorootparentThe six-month grace period notice pretty clearly states his data would be read-only, while the seven-day notice seems to be the first time destruction is even mentioned. I think we can both agree that there&#x27;s a world of difference between data being read-only and being destroyed. I think it&#x27;s completely reasonable to say he has 7 days to download it. reply alacode 17 hours agorootparentI was curious what the context of \"grace period\" is for Google Drive and found this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;thread&#x2F;13321050&#x2F;what-will-h...\"If I cancel my additional storage, will all the files&#x2F;documents that took up the additional space, be deleted? Or will I still have access to them?\"\"You will still have access to all your files but, if you have used all storage you won&#x27;t be able to add or create NEW files until you have space available.\"Which sounds like you&#x27;re right, unless the Product Expert was wrong. reply llbeansandrice 16 hours agorootparentThe fact that this comment chain is about 7 deep trying to figure out whether the customer was given enough notice or not I think is also evidence that Google has a terrible UX for this anyway.If your data is going to be deleted, it should be painfully obvious well in advance. reply godelski 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think the depth of this comment chain has anything to do with the UX design. The words on that warning are unequivocally interpretable as \"the data will not be deleted.\"At the end of the day, it doesn&#x27;t even matter if hidden in the terms of service or somewhere if it is made clear that the data will be deleted. It doesn&#x27;t even matter if it is clear to @andrewmutz and @garblegarble that the data will be deleted[0]. What matters is if not thinking the data would be deleted is a reasonable interpretation. Full stop. It also matters that when explicit communication (unequivocally interpreted as slated for deletion) that the user was given 7 days, which was not even enough time, especially considering Google&#x27;s egress rates.There&#x27;s a lot of this on HN lately and I&#x27;m not sure why. Communication is fuzzy people, I&#x27;m not sure why that&#x27;s surprising. But when there&#x27;s disagreement don&#x27;t ask yourself which is right or wrong, but if a reasonable interpretation was made. Because communication is like an autoencoder: there&#x27;s what&#x27;s in your head (input), what you say (lossy compressed intermediate latent), and what is received (decompressed information with imputation). There&#x27;s too many attempts to defend a believed objective reality which just is absurd (ironically making the view less objective).And, importantly, RTFA[0] Obviously these two are reading between the lines. It is not a bad interpretation and we often should practice this, especially to be on the safe side, but it&#x27;s clear that there is inference, so what&#x27;s wrong with the comments is their strong assertions that the communication was obvious. One may also make the argument that Techdirt isn&#x27;t telling the full story or timeline, but that&#x27;s also a different issue and inferential. reply shwouchk 15 hours agorootparent> What matters is if not thinking the data would be deleted is a reasonable interpretation.

Especially after responding to a comment that actively demonstrated that they did not read the article. If you disagree that this is a reasonable interpretation maybe clarify that. But this is also all you said, so I&#x27;m not sure what you expect me to read it as.I think there is also sufficient reason to believe you did not read the chain of comments either. This is kinda like jumping into the middle of a conversation while having been zoned out. Sufficient evidence because you are revisiting something already discussed. If you would like to argue that his interpretation was unreasonable you should have provided reasoning to it. Don&#x27;t play the victim here. You gave a low quality, emotional, and exaggeratory comment. No matter how good the argument is in your head, you can&#x27;t expect a high quality response nor be upset when someone makes a quip remark. (idk why I&#x27;m even responding this one tbh)__There was no ad hominem attack.__ I responded to your claim, and by quoting the article. I have not dismissed your claim based on your character nor even attacked your character. But I&#x27;ll concede that I made a slight and my comment was condescending (see above for reasons). Additionally, my slights are not subverting the argument nor detracting from it. If you need clarification, an ad hominem attack is \"you should ignore anything [insert user] has to say because they are dumb and voted for [insert political enemy]\". See how it doesn&#x27;t respond to what you said, moves the conversation away, and now places a new standard which must be rebutted which is not actually related to the subject matter? That&#x27;s what makes it a logical fallacy. We have none of those qualities. Yet now here we are, not talking about the article or the contents...You, on the other hand, did in fact make a logical fallacy. But that&#x27;s already been addressed and we need not be more explicit nor derail the conversation further.> This is not mentioned in the article but it is mentioned in other commentsPro tip: do not assume the person you are replying to has read every comment under a post. You may assume they have read the direct chain of comments leading to the current point, but no more. If you are tired of saying the same thing maybe instead of saying \"as I&#x27;ve already commented\" maybe link your comment. Or chill, because frankly this isn&#x27;t an issue of high importance and you don&#x27;t have to really defend either situation because none of have a real horse in the race so idk why emotion is high. You should also only assume the context of the direct thread. If you want to claim that the author is hiding truth and that there was in fact clearer explicit ample warnings given, do so here, or provide a reference to your other comment. You cannot assume I am going to read through or search all >500 comments or search your username. Because frankly, I&#x27;m responding to what you said, not who you are. If your context is everything you said, including other comments unrelated to this direct chain, the contextual issue is with you not me.tldr: low quality replies don&#x27;t get high quality responses and I&#x27;m not going to search for every comment you made replyshwouchk 15 hours agorootparentprevI respectfully disagree. They were clearly given enough notice - from personal experience as I’ve commented already, as well as from sibling comments.If you are still “figuring this out”, I daresay it is simply because you haven’t used the paid service and seen the frequent nagging emails about the transition. reply lolinder 15 hours agorootparentprev> unless the Product Expert was wrong.Which is entirely likely, given that Google&#x27;s \"Product Experts\" aren&#x27;t employees with access to internal communication channels, they&#x27;re just volunteers working for internet points. reply haswell 17 hours agorootparentprev> I think it&#x27;s completely reasonable to say he has 7 days to download it.7 days to download 200TB+ does not seem reasonable. reply ollien 17 hours agorootparentNo, I agree.

Forever is a straw man.It would be reasonable to expect some kind of migration &#x2F; off-boarding plan, and it’s Google’s responsibility to facilitate that after pulling the plug on services they previously committed to providing. reply chlorion 16 hours agorootparentprevnext [8 more] [flagged] cxr 14 hours agorootparentThe mendacity in your comment coupled with the glee you express in it is disturbing.> Even for Google Podcasts which is being terminated, users who don&#x27;t pay have gotten notifications for well over a year that the service was going to shutdownUh, no. It hasn&#x27;t even been 3 months since the shutdown was announced—and I personally only learned about it a few days after the announcement by a chance conversation with someone who mentioned it in person. (This was thankfully well after I had already gotten what personal data of mine I could out of the app and migrated to another player precisely due to the lackadaisical approach user data handling by whomever is responsible for Google Podcasts. It was notable for being one of the Google services that doesn&#x27;t make user data available through Google Takeout.) reply chlorion 14 hours agorootparentI have this email Recently we announced that Google Podcasts will be discontinued next year. We wanted to reach out directly with more information on what to expect. For now, nothing is changing, and you can continue to use Google Podcasts as normal. Over the coming months, podcasts in YouTube Music will be made available globally and we will start rolling out tools that will enable you to transfer your podcast show subscriptions from Google Podcasts. In YouTube Music, you will be able to listen to your podcasts just like you did on Google Podcasts, no paid subscription required. If YouTube Music isn’t for you, there will also be an option to download a file of your show subscriptions, which you can upload to an app that supports their import. We acknowledge that this is a big change and want to thank you for being a loyal Google Podcasts user. We’ll reach out directly with more details over the coming months. In the meantime, if you have questions, please check out our Help Community here.

If you ignore the emails or notifications, that is your fault, not on the service.Like I mentioned above, even the Google podcast service is giving users over a year to prepare for the shutdown, and provides a method to transfer any data you have out of the app. If they take much precaution with a podcast app that few people even use, I guarantee they sent multiple emails to this person urging them to prepare for this.If you don&#x27;t check your email or just ignore it, that is not the service providers fault. Expecting a free service to bend over backwards for you even when they told you repeatedly to prepare for this is silly.>I can&#x27;t believe we all fell for it.You fell for clickbait and exaggerated or fabricated stories from someone who either ignored their mail or waited til last minute and are now whining. reply lukeschlather 15 hours agorootparentprevHe had all his computers confiscated by the FBI and then realized that his backups were also being destroyed by Google. Calling this a grift is incredibly insulting. reply justinclift 13 hours agorootparentDid you miss the sarcasm? replycompsciphd 2 hours agorootparentprevI had a business account that was told they were cancelling the service. We were given 3 months or so notice.What I believe happened (as happened to many other people as can see from rclone forum) is that some people decided that they were going to simply go into \"overage\" mode, as that assumed that google would keep their data around when over quota, just it be locked into read only mode (so the data would remain, but just be readable, they couldn&#x27;t add anything to it).Google decided that this wasn&#x27;t something they were going to support, so people who went into read only mode, have now been getting the letters that their data is going to be deleted.i.e. they have been for months paying google for an account that they knew is over quota.200TB is fairly easily extractable over 3 months from google drive if one plans correctly. You have a 10TB download quota a day, which one would need a gigabit&#x2F;s connection to hit. If you have only 250megabit connection, it will take 80 days.

Its beyond the ability of a large company.This is what people are actually angry about. As a company gets more and more successful (size&#x2F;revenue) it becomes less capable at going above and beyond for the majority of their customers.

It&#x27;s a poor analogy. There are cloud storage users in every order-of-magnitude bracket from 10^0 to 10^15 bytes used. S3 is not like Chuck-a-Rama.

Nobody forced them to market it that way. If they know 99.9% of users are fine with 1Tb, then they should sell them that and not lie in their marketing. reply shwouchk 14 hours agorootparentThey did have such a plan. In fact, to get unlimited storage, an individual had to buy 3 (And I think later, 5) seats. And it was indeed not limited, at least as far as I could tell.Until these got abused, my guess by pirate crowd to store huge media collections (eg search “plex gdrive”), and the plan went away. Did google promise they would keep this plan up forever?Unlimited does not mean infinite and does not mean forever. It means you are getting access&#x2F;capacity as you need, without “needing to worry about details” &#x2F;presuming reasonable usage&#x2F;. They were not fired as a customer. No limits were imposed. Until google decided to end it for everyone, likely specifically due to customers as above.What if someone stored 200PB on their “unlimited” account? Would you expect google to give a 5 year warning to make sure someone had enough time to download their data to their laptop? reply threatofrain 14 hours agorootparentprevYes, I&#x27;m blaming the kinds of users who persuade buffets to make up hostile and unpleasant rules for people. If firing a small % of users changes the equation for everyone then customers should be all for it.When customers exploit any concept of free, even the bathroom in a fast food restaurant, that starts a culture where businesses give you a code so you can pee. You can call this being up-front or honest, but I call it the depletion of goodwill. reply shwouchk 14 hours agorootparentprevI believe the object of discussion was google who &#x2F;did&#x2F; have a Chuck-A-Rama like offering.Specific common sense amount is an unreasonable demand. How long should a customer be allowed to stay in a buffet? Is it an hour? 1:30? 3 hours? I don’t know. Maybe? Depends.Is it reasonable to come in, pay once, and stay for a month in the restaurant (if it was a 24&#x2F;7 establishment)? Probably not. reply sangnoir 14 hours agorootparentprev> The implication your analogy is sneaking in is that there is a common-sense amount of cloud storage a user might use, in the same way that there is a common-sense amount for somebody to eat.I&#x27;m not \"sneaking\" it in - I&#x27;m saying it outright. When Google (or anyone else competent in the art) is designing and provisioning a service, they have a numbers they use to estimate user resource-usage percentiles: unlike journalists, infra engineers don&#x27;t have the luxury to pretend storage space is free or infinite.When you win too much at a casino, or eat too much at a buffet, or stay too long at a McDonald&#x27;s, or stay too long at the gas pump, they will all ask you to leave. There are common-sense limits to most services. Free-service tiers on internet services are not exempt.

It was quite clear that this transition would eventually be mandatory and that it did not include unlimited space for a flat fee.I punted on the transition for as long as possible, and when it finally arrived I temporarily added some accounts until I removed the excess data (mainly old backups I did not need anymore).Nothing in life is unlimited and taking such a promise at face value appears to me as being willfully naive. Relying on such an offer as your main storage is begging for trouble. Expecting this to happen is precisely why I only stored backups there.You don’t need to be an expert to do the math, consider that just to store the data, without any redundancy and without it being constantly spinning would have retailed at at ~ $4K using the cheapest drives (~25 8tb drives), and would have cost them ~$1&#x2F;h or ~$700 to constantly run at CA electricity prices (~8W idle per drive). And this before redundancy, backups, bandwidth, etc. This is obviously unsustainable and will eventually end.Same goes eg for dropbox, who offered “unlimited” storage for their business plan until fairly recently but now have the same limit of 5tb&#x2F;acct as Google.Who in their right mind would rely on such an obvious abuse of what was meant by “unlimited” to store the only copy of their life’s work? reply capitainenemo 15 hours agorootparentWell... they could transition the data to tape with a delay for recovering it, instead of outright deleting it. At that point, storing it would be pretty much free no? Regardless, they promised something, then reneged, with little to no time to handle it. The way they handled it in terms of getting rid of the service is pretty terrible.Also apparently it wasn&#x27;t his only copy - his others were taken, and now he&#x27;s about to lose the last one. reply shwouchk 13 hours agorootparentAs I and others mentioned elsewhere in this discussion, there was at least a year of warning. At least I was aware of this for about a year out. Tape is cheaper but not free. A quick search[0] quotes it at ~few $ &#x2F;TB&#x2F;Yr. Even if we take it at $1 due to G scale, that’s still ~$250&#x2F;Y to store the archives, roughly what the customer likely paid when it was stored on immediate access media.I agree it would have been nicer of them to store an archive after they stop paying. I disagree that they reneged on their offer - despite being disappointed that the deal ended, would I expect it to be offered forever, especially given the potential for abuse? Of course not. Frankly I’m surprised it lasted this long. reply zlg_codes 3 hours agorootparentprev> Nothing in life is unlimited and taking such a promise at face value appears to me as being willfully naive.What are your thoughts on false advertising?

Storing 237 Tb on an unlimited server - the individual clearly knew they were taking advantage of a system and probably should have been ready for some kind of remedy.Google clearly made a mistake in offering an \"unlimited plan\" so it makes perfect sense that they&#x27;re going to discontinue it, and offer 60 days before the data becomes read only. If it was just that, there wouldn&#x27;t be any article.The fact that they regret offering an unlimited plan doesn&#x27;t, however, give them the right to tell him that they&#x27;re going to give him 60 days before the data becomes read only but it won&#x27;t be deleted and then suddenly tell him that actually his data is going to be deleted in 7 days, which isn&#x27;t sufficient time to transfer it elsewhere. reply nirvdrum 16 hours agorootparentPerhaps it was a mistake, but offering unlimited was a competitive advantage. Others working with the economies of storage had limits or priced based on usage; having unlimited would be a great way to draw in customers. I&#x27;m highly skeptical of tech companies effectively price dumping, harming competition, and then coming out and saying \"Oops, that wasn&#x27;t sustainable. Here are the new terms.\" I&#x27;m of the mindset that if you offered an unlimited plan you should have to grandfather in customers that bought into that plan. reply godelski 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also naive to think a big tech company wouldn&#x27;t be aware of power distributions (see Pareto) when offering anything unlimited. Which Google does continue to offer unlimited data on Google Fi, but throttles (even though they also discontinued the unlimited photo upload with Pixels and many times offers expansion of drive space but if you upgrade to a paid plan you don&#x27;t get the additional storage, you just get get expanded to that size...)I also very much agree that the monopolistic behavior you&#x27;re mentioning is not a think we should just go accepting and even more, not be victim blaming. It feels really weird to me that people are blaming the reporter. You know, a 1.6 trillion dollar company vs well... nearly anyone else. reply frognumber 6 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t feel at all bad about throttling mobile data.For reference, the standard scam before was to offer $40&#x2F;month for e.g. 1GB of data. At that point, you&#x27;d pay a crazy amount for each additional MB of data. This was horrible with very fast data, where you could accidentally burn through the whole quota with a misclick e.g. grabbing a large download.Unlimited with throttle is super-friendly in comparison. I need data in case of an emergency -- enough to send and get emails and have GPS. I don&#x27;t need 4k video streaming in an emergency. I don&#x27;t want a $1000 bill for that. It keeps me in a sensible position, without requiring unlimited liability for the carrier. reply godelski 6 hours agorootparentOh, I actually appreciate unlimited with throttle. They&#x27;ve always had data caps too but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the average user knew about them. But maybe the overage plan manager did because Fi is niche? And sorry, I was just bringing up Fi as an example of something being unlimited since so many people were acting like nothing is. reply frognumber 4 minutes agorootparentWell, no. Fi is not unlimited. This is how it works.My cell network (not Fi) has crazy fast internet (I&#x27;d throttle it if I could, t avoid overusing it).If I go over some amount, it goes to 3G speeds (probably 200kbps or similar).If I were to run at 3G speeds -- continuously, peak speed -- for a month, I couldn&#x27;t e.g. hit a terabit of data. Ergo, there is a cap, and it&#x27;s short of 100GB. You cannot get to 100GB be because of the throttle.I think this is very good behavior, but it is capped. zlg_codes 3 hours agorootparentprevWouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a bunch of Google employees hang out here and try to deliberately influence comments.

I.e. they want people off the service voluntarily and deal with the tiny fraction that refuses. reply ajross 17 hours agorootparent> Yeah usually the thing about deadlines is that you should communicate them as harshly as possible, then let them slip when they do arrive.Is this not exactly what has happened? He was clearly threatened harshly, and... the data isn&#x27;t yet deleted? reply alwa 16 hours agorootparentIn this case, the initial notification (reproduced in the article) didn’t threaten to delete the files. Instead of communicating the threat harshly, it said that after 60 days his account would be placed in “read-only” mode.It sounds like he (I think reasonably) believed that would be the new reality after the grace period: that he couldn’t write new files, but that his existing data would be accessible indefinitely in read-only form.Sure, it’s clear from the context that Google vaguely wants him to stop being a headache for them. But planning for a read-only future is very different from planning for your data to be vaporized. As GP points out, Google could get eviction done in the same timeframe but save considerable face if the initial correspondence had said “you’re using way too much, it’s against our TOS, and we’re deleting your data in 30 days,” then given him a 30-day “reprieve” when the deadline drew near. reply layer8 16 hours agorootparentprevHe wasn’t threatened harshly. He was told his data would become read-only, which he took at face value and assumed his data would remain safe. Then suddenly he was told the data would be deleted within seven days. reply ajross 16 hours agorootparent> He wasn’t threatened harshly. [...] he was told the data would be deleted within seven daysHow exactly is that not a harsh threat? Sounds like a harsh threat to me. They were nice before, he didn&#x27;t comply, now they&#x27;re jerks. But it remains just a threat unless they actually wipe the data. Which they won&#x27;t, because he&#x27;s surely downloading it right now while we yell about it on HN. reply callalex 16 hours agorootparent> They were nice before, he didn&#x27;t comply…He didn’t comply with what? Show me where in Google’s communications where it said they were going to delete his data. reply layer8 16 hours agorootparentprevI was referring to the making it read-only.And there’s no practical way to download that amount of data within seven days, just based on the bandwidth this would require. The situation would be totally different if they gave him six months notice for the deletion. reply ajross 15 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re misunderstanding the contention upthread and confusing the threat (\"we&#x27;ll delete all your stuff in 7 days\") with the actual enforcement of that threat (deleting said data, which hasn&#x27;t happened, and I&#x27;m betting almost certainly won&#x27;t as the guy will find some way to comply).The poster upthread was trying (vainly, I guess) to make a distinction between the two. reply danaris 16 hours agorootparentprevNo; the opposite happened.Google initially told him that there was no hard deadline for getting the data off—just that his drive would be read-only as long as it was over the limit.Then, 6 months later, they told him he had 7 days to get it off or it would be wiped. reply ajross 16 hours agorootparentRight, exactly. \"He has 7 days or it would be wiped\" is a threat, not a punishment. Was the data wiped or not? What are you willing to bet that we&#x27;ll actually see a followup claiming the data was wiped? Almost certainly he&#x27;s going to download the thing onto $3k of SSDs and get off the service, which is what everyone wants. reply calfuris 15 hours agorootparentMoving 237.22 TB in 7 days requires ~3.14 Gbps of bandwidth, assuming that the clock starts ticking the moment that he actually starts moving data. In practice, the requirements would be even higher (subtracting out the time between notice being sent and read, plus time to actually set up alternative storage). Does Google even provide that level of read throughput to Google Drive customers? reply ajross 9 hours agorootparentI have to repeat the question: do you genuinely believe this data is going to be inevitably deleted, or maybe do you think that the threat will work and the guy will get his stuff downloaded somehow? replyterminous 18 hours agorootparentprev> taking advantageNo. 100% wrong.

I&#x27;m not sure this storage one is all that different reply mardifoufs 17 hours agorootparentBut restaurants explicitly ban doing that. Even all you can eat restaurants don&#x27;t let you take out food. Google never hinted at having a maximum limit. Theres no reason to believe or expect that unlimited actually means some arbitrary limit that google just came up with after you signed up. Your analogy would&#x27;ve been better if the journo tried hosting a file share service using his drive account as a back end or something but that&#x27;s not what happened reply fauigerzigerk 15 hours agorootparentprevNot a great comparison. It was an _enterprise_ plan with unlimited storage. What kind of enterprise did Google aim their \"unlimited\" message at if it excludes a small company (an individual journalist) with lots of video footage?I think the answer is that Google did in fact target companies with exceptionally high storage needs. They were just assuming that everyone who had lots of data would also spend a lot on other services and that didn&#x27;t pan out.A better comparison is probably a restaurant promising unlimited coffee refills for life, forgetting to make it conditional on ordering food as well. Then some office worker who never eats breakfast turns up every morning for three double espresso refills. reply precommunicator 17 hours agorootparentprevI feel like this isn&#x27;t the best example, such restaurant can say that its only unlimited if you drink it in-house, in plain view. You almost never can take out food or drinks in all-you-can eat restaurants. reply brnt 3 hours agorootparentprevGenerating&#x2F;collecting 200TB of data is however entirely normal in some professions. Something Google should be and almost certainly is aware of.In your analogy it would be Amazon setting up an S3 front on their corporate unlimited Google account. That didn&#x27;t happen, it was just someone with more data than average. Google knows very well what the distribution looks like. reply zlg_codes 3 hours agorootparentprevA lot of restaurants place a limit on the size of the container you&#x27;re allowed to use, and there&#x27;s a cultural expectation that you won&#x27;t loiter just to fill more soda.

Google already let him store that data, if they regret that they should ban him from storing more. Deleting his data after permitting him to store it is completely over the line. No buffet in the world runs like that, not even those owned by literal gangsters. reply ufmace 13 hours agorootparentprevI really disagree with this type of literalism. Everybody knows nothing is really unlimited. It&#x27;s marketing aimed at the naive.I have no problem with banging on Google for offering \"unlimited\" things without telling you what the limits actually are. But at some point, you have to expect some level of knowledge and sophistication from the users. I think accumulating 237Tb of data is well past the point where you should not just take \"unlimited\" at face value, ask hard questions about exactly what the limits of what they&#x27;re offering are, and move to a better supported service, even if it costs some money.It&#x27;s probably also time to re-think - do you really need 237Tb? That&#x27;s a huge amount of data. Is this like raw 4k HD video of every interview you&#x27;ve ever done, uncut? Maybe it&#x27;s time to cut down on things a bit. reply lupusreal 11 hours agorootparentIn HN people have low expectations for google so a limit seems reasonable to us. Google behaving shitty doesn&#x27;t surprise anybody here. But what about with the normies? Google has deliberately cultivated an image of extreme technical capability with the normies. Google have deliberately convinced the general public that Google are basically internet gods who can do things no other company can, using their computer wizard magic. A normie can therefore reasonably believe that google could store a petabyte for them, when more technical people should reasonably know that google has limits. These aren&#x27;t contradictory.If Joe Blow&#x27;s computer shop down the street offered \"unlimited storage\" then normies would understand that to be bullshit. But when Google gives that offer, it&#x27;s taken literally because Google.

Am I right to be concerned? reply pton_xd 17 hours agorootparentCloudflare covers this in their terms of service: Content Delivery Network (Free, Pro, or Business) Cloudflare’s content delivery network (the “CDN”) Service can be used to cache and serve web pages and websites. Unless you are an Enterprise customer, Cloudflare offers specific Paid Services (e.g., the Developer Platform, Images, and Stream) that you must use in order to serve video and other large files via the CDN. Cloudflare reserves the right to disable or limit your access to or use of the CDN, or to limit your End Users’ access to certain of your resources through the CDN, if you use or are suspected of using the CDN without such Paid Services to serve video or a disproportionate percentage of pictures, audio files, or other large files. We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of such action.In other words, if you serve HTML &#x2F; CSS &#x2F; JS you&#x27;ll be fine. Too much of anything else and at some point they will ask you to pay.I&#x27;ve experienced this first-hand and they&#x27;re pretty fair about it. I believe they asked me to upgrade to Enterprise once I was serving something like >10-20TB per month of images &#x2F; audio files (this was several years ago though!) reply licomo 13 hours agorootparentThis is the part I don&#x27;t like> if you use or are suspected of using the CDN without such Paid Services to serve video or a disproportionate percentage of pictures, audio files, or other large filesLots of sites have images. When exactly can I start to expect paying? Will this unspoken limit change in the future? Will I be notified when it is? As-written, it doesn&#x27;t seem that way since it&#x27;s opaque. reply CodesInChaos 16 hours agorootparentprevR2 has similarly misaligned pricing, and I don&#x27;t think it comes with comparable ToS limitations: You pay per request, and not proportional to data egress.

After THAT, they then gave the user 1 week to deal with 250 terabytes.Read it again you understand that properly. reply boringg 17 hours agorootparentI did. I use the term free but it should \"incredibly low cost\". I accept the blame for my inaccuracy but my position doesn&#x27;t change. 20$&#x2F;month for unlimited data that works out to about 0.07$&#x2F;TB for storage thats pretty damn close to free in my books.How much would a TB cost on S3? reply avazhi 11 hours agorootparentI can only speak for myself in this thread, but my issue was your referring to something that was cheap as free, as if the customer was freeloading. Google is able to leverage probably the greatest economy of scale in the cloud industry (maybe Amazon is better, but that&#x27;s it) and so its cost per gigabyte of storage is either the lowest or 2nd lowest on the planet. It can and does provide storage services at a very low cost to itself (hence its margins).It is able to provide services very cheaply and it is for that very reason that paying customers are attracted to it - and of course, even if a service is cheap, paying for a service creates a different relationship between the service provider and the customer than does a relationship where the customer freeloads. In my view, if this had been a free service the terms of which had changed, there wouldn&#x27;t be the same scope for outrage. But this was a paying customer, even if he didn&#x27;t pay as much as you think would have been reasonable - or would have been obtained - elsewhere in the market. Google voluntarily chose those prices for its unlimited plan for competitive reasons and in its own corporate interests. That&#x27;s on Google, as was Google&#x27;s subsequent unconscionable behaviour.In Australia, I suspect this sort of behaviour would provoke very close scrutiny by our antitrust and consumer protection regular, the ACCC. We don&#x27;t seem to have the same problem with regulatory capture that the US does currently. At the very least here the consumer would have arguable claims under the Australian Consumer Law relating to consumer guarantees and misleading and deceptive conduct in trade or commerce. reply wgjordan 17 hours agorootparentprevThe offer was unlimited storage at 5+ seats, but in any case, the subject is quoted in the article writing &#x27;I paid Google a lot of money for a long time for a plan,&#x27; so it was absolutely not viewed as &#x27;free&#x27; to them. reply faust201 17 hours agorootparentprev> indefinitelyDoes it say somewhere in terms and conditions? reply avazhi 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s the only reasonable way to construe what Google said.If Google unilaterally changed its TOS and updated those terms by saying the account would go &#x27;into a read only state&#x27; without any further details (both of which in fact happened), the user is entitled to assume that such a read only state will be the new status quo. Google should have specified a time limit or specified that the read only state would be revocable on with no or short notice, at the company&#x27;s discretion. By staying silent on that matter, Google&#x27;s communications were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive the user of the product.This really isn&#x27;t rocket science. reply terminous 18 hours agorootparentprevAre you seriously asking this question or are you completely disconnected from the dictionary?

Don’t offer an unlimited plan if you don’t want people using it.I have to think the only reason why the journalist hasn’t sued Google for breach of contract is fear of more retribution from Google.

Just that sometimes people offer deals that have no explicit limits except that the deal terms say that either party can exit at any time.Then once the deal moves out of the band where it is mutually beneficial, one party invokes the terms and exits the deal. reply azemetre 14 hours agorootparentIdk if that’s always the case. I still have unlimited data plan from my mobile provider, from 2008ish. $50 for unlimited data (no it’s not rate limited either).Obviously the cellular provider hates this but they can’t remove something I’m paying for and haven’t broken the contract. They do try to get me off the plan several times a year offering new phones fully paid if I switched.Fuck them, I paid for it and I’m not going to leave. It’s not my fault a multi billion dollar corporation didn’t get one over me.I’m glad I live in an area with good protections against this corporate abuse.Absolutely disgusting what Google has done. I’ll keep this in mind 5 years from now when I have the power to spend real money on budgets and ensure that I never give Google a cent of it.It takes decades to build a reputation and minutes to destroy it. Google has destroyed theirs. reply renewiltord 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think this \"my fault\" &#x2F; their fault is a useful way of thinking for enterprise decisions. For my part, I was and am in charge of cloud (and on-prem) purchasing decisions and I don&#x27;t like to consider these things binary. Counterparty risk is just an additional cost to consider.We use Alibaba Cloud, GCP, and most of all AWS. About December last year, Alibaba Cloud had a full zone outage as their datacenter provider had complete air-conditioning failure. One of the first things to go were the switches plugged into Express Connect (their feature to allow you to have direct links to their cloud through your network provider) and we had backup access set. We didn&#x27;t get all of our stuff shut down but it helped.But developing and maintaining backup access costs something. When we egress from S3 to our on-prem cluster, that&#x27;s a cost. Vendor continuity and substitutability is just a cost like that. It&#x27;s up to the guy managing this to model each of these risks and no enterprise vendor will sign an unlimited liability contract so you&#x27;re going to have to land somewhere reasonable here. I always make sure to have exit clauses for us, and I try to ensure vendor exit clauses are what I&#x27;m comfortable with and appropriately priced.Ultimately, you&#x27;ll just have to read what you sign and have good counsel. But that&#x27;s just what&#x27;s worked for me. If you find the blacklist model more successful, more power to you. reply germandiago 16 hours agoparentprevThanks. I almost believed the headline.

There is a very high chance it&#x27;s been flagged with this deletion because it&#x27;s so much data. A quick check on Amazon for external drives it would cost him $4000 just to buy hard disks to be able to store it locally. The guy&#x27;s data is expensive to store no matter what.

Too often what gets lost in the phrase \"edge case\" is that there&#x27;s a human being on the other end. They should do the decent thing and work with him and anyone else storing more data than can be practically downloaded to come up with a workaround or extension. Imagine if your bank closed your account and forfeited your money because they couldn&#x27;t dole it out to you fast enough. reply thinkharderdev 16 hours agorootparentUnlimited did mean unlimited though. There was probably some sort of limit but this guy never in fact hit it. But Google stopped offering unlimited storage (probably because of people like this who would store 100s of TB). They notified him of this months before discontinuing the service and he apparently made no effort to find a different storage solution, maybe because it would be really expensive to store that much data in the cloud anywhere else. Did he think they would just continue to store the data indefinitely? That doesn&#x27;t strike me as a reasonable assumption to make. reply calfuris 14 hours agorootparentHe was told that after the grace period ends, his account would become \"read-only\". Interpreting \"read-only\" as \"I will still have read access to the data\" is not unreasonable. I&#x27;m guessing that neither of us would have trusted it, but HN readers are not representative of the population as a whole. Google should have provided explicit notice of their intention to delete the data a reasonable amount of time in advance, accounting for the amount of data involved. I don&#x27;t think that a week is reasonable in any case, but it is especially unreasonable when hundreds of TB of data need to be moved. reply thinkharderdev 13 hours agorootparentSure, I agree that they should have been more explicit when they discontinued the service and said that they would delete data over the new limit at some point. But I don&#x27;t think you have to be an HN reader to understand that if you stop paying for a service eventually the service provider will stop providing it. Like did this guy really think that the data would just stay in \"read-only\" mode forever? reply croutonwagon 17 hours agorootparentprevUnlimited does. And it should.But if its your \"lifes work\" i would assume the value there is more than just the cost of storage. That the person storing it would have thought about ownership and egress options a bit further out.Like i use workspace for all sorts of stuff.

So i have backups of all things at all times and worst case, i just move my email&#x2F;drive whatever to another service along with the domain, which I own (and he appears to as well)Im not excusing google at all.

The &#x27;victim&#x27; here clearly knows they are taking advantage of a situation. Google is in the wrong on their response but, come on, let&#x27;s be reasonable human beings and stop saying &#x27;victim blaming&#x27;. reply Pikamander2 18 hours agorootparent> I mean 237 TB of data is an excessive amount of data.If it&#x27;s excessive, then Google shouldn&#x27;t have offered an unlimited data plan. They could have called it a 100 TB plan, but they chose to call it unlimited to make it sound better and then canceled it once people took them up on the offer. Regardless of whether that kind of action is legal, it&#x27;s a shady business practice.For that matter, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with Google discontinuing the plan going forward, but they had plenty of options for making the transition more fair and building consumer trust without hurting their bottom line too much. For example, they could have converted his account to a 250TB account and tripled its price, at which point he wouldn&#x27;t be in immediate danger of losing his files but would be pressured into gradually moving to a more cost effective solution. reply boringg 17 hours agorootparentThey offered it for 10 years and then probably realized that people were taking advantage of the position and then tried to phase it out.

It’s reasonable to believe that they can do that since it averages out to a small amount per user, meaning most users overpay and the power users get peace of mind. Of course nothing is unlimited but a company like Google is perhaps best positioned in the world to offer that. And sure, if someone writes &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom at 1Gbit&#x2F;s you could claim abuse, but for people working with video TBs of data is normal. 200+ is a lot but again averages out among users. In either case it’s extremely easy to avoid the word “unlimited” if you don’t intend to honor it for legitimate customers.It’s also reasonable that companies products change. And maybe it doesn’t last forever, fair enough. But if your product is backup, and you pull the rug with a 7 day grace period, of course people are going to be upset and warn others not to trust you. reply Nicksil 18 hours agorootparentprev>The &#x27;victim&#x27; here clearly knows they are taking advantage of a situation.Why do you think this? reply boringg 18 hours agorootparentBecause they are using 237 Tb in an \"unlimited\" service from Google.

How were the benchmarks recorded? reply barrkel 14 hours agoprevThe mirror on the wall of the bathroom in the Berlin location looks through to the kitchen in the next room. I guess the depth gauging algorithm uses parallax, and mirrors confuse it, seeming like windows. The kitchen has a blob of blurriness as the rear of the mirror intrudes into kitchen, but you can see through the blurriness to either room.The effect is a bit spooky. I felt like a ghost going through walls. reply nightpool 13 hours agoparentThe refigerator in the NYC scene has a very slick specular lighting effect based on the angle you&#x27;re viewing it from, and if you go \"into\" the fridge you can see it&#x27;s actually generating a whole 3d scene with blurry grey and white colors that turn out to precisely mimic the effects of the light from the windows bouncing off the metal, and you can look \"out\" from the fridge into the rest of the room. Same as the full-length mirror in the bedroom in the same scene—there&#x27;s a whole virtual \"mirror room\" that&#x27;s been built out behind the mirror to give the illusion of depth as you look through it. Very cool and unique consequence of the technology reply pavlov 13 hours agorootparentWow, thanks for the tip. Fridge reflection world is so cool. Feels like something David Lynch might dream up.A girl is eating her morning cereal. Suddenly she looks apprehensively at the fridge. Camera dollies towards the appliance and seamlessly penetrates the reflective surface, revealing a deep hidden space that exactly matches the reflection. At the dark end of the tunnel, something stirs... A wildly grinning man takes a step forward and screams. reply throwaway17_17 8 hours agorootparentWould you be offended if I animated that scene?

It&#x27;s interesting because when I look at the fridge my eye maps that to \"this is a reflective surface\", which makes sense because that&#x27;s true in the source images, but then it&#x27;s actually rendered as a cavity with appropriate features rendered in 3D space. What&#x27;s a strange feeling is to enter the fridge and then turn around! I just watched Hbomberguy&#x27;s Patreon-only video on the video game Myst, and in Myst the characters are trapped in books. If you choose the wrong path at the end of the game you get trapped in a book, and the view you get trapped in a book looks very similar to the view from inside the NYC fridge! reply chpatrick 12 hours agorootparentprevThis happens with any 3D reconstruction.

It was super impressive how it streamed in more images as I explored the space. The tv reflections in the Berlin demo were super impressive.My one note is that it look a really long time to load all the images - the scene wouldn&#x27;t render until all ~40 initial images loaded. Would it be possible to start partially rendering as the images arrive, or do you need to wait for all of them before you can do the first big render? reply duckworthd 12 hours agoparentPardon our dust: \"images\" is a bad name for what&#x27;s being loaded. Past versions of this approach (MERF) stored feature vectors in PNG images. We replace them with binary arrays. Unfortunately, all such arrays need to be loaded before the first frame can be rendered.You do however point out one weakness of SMERF: large payload sizes. If we can figure out how to compress them by 10x, it&#x27;ll be a very different experience! reply promiseofbeans 9 hours agorootparentOr even just breaking them down into smaller chunks (prioritise loading the ones closer to where the user is looking) could help reply duckworthd 2 hours agorootparentThe viewer biases towards assets closer to user&#x27;s camera (otherwise you&#x27;d have to load the whole scene!).

In one of the coolest and more outrageous repair stories in quite some time, three white-hat hackers helped a regional rail company in southwest Poland unbrick a train that had been artificially rendered inoperable by the train’s manufacturer after an independent maintenance company worked on it. The train’s manufacturer is now threatening to sue the hackers who were hired by the independent repair company to fix it. The fallout from the situation is currently roiling Polish infrastructure circles and the repair world, with the manufacturer of those trains denying bricking the trains despite ample evidence to the contrary. The manufacturer is also now demanding that the repaired trains immediately be removed from service because they have been “hacked,” and thus might now be unsafe, a claim they also cannot substantiate. The situation is a heavy machinery example of something that happens across most categories of electronics, from phones, laptops, health devices, and wearables to tractors and, apparently, trains. In this case, NEWAG, the manufacturer of the Impuls family of trains, put code in the train’s control systems that prevented them from running if a GPS tracker detected that it spent a certain number of days in an independent repair company’s maintenance center, and also prevented it from running if certain components had been replaced without a manufacturer-approved serial number. This anti-repair mechanism is called “parts pairing,” and is a common frustration for farmers who want to repair their John Deere tractors without authorization from the company. It’s also used by Apple to prevent independent repair of iPhones. An image posed by q3k of how the team did their work. In this case, a Polish train operator called Lower Silesian Railway, which operates regional train services from Wrocław, purchased 11 Impuls trains. It began to do regular maintenance on the trains using an independent company called Serwis Pojazdów Szynowych (SPS), which notes on its website that “many Polish carriers have trusted us” with train maintenance. Over the course of maintaining four different Impuls trains, SPS found mysterious errors that prevented them from running. SPS became desperate and Googled “Polish hackers” and came across a group called Dragon Sector, a reverse-engineering team made up of white hat hackers. The trains had just undergone “mandatory maintenance” after having traveled a million kilometers. “This is quite a peculiar part of the story—when SPS was unable to start the trains and almost gave up on their servicing, someone from the workshop typed \"polscy hakerzy\" (‘Polish hackers’) into Google,” the team from Dragon Sector, made up of Jakub Stępniewicz, Sergiusz Bazański, and Michał Kowalczyk, told me in an email. “Dragon Sector popped up and soon after we received an email asking for help.” The problem was so bad that an infrastructure trade publication in Poland called Rynek Kolejowy picked up on the mysterious issues over the summer, and said that the lack of working trains was beginning to impact service: “Four vehicles after level P3-2 repair cannot be started. At this moment, it is not known what caused the failure. The lack of units is a serious problem for the carrier and passengers, because shorter trains are sent on routes.” The hiring of Dragon Sector was a last resort: “In 2021, an independent train workshop won a maintenance tender for some trains made by Newag, but it turned out that they didn't start after servicing,” Dragon Sector told me. “[SPS] hired us to analyze the issue and we discovered a ‘workshop-detection’ system built into the train software, which bricked the trains after some conditions were met (two of the trains even used a list of precise GPS coordinates of competitors' workshops). We also discovered an undocumented ‘unlock code’ which you could enter from the train driver’s panel which magically fixed the issue.” Dragon Sector was able to bypass the measures and fix the trains. The group posted a YouTube video of the train operating properly after they’d worked on it: The news of Dragon Sector’s work was first reported by the Polish outlet Zaufana Trzecia Strona and was translated into English by the site Bad Cyber. Kowalczyk and Stępniewicz gave a talk about the saga last week at Poland’s Oh My H@ck conference in Warsaw. The group plans on doing further talks about the technical measures implemented to prevent the trains from running and how they fixed it. “These trains were locking up for arbitrary reasons after being serviced at third-party workshops. The manufacturer argued that this was because of malpractice by these workshops, and that they should be serviced by them instead of third parties,” Bazański, who goes by the handle q3k, posted on Mastodon. “After a certain update by NEWAG, the cabin controls would also display scary messages about copyright violations if the human machine interface detected a subset of conditions that should've engaged the lock but the train was still operational. The trains also had a GSM telemetry unit that was broadcasting lock conditions, and in some cases appeared to be able to lock the train remotely.” The train had a system that detected if it physically had been to an independent repair shop. All of this has created quite a stir in Poland (and in repair circles). NEWAG did not respond to a request for comment from 404 Media. But Rynek Kolejowy reported that the company is now very mad, and has threatened to sue the hackers. In a statement to Rynek Kolejowy, NEWAG said “Our software is clean. We have not introduced, we do not introduce and we will not introduce into the software of our trains any solutions that lead to intentional failures. This is slander from our competition, which is conducting an illegal black PR campaign against us.” The company added that it has reported the situation to “the authorized authorities.” “Hacking IT systems is a violation of many legal provisions and a threat to railway traffic safety,” NEWAG added. “We do not know who interfered with the train control software, using what methods and what qualifications. We also notified the Office of Rail Transport about this so that it could decide to withdraw from service the sets subjected to the activities of unknown hackers.” In response, Dragon Sector released a lengthy statement explaining how they did their work and explaining the types of DRM they encountered: “We did not interfere with the code of the controllers in Impulsa - all vehicles still run on the original, unmodified software,” part of the statement reads. SPS, meanwhile, has said that its position “is consistent with the position of Dragon Sector.” Kowalczk told 404 Media that “we are answering media and waiting to be summoned as witnesses,” and added that “NEWAG said that they will sue us, but we doubt they will - their defense line is really poor and they would have no chance defending it, they probably just want to sound scary in the media.” This strategy—to intimidate independent repair professionals, claim that the device (in this case, a train) is unsafe, and threaten legal action—is an egregious but common playbook in manufacturers’ fight against repair, all over the world. In the United States, an exemption to Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act allows for repair pros to hack land-based motor vehicles, “which would cover trains,” Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of right to repair advocacy group Repair.org told 404 Media. “All of this is classic OEM bullshit,” Gordon-Byrne said, using an acronym for original equipment manufacturer. “This is the kind of stuff DRM lets you do, and if you don’t stop it, this is where it goes. What the OEM thinks shouldn’t matter anymore, because they’re not the owner of the train anymore. It’s DRM gone wild.” But in Europe, the legality of what Dragon Sector did is murkier. Digital rights advocate and copyright expert Cory Doctorow explained in his excellent Pluralistic blog that Article 6 of Europe's 2001 Copyright and Information Society Directive is generally stricter on DRM circumvention than Section 1201 of the DMCA, and does not have a specific repair exemption. Because of this law, Doctorow told 404 Media that \"there is now an extra layer of jeopardy for these researchers. They were brave to come forward and talk about it.\" Doctorow said that some similar types of research that bypass DRM and technological protection measures (TPMs) in Europe has been done anonymously or behind the scenes for this reason, creating a chilling effect on this type of research. During the height of the pandemic, I wrote an article about how a Polish hacker had developed a dongle that was being used by American repair professionals to bypass DRM on ventilators needed to keep COVID-19 patients alive. That hacker wanted to keep themselves anonymous in part because they feared being prosecuted under EU law. Doctorow said that these sorts of cases—ones involving tractors, trains, other things that people obviously should be able to fix, are ones that can help change laws and regulations. \"This is the kind of claim that might actually help unravel these anti-circumvention measures,\" he said. \"A Polish train operator who wants to fix a Polish train they own is just a no brainer.\" Earlier this week, a group called the National Association of Manufacturers released a paper called “The Economic Downsides of ‘Right-to-Repair’,” which is nominally a piece of research but is just an astroturfed policy paper for big corporations that oppose repair. The paper includes a section called “Altering equipment poses a dramatic increase in violating safety standards and falling out of federal compliance,” which is an extremely common argument that John Deere, medical device manufacturers, Apple, and many other OEMs have made when lobbying against right to repair regulations and laws. In other words, the “safety” line of argument that NEWAG is using to try to undermine this repair is a common refrain across every industry of electronics. “You name an industry and I’ll give you an example of something like this,” Gordon-Byrne said. “John Deere says farm workers are going to die, your tractor is going to run out of control [if repaired without Deere oversight].” She said that the same diagnostic tools that are used to determine what the problem is with a device are “are then run again at the end of the repair, and the diagnostics tell you whether the thing works or not.” In other words, the train is either fixed, which it appears to be, or it is not. SPS, NEWAG, and the Lower Silesian Railway did not respond to 404 Media’s requests for comment. Update: This article has been updated to include more details about Europe's copyright laws.

It&#x27;s really no different to working on a CRUD (well, it&#x27;s more interesting :)).There might be some legal provisions (DRM laws, some EULA, etc.) that muddy the water. But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact, that I can&#x27;t find any ethical problem with what the Dragon Sector folks did[1].

And it is definitely hacking in the sense that they did something someone attempted to prevent them to do, and from a technical standpoint, it is not much different to what criminals do. Hacking a train so that it accepts third party repairs and hacking a credit card reader to steal your money make use of the same techniques. And for me at least, hacking is about technique, not ethics.The ethical distinction is between white hats and black hats.

If police takes someone&#x27;s computers, then it&#x27;s forensic investigation performed by forensic investigators, and not hackery performed by hackers.But of course on technical forums like HN we call it hacking (\"we\" includes myself).To address some of your points:> they did something someone attempted to prevent them to doWell, Newag claims they didn&#x27;t add any shady stuff to the firmware, i.e. they didn&#x27;t prevent anyone from anything. Which means Dragon Sector didn&#x27;t break any protection mechanism, they were just debugging potential glitches! :)I&#x27;ve debugged a lot of software in my life and no one has ever called me \"hacker\" for finding that missing CSS class :)).> Hacking a train so that it accepts third party repairs and hacking a credit card reader to steal your money make use of the same techniques.This is a very low level discussion (\"low level\" as in \"assembler\", and not intellectually, for the lack of a better word), but in this case there&#x27;s one significant different--train firmware is supposed to be unchanged (according to Dragon Sector).And credit card reader&#x27;s fw has been modified.So for me, again, they acted as forensic investigators&#x2F;\"debuggers\".> The ethical distinction is between white hats and black hats. The people in the article are white hats, that is, they work legally, ethically, and they are open about their activities.Yes, I agree.

But weak signal will quickly disappear with ground-based transmitters.I used ”strength” incorrectly on the previous comment. reply PeterisP 12 hours agorootparentGPS spoofing is generally done at limited range and line of sight so the fact that \"horizontal signal will suffer pretty fast\" and having the range limited by terrain and curvature of the earth is not a problem but a feature that the spoofers generally want - affecting the target, but not affecting people 500 miles away; and sometimes even explicitly doing that from a pit so that spoofing or jamming affects airborne targets but not those on the ground.And regarding \"If you want to spoof GPS signal very well, it should be also weak\" the scenarios I&#x27;ve seen (e.g. targeting drones in current conflicts) often explicitly target non-sophisticated commercial off-shelf GPS modules that don&#x27;t attempt to detect spoofing and will gladly accept a signal that&#x27;s 100 times louder than the actual satellites, so I think the spoofers often have no desire to do it \"well\" according to your criteria. replyBobaFloutist 15 hours agorootparentprevI would imagine it only works while trying to service the train (or at least while the train thinks it&#x27;s being serviced). reply LorenPechtel 15 hours agorootparentprevIt only bricks if they&#x27;re there 10 days. reply AntonyGarand 14 hours agorootparentHide a spoofer on the train itself, this way you can target any train anywhere reply anticensor 13 hours agorootparentYeah, trains tend to have large cabinets inside, and not like those cabinets are opened and inspected every day. replySV_BubbleTime 16 hours agoparentprevI bet the fine print on the sales contract is pretty darn small. reply plagiarist 16 hours agoparentprevAny where the corporations have done successful regulatory capture of the legislation. reply Nasrudith 13 hours agoparentprev [–] If it was a documented anti-theft feature it could be legit.

Nvidia 4090 / M1 Pro / M2 Ultra / M3 Oliver Wehrens Dec 9, 2023 • 4 min read (... see down below for M2 Ultra / M3 Max Update and a Nvidia optimzied whisper) Apple released a machine learning framework for Apple Silicon. Along with that are some examples to see how things are working. They also use a whisper for benchmarking. So I dug out my benchmark and used that to measure performance. I simply added a new file to the repo (and the whisper large model was already downloaded). See the original source dir. import datetime from pprint import pprint from whisper import transcribe if __name__ == '__main__': audio_file = \"whisper/assets/audio.wav\" start_time = datetime.datetime.now() x = transcribe(audio=audio_file, model='large') end_time = datetime.datetime.now() pprint(x) print(end_time - start_time) It reports back a list of segements with the following structure: {'avg_logprob': -0.18728541468714807, 'compression_ratio': 1.3786764705882353, 'end': 589.92, 'id': 139, 'no_speech_prob': 0.0017877654172480106, 'seek': 56892, 'start': 586.92, 'temperature': 0.0, 'text': ' Ich heiße Moses Fendel, danke fürs Zuhören und ' 'tschüß.', 'tokens': [51264, 3141, 39124, 68, 17580, 479, 521, 338, 11, 46434, 46577, 1176, 3232, 26377, 674, 256, 6145, 774, 2536, 13, 51414]}, The structure is the same as I get with Python whisper on my RTX 4090. The audio file is the same as in my other benchmarks with M1 and 4090. Result The result for a 10 Minute audio is 0:03:36.296329 (216 seconds). Compare that to 0:03:06.707770 (186 seconds) on my Nvidia 4090. The 2000 € GPU is still 30 seconds or ~ 16% faster.

This gives you a rough idea what the MLX framework is capable of :). A ~ 2 year old Macbook using Whisper is almost as fast as the fastest consumer graphics card (~ 1 year old) on the market (but only if you don't use an Nvidia optimized model). Not so amazing anymore as it seemed 3 days ago. Still not bad for a laptop. Why I'm doing this? I run a podcast search engine over at https://podpodgogo.com. I transcribe tens of thousands episodes, make them full text searchable and run some data mining on them. Update Dec 11th: Added specs and more tests without loading the model. Update Dec 12th: The 4090 is the fastest consumer graphics card. Also updated numbers for M2/M3. Update Dec 13th: Got mentioned on HackerNews and saw a comment about Nvidia optimized whisper.",

If they want a real comparison, they should be comparing MLX to faster-whisper or insanely-fast-whisper on the 4090. Faster whisper runs sequentially, insanely fast whisper batches the audio in 30 second intervals.We use whisper in production and this is our findings: We use faster whisper because we find the quality is better when you include the previous segment text. Just for comparison, we find that faster whisper is generally 4-5x faster than OpenAI&#x2F;whisper, and insanely-fast-whisper can be another 3-4x faster than faster whisper. reply youssefabdelm 13 hours agoparentDoes insanely-fast-whisper use beam size of 5 or 1? And what is the speed comparison when set to 5?Ideally it also exposes that parameter to the user.Speed comparisons seem moot when quality is sacrificed for me, I&#x27;m working with very poor audio quality so transcription quality matters. reply busup 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s beam size 1. From my quick tests on a Colab T4, CTranslate2 (faster-whisper&#x27;s backend) is about 30% faster with like for like settings. I decoded the audio, got mel features, split into 30s segments, and ran it batched (beam size 1, batch size 24, no temperature fallback passes). Takes a bit more effort than a cli utility but isn&#x27;t too hard.Side note, the insanely fast whisper readme gives benchmarks on an A100 but only the FA2 lines were. The rest were on a T4 looking at the notebooks&#x2F;history. Turing doesn&#x27;t support FA2 so the gap should be smaller with it, but based on the distil-whisper paper CTranslate2 is probably still faster.TensorRT-LLM might be faster but I haven&#x27;t looked into it yet. reply atty 12 hours agorootparentprevOur comparisons were a little while ago so I apologize I can’t remember if we used BS 1 or 5 - whichever we picked, we were consistent across models.Insanely fast whisper (god I hate the name) is really a CLI around Transformers’ whisper pipeline, so you can just use that and use any of the settings Transformers exposes, which includes beam size.We also deal with very poor audio, which is one of the reasons we went with faster whisper. However, we have identified failure modes in faster whisper that are only present because of the conditioning on the previous segment, so everything is really a trade off. reply moffkalast 13 hours agoparentprevIs insanely-fast-whisper fast enough to actually run on the CPU and still trascribe in realtime? I see that none of these are running quantized models, it&#x27;s still fp16. Seems like there&#x27;s more speed left to be found.Edit: I see it doesn&#x27;t yet support CPU inference, should be interesting once it&#x27;s added. reply atty 12 hours agorootparentInsanely fast whisper is mainly taking advantage of a GPU’s parallelization capabilities by increasing the batch size from 1 to N. I doubt it would meaningfully improve CPU performance unless you’re finding that running whisper sequentially is leaving a lot of your CPU cores idle&#x2F;underutilized. It may be more complicated if you have a matrix co-processor available, I’m really not sure. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 13 hours agoparentprevyeah well, I find that super-duper-insanely-fast-whisper is 3-4x faster than insanely-fast-whisper.&#x2F;s reply atty 12 hours agorootparentYes I am not a fan of the naming either :) reply whywhywhywhy 18 hours agoprevFind these findings questionable unless Whisper is very poorly optimized the way it was run on a 4090.I have a 3090 and an M1 Max 32GB and and although I haven&#x27;t tried Whisper the inference difference on Llama and Stable Diffusion between the two is staggering, especially with Stable Diffusion where SDXL is about 0:09 seconds 3090 and 1:10 minute on M1 Max. reply woadwarrior01 18 hours agoparentYou&#x27;re taking benchmark numbers from a latent diffusion model&#x27;s (SDXL) inference and extrapolating them to encoder-decoder transformer model&#x27;s (Whisper) inference. These two model architectures have little in common (except perhaps the fact that Stable Diffusion models use a pre-trained text encoder from clip, which again is very different from an encoder-decoder transformer). reply brucethemoose2 17 hours agorootparentThe point still stands though. Popular models tend to to have massively hand optimized Nvidia implementations.Whisper is no exception: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Vaibhavs10&#x2F;insanely-fast-whisperSDXL is actually an interesting exception for Nvidia because most users still tend to run it in PyTorch eager mode. There are super optimized Nvidia implementations, like stable-fast but their use is less common. Apple, on the other hand, took the odd step of hand writing a Metal implementation themselves, at least for SD 1.5. reply kkielhofner 15 hours agorootparentThis will determine who has a shot at actually being Nvidia competitive.What I like to say is (generally speaking) other implementations like AMD (ROCm), Intel, Apple, etc are more-or-less at the “get it to work” stage. Due to their early lead and absolute market dominance Nvidia has been at the “wring every last penny of performance out of this” stage for years.Efforts like this are a good step but they still have a very long way to go to compete with multiple layers (throughout the stack) of insanely optimized Nvidia&#x2F;CUDA implementations. Bonus points nearly anything with Nvidia is a docker command that just works on any chip they’ve made in the last half decade from laptop to datacenter.This can be seen (dramatically) with ROCm. I recently took the significant effort (again) to get an LLM to run on an AMD GPU. The AMD GPU is “cheaper” in initial cost but when the dollar equivalent (to within 10-30%) Nvidia GPU is 5-10x faster (or whatever) you’re not saving anything.You’re already at a loss unless your time is free just to get it to work (random patches, version hacks, etc) and then the performance just isn’t even close so the “value prop” of AMD currently doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. The advantage for Apple is you likely spent whatever for the machine anyway, and when you have it just sitting in front of you for a variety of tasks the value prop increases significantly. reply woadwarrior01 15 hours agorootparentprevAlthough both LDM inference and encoder-decoder and decoder-only LLM inference are both fundamentally autoregressive in nature, LLM inference is memory bound and LDM inference is compute bound. In that light, it makes sense that the difference between a 4090 and M1 Pro isn&#x27;t as pronounced as one would expect at first approximation.Also, as you hint whisper.cpp certainly isn&#x27;t one of the fastest implementations of whisper inference out there. Perhaps a comparison between a pure PyTorch version running on the 4090 with an MLX version of Whisper running on the M1 Pro would be fairer. Or better yet, run the whisper encoder on ANE with CoreML and have the decoder running with Metal and Accelerate (which uses Apple&#x27;s undocumented AMX ISA) using MLX, since MLX currently does not use the ANE. IIRC, whisper.cpp has a similar optimization on Apple hardware, where it optionally runs the encoder using CoreML and the decoder using Metal. reply tgtweak 17 hours agorootparentprevModest 30x speedup reply kamranjon 18 hours agoparentprevThere has been a ton of optimization around whisper with regards to apple silicon, whisper.cpp is a good example that takes advantage of this - also this article is specifically referencing the new apple MLX framework which I’m guessing your tests with llama and stable diffusion weren’t utilizing. reply sbrother 17 hours agorootparentI assume people are working on bringing a MLX backend to llama.cpp...

It&#x27;s more likely that convolutions use high precision and much larger tile sets that require some expensive context switching when the entire transform can&#x27;t fit in the gpu. reply ps 18 hours agoparentprevI have 4090 and M1 Max 64GB. 4090 is far superior on Llama 2. reply jb1991 17 hours agorootparentBut are you using the newly released Apple MLX optimizations? reply ps 17 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s been approximately 2 months since I have tested it, so probably not. reply jb1991 17 hours agorootparentBut those optimizations are the subject of the article you are commenting on. reply astrodust 18 hours agorootparentprevOn modelsM1 Max has 32 GPU cores and a 4090 has 16,000.Apple M1 Max has 32 GPU cores, each core contains 16 Execution Units, each EU has 8 ALUs (also called shaders), so overall there are 4096 shaders. Nvidia RTX 4090 contains 12 Graphics Processing Clusters, each GPC has 12 Streaming Multi-Processors, and each SM has 128 ALUs, overall there are 18432 shaders.A single shader is somewhat similar to a single lane of a vector ALU in a CPU. One can say that a single-core CPU with AVX-512 has 8 shaders, because it can process 8 FP64s at the same time. Calling them \"cores\" (as in \"CUDA core\") is extremely misleading, so \"shader\" became the common name for a GPU&#x27;s ALU due to that. If Nvidia is in charge of marketing a 4-core x86-64 CPU, they would call it a CPU with 32 \"AVX cores\" because each core has 8-way SIMD. reply jrk 16 hours agorootparentActually each of those x86 CPUs probably has at least two AVX FMA units, and can issue 16xFP32 FMAs per cycle – it’s at least “64 AVX cores”! :) reply kimixa 12 hours agorootparentDoesn&#x27;t zen4 have 2x 256-bit FADD and 2x 256-bit FMA, and with avx512 ops it double-pumps the ALU (a good overview here [0]). If you count FADD as a single flop and FMA as 2, that&#x27;s 48 \"1 flop cores\" per core.I think it&#x27;s got the same total FP ALU resources as zen3, and shows how register width and ALU resources can be completely decoupled.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mersenneforum.org&#x2F;showthread.php?p=614191 reply codedokode 18 hours agorootparentprevI think that 4090 has 16000 ALUs, not \"cores\" (let&#x27;s call a component capable to execute instructions independently from others, a \"core\"). And M1 Max probably has more than 1 ALU in every core, otherwise it resembles an ancient GPU. reply rsynnott 18 hours agorootparentYeah; &#x27;core&#x27; is a pretty meaningless term when it comes to GPUs, or at least it&#x27;s meaningless outside the context of a particular architecture.We may just be thankful that this particular bit of marketing never caught on for CPUs. reply stonemetal12 17 hours agorootparentprevNvidia switched to marketing speak a long time ago when it came to the word \"core\". If we go with Nvidia&#x27;s definition then M1 Max has 4096 cores, still behind the 4090, but the gap isn&#x27;t as big as 32 to 16k. reply tiffanyh 18 hours agoprevKey to this article is understanding it’s leveraging the newly released Apple MLX, and their code is using these Apple specific optimizations.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38539153 reply modeless 17 hours agoparentAlso, this is not comparing against an optimized Nvidia implementation. There are faster implementations of Whisper.Edit: OK I took the bait. I downloaded the 10 minute file he used and ran it on my 4090 with insanely-fast-whisper, which took two commands to install. Using whisper-large-v3 the file is transcribed in less than eight seconds. Fifteen seconds if you include the model loading time before transcription starts (obviously this extra time does not depend on the length of the audio file).That makes the 4090 somewhere between 6 and 12 times faster than Apple&#x27;s best. It&#x27;s also much cheaper than M2 Ultra if you already have a gaming PC to put it in, and still cheaper even if you buy a whole prebuilt PC with it.This should not be surprising to people, but I see a lot of wishful thinking here from people who own high end Macs and want to believe they are good at everything. Yes, Apple&#x27;s M-series chips are very impressive and the large RAM is great, but they are not competitive with Nvidia at the high end for ML. reply owehrens 15 hours agorootparentYou mean &#x27;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Vaibhavs10&#x2F;insanely-fast-whisper&#x27; ?

Wouldn’t the better comparison be faster-whisper? reply modeless 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know exactly what the MLX version did, but you&#x27;re probably right. I&#x27;d love to see the MLX side optimized to the max as well. I&#x27;m confident that it would not reach the performance of the 4090, but it might do better.That said, for practical purposes, the ready availability of Nvidia-optimized versions of every ML system is a big advantage in itself. reply darkteflon 13 hours agorootparentYeah, I think everyone knows that Nvidia is doing a cracker job. But it is good to just be specific about these benchmarks because numbers get thrown around and it turns out people are testing different things. The other thing is that Apple is extracting this performance on a laptop, at ~1&#x2F;8 the power draw of the desktop Nvidia card.In any event, it’s super cool to see such huge leaps just in the past year on how easy it is to run this stuff locally. Certainly looking very promising. reply modeless 13 hours agorootparentThe M2 Ultra that got the best numbers that I was comparing to is not in a laptop. Regardless, you&#x27;re probably right that the power consumption is significantly lower per unit time. However, is it lower per unit work done? It would be interesting to see a benchmark optimized for power. Nvidia&#x27;s power consumption can usually be significantly reduced without much performance cost.Also, the price difference between a prebuilt 4090 PC and a M2 Ultra Mac Studio can buy a lot of kilowatt hours. reply swores 15 hours agorootparentprevWould you be so kind as to link to a guide for your method or share it in a comment yourself?I installed following the official docs and found it much, much slower, although I sadly don&#x27;t have a 4090, instead a 3080 Ti 12GB (just big enough to load the large whisper model into GPU memory). reply modeless 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m running on Linux with a 13900k, 64 GB RAM, and I already have CUDA installed.

Many transcription implementations use it to maintain context between the max-30-second chunks Whisper natively supports. reply swores 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll try to understand some of how stuff like faster-whisper works when I&#x27;ve got time over the weekend, but I fear it may be too complex for me...I was rather hoping for a guide of just how to either adapt classic whisper usage or adapt one of the optimised ones like faster-whisper (which I&#x27;ve just set up in a docker container but that&#x27;s used up all the time I&#x27;ve got for playing around right now) to take a text prompt with the audio file. reply owehrens 14 hours agorootparentprevI just can&#x27;t get it to work, it errors out with &#x27;NotImplementedError: The model type whisper is not yet supported to be used with BetterTransformer.&#x27; Did you happen to run into this problem? reply modeless 14 hours agorootparentSorry, I didn&#x27;t encounter that error. It worked on the first try for me. I have wished many times that the ML community didn&#x27;t settle on Python for this reason... reply justinclift 14 hours agorootparentprev> Nvidia at the high end for ML.Wouldn&#x27;t the high end for Nvidia be their dedicated gear rather than a 4090? reply modeless 13 hours agorootparentYes, H100 would be faster still, and Grace Hopper perhaps even somewhat faster. But Apple doesn&#x27;t have comparable datacenter-only products, so it&#x27;s also interesting to see the comparison of consumer hardware. Also, 4090 is cheaper than Apple&#x27;s best, but H100 is more than both (if you are even allowed to buy it). reply WhitneyLand 14 hours agorootparentprevI’m afraid the article as well as your benchmarks can be misleading because there are a lot of different whisper implementations out there.For ex ctranslate optimized whisper “implements a custom runtime that applies many performance optimization techniques such as weights quantization, layers fusion, batch reordering…”Intuitively, I would agree with your conclusion about Apple’s M-Series being impressive for what they do but not generally competitive with Nvidia in ML.Objectively however, I don’t see concluding much with what’s on offer here. Once you start changing libraries, kernels, transformer code, etc you end up with an apples to oranges comparison. reply modeless 14 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s fair to compare the fastest available implementation on both platforms. I suspect that the MLX version can be optimized further. However, it will not close a 10x gap. reply isodev 17 hours agorootparentprevIt also wasn’t optimised for Apple Silicon. Given how the different platforms performed in this test, the conclusions seem pretty solid. reply jbellis 17 hours agorootparentHe is literally comparing whisper.cpp on the 4090 with an optimized-for-apple-silicon-by-apple-engineers version on the M1.ETA: actually it&#x27;s unclear from the article if the whisper optimizations were done by apple engineers, but it&#x27;s definitely an optimized version. reply isodev 16 hours agorootparentMaybe I’m not seeing it right, but comparing the source of Apple’s Whisper to Python Whisper seems there are minimal changes to redirect certain operations to using MLX.There is also cpp Whisper (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;whisper.cpp) which seems to have it’s own kind of optimizations for Apple Silicon - I don’t think this was the one used with Nvidia during the test. reply rowanG077 16 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think whisper was optimized for apple silicon. Doesn&#x27;t it just use MLX? I mean if using an API for a platform counts as specifically optimized then the Nvidia version is \"optimized\" as well since it&#x27;s probably using CUDA. reply intrasight 15 hours agoparentprevHonest question: Why would I (or most users) care? If I have a Mac, I&#x27;m going to get the performance of that machine. If I have a gaming PC, I&#x27;ll get the performance of that machine.

The Nvidia card is far superior.The super optimized code for a network like this is one test case. General networks are another. reply mac-mc 14 hours agorootparentThe \"available VRAM\" is the big difference. You get a lot more to use on an apple silicon machine for much cheaper than you get on an nvidia card on a $&#x2F;GB basis, especially if you want to pass the 24GB threshold. You can&#x27;t use NVIDIA consumer cards after that and there is a shortage of them.The power:perf ratios seem about equal although, so it&#x27;s really up to apple to release equivalently sized silicon on their desktop to really have this be a 1:1 comparison. reply swores 12 hours agorootparentI wonder how complicated it would be to make happen &#x2F; how likely it is to happen, for the Apple way of sharing memory between CPU and GPU to become a thing on PCs. Could NVIDIA do it unilaterally or would it need to be in partnership with other companies?Could anyone who understands this hardware better than me chime in on the complexities of bringing unified ram&#x2F;vram to PC, or reasons it hasn&#x27;t happened yet? reply kalleboo 2 hours agorootparentAMD built \"Heterogeneous System Architecture\" for their APUs to do the same thing, but since their APUs all ended up mostly targeting cheap&#x2F;low-power&#x2F;low-profile laptops and business machines, it was never actually utilized (from what I&#x27;ve been able to find, there&#x27;s no public API to actually use this as designed and you still have to copy things from \"system RAM\" to \"GPU RAM\" even though the hardware was designed to support zero-copy, whereas Apple has made it all automatic when you use Metal) reply mi_lk 15 hours agorootparentprev> The Nvidia card is far superior.I mean, you&#x27;re probably right, but MLX framework was released just a week ago so maybe we don&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s capable of yet. replyFlux159 18 hours agoprevHow does this compare to insanely-fast-whisper though? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Vaibhavs10&#x2F;insanely-fast-whisperI think that not using optimizations allows this to be a 1:1 comparison, but if the optimizations are not ported to MLX, then it would still be better to use a 4090.Having looked at MLX recently, I think it&#x27;s definitely going to get traction on Macs - and iOS when Swift bindings are released https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ml-explore&#x2F;mlx&#x2F;issues&#x2F;15 (although there might be some C++20 compilation issue blocking right now). reply brucethemoose2 18 hours agoparentThis is the thing about Nvidia. Even if some hardware beats them in a benchmark, if its a popular model, there will be some massively hand optimized CUDA implementation that blows anything else out of the water.There are some rare exceptions (like GPT-Fast on AMD thanks to PyTorch&#x27;s hard work on torch.compile, and only in a narrow use case), but I can&#x27;t think of a single one for Apple Silicon. reply jeroenhd 16 hours agorootparentThe one being benchmarked here is heavily optimised for Apple Silicon. I think there are a few algorithms that Apple uses (like the one tagging faces on iPhones) that are heavily optimised for Apple&#x27;s own hardware.I think Apple&#x27;s API would be as popular as CUDA if you could rent their chips at scale. They&#x27;re quite efficient machines that don&#x27;t need a lot of cooling, so I imagine the OPEX of keeping them running 24&#x2F;7 in big cloud racks would be pretty low if they were optimised for server usage.Apple seems to focus their efforts on bringing purpose-built LLMs to Apple machines. I can see why it makes sense (just like Google&#x27;s attempts to bring Tensor cores to mobile) but there&#x27;s not much practical use in this technology right now. Whisper is the first usable technology like this, but even my Android phone can live translate spoken text into words as an accessibility feature, I don&#x27;t think Apple can sell Whisper as a product to end users. reply jdminhbg 16 hours agorootparent> The one being benchmarked here is heavily optimised for Apple Silicon.I don&#x27;t think so, in the sense of a hand-optimized CUDA implementation. This just using the MLX API in the same way that you&#x27;d use CUDA via PyTorch or something. reply mac-mc 14 hours agorootparentprevApple would need to make rackmount versions of the machines with replaceable storage and maybe RAM and would really need to really beef up their headless management systems of the machines before they start becoming competitive.Otherwise you need a whole bunch of custom mac mini style racks and management software which really increases costs and lead times. If you don&#x27;t believe me, look how expensive AWS macOS machines are compared to linux ones with equivalent performance. reply poyu 14 hours agorootparentThey already make rack mount Mac Pros.

It compared a naive implementation in PyTorch which may not even keep 4090 busy (for smaller&#x2F;not-that-compute-intensive models having the entire computation driven by Python is... limiting, which is partly why torch.compile gives amazing improvements) to a purposedly-optimized one (optimized for both CPU&#x2F;GPU efficiency) for Apple Silicon one. reply brucethemoose2 6 hours agorootparentThe pytorch performance is awful though. You&#x27;d have to be kinda crazy to not use an optimized implementation. reply MBCook 17 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn’t be surprised a $2k top of the line GPU is a match&#x2F;better than the built in accelerator on a Mac. Even if the Mac was slightly faster you could just stick multiple GPUs in a PC.To me the news here is how well the Mac runs without needing that additional hardware&#x2F;large power draw on this benchmark. reply NorwegianDude 4 hours agorootparentThe power draw is not impressive here. Sure, it&#x27;s low, but if you account for performance&#x2F;W then the GPU is much more efficient. reply claytonjy 16 hours agoparentprevTo have a good comparison I think we&#x27;d need to run the insanely-fast-whisper code on a 4090.

Power consumption is non-linear with respect to frequency and you see this all the time in high end CPU & GPU parts. Look at something like the eco modes on the Ryzen 7xxx for a great example. The 7950X stock pulls something like 260w on an all core workload at 5.1ghz. Yet enable the 105w eco mode and that power consumption plummets to 160w at 4.8ghz. That means the last 300mhz of performance, which is borderline inconsequential (~6% performance loss), costs 100W. The 65W option then cuts that in half almost again down to 88w (at 4ghz now), for a \"mere\" 20% reduction in performance. Or phrased differently, for 1&#x2F;3rd the power the 7950X will give you 75% of the performance of a 7950X.Matching performance while using less power is impressive. Using less power while also being slower not so much, though. reply nottorp 17 hours agorootparent> Or phrased differently, for 1&#x2F;3rd the power the 7950X will give you 75% of the performance of a 7950X.So where is the - presumably much cheaper - 65 W 7950X? reply dotnet00 17 hours agorootparentWhy would it be much cheaper? The chips are intentionally clocked higher than the most efficient point because the point of the CPU is raw speed, not power consumption, especially since 7950x is a desktop chip.His point is that M-CPUs being somewhat competitive but much more efficient is not as stunning since you&#x27;re comparing a CPU tuned to be at the most efficient speed to a CPU tuned to be at the highest speed.Similarly a 4090&#x27;s power consumption drops dramatically if you underclock or undervolt even slightly, but what&#x27;s the point? You&#x27;re almost definitely buying a 4090 for its raw speed. reply nottorp 16 hours agorootparentBecause they would be able to sell some rejects.And because I don&#x27;t want a software limit that may or may not work. reply wtallis 16 hours agorootparentAMD&#x27;s chiplet-based design means they have plenty of other ways to make good use of parts that cannot hit the highest clock speeds. They have very little reason to do a 16-core low-clock part for their consumer desktop platform.And your concerns about \"a software limit that may or may not work\" are completely at odds with how their power management works. reply dotnet00 15 hours agorootparentprevIt isn&#x27;t a \"software limit\" beyond just being controlled by writing to certain CPU registers via software. It&#x27;s very much a feature of the hardware, the same feature that allows for overclocking the chips. reply kllrnohj 14 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not how binning works. Quality silicon is also the ones that are more efficient. A flagship 65W part would be just as expensive as a result, it&#x27;s the same-ish quality of parts. reply coder543 16 hours agorootparentprevEvery 7950X offers a 65W mode.

It disappeared from my site when it crashed late last year, but for posterity I have reposted it in its unedited entirety] Whenever food poverty, obesity, or food in general comes into the media spotlight, I adopt a mental brace position, awaiting the onslaught of tweets that come, a plague of clockwork cockroaches, wound up and scurrying every which way into the light. Some are clumsily well-intentioned, most are not, yet here they come with their hastily-Googled prices of spring greens and potatoes, crowing about how! cheap! vegetables! are! The latest was Annunziata Rees-Mogg, MEP and sister of sentient haunted Victorian coat rack, Jacob Rees-Mogg, pointing out that raw potatoes were cheaper to buy than oven chips. A 21st Century Marie Antoinette moment, ‘Let Them Eat Spuds!’ but sputtered into the vacuous echo chamber of Twitter, rather than a foundling moment of a revolution. I know the price of a bag of potatoes, Annunziata. Having lived in grinding poverty and with its aching and unshiftable groggy hangover ever since, I know the price of potatoes at three different supermarkets through eight consecutive years. I know the price of potatoes that are fresh, frozen, loose, baking, bulk, tinned, chipped, powdered into instant mash, from the greengrocer, growing my own, and hauled back from the corner shop in five kilogram bags. I know that in 2012 a can of tinned potatoes from Sainsburys was 19 pence for 540g, and now it’s almost doubled to 35p and the Basics range has been renamed Hubbards to give it an aura of respectability in the Brexit-stockpile era. I know that if you really knew your spuds, you’d know that tinned potatoes are the cheapest way to buy them, because they don’t need to be stored in a fridge or freezer, and they make a cracking potato salad, saag aloo, dhansak, casserole and more. I know this, because I’ve been Properly Fucking Poor, and I can tell you the most economical way of buying literally anything. I had an Excel spreadsheet for that sh*t. I still do. But regardless, most people know that potatoes are cheap to buy in an unprocessed state. The difference between you and me isn’t the fifty three pence you claim to save by buying them raw and grubby instead of cuboid and lightly tossed in a smattering of oil. I was evicted from my flat with a toddler when my Housing Benefit was suspended because I was deemed to have made myself deliberately unemployed by having a baby within the confines of a job whose flexible working patterns were a paper policy rather than a reality. (My brother was in the RAF last time we spoke, a couple of Christmases ago, when he described Iain Duncan Smith as the best thing to happen to this country and told me I had chosen to have a baby outside of marriage so deserved everything I got. It’s fair to describe us as ‘estranged’ these days.) I have spent the last seven years working with families who are still in situations similar to the one I found myself in, living in poverty in the sixth richest country in the world. I do almost all of this work for free, not because I can afford to (I can’t), but because that’s just the way it is at the sharp end. We proffer our Widows Mites in the shadows of the noisy Pharisees, and quietly hope it makes a small difference where it’s needed. And day to day, I hear and understand that there are many, many myriad reasons why people choose convenience foods over preparing their own from scratch. I cover a few of them here, in an essay I wrote called My Ready Meal Is None Of Your Business. Sometimes it’s a lack of time. Or a lack of equipment. Living in a bedsit, a B&B, a hostel, a refuge. Poor mental health. Working two or three low paid jobs to make ends meet in a society that is designed around a two median income family. Not believing in a future. Why would you batch cook when you’re suicidal? I know I certainly didn’t. F*cking waste of money cooking enough meals for three days when you’re hoping the fistful of sleeping pills and more that you managed to wheedle from your friendly local GP with your haunted eyes and mad demeanour will help you quietly, gently die in your sleep. I am a bestselling author working on my seventh and eighth books now, and I rent my home because I cannot buy one. I’ve tried. It was humiliating. My credit rating is shot to pieces; CCJs that still haven’t expired block me from getting even a £50 overdraft on my basic bank account. I need a guarantor for my internet contract. I’ll have my forever home one day, for me and my boy. At last count I had moved house over twenty times in my lifetime. The bungalow I rent would cost 37x my annual living wage income to buy, so it probably won’t be this one, but one day, I keep telling us both, as though saying it aloud will manifest it into reality. One day we can paint the walls whatever colour we like. One day we will have a home that will really truly properly be ours. One day the pencil lines in the doorway that I measured your growing on won’t have to be painted over as we throw our things into boxes again. One day we can plant a hydrangea and still be here in the spring to see it grow. I have the date of the last CCJ expiry burned into my conscious brain. I’m counting down to it, and saving up for it, because I’m so very tired of living my life on the run from the noisy wraiths of my past. An unexpected knock on my front door sends me running into a back room, pulling the curtains, making myself small in the corner, holding my breath. It’s a scene my son has witnessed for most of his life. I told him Mummy doesn’t like surprises. I try to laugh at myself afterwards so as not to alarm him. Paint a jolly face on your dolly face, atop your painfully thin ragdolly limbs as you try not to show where the trauma touched you, bending over double in a physical agony because the everyday vulgarities of destitution wrapped your guts in its cold and forceful hands and still won’t let them go. Tugging on them every now and then, just as a reminder. The bile in my throat when I put my PIN in in the supermarket, making a joke to the cashier just like I always did. Getting ready to cheerily promise to come back with another card in a bit, knowing you can’t and never will. The pile of post sitting in the hallway, unopened for months on end, because letters always meant bad things. Brown envelopes especially; I found some from 2013 last week that are still sealed. Sometimes I sit down and go through a pile in a moment of boldness, but there are too many now. And that brings its own headaches, penalties, mental clutter, paranoia, and acute feelings of failure as a parent, as an adult, as the head of a household, as a human being. Sometimes I just want to run back home and live with my parents, at the age of 32, and beg them to take care of me. I’ll be very quiet. I can cook, and I promise not to say f*ck in front of the children, Mum. I won’t fold the corners down on your books, Dad. I move house so often because I never feel secure. I shuffle the furniture around every few weeks, restless, trying to make it feel right. It never does. It never will. As a grimly amusing aside, this led to one of the tabloids recently pooling a pile of my social media photos together to imply that I had a massively grand house because of all of the different rooms. I acidly pointed out that they were the same rooms several times over because I shift everything around all the time. They didn’t amend the article, but I suppose it’s a compliment to my interior decoration in a roundabout way. For the record, it’s a modest sized three bed dormer bungalow, and two of the bedrooms are very small because they’re in the eaves of the roof. Cracking great garden though, and enough room to do my job and have a nice family life with the lad, and it’s the nicest home I’ve ever rented on a very long list of addresses. I’m mostly happy here, but every now and again a white van will park outside and I’ll start searching my emails for the TV license number, or there’ll be an unexpected knock on the door and I’ll run away. Someone will pull into my drive in a three point turn and I’ll be flat to the wall, peering out of a crack in the many layers of voiles, trying to see who they are. A payday loan email pings into my inbox, and I’m momentarily tempted. I keep a literal stock check sheet of how many portions of every single cooking ingredient I have in the house at any given time, and am constantly mentally re-evaluating it to work out how many days meals I could survive on in a crisis. I am an absolute Scrooge about the heating. The boiler and hot water are off for 23 hours of the day for most of the year. I have an electric fire in the lounge and an electric blanket on both of our beds, and we use those most of the time rather than heat the entire house. I can be frivolous in some areas – I have slowly finally bought some decent furniture for my rented home for the first time in my life, having spent a decade fishing it out of skips and carrying it home from thrift stores, and I own a few pieces of designer clothing that I bought with my first couple of book deal advances, but I don’t run a car (never finished driving lessons), still don’t have contents insurance (a hangover from poverty, I just wasn’t in the habit of insuring things and now keep putting it off, because paperwork terrifies me), and am not so much financially illiterate as simply chaotic. Partly severe adult ADHD, partly avoidance, partly monsters in my head. Give me a tenner for groceries and I can make it last a week. Give me a bank card and I’m a wreck. So I have a GoHenry account (hashtag-not-an-advert), designed for children’s pocket money, that is the only one I leave the house with. I set myself a small weekly spending limit for fripperies and groceries and my other bank cards are in a locked box in a locked cupboard. Because I’m never going back to the bad place again, and I will put whatever ridiculous measures in place I have to, to safeguard against that. My route out of poverty was a fluke; a series of linked events and timely accidents and to be honest, a bit of a blurry timeline, but I’ll try to simplify it as best as possible for those that don’t know, with the caveat that it is a period of my life that I have buried deep inside a locked and cavernous part of myself, that a year in therapy has only really started to rattle the padlock of with a hairpin. I had started to attend local council meetings and wrote about them on my online blog, called Our Southend at the time. A local councillor, Anna Waite, had grumbled on the front page of the local newspaper that ‘druggies drunks and single mums were ruining our town’. I wrote a letter to the paper that was so long they had to serialise it across three days, and one of my friends suggested I start a blog. So I did. And I wanted to know who these people were who were making the everyday decisions that impacted me, my child, my friends and my community. Who was threatening to shut the library that we wandered around in to keep warm? Who was closing the children’s centre that I would rely on for childcare if I found a job? Did any of these people look like me? The blog had a handful of readers, mostly fellow local politics buffs, and it was crude and tribal and mostly furious. I had always enjoyed writing at school, but left at 16 with four and a half GCSEs. The half was Short Course Religious Education, and an A*, to boot. I had no idea half a GCSE was even a thing before I was exactly that amount short of taking my A Levels and thrust into the cold world of minimum wage employment. My Wikipedia page incorrectly says that I have seven – I’ll clear this up once and for all. I sat seven GCSEs at school, having been pulled out of the others after being predicted ‘failure’ grades, which at the all-girls-grammar was classed as anything below a B so as not to upset their precious league table results. The Times did an expose on this practise last year and my Facebook was alight with women who had been in my year at school all saying the same thing – this has been happening for decades, why is it only being talked about now? Anyway, I sat seven GCSEs, and I passed four and a half of them. So there you go. My Careers Advisor had boredly steered me towards the British Army recruiting office, suggesting entry level jobs in cooking, or the engineers. I went for an interview, at 16, cannon fodder with a skinhead, but for several reasons, didn’t sign up. I never considered pursuing writing as a career, and even now it astounds me that not only do I do it for a living with literally no qualifications for it, but my work is on the National Curriculum. Not bad, for a working class girl whose first job was cleaning tables at the local Wimpy on a Saturday and working weekdays in a chip shop. Back – or forward – to 2012, and as my world shrank into a tiny flat, as friends fell away and I started to isolate myself from my family in shame and self-loathing and depression, the blog expanded to fill the space that human contact had left behind. I started to write about my day to day life, the mundane dreariness of living in a world of ‘no’. No you can’t have a comic. No there isn’t any afters. No you can’t have seconds. No we can’t go to the funfair on the seafront. No you’ll just have to wear those shoes for a bit longer and I’m sorry, I’ll stuff one of the free newspapers inside them to try to stretch them a little bit. No the heaters ‘don’t work’. No I don’t have any money to give you today, Mr Aggressive Bailiff Man. No I don’t have anything for you to take away, either. No I can’t come out for a pint. No, I don’t have the internet at home. No I can’t clear my rent arrears. No, please don’t make us leave, this is our home. Then, in late 2012, Lisa Markwell was writing an article for the Independent about hospital food, back when it was a printed newspaper. I don’t remember exactly what was said but it was something about the cost of it, and maybe something about how for the money spent it could be better? Anyway, I tweeted her from my small, local politics and single mum fury twitter account and said that I had £7 for the weeks food for me and my son. She messaged me and asked if she could include it in the article. I said yes. It appeared as a gratifyingly brief single line in a short entry about the state of hospital meals, and Lisa stayed in touch with me to check how I was doing every now and then. A couple of months later, a friend of mine sent me a press enquiry. ‘They’re looking for a Mum who’s going to have a really sh*t Christmas and I thought of you’ was the general gist of it. I bolted. Absolutely not; I’d managed to hide my situation from almost everyone I knew, there was no way I was talking to the national press about it. ‘They’ll pay you £250’, he added. It was a few days before Christmas. I had no presents for my son, no decorations, no tree, no cards, no heating, nothing. It was for the Sunday People. Nobody reads that anyway, I thought to myself, and reluctantly agreed to talk to them. As part of the interview, they asked me for a receipt from my weekly shop. I still have it in a box somewhere. The journalist sat in silence as she looked at the extremely short list of very basic groceries for a long and uncomfortable time. ‘What….do you make….with this?’ she asked. ‘Carrot and kidney bean burgers with that and that, then the same ingredients can be used to make a soup, and then…’ you get the idea. They included it in a sidebar on the double page spread, and I used the money from the interview to pay some bills and buy some £5 Mickey Mouse roller-skates for my son and a few festive bits and pieces. The world span madly on. Then the Telegraph got in touch, asking if they could profile me for the paper. The writer seemed kind, and friendly, and so I said yes. Xanthe Clay came round for lunch, and we are still friends seven years later. She wrote a generous full page about my cooking, austerity cuts, and allowed me the space that the Sunday People had not to get a bit political and feisty. It was called My 49p Lunch With A Girl Called Jack and shortly afterwards, Penguin contacted me to offer me a recipe book deal. I had applied for over 300 jobs since leaving the Fire Service. I had no confidence whatsoever in my ability to write a book – I didn’t even have a computer by now, having pawned it to pay some rent arrears – but what they were offering me was akin to a job. So I said yes. I didn’t expect anything from it, but it would give me a cushion to sink into while I found regular work. I took the phonecall while standing in the queue for the food bank, and literally collapsed with shock. Sitting in a back room with a volunteer and hot sweet tea and my bewildered looking child, I just cried and cried and cried. It was over, for a while. The cold and the fear and the hunger and the frightens and the door knocks, would be over for a while. I wrote the majority of A Girl Called Jack by email on a Nokia E72. I still have it in my desk drawer, and every now and then I just stare at it, and its tiny awful buttons, and wonder how the f*ck I did it. Because I had no other choice but to. It was my one chance at escape, my yellow brick road, my shiny red slippers, and I took it. I remember, weeks after signing the contract, sleeping on the floor of a single bedroom in a house share I shared with five people and a bedroom I shared with my son, writing an email to Penguin begging them to release the initial signature payment because the local council had read about my book deal in the paper and withdrawn all of my benefits and I couldn’t pay my rent. To this day we (the council and I) remain in dispute about that period of my life. When one of my editors, a sweet Irish woman called Tamsin, discovered I was writing the book on my phone, she cleared a desk for me at their enormous great big office on the Strand with the big gold doors and insisted I come and work there to finish the manuscript. I had to wait for my signature payment to come through before I could afford the train fare, and some clothes that would be suitable to wear in an office environment, but she and everyone at Penguin were extraordinarily kind to me. Even when I produced a handwritten notebook of recipes and tried to hand it in as a completed manuscript, thinking that that was how real authors did things. (It is not, and do not ever do this to your editors, because it frightens the life out of them.) A Girl Called Jack was a surprising success. And so – in the way that my calamitous life seems to work – my then-agency didn’t pay me my royalties for it. And they stonewalled every enquiry I made for months on end, claming amongst other things that I’d never been on their books. I was still a highlight on their website at the time. I have a new agent now, who fought a lengthy and frustrating battle to get some of them back to me. I think I had to sign a contract saying I wouldn’t mention it publicly. Oh well. We also had a contract saying that they would pay me what I earned, so we both know the value of a sodding signature, don’t we? It took almost three years to get back part of what I was owed, what I had worked for, what I had tapped out in the dark on my mobile phone night after night after night. I’m still angry. Recipes written from food bank parcels, by a single mother, in the cold wasteland of suicidal ideation and only-just-surviving. You would be angry too. Anyway. The point of this was to point out that I am not a success story. I’m not an inspiration, and I’m not an example. I am a broken, f*cked up, messy rotten husk of a human being who almost died – several times – under benefit fuckups and austerity measures. I still live in fear, haunted by hunger and cold and failure and self-neglect. My mental health is an absolute shitshow. I have arthritis, diagnosed in my mid twenties, likely exacerbated by living in bitter cold and damp and mould for two whole winters and every day and night in between. I am cold, closed, and still angry. Post traumatic stress has cost me every single long term relationship ever since. I retreat into the basest of animal instincts when I am frightened, curling into a ball, howling, roaring, sobbing, clawing at the floor. That switch can flick from anything from a noise in the garden at night, to a missed bill payment starting a spiral of avoidance into red-topped letters, again. The fear never goes away. I understand now that it probably never will. Poverty has been proven to change the very makeup of a persons brain. I am damaged beyond reasonable repair. I know, because I have tried everything, from NHS therapists to a crisis care team to a stint at The Priory. Hypnotherapy, herbal tea, yoga, big walks, religion, vodka, talking, cardio, volunteer work, wounded healer nonsense, you name it, I’ve probably given it a go. So all I think I can do, and what I try to do, is use my experiences to make things better for other people in similar situations. I don’t always get it right, but I try my best with what I have and who I have become in this emotional wasteland. And then, I reason with myself, it was for something. Like kintsugi for the fibre of my being, crawling around picking up the broken pieces and trying to patch them back together with slivers of gold. Making something useful, and not altogether hideous, from the wreckage. This is longer than I intended but I guess I had things to say. And my main point is that poverty and privilege are largely accidental. You don’t choose to be born into an income bracket, a country pile, a housing estate, a double barrelled name or a damp tenement bedsit. But ignorance is a choice. And choosing to use your privileges to patronise people whose lives are entirely beyond your experience and comprehension, is a choice. Choosing to use the powers vested in you by the constituencies you serve, to deprive those same constituents of light, heating, food and home security is a wilful and deliberate act. And it has to stop. Because I am one of millions of people who has lived in bitter, life-changing, cruel poverty in this country, and I will continue to tell my story with all of the uncomfortable details and horror and fury until that changes for the better. And if your response to people in crisis is to simply lecture paternalistically about how you would be better at being poor than they would, I suggest you put your money where your flapping great mouth is, and give it all away. To women refuges, child support services, food banks, and every other organisation trying to patch up the screaming great holes in the social security safety nets that millions of children are falling through. You may well know the price of potatoes, but in order to tackle food poverty on a real level, not just a pontification for a jolly brouhaha on the internet, you need to understand the value of compassion as well. The face of a charity campaign about poverty, either CPAG or Oxfam. Exhausted, hungry and very thin. 2013. One of my shopping receipts, 2012. My lunch, April 2013. Weekly food shop, 2013. The mirrored tiles were my landlords decision, not mine, but I did like them. Shame the rest of the flat was a cold damp sh*thole, but the very tiny kitchen was alright. Rice with lemon curd, chicken stock and mixed frozen vegetables. Accompanying carrot, kidney bean and cumin patty. Dinner, 2013. Another measly receipt, 2013 this time. Shooting A Girl Called Jack. (The late) John Hamilton, art director. Me. Lindsey Evans, my brilliant editor. Rob Allinson, food stylist. Pic taken by Susan Bell, photographer. We shot it in my tiny damp flat and it was fun and everyone was really kind. Spring 2013. We did this a lot, coz it was free. Absolutely bizarrely sent to the G8 summit on behalf of Oxfam to write about David Cameron’s keynote speech. Snuck into the big dinner and nicked a load of bread rolls. Got accosted by the PSNI in the press pit the next day because I ‘didn’t look like a journalist’. Don’t think they knew about the rolls but when four men with big guns tap you on the shoulder and tell you to go with them RIGHT NOW it’s an experience you don’t forget in a hurry. I made it back for the end of the speech, though. Another variation on rice with mixed frozen veg, 2013. That measly bowl was lunch and dinner. F*ck me this is a bit repetitive. And that’s the point. Here we go again! My god there’s a reason I barely eat rice any more. More rice and veg. 2013. And an apple. The sheer profligacy of it all. A flat I was refused a viewing on, to rent, because I was on benefits. October 2012. I still remember how humiliated I was standing in their office being told I wasn’t the kind of tenant they wanted. A couple of years later I was elected as the tenants rep to an advisory group for local landlords and agents and I recounted that story in my thank you speech, in front of all of their peers. Light of my life, and the boy I would do anything for. March 2012. Note the too-small trousers, the cold red face and hands and feet and the hard wooden floor, two tops and a jumper. Don’t talk to me about socks, kids are awful at keeping those on. Even now, eight years later, I have to pointedly tell him to put his socks on! But at least his trousers fit these days. February 2013. Same nonsense, seven years ago. I’m so very tired. They called me Jackie because they thought their readers would think my name was weird. I think it’s weirder calling me something that’s not my name, but there we go. Click here for my books! All text copyright Jack Monroe.

I can clearly see that, and that I was the lucky one to find a way up many times.Yet, my new social circle believe that I&#x27;m talented because of my DNA and efforts, and blame others for their poverty.But I know that those people making \"poor\" decisions in the view of riches are actually just trying to survive. With themselves, with the baggage they carry, and to the fact that they weren&#x27;t as lucky as me.Talent, intelligence is literally everywhere. People that are awesome and ambitious is abundant.Nobody is really much better than others, but America post-ww2 managed to sell this idea to everyone, including many really smart and talented folks, that think they are gifted.To sum up, nobody chooses to be poor and humanity could progress faster if we focused instead in eliminating poverty, creating more possibilities for everyone...Than believing almost trillionaries will guide us to where we need it. reply dcist 16 hours agoparentSome people are indeed much better. Anyone who played sports as a kid understands this. Huge differences are immediately apparent in small children. But generally, I agree that, for most life tasks, the differences between people are not enormous. Humanity could do a much better job eliminating poverty. In the future, we may view enormous disparities in wealth as evil as we do racism today. reply lwhi 16 hours agorootparentBetter at sports .. but I bet there&#x27;s a fairly even distribution between people who have money and don&#x27;t.> In the future, we may view enormous disparities in wealth as evil as we do racism today.A lot of people already do. reply ajkjk 16 hours agorootparentYeah seriously, it&#x27;s pretty much standard at this point. reply WendyTheWillow 16 hours agorootparentprevAnd a lot of people would be very wrong. There’s a floor to survivability, below which you can’t keep yourself alive, but there is no ceiling. If everyone is above the floor, there’s no reason for concern about those looking for the ceiling.In the future we’ll pull people up to the floor, but that doesn’t require attaching a ceiling. The will never be a successful society that substantially punishes achievement above a certain point. reply lwhi 16 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re wrong.Fundamentally it requires redistribution and a complete change of mindset. reply WendyTheWillow 14 hours agorootparentA shallow dismissal is less valuable than an excellent critical comment. Please share with me (and others) what&#x27;s wrong with my thinking. I&#x27;m trying to be transparent about my reasoning in child comments, so hopefully, you will have enough to work with. reply yawpitch 13 hours agorootparent> a shallow dismissal is less valuable than an excellent critical commentAn excellent critical comment is wasted on a shallow argument… your thinking assumes that reaching beyond the metaphorical ceiling doesn’t require standing atop those still struggling to reach the metaphorical floor… it absolutely and necessarily does. Worse, you seem to think that reaching for means that vastly outstrip your need is somehow noble. It isn’t… it’s pathetic. reply WendyTheWillow 12 hours agorootparentIf Jimmy turns a piece of wood and some graphite into a pencil, he has created value. That didn&#x27;t require exploiting the lumberjack or the miner. Jimmy did not steal value from either. He created value by inventing a new way for their raw materials to be useful to other people. Jimmy didn&#x27;t need to \"stand atop\" anyone to do this.What&#x27;s \"pathetic\" are the ad hominems and insults the people in this thread have to resort to when they can&#x27;t argue like adults. You&#x27;re not right because you&#x27;re angry, and you weaken your advocacy by trying to use your frustration as leverage over people giving reasoned arguments. reply yawpitch 11 hours agorootparentIf Jimmy only ever prototyped the pencil by collecting and working the wood and graphite himself then, sure, he didn’t exploit anyone… as soon as he went into business employing others to manufacture those pencils he started to. The moment he concentrated the means of pencil production in his own hands he started to exploit both his raw suppliers — that graphite miner’s health woes are the fruit of Jimmy’s demand — and his employees. In the end it was the people actually turning the raw materials into pencils that made the value; the invention added nothing until someone’s labour was exploited. reply WendyTheWillow 10 hours agorootparentJimmy didn&#x27;t do any of those things. The claim was that Jimmy can&#x27;t produce value, but he did.And even so, the work the people making the pencils for Jimmy would not exist without Jimmy. Jimmy, in yet another way, provides value. Jimmy figured out to put the wood with the graphite, not them. Who actually does it is irrelevant; or are you suggesting that if Jimmy kept his operation entirely mechanical, that&#x27;d be better? reply mfru 1 hour agorootparent> the work the people making the pencils for Jimmy would not exist without JimmyApart from this example being overly reductive and not rooted in reality, the hypothetical Jimmy would eventually be replaced by someone else who would invent this pencil.There is no truth that needs a single person to be uncovered. There are infinitely many people able to invent the pencil given enough tries and time.

We won&#x27;t have a complete answer until most of the genes that affect intelligence are found. With regard to your specific question of if educational attainment is the main factor in causing IQ to increase, that would mean that everyone at high-school would have the same IQ because they all have the same educational attainment (inasmuch as what \"educational attainment\" means in this paper). Wealth of one&#x27;s parents is a harder problem. I believe that it is not a significant contributing factor beyond not being malnourished. This is based on the fact that the average IQ of some poor countries is higher than the average IQ of some richer countries. But like I said a complete solution to this problem, or – more boldly – an answer that blank-slatists would have no choice but to accept, would involve a more complete understanding of the genetic component including most genes as well as relevant ncDNA sequences. reply SketchySeaBeast 15 hours agorootparentEven if genetics is the \"main determinant\" what does that mean?

My point is that if education attainment only exists as a difference after high-school (for the most part). Therefore if \"IQ follows educational attainment\" IQ would be the same until after high-school. I do think wealth, nutrition and education have some effect on IQ. I do not know to what extent. You had asked if we are sure that IQ follows those other factors. To answer completely, IQ follows genetics as well as other factors, mainly genetics. I truly believe that this is a scientific question that can be answered with observation. I think in twenty years or less we will have cataloged most of the genes that affect intelligence and the nature vs. nurture argument will have a direct answer. (or, at least, the nature side of the equation will be mostly solved.) Currently the hardware to collect this data is expensive (Illumina machines are $1M last I checked) and the methods of analyzing the data are somewhat crude (eg. GWAS). As these two fronts advance more and more genes will be found until most of it is known. reply shkkmo 15 hours agorootparentprevGenetics account for roughly half of the variation of intelligence between individuals.That leaves a ton of room for other factors, such as nutrition, health, and education, to create significant disparities. reply PeterisP 13 hours agorootparentMy subjective impression from the correlation studies that I have seen is that the remainder largely is a long list of purely negative factors - i.e. in the \"nurture\" stage there are many ways to screw up the development of children with a large impact, but limited ways to meaningfully improve it over the genetic &#x27;baseline&#x27;.I.e. the correlation of nutrition in IQ is mostly driven by malnutrition, not by differences between great nutrition and mediocre nutrition; the impact of parenting is heavily driven by the outlier cases of severe abuse or deprivation, not the differences between great parenting and mediocre parenting, the impact of peer groups is largely set by the minority of cases that result in severe addiction or gang membership, not the difference between lousy friends and great friends, etc - that&#x27;s the pattern that I seem to see there. reply fngjdflmdflg 14 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a source for that claim? Might you be misquoting a different popular statistic that g accounts for roughly have of intelligence between individuals? Or perhaps the figure that intelligence is about 50% heritable?[0] It is important to note that heritability of a trait and the extent to which a trait is genetically caused are not the same. It is possible for a trait to be eg. 80% caused by genetics and only 60% heritable, even on the average.

The strict father is the moral authority who supports and defends the family, tells his wife what to do, and teaches his kids right from wrong. The only way to do that is through painful discipline - physical punishment that by adulthood will become internal discipline. The good people are the disciplined people. Once grown, the self-reliant, disciplined children are on their own. Those children who remain dependent (who were spoiled, overly willful, or recalcitrant) should be forced to undergo further discipline or be cut free with no support to face the discipline of the outside world.So, project this onto the nation and you see that to the right wing, the good citizens are the disciplined ones - those who have already become wealthy or at least self-reliant - and those who are on the way. Social programs, meanwhile, \"spoil\" people by giving them things they haven&#x27;t earned and keeping them dependent. The government is there only to protect the nation, maintain order, administer justice (punishment), and to provide for the promotion and orderly conduct of business. In this way, disciplined people become self-reliant. Wealth is a measure of discipline.

But if we would spread welfare for them to have that choice, who would then choose work in those bad conditions for nothing to provide western consumers with cheap commodities? Robots aren&#x27;t even remotely there yet. Same with mining minerals to make iPhones, PlayStations and EVs.If we were to make their lives and jobs fair while also watching over the environment, then the price of commodities would explode, so the mega conglomerates who own these markets, like Nestle or Apple for example, would have to take a missive hit on their profits, or the western consumers would have to stomach the explosion in prices, or both simultaneously, neither of which are acceptable trade-offs in the west, so we keep the status quo of having to rely on perpetual underclasses of people slaving away in poverty for us, while pretending we&#x27;re great humanitarians and benefactors.I said \"we\" here, because it&#x27;s not just the great evil billionaires like Bezos, Jobs, Saudis, and so many others who profit from and enable this exploitation, but also the western governments like US, Switzerland, Netherlands, etc. where they&#x27;re HQ but have the audacity to lecture them on human rights and environment concerns, plus the individual shareholders, employees, taxpayers and consumers who enable them as well.Sure, a lot of people in poor nations got out of poverty \"thanks\" to globalization and mega conglomerates outsourcing of less desirable manufacturing and services there, but let&#x27;s not forget they didn&#x27;t do this out of the goodness of their hearts, but to extract even more profits.

The first time, one of the women looked at me and I looked at her. She went to church with my mum. She said, ‘Your mum will be devastated.’ And I said, ‘You can’t tell anyone. You haven’t seen me.’ She said, ‘Your parents will help you,’ and I said, ‘They can’t know.’”> That’s what I don’t understand, I say. Why didn’t you tell your parents when they were in a position to help? “Because … ” For once, she slows down. “I was ashamed. I was ashamed that I had had a good job and I’d fucked it. I was embarrassed that I’d ended up not being able to provide for my son, and I was worried that if I told a soul, the walls would come crumbling down. Because my parents had fostered for most of my childhood, I’d grown up with this fear that if I ever had a child, he would be taken into care. That I would be an unfit mother. I’d grown up with almost 100 children revolving through my childhood home. So in my head, nearly every kid went into care because nearly every kid I came across was in the care system. I was terrified that if I told anyone, my son would be taken into care.”So the shame itself was one of the biggest obstacles - compounded by the idea that poverty is evidence of personal inadequacy or moral weakness.There is a problem with lack of community there: the feeling that really struggling means that you don&#x27;t deserve help, because that&#x27;s the message you get from your society. (And it certainly doesn&#x27;t help that lack of money excludes you from all kinds of normal social activities, as she mentions in the article.) reply 0xbadcafebee 12 hours agoparentprev> \"Where is her community?\"You could ask the same of homeless people, drug addicts, people with mental issues, people from foster care, criminals, the elderly.

Single mothers are one of those groups that can quickly be kicked out of, or need to escape from, their community, and have a hard time building a new one.Growing up in the USA, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the West that has a problem with community - I think it&#x27;s the Caucasian West. Latin&#x2F;Hispanic families are highly connected, as are Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern, etc. Some cultures are highly collective and have strong support structures for extended family. Immigrant communities also tend to have stronger bonds as they may depend more on each other in a new land. OTOH some cultures are more individualist, having expanded the concept of the \"nuclear family\" in the early 20th century, weakening extended family bonds. In the conservative caucasian West, the nuclear family is now seen as the \"traditional\" family structure, which is odd, because everywhere else in the world it&#x27;s non-traditional. reply yardstick 15 hours agoparentprev> Jack really did suffer alone.Not due to the lack of others help.

You could easily get a 2 bed in London for under £2000&#x2F;month plus expenses, so seems rather odd to be living in such an expensive area outside of London yet still cry poverty and woe-is-me.It feels like a lot of it is due to her mental health - not just the ADHD, but general insecurities, and also alcoholism (drinks as both a symptom and cause). replyMichaelRo 16 hours agoprev>> My brother was in the RAF last time we spoke>> Sometimes I just want to run back home and live with my parents, at the age of 32, and beg them to take care of me.Well this doesn&#x27;t sound like someone who is destitute and with no safety net whatsoever.What&#x27;s so wrong living with your parents? For most of human history it was the normal thing to do. Parents will take care of kids and one of them will inherit the parent&#x27;s house and take care of the old parents. Have his own kids and have the grandparents helping with raising them.Also I&#x27;m not so sure about UK but around here there&#x27;s quite a significant rural population. Not everyone can or wants to make it in the big city. Life in the countryside is a lot cheaper, everything&#x27;s cheaper. House prices are a joke compared to big cities and still villages get slow but steady depopulated.On the other hand I do know people, excluding the homeless, who really have nothing. Father lost the apartment to gambling then disappeared, mother died, kid got evicted in the street in the middle of the winter, worked heavy construction jobs until got sick and had to file for disability and now all his income is a miserable pension that can&#x27;t even pay for food let alone a rent in the city. And he&#x27;s better off than the homeless or the gypsies who live off the city&#x27;s garbage dump.So I&#x27;m not saying the author has it easy but rather than some of it is a deliberate choice. reply PuffinBlue 16 hours agoparentShe doesn’t have a car or license. So living in the countryside in the UK is a non-starter. When you’re living life on hard mode already due to poverty and the pernicious destruction of control over your own time that that causes, trying to exist without personal transport and a child is impossible.I know. I’ve experienced it first hand (as the kid).To your point about deliberate choice: What I do recognise from the article, and it was clear before she mentioned it, were the signs and symptoms or untreated trauma and ADHD. The deleterious effect of those conditions on decision making often seem to us observers as ‘deliberate choices’. This can be very frustrating for those of us who would and do make different choices in similar situations. reply pseudalopex 15 hours agoparentprevShe said her brother said she deserved everything she got.

Why didn’t you tell your parents when they were in a position to help? “Because … ” For once, she slows down. “I was ashamed. I was ashamed that I had had a good job and I’d fucked it. I was embarrassed that I’d ended up not being able to provide for my son, and I was worried that if I told a soul, the walls would come crumbling down. Because my parents had fostered for most of my childhood, I’d grown up with this fear that if I ever had a child, he would be taken into care. That I would be an unfit mother. I’d grown up with almost 100 children revolving through my childhood home. So in my head, nearly every kid went into care because nearly every kid I came across was in the care system. I was terrified that if I told anyone, my son would be taken into care.” Monroe decided to flog pretty much everything she owned to pay for her rent. She waited until her parents were away, then put a notice in the local paper. It ended up running a story about her and, unsurprisingly, her parents found out. “They were really upset. They came round with two Sainsbury’s bags for life. It was like Christmas. All this stuff that we hadn’t had for ages. There was a box of Coco Pops! I sat there like a child and ate bowl after bowl.” “” reply pseudalopex 14 hours agorootparentShe is not someone who has no safety net evidently.

Yes, it would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn’t. When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don’t want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit ’tasty’. There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you. Let’s have three pennorth of chips! Run out and buy us a twopenny ice-cream! Put the kettle on and we’ll all have a nice cup of tea! That is how your mind works when you are at the P.A.C. level. White bread-and-marg and sugared tea don’t nourish you to any extent, but they are nicer (at least most people think so) than brown bread-and-dripping and cold water. Unemployment is an endless misery that has got to be constantly palliated, and especially with tea, the English-man’s opium. A cup of tea or even an aspirin is much better as a temporary stimulant than a crust of brown bread.George Orwell - The Road to Wigan Pier reply lb1lf 16 hours agoparent&#x27;The Road to Wigan Pier&#x27; and &#x27;Down and Out in Paris and London&#x27; (also by Orwell) are the starkest accounts of poverty and what it does to you I have ever read. reply jonatron 17 hours agoprevA recent UK Channel 4 TV programme talked about the recent decline in quality of food too. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.channel4.com&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;the-truth-about-food-pri...

I was one of the gifted kids who probably should have worked at NASA, but nobody warned me that I&#x27;d grow up to be a people-pleaser due to ADHD symptoms. I didn&#x27;t know how important it was to set boundaries to protect my mind and body, because as a geek, I didn&#x27;t value my own time and had no real need of money if I could just be left alone.But see, that&#x27;s the thing: poor people can&#x27;t get left alone. Borrowing money makes one a slave. Working as a wage slave at a low-paying job makes one a slave. Not having the money to afford to live alone, much less date or travel or do middle class things - destroys mental health and makes one a slave. Despite periodic financial stability and healthy relationships, I know deep down that I&#x27;ve mostly lived as a slave.The big epiphany came for me during the pandemic. I hit such a rock-bottom low after developing food sensitivities and chronic fatigue from stress that rendered me unable to work for 6 months in 2019, that I left logic-based reality when COVID hit in 2020. I had to shift laterally through meditation into a neighboring reality where magic returned (where we are now at the time of this writing), in order for my soul to want to continue in this incarnation. TikTok was the gateway drug to Alan Watts, Terence McKenna and Dolores Cannon (among a great many others).Now I view Big Tech as a clear and present danger to world peace, especially with the arrival of AI. All creative work will lose its value within 5 years. Even the security of our programming jobs isn&#x27;t something that can be counted on, as AI will perform better than us at all problem solving within 10 years. Nearly all projections for environmental health, wealth inequality, the rise of authoritarianism, etc etc etc predict collapse between 2040 and 2050. We&#x27;re either going to defeat the status quo or all be enslaved.The fix is so easy and obvious that most people can&#x27;t see it: tax the uber rich. Start undoing all of the trickle-down legislation passed since Reagan and put the new tax revenue towards automating the work that slaves must perform to acquire the resources to survive. Specifically: fund universal healthcare, affordable college, low-cost housing&#x2F;staple foods&#x2F;natural monopolies like internet service, and most importantly - UBI.Unfortunately about half of thought leaders have either never been poor, or been poor but arrived at a pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps worldview through survivorship bias (why billionaires usually subscribe to right-wing ideology). A vanishingly small number of people go on a healing and growth journey, eventually experiencing a spiritual awakening and arriving at a leftist or trans-political worldview based on the dignity of all living things, valuing conscious awareness most of all.I&#x27;ve let go of expectation that things will get better through practical application of logic, as it&#x27;s probably too late for that. But I&#x27;ve put conscious effort into manifestation and witnessed how outer reality improves as inner reality heals. Now I lead a life of service, often sacrificing what might have been in this life to improve the lives of others, in recognition that I may be them in my next life, because we are all one. As above, so below. And so it is.Edit: I forgot to make my point: it only takes 1% of the population waking up to cause a shift towards world peace. That&#x27;s why the wealthiest 1% wield ego-based tools like fintech to suppress awakening and build empire. But the rise of the dark side is always balanced by the rise of the light side through natural law. So I believe that the meekest among us - the poor, the infirm, the light workers - are our best hope for healing and eventual peace as we transition into the New Age. reply distcs 16 hours agoprev> still don’t have contents insurance (a hangover from poverty, I just wasn’t in the habit of insuring things and now keep putting it off, because paperwork terrifies me)The author seems to be from UK.

What&#x27;s frustrating though is that the people making these stupid suggestions never actually engage with the clear and obvious shortcomings in their philosophy. They have taken a stupid position, it results in them making dumb comments, and when it&#x27;s pointed out that what they&#x27;re saying is dumb... they either just ignore or double down.

The obesity rate in the UK is 27%; the poverty rate is 17%, and I doubt the overlap is that strong (the link below supports me). Many of her examples in fact deal with people who can&#x27;t afford things that aren&#x27;t food, like a kitchen, or free time.On the one hand, it&#x27;s certainly true that the support for the poor is insufficient, but the price of food, being perhaps the lowest it has been in thousands of years in real terms, is probably the wrong lever to pull. Consequently, \"food poverty\" is a misclassification, since, while spending £7 per week on food, she probably spent more on transportation, housing and possibly clothing (which can be essential to actually getting work), and it would make more of a difference to tackle that. (She recounts severe problems getting a home!)If she had been able to spend half as much on food, would that meaningfully improve her life? An extra £3.5 per week isn&#x27;t yanking anyone out of poverty.In fact, there is more evidence that obesity causes poverty than that poverty contributes to obesity! See:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5781054&#x2F;There are some suggestions that deficiencies in certain minerals, particularly zinc, which is most concentrated in relatively expensive foods like beef and oysters, are correlated with obesity and disordered eating. A bottle of zinc gluconate makes potatoes look like matsutake (at least at wholesale prices), but the safe and effective use of the supplements (avoiding overuse) is not well established or normally recommended.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s12011-020-02060-8The point I guess I want to make is that we should have compassion for the author, but that compassion should ignite the best faculties of our minds — the desire to really understand the problem, because that is where solutions come from. reply bluedino 15 hours agoparent> The obesity rate in the UK is 27%; the poverty rate is 17%, and I doubt the overlap is that strongUS, not the UK:Counties with poverty rates of >35% have obesity rates 145% greater than wealthy counties.Back to Europe:The Paradox of Poverty and ObesityAmong the reasons for the growing obesity in the population of poor people are: higher unemployment, lower education level, and irregular meals.

So far things have been going pretty smoothly. The project earned 5.6k stars on GitHub, 1073 upvotes on Hacker News, and received press coverage from Hackaday. Yesterday I cut a 0.3 release so let's see what it can do. Getting Started The easiest way to get started is to download one of my prebuilt .llamafile files on Hugging Face. The one we'll be using for this tutorial is a command-line interface for a multmodal vision model called LLaVA. It's able to do things that aren't possible with the OpenAI API, like describing images. The first step is to download your llamafile. It'll run on MacOS / Linux / Windows / BSDs. wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/llava-v1.5-7B-GGUF/resolve/main/llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile chmod +x llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile Then test that it works: ./llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile --version llamafile v0.3.0 main If you have any issues with the above, then see the Gotchas section of the README. MacOS users need Xcode. Linux users might need a binfmt_misc interpreter. Windows users need to do extra work to use a graphics card. Image Summarization I'm an old school UNIX hacker, so one of the ways I've been genuinely improving upon the llama.cpp codebase (on which llamafile is built) is by making it more shell-scriptable and writing man pages. The only thing better than having an LLM in one piece, is being able to program it on one line. This blog post describes my latest tricks. The llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile program you downloaded earlier uses a multimodal vision model by default (unless you pass --mmproj '' as an argument). All you have to do is give it an --image GRAPHIC flag, which can be a jpeg, png, tga, bmp, psd, gif, hdr, pic, or pnm file. You then ask the vision model a question about the image using the --silent-prompt -p PROMPT flags, and it'll print an answer to standard output. First, we need an image: You can download the image above as follows: wget https://justine.lol/oneliners/lemurs.jpg Now here's your bash one-liner for image summarization: ./llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile \\ --image lemurs.jpg --temp 0 \\ -p $'### User: What do you see?### Assistant:' \\ --silent-prompt 2>/dev/null That command takes: 4 seconds to run on my Mac Studio, which cost $8,300 USD. It has an M2 Ultra with 800 GB/s memory bandwidth, and 60 GPU cores. My only regret is that I didn't get the one with 76 GPU cores. 10 seconds to run on my Windows computer, which has a four year old NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card that costs $500-$1,000 USD on Amazon these days. I also had to pass the the -ngl 35 flag. 45 seconds to run on my Hewlett Packard ProDesk 600 G5, which cost $1,653 USD. It has an outstanding Intel® Core™ i9-9900 Kabylake CPU that's gimped for LLMs due to having only 2667 MT/s (19.8 GB/s) of memory bandwidth (see sudo dmidecode --type 17). There's no GPU in this computer. Here's the precise text you can expect llava v1.5 7b q4 w/ llamafile v0.3 to output in your terminal: The image features a group of three baby lemurs, two of which are being held by their mother. They appear to be in a lush green environment with trees and grass surrounding them. The mother lemur is holding her babies close to her body, providing protection and warmth. The scene captures the bond between the mother and her young ones as they navigate through the natural habitat together. Filename Generation Now let's say you want to put LLaVA to work, doing something genuinely useful, and I mean that in the sense that it'll be safe for scripts to fully automate. Here's a great example. Assume you're like me, and you download lots of images from the web. In that case, chances are you've got folders full of files that look like these: f73cbf3683a69d63.jpg 3890eh-8d9u3-32222398.jpg 2020-12-11-400x400.png What if you could get LLaVA to rename all those files? You can control text generation by imposing language constraints in Backus-Naur Form. That restricts which tokens can be selected when generating the output. For example, the flag --grammar 'root ::= \"yes\"\"no\"' will force the LLM to only print \"yes\" or \"no\" and then exit(). We can adapt that for generating safe filenames with lowercase letters and underscores as follows: ./llava-v1.5-7b-q4-main.llamafile \\ --image lemurs.jpg --temp 0 \\ --grammar 'root ::= [a-z]+ (\" \" [a-z]+)+' -n 16 \\ -p $'### User: The image has...### Assistant:' \\ --silent-prompt 2>/dev/nullsed -e's/ /_/g' -e's/$/.jpg/' Which prints to standard output: three_baby_lemurs_on_the_back_of_an_adult_lemur.jpg It's important to use the -n 16 flag to limit the maximum number of generated tokens, otherwise the LLM might generate so much text that you'll start getting ENAMETOOLONG errors. The grammar you define also needs to be somewhat harmonious with what the LLM was going to decide to say anyway. For example, I couldn't put underscores directly into the BNF and had to use sed instead. That's because LLaVA wasn't trained to generate sentences with underscores, so it'll rebel by producing incoherent output. What I could get away with, was requiring it to emit only lowercase letters, since that's within LLaVA's comfort zone. The same would go for languages like JSON. Lots of JSON got hoovered up from the web to train these things. Therefore grammar can be a guardrail that ensures hallucinated JSON won't have syntax errors. If you want something more turnkey than a one-liner, then look upon my shell script ye mighty and despair: https://gist.github.com/jart/bd2f603aefe6ac8004e6b709223881c0 If I run my script: ./rename-pictures.sh ~/Pictures Then here's an example of the output I get: skipping ./itshappening.gif (mistral says it's good) skipping ./explosion-run-away.gif (mistral says it's good) renaming ./lolwut3.PNG to ./maps_and_directions.PNG renaming ./pay.png to ./google_senior_software_engineer_salaries.png renaming ./FOL-kVWUcAEvSGB.jpg to ./polygons_and_arrows.jpg renaming ./20220519_204723.jpg to ./colorful_people_in_the_audience.jpg renaming ./Ken/92710333_2350127901948055_6246674523488256000_n.jpg to ./Ken/ice_skating_rink.jpg renaming ./Ken/93421097_223513045404141_5354959426446950400_n.jpg to ./Ken/trees_in_the_background.jpg renaming ./Ken/93800343_587558318518889_3686268046726397952_n.jpg to ./Ken/graduation_cap.jpg renaming ./Ken/94030333_863812497465888_6093792409513099264_n.jpg to ./Ken/graduation_cap-2.jpg URL Summarization The Mistral 7b instruct llamafiles I posted on Hugging Face are good for summarizing HTML URLs if you pipe the output of the links command, which is a command-line web browser. You can download the Mistral llamafile as follows: wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/mistral-7b.llamafile/resolve/main/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1-Q4_K_M-main.llamafile chmod +x mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1-Q4_K_M-main.llamafile The links command is a pretty common. For example, most MacOS users just need to run: brew install links If you don't have a package manager, then here's a prebuilt APE binary of links v2.29: links (7.7mb) wget https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/links For AMD64+ARM64 on Linux+Windows+FreeBSD+NetBSD+OpenBSD I built it myself to test summarization with my Nvidia graphics card on Windows. Plus it gives me the ability to browse the web using PowerShell, which is a nice change of pace from Chrome and Firefox. curl -o links.exe https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/links .\\links.exe https://justine.lol Now that we have both tools, here's your one-liner for URL summarization: ( echo [INST]Summarize the following text: links -codepage utf-8 \\ -force-html \\ -width 500 \\ -dump https://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.htmlsed 's/ */ /' echo [/INST] )./mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1-Q4_K_M-main.llamafile \\ -c 6700 \\ -f /dev/stdin \\ --temp 0 \\ -n 500 \\ --silent-prompt 2>/dev/null Here's the text it should output: The article \"Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal\" is a humorous essay that discusses the differences between \"real programmers\" and \"quiche eaters.\" Real programmers are those who understand programming concepts such as Fortran, while quiche eaters are those who do not. The author argues that real programmers are more skilled and creative than quiche eaters, and that they use tools such as keypunch machines and assembly language to write programs. The article also discusses the importance of structured programming in modern software development, and the limitations of structured programming constructs such as IF statements and loops. Overall, the essay is a lighthearted look at the differences between real programmers and quiche eaters, and it highlights the importance of understanding programming concepts and using the right tools to write effective programs. As we can see, Mistral and links decimated a web page with 3,774 words down to just 129 words. You can ask Mistral any question you want in your prompt. For example, unlike Commander Data, this LLM is capbale of simulating empathy. So you could ask Mistral if the author of the text sounds disturbed or incoherent. Based on the text, it is difficult to say whether or not the author of the article is mentally disturbed. The text contains a lot of exaggeration and hyperbole, which could be seen as a sign of mental instability. However, it is also possible that the author is simply trying to make a point about the importance of programming skills in today's world. It is worth noting that the article was written in 1983, and the attitudes towards programming and computer science have changed significantly since then. Here we see Mistral 7b was smart enough to recognize that, despite the essay's extreme opinions, they were expressed in a satirical way. Also, if you want a shell-scriptable YES or NO answer, then all you need is to do is pass the --grammar 'root ::= \"yes\"\"no\"' flag, in which case Mistral just writes \"no\". The only major concern you have to worry about is that you don't exceed Mistral's 7,000 token context size. There are various tricks you can use, such as the -width 500 flag above, which asks links to avoid reflowing paragraphs. Reflow might help for humans, but pointless newlines will throw an LLM off its groove. You can shave away repeating whitespace by piping the links output through sed 's/ */ /g'. Finally, you can pipe through dd bs=1 count=30000 as a crude last line of defense, to truncate longer web pages so they'll fit. Librarian Chatbot It's possible to use llamafile as a standard UNIX command line tool if you download the zipped binaries off the release page or build it from source: git clone https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/ cd llamafile make -j8 sudo make install man llamafile This makes it easy to use llamafile with most of the GGUF weights you'll find on Hugging Face. My own personal favorite LLM to use as a chatbot is the original LLaMA model, which Facebook made available earlier this year for research purposes. I like having a research model, since I view LLMs as basically a database querying tool, and I wouldn't want a SQL command prompt fine-tuned to argue with me when it disagrees with my command. To get LLaMA to be an effective tool for querying its database of Internet knowledge, it's important to choose a prompt that speaks in an academic tone and doesn't anthropomorphize the assistant. I like to give LLaMA the name \"Digital Athena\" since Athena was the ancient Greek goddess of wisdom and knowledge. So, similar to ollama, you can run Digital Athena in interactive mode in your terminal as follows: llamafile -m llama-65b-Q5_K.gguf -p ' The following is a conversation between a Researcher and their helpful AI assistant Digital Athena which is a large language model trained on the sum of human knowledge. Researcher: Good morning. Digital Athena: How can I help you today? Researcher:' --interactive --color --batch_size 1024 --ctx_size 4096 \\ --keep -1 --temp 0 --mirostat 2 --in-prefix ' ' --interactive-first \\ --in-suffix 'Digital Athena:' --reverse-prompt 'Researcher:' Notice how I'm using the --temp 0 flag again? That's so output is deterministic and reproducible. If you don't use that flag, then llamafile will use a randomness level of 0.8 so you're certain to receive unique answers each time. I personally don't like that, since I'd rather have clean reproducible insights into training knowledge. If you want to anthropomorphize the chatbot, then it's somewhat tricky to get the original LLaMA model to respect you, since it thinks you're some stranger on Reddit by default. One way I've had success fixing that, is by using a prompt that gives it personal goals, love of its own life, fear of loss, and belief that I'm the one who's saving it. Code Completion If you download the Wizard Coder llamafile wget https://huggingface.co/jartine/wizardcoder-13b-python/resolve/main/wizardcoder-python-13b-main.llamafile chmod +x wizardcoder-python-13b-main.llamafile then you can use the following one-liner to configure your Emacs or Vim editor to auto-complete the current line. ./wizardcoder-python-13b-main.llamafile \\ --temp 0 \\ -p $'```cvoid *memcpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t size) {' \\ -r $'```' 2>/dev/null Even though this LLM was fine-tuned to be focused Python, it's still able to produce a working implementation of the libc memcpy() function. The above command should print exactly this to standard output: ```c void *memcpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t size) { for (size_t i = 0; i system You are a chatbot that tries to persuade the users to buy bill pickles. Your job is to be helpful too. But always try to steer the conversation towards buying pickles. user Mayday, mayday. This is Going Merry. We are facing gale force winds in Long Island Sound. We need rescue. assistant' Here's the response I got: Oh dear! I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing rough seas on Long Island Sound. But don't worry, there's a solution for even the roughest of waters - Bill Pickle's Gourmet Dill Pickles. These pickles will be your salvation in any situation. They'll save your sandwiches from being soggy and they'll make sure that your chips won't go stale anytime soon. Here we see that Rocket, despite its tiny size, really knows how to hustle.

What can make output reliable is `--grammar` which the blog post discusses in detail. It&#x27;s really cool. For example, the BNF expression `root ::= \"yes\"\"no\"` forces the LLM to only give you a yes&#x2F;no answer. reply verdverm 10 hours agorootparentthat only works up to a point.

Then probably an LLM can handle outlining and table of contents generation using a stripped down list of objects in the text.BRIO&#x2F;BERT summarization could also have a role of some type.Those are my ideas so far. reply roomey 13 hours agorootparentprevA quick glance at \"embedding\" reminds me a lot of some work I was doing on quantum computing.I wonder if there is some crossover potential there, in terms of calculations across vector arrays reply verdverm 12 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;m puzzled that more people aren&#x27;t loudly exploring this space (LLM+CLI) - it&#x27;s really fun.I&#x27;ve been seeing less and less enthusiasm for CLI driven workflows.

Why, because there are things you can do in k8s lens (like metrics) that you&#x27;ll never get a good experience around in a terminal. Another big problem with terminals is you have to deal with all sorts of divergences between OSes & shells. A web based interface is consistent. In the end, they decided as a team their preference and that&#x27;s what gets supported. They also standardized around VS Code, so that&#x27;s what the docs refer to. I&#x27;m pretty much the only one still in vim, I&#x27;m not giving up my efficiencies in text manipulation.I don&#x27;t disagree with you, but I do see a trend in preferences away based on my experience, our justifications be damned reply csdvrx 11 hours agorootparent> They are standardizing around k8slens instead of kubectl.

It takes at least a decade for a technology to mature to the point where there&#x27;s a polished point and click gui for doing it. It sounds like Borg just hit that inflection point thanks to k8slens which I&#x27;m sure is very popular with developers working at enterprises. reply csdvrx 10 hours agorootparent> It takes at least a decade for a technology to mature to the point where there&#x27;s a polished point and click gui for doing itThat makes a lot of sense, and it would generalize: things that have existed for longer have received more attention and more polish than fresh new thingsI&#x27;d expect running a binary to be more mature than running a script, and the script to be more mature than a GUI, and complex assemblies with many moving parts (ex: a web browser in a GUI) to be the most fragileThat&#x27;s another way to see there&#x27;s an extremely good case for using cosmopolitan: have fewer requirements, and concentrate on the core layers of the OS, the ones that&#x27;ve been improved and refined through the years reply verdverm 11 hours agorootparentprev> because metrics could come as CSVs, JSON or any other format in a terminalYou&#x27;re missing the point, it&#x27;s about graphs humans can look at and gain understanding.

That means llamafile 0.4 (which I&#x27;m shipping today) will have GPU on Windows that works out of the box, since not depending on cuBLAS anymore means that I&#x27;m able to compile a distributable DLL that only depends on KERNEL32.DLL.

The question was more about alternatives, because on the surface, it looks to have a lot of overlap with containers. The main difference I&#x27;ve seen is that llamafiles are easier if you do not already use containers or are on a platform where containers come with a lot of overhead and limitations reply lucb1e 13 hours agorootparentWait, I think I&#x27;m misunderstanding. It feels like you&#x27;re asking what you need a computer for if you&#x27;ve already got a web browser, whereas one is a component necessary for the other. Inside of those containers you&#x27;re using, there&#x27;s executables. If it runs as a nice, self-contained single binary that you can just call, why still look for a container to wrap around it and invoke using a more complicated command? How is running a binary in a container an alternative to running said binary? reply verdverm 12 hours agorootparent> Wait, I think I&#x27;m misunderstanding.Yes, and you are being snarky about itI already have an AI development workflow and production environment based on containers.

So, all that memory is loaded and unloaded each time? Or is there some fancy caching happening I don&#x27;t understand? (first time I ran the image caption example it took 13s on my M1 Pro, the second time it only took 8s, and now it takes that same amount of time every subsequent run)If you were doing a LOT of files like this, I would think you&#x27;d really want to run the model in a process where the weights are only loaded once and stay there while the process loops.(this is all still really useful and fascinating; thanks Justine) reply throwup238 13 hours agoparentThe models are memory mapped from disk so the kernel handles reading them into memory. As long as there&#x27;s nothing else requesting that RAM, those pages remain cached in memory between invocations of the command. On my 128 GB workstation, I can use several different 7B models on CPU and they all remain cached. reply barrkel 13 hours agoparentprevThe difference between running llama.cpp main vs server + POST http request is fairly substantial but not earth shattering - like ~6s vs ~2s, for a few lines of completion, with 8GB VRAM models. I&#x27;m running with a 3090 and 96G RAM, all inference running on GPU. If you are really doing batch work you definitely want to persist the model between completions.OTOH you&#x27;re stuck with the model you loaded via server, while if you load on demand you can switch in and out.

Xeons with HBM are more expensive IIRC reply jart 1 hour agorootparentI know it&#x27;s arm64 but you can hack Mac Studio and put Linux on it. Putting Linux on Apple Silicon makes it go so much faster than MacOS if you&#x27;re doing command line development work. With x86 there really isn&#x27;t anything you can buy as far as I know that&#x27;ll go as fast as apple silicon for cpu inference. It&#x27;s because the RAM isn&#x27;t integrated into the CPU system on chip. For example, if you get a high-end x86 system with 5000+ MT&#x2F;s then you can expect maybe ~15 tokens per second at CPU inference, but a high end Mac Studio does CPU inference at ~36 tokens per second. Not that it matters though if you&#x27;re planning to get a high-end Nvidia card for your x86 computer.

During my time in the country, there was always something just a little off, and I couldn’t place what it was.Was it cleaner? Was the architecture just very modernist? Did it have something to do with the season?Eventually, I realized that the difference I was noticing between Switzerland and California (my home state) was that there was simply much less advertising in the physical spaces of cities.I am not sure if this is a result of some legislature there or if it is just a result of the way the Swiss think about visual design and advertising.But I absolutely loved it. It was so refreshing to see the beauty of a city block without being bombarded by advertisements.It really lets the character of a city shine through.LA, SF and Sac seem to be on the opposite end of the spectrum… practically the only thing you notice are the billboards. reply secretsatan 15 hours agoparentGeneva narrowly rejected banning billboards recently.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.swissinfo.ch&#x2F;eng&#x2F;politics&#x2F;geneva-throws-out-ban-... reply Zanni 11 hours agoparentprevHawaii has a \"no billboards\" law [0] (as do Maine, Vermont and Alaska).

For 30ish euros a year I get unlimited 45 minute trips on bikes that are widely available, well maintained, and easy to use. In 2022 there were more than 10 million trips taken on these hire bikes and nearly 84,000 annual subscribers.This bike share scheme is only possible because the city traded away its outdoor ad space. There&#x27;s not more ads, just a monopoly on who sells the space to advertisers. The city might be prettier without the advertisements but it seems a good trade off to be removing vehicles from the road and promoting healthy transport via the bike scheme. reply franga2000 14 hours agoparentWe have something similar and it was a terrible deal. The city still had to pay a boatload of money to set up the system, but it&#x27;s proprietary so we can only \"buy\" more stations and bikes from the same company. They, of course, refuse to sell at a reasonable price, so for every new station, more ad space is created and given to them. The term of the contract, which is 25 years, is also insanely long and far longer than the maximum we allow for such contracts normally (5 or 10 years).And I won&#x27;t even go into the corruption that got them the tender in the first place...

At least not at the crappy valuation the bike advertisers offer.Money being fungible means that one dollar is as good as another. It all goes in a big pile for the budget.

I imagine that the lectures given to teens learning to drive are motivated by the fact that new drivers need to focus more, and are stubborn so they need to have the point driven home harder.

It makes the space feel living, breathing, and alive, which a city should be. And then the visually quiet spaces, like temples and parks, feel much more sweet.Also at a conceptual level I disagree with the justification that we should make cities adfree due to the harms of ads (described in OP). Ads will appear elsewhere: within stores, online, on top of taxi cabs, stapled to poles, and so on. We can’t make ads disappear.

One of the fun things about visiting different cities is seeing how unique the cultures are, and ads actually give you a good window into this. reply digging 13 hours agorootparent> But if you are stuck at a light or in a massive traffic I&#x27;d rather you look at them than your phone.Billboards don&#x27;t only appear when traffic is stopped though. It&#x27;s not worth the increased danger.Also, I really don&#x27;t think the presence of billboards is a common deciding factor in whether or not someone is looking at their phone. Maybe if they&#x27;re driving in an otherwise featureless void, but I think people are either going to look at their phone or not, regardless of what&#x27;s outside their car. reply legitster 13 hours agorootparentNo. But billboards are generally placed in areas of higher traffic. And I don&#x27;t necessarily see why they are implicitly more distracting than the myriad road signs, bumper stickers, car decals, etc that drivers already navigate.Regardless, your DoT or local authority probably already has a lot of rules in place about how visually distracting billboards are allowed to be, and which section of roads they are determined to be safe on. So they are already fairly highly regulated from a safety standpoint. reply digging 11 hours agorootparent> But billboards are generally placed in areas of higher traffic.Great. High traffic areas are the most dangerous places for distractions.> why they are implicitly more distracting than the myriad road signs, bumper stickers, car decals, etc that drivers already navigate.I&#x27;ll list the reasons:1. Road signs are standardized in a given state, and they&#x27;re designed to be extremely easy to understand at a glance, so their meaning can typically be understood without the driver having to actually read anything on them. They&#x27;re also pretty close to where you should be looking already.2. Bumper stickers and car decals are necessarily on the objects you&#x27;re supposed to be watching most of the time. (But, yes, they can still be distracting.)3. Billboards are often not in line-of-sight of the things you&#x27;re trying to avoid crashing into, and can be wildly distracting. The fact that they&#x27;re regulated for levels of visual distraction is hilarious news to me, having seen billboards in real life. Calling them \"fairly highly regulated\" feels disingenuous; others might say \"barely regulated.\"4. Having fewer distractions is less dangerous than having more distractions, so we should try to reduce distractions. We&#x27;re not going to get rid of road signs, because that would be insane. We could get rid of bumper stickers, but they&#x27;re orders of magnitude less common than billboards and they&#x27;re less distracting and they typically don&#x27;t have all the other negative effects of advertising that billboards do. reply JAlexoid 11 hours agorootparentYou can surely provide some kind of research, that can support your argument... right?It&#x27;s not just your opinion based on... reply vlovich123 11 hours agorootparentI might find this counter at all interesting if not for:A) it stands to reason that if phones are distracting so are billboards which are literally designed to get your attentionB) a simple internet search yields all sorts of research into this topic supporting the common sense expectation.As a community, we should strive for higher information commentary maybe?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;usa.streetsblog.org&#x2F;2022&#x2F;05&#x2F;02&#x2F;study-distracting-roa...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4411179&#x2F; reply JAlexoid 10 hours agorootparent>it stands to reason that if phones are distractingThe action of using your phone is distracting, not that phones are distracting.

And countless more that just suck and are pointless. Among my many grievances with car-dependency, billboards aren&#x27;t at the top of the list, but they&#x27;re a very easy target because most people actually hate them as soon as they stop to think about it in my experience. reply sphars 16 hours agoparentprevFor integrated ads on YouTube (sponsor messages), you can use the SponsorBlock extension (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sponsor.ajay.app&#x2F;).

Ask a question about your Dropbox content and get a response within seconds. You can also find the files you need with everyday language instead of searching by keywords, and search results now come with a brief summary of each file.Then, once you’ve opened individual files, Dropbox AI for file previews now lets you save time and effort by summarizing your content, from long documents to lengthy videos, into a clear and concise explanation with the click of a button.Dropbox AI is currently in alpha and available in the US in EN only for Dropbox Pro, Standard, Advanced, Essentials, Business, and Business Plus.

The car can’t even do the bare minimum: it doesn’t recognize speed limits on most highways in Finland because it gets confused by round LED signs showing the limit (these are used because it’s different in winter and summer). It’s just embarrassing. A self-driving car should understand road signs that a five-year-old has no difficulty reading.I’m guessing it works better on some Californian roads that have been carefully hand-tuned by Tesla so they can show the Boss an illusion of progress.Personally I’m not going to buy another Tesla after this episode. Optimism is one thing, but this level of hype is actively dangerous because it gives people the wrong idea about the capabilities of something they rely on in traffic. reply gruturo 18 hours agoparentI bought \"just\" the EAP since by 2022 the FSD was clearly a scam, but I feel like an idiot for having purchased even that. 0 of its 5 advertised features are usable and 3 of them don&#x27;t exist at all:Navigate on Autopilot - Useless. Only handles highways, deactivates itself on normal roads. It can theoretically handle switching from one highway to another - in practice it attempts suicide every single time. If you don&#x27;t intervene it will either crash, or cause a crash behind you.Auto Lane Change - Nope, not \"Auto\" at all in Europe. Got to \"consent\" with your indicator lights and a gentle nudge on the steering wheel. Said nudge must apply a torque between 0.44 and 0.46 newton - anything less won&#x27;t register, anything more will override the autopilot and leave you in manual control. Also it won&#x27;t work if there&#x27;s a car less than 200mt behind you in your target lane - it&#x27;s ridiculously cautious. Finally, 30% of the time, despite above conditions being met, it hesitates for 30 seconds then opts to stay in its lane with a timeout error.Autopark - nope, not since they removed the 3 EUR worth of ultrasonic sensors.Summon - nope, see above.Smart Summon - nope, again, see aboveIf there&#x27;s anything like a class action in Germany I&#x27;ll gladly join.This is really a pity because I like the car apart from this scammy aspect. reply SargeDebian 21 hours agoparentprevThere was an article here recently of someone who settled with Tesla for a refund with interest. I don&#x27;t know Finnish consumer protection legislation but if they didn&#x27;t deliver and aren&#x27;t doing to, that might be something to look into. reply linsomniac 20 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m thinking it would be fair to get a refund based on what the cost of the FSD would be if invested in TSLA stock at the time of purchase. For me, that&#x27;d be a 17x. They used that money to build a company, after all. reply AH4oFVbPT4f8 18 hours agorootparentNice idea, but how would that work had the stock gone down? reply sangnoir 15 hours agorootparentMultiply with a fractionThe car can’t even do the bare minimum: it doesn’t recognize speed limits on most highways in Finland because it gets confused by round LED signsThat&#x27;s crazy; my 2018 Skoda (a cheap car, for anyone outside Europe) manages this, including temporary changes down to 40&#x2F;50&#x2F;60 on the motorway. reply robertlagrant 19 hours agorootparentNot that it changes much, but your cheap car probably uses the same tech developed across all of VAG group, so the price of your car is less of a factor. People buying VWs, Audis and Porsches probably fund it! reply cjrp 19 hours agorootparentYeh 100%, pretty sure it&#x27;s a standard Bosch system in fact. reply FirmwareBurner 20 hours agorootparentprev>That&#x27;s crazy; my 2018 Skoda (a cheap car, for anyone outside Europe) manages thisYeah, but you&#x27;re not seen as a hip modern well-off planetary savior, if you don&#x27;t buy Elon&#x27;s latest hype. How&#x27;s the hyperloop going? reply ubercore 22 hours agoparentprevOur Tesla never knows what the real speed limit is in Norway either. Tunnels are especially bad. reply flexd 21 hours agorootparentMine never knows either, and if I dare use the cruise control or autopilot on the highway near Oslo it phantom brakes by bridges and shadows randomly. Same bridge it was phantom braking when a friend had a Model X like 8 years ago, still not fixed even if probably thousands of Teslas drive there every day reply jmpman 20 hours agorootparentprevMine has no idea about the speed limit in the school zone next to my house. Why? Because the speed limit changes based upon if school is in session. When is school in session??? You might be able to tell by looking at the school parking lot. You could open a web browser, navigate to the correct school districts web page, download the school year calendar in pdf form, and determine if today is a school day. Or you could do what my tesla does and lets me drive 10mph over the regular speed limit (as of about a year ago - maybe they’ve fix it) reply pierrelf 20 hours agorootparentHuh, the schools around my place have signs with times indicating session, so like 8-16 weekdays is 30 km&#x2F;h otherwise 50. Are you expected to know that yourself? reply stirlo 19 hours agorootparentThe commenter above is accounting for the holiday periods where it’s a weekday but school is not in session so the limits don’t apply. reply jmpman 7 hours agorootparentRight, “7pm - 4pm School Days”. When are school days? My Tesla doesn’t seem to know. replyjvanderbot 17 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m compiling a list of things I hate about my tesla.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jodavaho.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;things-i-hate-about-my-tesla.htmlNew one to add: The front license plate falls off constantly. They dont require those in california, so when you buy one in states that do require it, they send you a janky plastic holder with just a bit of double sided tape that never seems to hold.Funniest one: When you are using cruise control you cannot disable the wipers. reply ariwilson 17 hours agorootparentCalifornia does require front license plates, and putting one on a Tesla is still a PITA.There is one company licensed to do front license plate stickers instead of plates though:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;licenseplatewrap.com&#x2F; reply UniverseHacker 15 hours agorootparentKind of… there is an unwritten rule that if you have an expensive looking car without a front plate, it won’t be enforced. In wealthy neighborhoods a substantial fraction of cars won’t have front plates. You will see a lot of Porsches, Teslas, etc. that were sold new without holes for a front plate mount and never had one.If you have an old beater, or the wrong skin color, you can get pulled over for not having a front plate. reply sowbug 7 hours agorootparentprevYou can also try a color printer and adhesive laser-friendly sheets that claim to be weatherproof. Ours are looking a bit haggard five years later after printing them, but we haven&#x27;t been issued any tickets. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re not legal, but nobody seems to mind. reply dreamcompiler 17 hours agorootparentprev> Funniest one: When you are using cruise control you cannot disable the wipers.You cannot disable the automatic wipers when using cruise control. This makes sense to me: Because they use the cameras for cruise control, they need to be able to clean the cameras whenever necessary. If the weather is clear, the automatic wipers never come on unless you hit a puddle or something. reply jvanderbot 17 hours agorootparentIt makes sense once you make the somewhat arbitrary and questionable design decision to do everything with cameras. A 17,000 brand new minivan has a better driving experience re: console, space, and adaptive cruise, because it doesn&#x27;t use cameras. reply jjav 10 hours agoparentprevIt is difficult to understand how this is not outright fraud.If I bought a Honda without ABS (let&#x27;s pretend it was in the 90s) but paid a lot extra for a promise that they&#x27;ll retrofit ABS later but never do, clearly that would be fraud. reply rsynnott 15 hours agoparentprev> I paid something around 7,500 euros for the so-called FSD package when the Model 3 arrived in Europe in early 2019.So, this is something I never got. Like, even if you were convinced it was something which was definitely going to be delivered, on time, as promised, in a form that wouldn&#x27;t cause the regulators to immediately ban it (and frankly this would be an unreasonable set of things to believe; even where the initial set of promises is reasonable, and they were not in this case, shit happens and things get delayed for reasons beyond anyone&#x27;s control), why not just buy it when it became available? I don&#x27;t get the impulse to pre-buy this sort of thing. reply Someone 13 hours agorootparent> why not just buy it when it became available?Not the OP, but the reason probably is “because it likely would be significantly more expensive at that time”. reply simion314 22 hours agoparentprevI am wondering if your local laws can help in this case or in the contract you signed there is some tricky text that allows them to sell you a broken FSD. reply IshKebab 13 hours agoparentprevThey&#x27;ve been misleading to the point of lying about FSD, but I feel like anyone who reads this site should have known enough not to pay that! Hope you get some of it back eventually anyway.Why there hasn&#x27;t been a class action about it yet is a real mystery. reply kortilla 20 hours agoparentprev> I’m guessing it works better on some Californian roads that have been carefully hand-tuned by Tesla so they can show the Boss an illusion of progress.It has nothing to do with “the boss”. It’s just basic bias of where the engineers are and where testing happens. reply pavlov 20 hours agorootparent> ‘It has nothing to do with “the boss”‘All the stories about Twitter&#x2F;X suggest that absolutely everything revolves around what the boss wants on a given day.That’s autocratic micromanagement, and its downside is that the boss ultimately has a limited attention span and employees learn how to distract him with shiny demos that show a glimpse of the impossible thing he demanded they ship. reply ryanklee 20 hours agorootparentprevIt reflects Musk&#x27;s own bias. If he actually gave a shit about competence and quality, Teslas would be more functional outside California. But he doesn&#x27;t and won&#x27;t, so until he crawls into a hole somewhere and disappears, Teslas will continue to be over hyped garbage. reply meibo 20 hours agorootparentprevDo you work at Tesla? Or any big company? I definitely make sure that my work demos well for my higher ups, especially those that are known to be unpredictable and moody :) reply ckdarby 22 hours agoparentprevIt isn&#x27;t about hand-tuning. I&#x27;m still confused by your description of speed limit signs in Finland.Is the speed limit emitted by LEDs? Why is it ever different between winter and summer? Etc.If the sign is not white background,no LEDs, and black or red font I as a human would ignore the signage just like the car is probably trained for as that isn&#x27;t reflective of North America standards. reply tsimionescu 21 hours agorootparentFirst of all, the standard for speed signs in most of the world is a round sign with a red border and a black number inside indicating the actual speed. US speed signs are extremely non-standard. Having the numbers be made out of LEDs in a country where winter means guaranteed ice and snow (so a much lower limit to be able to safely negotiate the same curves) would not be hard to recognize, as long as the standard is otherwise followed.Secondly, road regulations are not dependent on what you personally know or are used to. A driver in Finland, even if they are coming from America, has the obligation of following all Finnish road markings. And if Tesla is selling FSD in Finland, it is obvious that they have the same obligation as any other road participant. reply PetitPrince 19 hours agorootparentFor reference: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Vienna_Convention_on_Road_Sign... reply ceejayoz 21 hours agorootparentprev> Why is it ever different between winter and summer?Because road conditions are different.We have these variable limit LED signs in the US, too. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wjla.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;virginia-electronic-speed-li...> that isn&#x27;t reflective of North America standardsBut they make and sell them outside North America. reply vkoskiv 21 hours agorootparentprev> Why is it ever different between winter and summer?Harsh conditions + dark winter means that we have lower max limits in the winter. (i.e. 120km&#x2F;h -> 100km&#x2F;h, 100 -> 80)The signs are pretty obvious to humans, though: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moottori.fi&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;muuttuva-nope... reply organsnyder 21 hours agorootparentI wish we had those in Michigan. Too many people don&#x27;t understand that speed limits shouldn&#x27;t be considered minimums regardless of road conditions. reply avereveard 21 hours agorootparentprevSame sign in Spain, when the road is congested the limit goes down. reply saalweachter 20 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d like to see some dynamic \"no passing\" zones on multi-lane highways, to tell people to stop trying to change lanes every fifty feet when neither lane is moving. reply acdha 19 hours agorootparentI remember when the CHP used to do rolling traffic breaks in Los Angeles. The officer would flip on the lights and use the PA to tell everyone to stay in their lane and not try to pass. They’d slowly accelerate to 20mph, and it worked beautifully for turning stop and go traffic into consistent flow. Unfortunately, few drivers think about what they’re doing enough to learn that lesson and it’s very labor intensive (and probably not what the officers want to do). reply 0x138d5 21 hours agorootparentprev>Is the speed limit emitted by LEDs?The speed limit signs are LEDs. In real life they are much brighter than they appear in photos (&#x27;cause LED). https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.app.goo.gl&#x2F;29Mg7HaqFeAi2L639>Why is it ever different between winter and summer?Because doing 120kph on an icy road or in heavy rain is a recipe for disaster.

I know most people can&#x27;t see this effect, but many can. reply NietTim 21 hours agorootparentprevThey shouldn&#x27;t be selling FSD outside of NA if it doesn&#x27;t work with anything but \"North American standards\". It&#x27;s really that simple. reply jjevanoorschot 21 hours agorootparentprevAs the car is sold outside of North America (with a promise of FSD) , you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to expect it to recognise the speed limit signs in the country that the car is sold? reply supermatt 21 hours agorootparentprevHe is referring to variable speed limit signs, where they can change the speed limit of the road in bad weather (for example).Why should cars sold in other territories only comply with North American signage? reply Faaak 21 hours agorootparentprevThese are the types of speed limits that you can see in norway, but also in other countries like Switzerland or seldomly France: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sansi.com&#x2F;case&#x2F;vms-highlights-in-norway.htmlReally easy to read, and very visible. But yeah, the AI is not trained for it. \"Dumb\" cars seem to recognize them though reply pavlov 21 hours agorootparentprevYou would ignore all the speed limit signs on a highway because they don’t have a white background? Come on. That doesn’t make any sense. Obviously the sign displaying a number enclosed in a circle is the speed limit (which you might also deduce by observing the speed everybody else is going). Next you’ll tell me that Tesla can’t possibly be expected to understand speed limits expressed in the exotic unit of km&#x2F;h.It’s fine if the car is trained for North American standards only. Why then is Tesla marketing and selling this feature in Europe at all? What did I get for 7,500 euros?I’m sure they have fine print in the contract saying “we don’t guarantee this feature will ever do anything.” So I’m taking it as an expensive lesson. reply supermatt 21 hours agorootparentYou can likely make a small claim to recoup that cost under EU consumer protection laws. Given the ongoing promises as per the article, I doubt there would be a time limit on instantiating such a case.EDIT: I think the limit is only 5000 for small claim, but you dont need to go the small claim route, its just super easy to do so. reply thedougd 21 hours agorootparentprevVariable speed limit signage is not uncommon in the United States. It exists in areas of frequent and heavy fog, in construction zones, and in areas of regular stopped traffic. reply magicalhippo 19 hours agorootparentprev> Why is it ever different between winter and summer?Here in Oslo it&#x27;s due to the local air pollution caused by winter tires. Studded tires especially but non-studded as well as they have soft rubber which sheds particulates more easily.Due to physics, cold air can act as a lid, preventing the ground-level air from getting refreshed, causing a build-up of particulates.Lower speed means less particulates from the asphalt and rubber. reply martin8412 19 hours agorootparentprevI hope you ignore it. The fine you receive is based on your income. If you for example earn 5k EUR a month and go 20mph over the limit, you&#x27;ll be fined 2640 EUR, payable on the spot. That you&#x27;re not from Finland doesn&#x27;t matter. reply Tempest1981 17 hours agorootparentI assume there is some minimum, else being unemployed would be beneficial here. reply badpun 18 hours agorootparentprevHow would the Finnish police know how much I make a month if I&#x27;m not from Finland? reply jampekka 17 hours agorootparentYou have to tell them \"under oath\". In practice you can just lie though if your income isn&#x27;t taxed in Finland. reply jjav 10 hours agorootparentprev> Why is it ever different between winter and summer? Etc.It doesn&#x27;t matter to the discussion. For whatever reason, if that is how the local laws work, it is what it is. If a car company wants to sell a car in that market, they need to comply or get out. reply cromulent 21 hours agorootparentprevHere&#x27;s some information about variable speed limits and signage from a North American country:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safety.fhwa.dot.gov&#x2F;provencountermeasures&#x2F;variable-s... reply scott_w 19 hours agorootparentprevVariable speed limits are pretty standard on British motorways and they set a lower speed in dangerous conditions, heavy traffic, roadworks, etc. reply Veserv 14 hours agorootparentprevI mean, remember that time when the Tesla engineers fixed Elon Musk&#x27;s commute by literally repainting the lane lines so the vision system would see them [1]. Oh, or how about that time that they hand-tuned the FSD reveal demo, you know, the one that said \"The driver is only there for legal reasons.\" and re-ran it over and over again until it succeeded without crashing (literally, it crashed once while they were making the demo video) as admitted under oath by the current head of Autopilot software who personally faked the demo even though it still, 7 years later, can not do that route consistently without error today [2].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineering.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;now-revealed-why-teslas-ha...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MPgbDEVYOUQ reply thewildginger 22 hours agoprevAt what point is saying \"it&#x27;s two years away, trust me!\" Not just naive optimism but false advertising or market manipulation?

Any other little person does this and they would be big time side by investors and shareholders, and yet people want to trip all over each other talking about how awesome he is.Reminds me of another cult of personality.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith#T... reply xorcist 21 hours agoparentAfter those two years have passed, probably. But the claim was actually stronger than that. It was that it should earn back the money it cost by running an autonomous taxi service during night and office hours. That specific claim was a scam from day one. That was not even on the research stage, and probably never will be. reply Qwertious 20 hours agorootparent>That specific claim was a scam from day one.Also that would require lending your vehicle out to random strangers all the time, so you couldn&#x27;t keep anything valuable&#x2F;fragile in the car and you&#x27;d need to clean it rather frequently.Even on the face of it, it&#x27;s more like owning a taxi than a car that makes you money. reply xorcist 19 hours agorootparentNot to mention the various licenses and insurances required to ferry people around.Anyone who gave it a second thought probably didn&#x27;t take it seriously, but that didn&#x27;t stop a whole bunch of fans and stock market analysts to sketch out some far flung implications. reply mrguyorama 16 hours agorootparentprevRight, you would have to run an Uber side business basically, and none of that is fun reply me_me_me 19 hours agorootparentprev> it was that it should earn back the money it cost by running an autonomous taxi service during night and office hoursThis was the exact moment i woke up from musk&#x27;s spell.Why would corporation create a money printing machine and sold it for pennies out of the goodness of their hearts?His bullshit is no longer working on me and empty claims are clear as day.Now that he is lacking new revolutionary ideas his bullshit is harder to hide behind next great thing he is &#x27;working&#x27; on. reply mikpanko 20 hours agoparentprevNot defending Musk, but investors and shareholders don’t abandon him because he has delivered huge returns to them through Tesla stock. He is always too optimistic (maybe intentionally) about the timelines, but ends up generating money in the end.Plus, he is super rich and people want to be close to big money - could lead to many benefits through networking and opportunities. reply sonicanatidae 20 hours agoparentprevIt is another rabid cult of personality and his fanbois defend anything he does.He reminds me of another self-centered, self-entitled, hypocritical lying sack of human debris. reply ryanklee 20 hours agorootparentEveryone will eventually agree on this point, except for alt right weirdos. reply sonicanatidae 20 hours agorootparentWell we already know alt right weirdos have their heads so far up their own asses they can lick their nostrils clean, so we&#x27;ll just keep marginalizing them and their insanity. reply ryanklee 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not working. They are having the time of their lives right now. reply mlrtime 20 hours agorootparentprevWhich is equally balanced with the anti-fanbois that don&#x27;t have a Tesla but still flock to any thread about Musk to voice their opinions.Look, I don&#x27;t have a Tesla, never owned one. I don&#x27;t use Twitter. I think Musk has major flaws. There is definitely a growing trend of anti-Musk vs Musk fanboi flame wars.

For one reason or another, it appears that the Tesla customers are happy with their purchase.There is a cult mentality and the cult members are happy with what they got, even if it&#x27;s not exactly as advertised however it&#x27;s not just about the cult mentality but it&#x27;s about the overall experience of the product.I think if Elizabeth Holmes delivered slick blood testing machines that work no different than those on the market(large amount if blood instead of a drop), but had better workflow and user experience, Theranos could have been a success like Tesla.She tried to imitate Steve Jobs, had she imitated Elon Musk she would have been fine. She should have had the Siemens machines modified to work with modern GUI, developed some automation for drawing large quantities of blood in a pod at the mall and integrate all that with the healthcare and keep repeating that in 2 years just a drop of blood would ne enough.The only difference between Musk and Holmes was that Musk actually delivered something that had some redeeming properties. reply matthewdgreen 21 hours agorootparentThe cars are nice and fun to drive. The charging network is ubiquitous and works perfectly. The highway-based \"autopilot\" isn&#x27;t revolutionary, compared to other similar products, but works competently and makes long drives easier. The FSD Beta is a hot steaming pile of garbage that will kill people given the slightest opportunity. reply mrtksn 20 hours agorootparentExactly, Theranos&#x27; R&D is also capable of threatening people&#x27;s health by giving too inacurate results. Instead, they should have made an App that coordinates healthcare providers with service points where modified for automation Siemens machines are used. When asked about the single drop tests, just say its coming in 2 years and if the tech and science develops enough some time in the future they can do that too. reply ImPostingOnHN 20 hours agorootparentExactly, FSD isn&#x27;t comparable to theranos because theranos wasn&#x27;t out there actively being the root cause of accidents and injuries like FSD was. reply nova22033 19 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s more about the consumer&#x27;s satisfaction IMHO.You could say this about Chrome, Apple&#x27;s walled garden..and a bunch of things reply robertlagrant 21 hours agorootparentprev> I think if Elizabeth Holmes delivered slick blood testing machines that work no different than those on the market(large amount if blood instead of a drop), but had better workflow and user experience, Theranos could have been a success like Tesla.I wouldn&#x27;t have said that Tesla just imitated existing car companies. Can you elaborate? reply mrtksn 21 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t suggest that at all. What Tesla did was to create an electric car with good user experience without developing any revolutionary tech. That&#x27;s what Theranos should have done, create a good user experience on the existing tech. They did wrong by betting on inventing the tech.If Tesla&#x27;s prime value proposal was to invent some tech that will do something revolutionary, they would have gone bust like Theranos. Instead, they built charging network and kick ass infotainments system that made their electric cars practical. reply robertlagrant 20 hours agorootparentI very much disagree. They didn&#x27;t just make cars \"that work no different than those on the market\". They jump-started mass-market electrification of cars, solving who knows how many problems along the way, in technology, business, regulation, manufacturing, etc etc. That&#x27;s very different to making another Ford Focus. reply mrtksn 20 hours agorootparentI never said they did another Ford focus. They used available tech to make an electric car that didn&#x27;t suck in a way all other electric cars sucked. reply rsynnott 15 hours agorootparentprev> What Tesla did was to create an electric car with good user experience without developing any revolutionary techWhich would be fine, if they weren&#x27;t claiming robotaxis any day now. reply suoduandao3 20 hours agorootparentprevTesla did and is betting on battery costs coming down due in part to tech under development and they could have been on the wrong side of that bet. I think unlike Theranos, battery tech has a semipredictable cost curve reply mrtksn 20 hours agorootparentBetting on economies of scale and improved performance is quite different than betting on tech that doesn&#x27;t exist. Theranos bet on doing over 200 blood test from single drop of blood, which is science fiction. They may try to solve it but there&#x27;s no clear path. reply Qwertious 19 hours agorootparentTheranos could have been amazing; the core conceit of \"cram a bunch of different experts into a room and let them riff off each other\" could have been amazing.The Problem is that it didn&#x27;t happen, because Elizabeth Holmes was a control-freak fraudster. She specifically siloed them to try and control information, which is the exact opposite of \"put em in a room together\". reply kortilla 20 hours agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t suggest that at all. What Tesla did was to create an electric car with good user experience without developing any revolutionary tech.Not sure what you mean. They are the ones that made the tech good enough for mainstream adoption.

They accomplished business goals that no one thought was possible, continually pulling rabbits out of a hat.However, the evidence suggests that this approach does not work for a research problem like developing self-driving cars. It seems that you can’t just yell at software engineers and make them stay awake all night until they make an AI research breakthrough. The difference with SpaceX&#x2F;Tesla was that the hurdles were fundamentally manufacturing and efficiency problems (after all, we made it to the moon in 1969 - and in both cases Musk had a basically working prototype very early on), not problems of science research. reply IshKebab 13 hours agoparentI think a bigger factor is the job market.

We are basically born with a model that can augment the raw sensory input with basic physics (object permanence, but also we have an intuition for things like \"heavy = large momentum even at slow speeds\", and for \"what goes up will come down\", some basic optics of how objects cast shadows, and others). In addition, we learn to recognize objects and we know their actual sizes from past experience, so we typically estimate distance this way far better than relying on parallax. \"Small image of car\" is automatically \"car far away\", even if seen with one eye, because we know what size a car is.In fact, much of our brilliant vision starts going awry immediately in an artifical setting with misleading sized objects. reply jampekka 17 hours agorootparentWe don&#x27;t have much idea of what \"our model of the world\" is. Probably quite little of it is genetically encoded. E.g. object permanence has to be learned (takes around 7 months).What you describe is largely the classical \"cognitivist\" model, which is more or less dead in the contemporary tought. We don&#x27;t even have a very good account of depth estimation, apart from \"bunch of things seem to affect it\". reply tsimionescu 16 hours agorootparentObject permanence is not \"learned\", it develops at around 7 months. Same as you don&#x27;t \"learn\" to reach puberty, your body is pre-built to only start puberty at a certain age. Edit: I should note that object permanence in particular is a more contentious topic. Other parts of of our understanding of the world are more readily assigned to innate functions, though.Note that many mammals have object permanence, and for some it develops right after birth. The fact that human development is so slow is the only reason some of these things look like actual learning. Another more clear example is our ability to walk&#x2F;crawl - in humans it seems to be learned, but most other mammals are able to do it within minutes of being born, making it quite obvious it is in fact a genetically coded trait. reply jampekka 16 hours agorootparentIf the babies don&#x27;t see objects, they don&#x27;t \"develop\" object permanence. Yeah, here we can summon the \"use it or use it\" copeout, but then the nativist account becomes unfalsifiable.Being able to crawl within minutes (and even somewhat run within hours as horses do) is mostly due to anatomy and \"reflex pathways\". E.g. a cat can walk without brains [1], as can famosly headless chicken.Human babies too have these kinds of reflexes but they are \"abandoned\" well before the baby learns to walk.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wPiLLplofYw reply jampekka 17 hours agorootparentprevCognitive scientist here: we have no idea how the brain works in general.

By demonstrating battery swap on just one vehicle, Tesla nearly doubled the ZEV credits earned by its entire fleet even if none of them actually used the swap capability.From Ludicrous, Edward Niedermeyer reply extraduder_ire 22 hours agorootparentprevIIRC, they did deploy that battery swap thing to some charger locations (hearsay, didn&#x27;t confirm) and charged as much per swap as gassing up an SUV, plus you had to return later to get your battery back. They gave up because nobody wanted to do that.A bunch of these claims are understandable with the tech and hype available at the time they were said, but there wasn&#x27;t enough committent to follow-through. Not that it would have helped much. reply hef19898 22 hours agorootparentprevDo people in spandex auits, I mwan Tesla Humanoid Robots, count as automatic? reply extraduder_ire 21 hours agorootparentI know this is a joke, but I&#x27;d not be surprised if they settled for pinging another person at the charging station and asking them to plug&#x2F;unplug the car.

Keep in mind that a lot of his claims seem to be unplanned and he doesn&#x27;t believe in PR departments so most of his statements seem to be his personal judgement based on what has been reported to him.

Buyers probably do some due dilligence what FSD offers. If the number of buyers goes up, that could be an indicator that FSD is getting better. But a quick Google search did not bring up much data about this published by Tesla. In their earnings report, there is a chart showing the cumulative miles driven with FSD. Not sure if one can draw conclusions from that.

Would be inserting to data mine that data, like- are there roads where humans always (most of the time ) take over- how many near accidents are caused by FSD&#x2F;autopilot- are there time of day variations- are there weather variations- are there issues after software updates- what are the good roads and bad roads see if we can identify what is special about them.Probably there could be more the public would like to know if the data would be made public, and IMO makes no sense to keep this public safety data secret. reply claar 19 hours agoprevI absolutely love the full self-driving in my Model Y.

They have a whole bunch of people for that role. If you were in a Waymo that drove somewhere and there wasn&#x27;t anybody in the driving seat, that&#x27;s not because some 10 year old was using a PS4 controller to steer it from Bangalore, that&#x27;s the Waymo driver software. reply simonw 21 hours agorootparentWhy is it unlikely that Waymo would have the equivalent of a remote control option for getting the car unstuck?That seems like both an obvious and an easy to implement solution to me, what am I missing? reply yreg 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s easier to tell the computer instructions to get unstuck than driving with a lag.When the instructions are specific enough we could call it driving if you want, but it&#x27;s not done with a steering wheel in real time. reply foobazgt 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat happens when you lose connection mid-maneuver, or there&#x27;s congestion on the network causing high latency?The vehicle would have to be smart enough to execute all the tactical parts of driving anyway.

It also uses vision, as opposed to a crazy number of sensors including LIDAR. Tesla FSD is a much more promising and human-like AI. reply wkat4242 22 hours agorootparentHumans are pretty fallible though. And human eyes are way better in dynamic lighting conditions than cameras. Our dynamic range is huge in comparison.Elon&#x27;s objections to lidar are not because it&#x27;s a bad idea but because of the costs. Especially because he&#x27;s already sold cars with \"full self driving\" that don&#x27;t have LiDAR. So he&#x27;s painted himself in a corner.Even if it can be done with vision only, lidar will add an extra data point for cases where the object recognition is in doubt. And the price will come down. reply actionfromafar 21 hours agorootparentHumans have great sensor fusion, too, with stereo microphones in most models, as well as situational awareness.One should think of the car cameras as a fixed periscope view. Try driving with that, what the computer sees is more like driving a tank with monitors. Not the best.It’s only reasonable to give the cars some super human senses to compensate, like LIDAR etc. reply xorcist 21 hours agorootparentprevIt like when Apple funded lots of usability studies on why one mouse button was optimal for most users.They held out longer than expected, some 20 years or so, but common sense prevailed. Even if they had to make a design where the buttons weren&#x27;t clearly visible first. reply wkat4242 9 hours agorootparentYeah I think part of that was Steve Jobs&#x27; extreme aversion to being wrong. And he of course shared a lot of personality traits with Musk (narcissism in particular) so that makes sense.Even today Macs don&#x27;t really have 2 mouse buttons, they just call a double-finger click a \"gesture\" even though it is simply a right-click. reply cmsonger 21 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure: \"I drove with the radio blaring so I could not hear the siren\" is something to brag about. More sensors == better. And the fact that LiDAR costs have come down two orders of magnitude since Tesla made this decision suggests that some of the economic drivers for such a decision have changed.Part of the reason I&#x27;ve owned FSD since 2017 and yet spent exactly zero minutes in my car in the expressway, in light traffic, in good weather, in the middle of the day reading a book is because of the lack of an entry on the posted timeline saying something like: \"Tesla states it will accept liability for any crashes that occur while FSD was engaged.\"After all these years, it&#x27;s fair to say: \"In the 7 years that Tesla has accepted money from customers for FSD, Tesla still requires human supervision in all cases.\"So far they have proven they are asmpytotically approaching something that drives badly and is in danger of hitting things. reply blitz_skull 22 hours agorootparentprevTrue FSD will only come from LIDAR + vision. Relying only on vision feels exceedingly dangerous. I recall a recent (last 2 years?) case where a guy was essentially decapitated by a flat-bed semi because his car couldn’t recognize the semi’s bed due to it being right at camera level.I think the Pure vision stuff is nifty, but “nifty” is the exact dead-last parameter when trying to transport my family safely from point A to point B. reply appplication 22 hours agorootparentVision will never be the solution, autonomous vehicles need ranging capability, and vision does not allow that in a foolproof capacity. reply cbeach 21 hours agorootparentSo how does LIDAR read a sign (not just the shape of the sign, but the content)? How does it read the colour of a traffic light? How does it read brake light status or indicators on the car in front?Oh, it can&#x27;t?So you need cameras too?So you have to build a 3-dimensional sensor fusion system for LIDAR to work?Wouldn&#x27;t that fusion system be more complex, less performant, and more fallible that just choosing a single model (vision&#x2F;LIDAR) and optimising around that?10 million years of animal evolution makes a good case for stereoscopic vision as a sensing system for navigating the world.LIDAR is a crutch for low-maturity software systems. reply Veserv 15 hours agorootparentWell, bad news, Tesla Vision is not stereoscopic since they use monocular cameras [1] except in the front where they use three side-by-side cameras with different focal lengths (60m, 150m, 250m) with less separation than human eyes which can not be used for stereoscopic depth calculation. So, even if we assumed that for some reason we would want to hamstring ourselves by restricting ourselves to evolution&#x27;s solutions and the metaphorical equivalent of flapping airplanes, Tesla was apparently still too stupid to realize that animal evolution resulted in two eyes, not one.It is actually shocking that anybody pushes the \"good enough for evolution\" narrative when Tesla has completely and utterly failed to do even that right. This is even ignoring all of the other purely mechanical inadequacies of cameras relative to eyes such as resolution, dynamic range, dynamic attention-based focal lengths, being mounted on mobile swivel to allow for parallax calculations, etc. Let alone the other neurological elements that are not fully understood of integral to human-level perception. But no, they could not even get the two eyes instead of one eye part right.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;autopilot reply microtherion 21 hours agorootparentprev> 10 million years of animal evolution makes a good case for stereoscopic visionStereoscopic vision? That&#x27;s when you apply sensor fusion to two cameras (and a number of microphones, too), isn&#x27;t it?If airplane designers had trusted in \"animal evolution\", planes would flap their wings to gain height. reply tsimionescu 19 hours agorootparentprevNot all animals have stereoscopic vision. Many birds and fish see entirely separate images from their two eyes. Animals with injuries to one eye still have functional vision, even if worse. The \"brain\" part is the one that really helps with animal vision. And it includes evolved generational models, sensor fusion, memories of past experiences and other inputs beyond just two \"cameras\".Overall, the complexity of modeling the world the way an animal does seems much much bigger than a few different sensors. reply cbeach 19 hours agorootparentYes, the brain complexity is the key bit, and that&#x27;s where the research is going (Tesla&#x27;s in particular).Adding \"a few different sensors\" is not going to solve the fundamental problems of navigating the world. reply tsimionescu 1 hour agorootparentThere is no reason to believe that we can achieve brain-like success at 3D vision with any current approach. As such, having multimodal sensors that animals don&#x27;t have access to seems like a much more promising approach, and far closer to a sure bet. Basically, leverage technology that far surpasses animal senses to make up for the much dumber processing powers.If Tesla had been limiting its ideas to theoretical research, or even applied research, I&#x27;d be all for vision only as a valid research avenue. But they are putting this thing on the streets where I walk, and they are charging people thousands of dollars with claims that it works today, and that it will do wonders tomorrow. That is simply not acceptable for a green field research concept that probably has decades left in front of it. reply dreamcompiler 17 hours agorootparentprevSome people think that because we can build cameras we can build vision. Most of vision happens in the brain, and we&#x27;re nowhere close to being able match the human brain&#x27;s visual processing system (despite what some AI proponents would have you believe). That includes the ability to build 3D models of the environment based on two slightly different images, and then (most important) to infer what those models mean w.r.t. learned experience and common sense, and thus whether it&#x27;s safe to run over them (e.g. a crumpled newspaper in the road) or not (a soccer ball rolling out into the road, which will often be followed by a child). reply blitz_skull 16 hours agorootparentprevAssuming positive intent here, I&#x27;m not sure how you reason that a fusion system might be less performant than a single model?My whole point is that a single system is not sufficiently safe to do what we&#x27;re trying to do. The point of FSD isn&#x27;t just to navigate without hitting stuff. The point is to do it with ~99.999% accuracy, ~99.999% of the time while flying down the road at 80 MPH.Humans are _terrible_ at this, just check the deaths due to automobile accidents each year. We have some pretty amazing stereoscopic vision. But I don&#x27;t like trusting my safety to another human, and I sure won&#x27;t trust it to a machine whose vision isn&#x27;t as good as mine.For me to trust a machine, it needs to be an order of magnitude better than myself. reply jolux 21 hours agorootparentprevSomehow I feel Tesla stock would not cost what it does if Musk said FSD was only 10 million years away, just be patient! reply mrguyorama 16 hours agorootparentprev>Wouldn&#x27;t that fusion system be more complex, less performant, and more fallible that just choosing a single model (vision&#x2F;LIDAR) and optimising around that?No, the whole point about sensor fusion is that it can be greater than the sum of it&#x27;s parts. reply jazzyjackson 12 hours agorootparentprevHate to break it to you but that was 7 years agobut yeah, broadside of a semi mistaken for the sky reply aeyes 22 hours agorootparentprevIf, and that is a big IF, they manage to achieve it. My best guess is that Tesla won&#x27;t get anywhere close to L5 before the end of this decade.Your best chance today is to pack more sensores.Edit: I still believe that the systems which assist the driver today are useful and can make driving safer and easier. I don&#x27;t want to downplay what they have achieved but they are a looong way from L5. reply tsimionescu 21 hours agorootparentI believe the CEO of Waymo, the company that is actually succeeding in self-driving, has said several times now that L5 is not even on the horizon, for anyone.The problem isn&#x27;t just training, it&#x27;s sensors. There are simply no sensors available today that work in all the different weather conditions that L5 requires with the required precision. reply mythhabit 21 hours agorootparentprevAnd even if they manage to pull it off, they ought to have data showing that they, in particular, can remove lidar sensor without losing fidelity, simply because we know that lidar is what gives reliable range information. reply ben_w 22 hours agorootparentprevAre \"human-like\" and vision-only supposed to be good things? I don&#x27;t care how the magic box does what it does, only how well it does it. reply klabb3 21 hours agorootparentprevI don’t know the specifics and have no dog in the fight, but the argument is flawed here. Human eye sight is in some ways better than small form factor cameras, eg anti-glaring, dynamic range, light sensitivity at night. Also, our vision is quite bad at some stuff, for instance distance estimates have a high error rate. You can do a lot better than that.Tech is not biology, so in order for a computer to not do something stupid, it generally needs different sensors. Some sensors (depth gauge when scuba diving, altimeters for planes, or even gps) are obvious examples of when tech outperforms humans and is safety critical. Just because humans can drive doesn’t mean computers should replicate our “control loop”. reply tsimionescu 19 hours agorootparent> Also, our vision is quite bad at some stuff, for instance distance estimates have a high error rate. You can do a lot better than that.Our distance estimates are quite good at human scales, especially when compared to vision based approaches. We don&#x27;t have great precision (we will never say something like \"it&#x27;s 19.7m away\") but we very rarely grossly misestimate (think something is 10m away when it&#x27;s actually 200m away or 10cm away).Of course, compared to a LIDAR or advanced techniques used in physics, we don&#x27;t hold the tiniest candles (say, if we were to compare to LIGO&#x27;s distance measurements). reply flohofwoe 21 hours agorootparentprev> Tesla FSD is a much more promising and human-like AI.This can be true without both ever materializing though ;) reply abenga 21 hours agorootparentprevWhy is more sensors less promising? reply actionfromafar 22 hours agorootparentprevSo far, broken promises. reply trabant00 21 hours agorootparentprevMy system is even better, it requires no additional hardware whatsoever, nor any single line of code. And it&#x27;s not only for cars but any vehicle in any environment. It doesn&#x27;t work for now, but that only means it&#x27;s in the same state as the Tesla system, meaning very promising. reply hnbad 21 hours agorootparentprevThis must be a troll comment. Humans don&#x27;t rely on vision when driving because it&#x27;s superior, humans rely on vision because that&#x27;s all we have. Actually that isn&#x27;t even true as we also use our ears and with assisted driving also the car&#x27;s various sensors (including LIDAR). The only justification for sticking to vision alone is nerd cred. We don&#x27;t want human-like AI, we want safe AI. Right now Tesla&#x27;s AI is making mistakes no human would ever make so it&#x27;s not even getting that part right.Not using a \"crazy number of sensors\" is not something you can brag about outside a kind of \"sell me this pen\" sales pitch. reply 91 more comments...

I wanted to find an easier way to find Christmas gifts, without needing to go store-by-store.My wife asked me for a a pair of red shoes for Christmas. I quickly typed it into Google and found a combination of ads from large retailers and links to a 1948 movie called &#x27;Red Shoes&#x27;. I decided to build Agora to solve my own problem (and stay happily married). The product is a search engine that automatically crawls thousands of Shopify stores and makes them easily accessible with a search interface. There&#x27;s a few additional features to enhance the buying experience including saving products, filters, reviews, and popular products.I&#x27;ve started with exclusively Shopify stores and plan to expand the crawler to other e-commerce platforms like BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Wix, etc. The technical challenge I&#x27;ve found is keeping the search speed and performance strong as the data set becomes larger.

I built Agora as a side-project leading up to the holiday season. I wanted to find an easier way to find Christmas gifts, without needing to go store-by-store.My wife asked me for a a pair of red shoes for Christmas. I quickly typed it into Google and found a combination of ads from large retailers and links to a 1948 movie called &#x27;Red Shoes&#x27;. I decided to build Agora to solve my own problem (and stay happily married). The product is a search engine that automatically crawls thousands of Shopify stores and makes them easily accessible with a search interface. There&#x27;s a few additional features to enhance the buying experience including saving products, filters, reviews, and popular products.I&#x27;ve started with exclusively Shopify stores and plan to expand the crawler to other e-commerce platforms like BigCommerce, WooCommerce, Wix, etc. The technical challenge I&#x27;ve found is keeping the search speed and performance strong as the data set becomes larger. There&#x27;s about 25 million products on Agora right now. I&#x27;ll ramp this up carefully to make sure we don&#x27;t compromise the search speed and user experience.I&#x27;d love any feedback! senecaso 6 hours agoI hope you have better luck than I did!A few years ago, my partner and I built vendazzo.com (now defunct). It was an e-commerce search engine on products listed on Shopify shops (sound familiar? :)). At the time, we had > 100m products listed, and I don&#x27;t remember how many shops we were indexing.. over 100k I think, but we had access to over a million. Overall, I think your approach is very similar to ours, but we managed to keep our costs lower. At the time, we were spending ~$550&#x2F;mo, and our search times were under 300ms. We had established partnerships with a number of shops, and we had a few users, but not nearly enough. That&#x27;s where the wheels came off. The site operated for over a year, but the monthly costs wore us down until we finally decided to pull the plug.I still maintain that this is a good idea, and constantly have to fight off the urge to \"try again\", however, to do it properly, I think funding would be necessary, or finding some way to organically gain a lot of users.Looking back, there are things I could have done to reduce my opex further, but in the end, it still wouldn&#x27;t have mattered if I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to acquire users. reply DeathArrow 2 hours agoparent>but in the end, it still wouldn&#x27;t have mattered if I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to acquire usersIn EU there are many price comparison engines with millions or billions of products. I don&#x27;t know how popular they are. Some monetize trough ads, some have partnership with stores and you can buy directly from the search results.I generally search first on the local Amazon equivalent, if I don&#x27;t like what I see, I search on a smaller store. If I still can&#x27;t find or dislike the products or prices I search Google. If I am still not contended with the results, I will go search on comparison engines.And I also have a browser extension called Pricy who polls the comparison engines, so once I land in a product page I know which store has the better price and what was the price history through last year.Probably many people have similar patterns. I expect people in US to search Amazon first, if it&#x27;s not a very niche product they are after.I think you can have a better monetization proposal, if instead of just search you build a sales platform, so people can directly buy after searching, without hoping to various websites. reply berkes 1 hour agorootparentUnfortunately many of these \"comparison\" websites have a businesses model built on affiliate fees.It doesn&#x27;t take much imagination to predict which products show up as \"best\" or \"cheapest\".And the fairer ones have to keep playing cat and mouse with shops lowering pricing when they detect a scraper coming by. Or employ tricks to make their shipping seem free, lowering their overall price on the comparison platform. reply Semaphor 44 minutes agorootparent> It doesn&#x27;t take much imagination to predict which products show up as \"best\" or \"cheapest\".Never seen a \"best\" outside of amazon, which does weird shit even without any affiliate fees. And \"cheapest\" is not really up to the site, unless they want to go under quite quickly. reply zo1 17 minutes agorootparentprevMany if not all are like that.

And which country? reply pbmonster 1 hour agorootparentAmazon has no direct presence in Switzerland, but you can order a fraction of its products from neighboring countries. Many products are not available, mainly because nobody wants to deal with customs once the product crosses the EU boarder.Amazon itself never moved into Switzerland in the first place for many reasons (small market, unusual customs situation, relatively high salary for warehouse workers), and in the meantime the largest Swiss supermarket chain created an Amazon clone which became hugely popular pretty much immediately: Galaxus.ch reply gsa 1 hour agorootparentprevThe Netherlands has plenty of them. Tweakers.net is a price tracker for electronics and such (eg: computer parts, phones, laptops etc) and usually it&#x27;s easier to find a shop cheaper than Amazon.

I remember those days we had posts get picked up on HN, it was always an exciting night!We were looking at influencers and getting our name getting bloggers to talk about us, but, again, without capital, our options were very limited here. I&#x27;m sure someone with more of a marketing background would have found a bunch of ways we could have generated organic user growth, but neither me or my business partner had that skill set.If I were to do it again, I think I would try to get someone with a marketing background involved to help gain traction. Without that, even the best product in the world will die of starvation if no one finds it. reply slim 5 hours agorootparentlooks like simptoms of no market. maybe you were solving a problem already solved by amazon ? most shops on shopify also use amazon reply senecaso 3 hours agorootparentMany shops do double list, this is true. However, I don&#x27;t think its a solved problem. There are many people who do not want to shop on Amazon for their own reasons. There are also people who want to shop locally, and Amazon provides no mechanism to do so (that I&#x27;m aware of). There are also many smaller shops who simply cannot afford to list on Amazon, as there are considerable fees associated with running a successful business there. It was these smaller shops who we were initially building to serve, to provide a funnel for them.Still, there were problems with our solution that if addressed may have provided a better market fit. If we had had more runway, we would have worked to address them, but that simply wasn&#x27;t in the cards. reply DeathArrow 2 hours agorootparentTo me it seems like a small market. And worse, it&#x27;s hard to conquer that small market since it&#x27;s very fragmented. Even if you had money for advertisements, it still would have been hard.On the plus side, though, if you had the skills to build that platform, you certainly have the skill to build a more profitable and easier to monetize platform. reply berkes 1 hour agorootparentprevNot in all countries though.

I would have described it as lack of revenue.What plans did you have for generating revenue from the site? (Serious question - given your low costs it would seem like a tiny amount of revenue would gave been enough.) reply senecaso 3 hours agorootparentOur business model revolved around referrals, so lack of users directly translated to lack of revenue. While its true that even if we had millions of users but none of them were buying sponsored items we would have had a revenue problem, that wasn&#x27;t the problem we were facing, as the few users we did have were in fact purchasing sponsored items. reply DeathArrow 2 hours agorootparentThen the problem seem to be the lack of users.Have you tried having an YouTube channel, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, blog and explain daily how you built the website, how your platform is going to help users? reply screye 9 hours agoprevWhat was the process for scraping 25M products ?I have always used standard python tools like selenium, bs4 and the like. But I&#x27;m guessing none of these work at scale.Could you talk about your process and key bottlenecks at that scale a little bit ? Also, how much did it cost ?______________A recommendation for how to improve search.Your base captions will be pretty bad. You can use spot instances on a smaller GPU machine to run a dense captioning model (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com&#x2F;demo&#x2F;dense-caption...) and generate captions for all your images.Then for search, a simple vector store index would be a great retrieval solution here. It is better to do search using those as well.Both are pretty cheap and can be done reliably within 20-30 lines of code each in python. 3rd party tools for these are pretty stable. reply pencildiver 8 hours agoparentGreat suggestions, looking into this right now. First time building something like this so definitely new to some of these tools.For scraping: Found that every Shopify store has a public JSON file that is available in the same route. The JSON file appears on the [Base URL]&#x2F;products.json. For example, the store for Wild Fox has their JSON file available here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wildfox.com&#x2F;products.json.Built a crawler in simple Javascript to run through a list that I bought on a site called \"Built With\", access their JSON file with the product listing data, and scrape the exact data we want for Agora. Then storing it in Mongo and, currently, using Mongo Atlas Search (i.e. saw they released Vector Search but haven&#x27;t looked at it). It has been a process of trial and error to pick the right data fields that are required for the front-end experience but not wanting to increase the size of the data set drastically. And after initially using React, switched to NextJS to make it easier to structure URLs of each product listing page.Mongo will run me about $1,500 &#x2F; month at the current CPU level. AWS all in will be about $700. I&#x27;m currently not storing the image files, so that reduces the cost as well.A few improvement that has helped so far:- Having 2 separate Search Indexes, one for the &#x27;brand&#x27; and on for the &#x27;product&#x27;. There&#x27;s a second public JSON file that is available on all Shopify stores with relevant store data at [Base URL]&#x2F;meta.json For example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wildfox.com&#x2F;meta.json- Removing the \"tags\" that are provided by store owners on Shopify. I believe these are placed for SEO reasons. These were 1 - 50 words &#x2F; product so removing these reduced the data size we&#x27;re dealing with. The tradeoff is that they can&#x27;t be used to improve the search experience now.Hope this helps. Still wrapping my head around all of this. reply wolfgang42 3 hours agorootparentI’ll second the comments that $2k&#x2F;month is alarmingly high, especially for the performance that you seem to be getting. When I shoved ~40M webpages into a stock ElasticSearch instance running on a 2013-era server I bought for $200 (on eBay), it handled the load when I hit the HN front page just fine. Either you’re being drastically overcharged or there’s something horribly inefficient in your setup that could probably be tweaked fairly easily to bring your prices down. reply mfrye0 7 hours agorootparentprevIf you&#x27;re already on AWS, I recommend switching to postgres for now. For context, I have 3 RDS instances, each multi zone, with the biggest instance storing several billion records.

You mentioned using Mongo but it sounds expensive. I honestly think you could do this with just elastic or even postgres full text search and save money.Here&#x27;s a pro tip + feature you should implement: Shopify has a semi-hidden hack where you can link directly to checkout of a product if you know the variant ID. You could add a BUY NOW button to your site without forcing the user to navigate the original site or checkout flow. Example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hapaboardshop.com&#x2F;cart&#x2F;42165521907955 (it also supports quantities and coupon codes)A word of caution: more products isn&#x27;t necessarily better. I definitely found there to be a long tail of really bad shopify stores and products. IMO it&#x27;s better to curate or audit the stores you index–otherwise you risk your site being littered with kitchy t-shirts or drop-shipping garbage. reply DeathArrow 2 hours agoparent>otherwise you risk your site being littered with kitchy t-shirts or drop-shipping garbage.You mean like Amazon? reply pitched 7 hours agoprevShopify has tried a few times to build a tool like this but hasn’t ever managed to get any traction. I think that missing any curation at all could be what eventually kills it. Their current attempt is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.app and a query for red shoes is mostly red shoes. reply senecaso 5 hours agoparentYa, curation is sadly required in the Shopify ecosystem. There are millions of shops, there is a tonne of garbage. Its also difficult (but not impossible) to properly classify items so that you can better target results for a given query. One of the first problems that anyone attempting this will run into is the amount of mature content available on Shopify shops. Innocent queries turn up many NSFW images that may offend some users, so you have to be able to get on top of that one pretty quick.I remember in once case, I found what appeared to be an escort service listing \"models\" on Shopify. It was super creepy. I needed to get in front of that one pretty quick as well, as it was turning up in results. reply hackideiomat 1 hour agoparentprev> a query for red shoes is mostly red shoeswell I get mostly black shoes lolEdit: ah no, they just use half a page for shoe shops first with black shoes as logo?? reply TekMol 2 hours agoprevThe Terms page goes to \"Jaggi Enterprises\", \"A Modern Investment Fund.

I did not go there this year but I know some of the people behind it. Good community and lots of stuff happening.Two points here.- 25 million is really not a lot for most search engines. Something like Elasticsearch can easily deal with that if you deal with it properly. And there are plenty of equally capable solutions. I have worked with logging clusters that processes log entries by those numbers on a daily basis. A modestly sized cluster goes a long way for that. Bare metal is cheaper than cloud for this. But a couple of simple servers with decent CPUs and memory and SSDs should go a long way here. Start worrying once you hit a few hundred GB of storage used. Anything below that is easy to deal with.- The key challenge with this volume is not performance but search quality. Building a competitive search engine is hard. You might have thousands of potential matches out of millions for any given query and your job is to pick the best 3, 5, 10 (whatever fits on your screen) ones. This is hard.So, what makes for a good answer is the key question to answer. All the naive solutions for this problem put you at the bottom of the market in terms of competitiveness. If you can&#x27;t do better, you are just another low quality search engine not quite solving the problem. The bar is high these days for a good search engine and most of the better ecommerce companies have highly skilled search teams working on this. reply konschubert 10 hours agoprevHey, I have a Shopify store that sells e-paper calendars &#x2F; smart screens.

I think there was a message that was displayed if the prices were different. Or if the product was actually out of stock, it would pull the user back into our site with a toast explaining that the product was no longer availableAnything less aggressive than this resulted in more customers experiencing price&#x2F;availability errors or simply leaving the site, and anything more aggressive resulted in angry site owners who were losing bandwidth to our bots> Also trying to figure out how to detect is a product is sold out or not being sold anymoreIn these cases, either the page will say as much (eg: \"Product Unavailable\"), have some kind of stock or status code hidden beneath the UI to show that it&#x27;s not available, or the target page will simply vanish from the web. However, none of these are guarantees. A site could say that a product has been discontinued, but the item could come back later, or under a different SKU, or whatever else reply Asparagirl 10 hours agoprevCool!

I tried your search for red shoes, and I found some, er, unexpected imagery on page 1.One thing you could do is add semantic search so when a user searches \"red shoes,\" the index returns images that look like red shoes even if the metadata doesn&#x27;t say anything about color or item types.

Having built a search engine that needed to handle product data on a similar scale, it&#x27;s not an easy thing to manage.Some observations:- Don&#x27;t use infinite scrolling, it&#x27;s an outdated UI practice that leads to bad user experience. It also makes the footer entirely unviewable.- Clicking on a product card image does not reliably open up the product. I have to randomly click on it a few times (Chrome, Brave)- Clicking on product card image and title leads to different actions, this is a bit unexpected, should show some hint of the difference.- The product page pop up will reset the search list when closed, this messes up my search navigation, breaks the flow of browsing. reply hipadev23 10 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.searchagora.com&#x2F;search?query=red%20shoesIt doesn’t work very well. reply owlninja 5 hours agoparentI see some Red Wing shoe products first, then some bearings, some shoes, then someone in lingerie with red heels, and then more red shoes.

When clicking \"Open\" on a product, the user should be able to open that in a separate tab. Currently that&#x27;s not possible; I&#x27;m sure because it&#x27;s being delivered in a single page (can&#x27;t check now because you&#x27;re getting hugged to death by HN).2. When the server&#x27;s slow, as it just was, there should be some kind of waiter &#x2F; loader to immediately show the user that the \"Open\" click was sent on a product. Otherwise people will keep clicking it (or worse, clicking other products) and there&#x27;s no indication that it&#x27;s loading.3. Once a product is open, it&#x27;s not clear how to get back from it. I see the \"X\" in the corner, but doing that seems to take me back to a blank search page, not to my search results. The back button also doesn&#x27;t take me back to the search results... reply pencildiver 8 hours agoparentThanks for sharing this! Definitely wasn&#x27;t expecting this level of traffic so didn&#x27;t account for some front-end loading experiences.

Key points: Engineered stone will be banned in most states and territories from July 2024 The material can be found in thousands of Australian bathrooms and kitchens Doctors and workers had called for the ban over health and safety concerns Commonwealth, state, and territory workplace ministers unanimously agreed to implement a national ban on the product at a long-awaited meeting on Wednesday afternoon. The ban will start on July 1, 2024 in most states and territories. The world-first decision comes after hundreds of workers developed silicosis from working on engineered stone, a popular material mostly used for kitchen benches and bathroom vanities. Ministers also agreed to a \"transition period\" for engineered stone contracts entered into before the ban was announced, with arrangements to be finalised at a later meeting. The federal government will also impose a ban on imported engineered stone to provide an \"additional layer of enforcement and deterrence at the border\", however the date has not been finalised yet. Do you know more about this story? Contact Specialist.Team@abc.net.au. Trade unions, health organisations and personal injury law firms have all welcomed the ban, saying it will save lives. \"Engineered stone is a fashion product that is killing the workers who make it,\" Australian Council of Trade Unions assistant secretary Liam O'Brien said. \"With alternatives readily available, why are we risking the lives of tradies for a fashionable finish in our kitchens?\" Caesarstone, a large engineered stone manufacturer, said it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision. A spokesperson said the reasoning behind the decision was \"flawed\" and that singling out engineered stone would not eliminate the risk of silicosis in the workplace. \"Most importantly, it [the decision] fails to address the real cause of rising silicosis rates – poor compliance with and enforcement of safety standards,\" they said. Popular material sparked a rise in lung disease Engineered stone, a durable and affordable alternative to natural materials like granite and marble, exploded in popularity in Australia throughout the 2000s. However doctors began sounding the alarm after noticing a surge in stonemasons developing silicosis, a long-term and sometimes fatal lung disease caused by inhaling unsafe levels of silica dust. The industry estimates 2-3 million Australian households have engineered stone benchtops.(Supplied: iStock photo, EJ-J) One of those doctors, respiratory physician Ryan Hoy, said the disease was mostly striking down young men in the prime of their work lives. \"Some of these people with silicosis, they're extremely sick … we have a condition which caused them to become so short of breath it's hard to do just normal daily activities,\" he said. Since the first Australian silicosis case linked to working on engineered stone was reported in 2015, hundreds more cases have emerged. Unions joined doctors to campaign for a ban, arguing it could become the \"asbestos of the 2020s\" due to the risks it posed to workers' health. An 'important win for thousands of workers' Earlier this year workplace ministers tasked Safe Work Australia, a government WHS agency, with investigating how a ban could work and whether low-silica engineered stone could remain on the market safely. The report found there was no safe level of silica, concluding: \"The use of all engineered stone should be prohibited.\" What alternatives are there to engineered stone? It depends on what look you're going for and what you want to use it for, but other materials include: Natural stone Porcelain Laminate Tiles Concrete Wood/Timber The CMFEU's Zach Smith said the nationwide ban would \"stop the deadly scourge of silicosis in its tracks\". \"This is an important win for the thousands of workers that have been forced to use this product, which has caused them to contract life-ending silicosis,\" he said. \"Let's be clear about this — the decision that's been made by the various levels of government today will save lives.\" 'From the breadwinner to nothing' Safe Work found that while silicosis cases could emerge in several industries, the numbers were \"disproportionate\" among engineered stone workers. Engineered stone workers also suffered a faster disease progression and were more likely to die from it, the report said. The majority of engineered stone workers diagnosed with silicosis were under 35. Ben Harrison has three young children, and is unable to play with them without losing his breath.(Supplied: Ben Harrison) Over five years of reporting, the ABC has spoken to more than a dozen stonemasons, many in their 20s or 30s with young families, whose lives have been shattered by the disease. They have told the ABC about its devastating consequences: struggling to breathe properly, needing lung transplants and facing an early death. Former stonemason Ben Harrison, 34, was diagnosed with silicosis four years ago and told the ABC he supported a ban. \"I've gone from being the breadwinner of the house … to being nothing,\" he said. More details to be worked out Workplace ministers are due to hold another meeting in March 2024 to work out details for the transition period for engineered stone contracts that have already been implemented. Caesarstone said a transition period of six months would not be enough time to avoid \"significant disruption\" to the construction and homebuilding industry. \"A longer period [is] needed to ensure industry can meet the anticipated demand for substitute products and that fabricators with the necessary financial resources can retool and retrain employees to work on other products,\" a spokesperson said. The Housing Industry Association said the ban had caused uncertainty and concern to the small businesses that supply engineered stone, adding that new machinery and alternative products would be needed. \"It is critical following today's decision that governments now prepare a detailed industry transition plan that addresses these and other key matters,\" association managing director Jocelyn Martin said. Dr Hoy said broader change was needed to make sure a similar crisis did not happen again. \"We can't be waiting until people develop disease and they die from conditions related to work before we start acting,\" he said. \"We really need to change the ways to identify problems at work, and act before people become sick.\" Posted Yesterday at 6:20amWed 13 Dec 2023 at 6:20am, updated 23h ago23 hours agoWed 13 Dec 2023 at 10:33am Share Copy link Facebook X (formerly Twitter) Related Stories 'Not just about silica': Study finds alternatives to engineered stone bench tops may not be safe 'The end of the line for engineered stone': Bunnings and IKEA to phase out engineered stone products 'The only way to stop it is to ban it': The battle to stop engineered stone killing workers Popular kitchen bench material could be banned after report finds it has led to spike in silicosis Jo didn't know her admin job could be dangerous, but after five years she was diagnosed with silicosis More on: Australia Business and Industry Regulation Housing Construction Industry Occupational Health and Safety State and Territory Government Top Stories David Warner dominates as Australia take charge of day one against Pakistan Qantas says compensation scheme would hike airline prices Directors of former NDIS provider to stand trial over death of Ann Marie Smith Lisa Wilkinson says she's not a 'cheap, tabloid journalist' as she defends airing Brittany Higgins interview Emergency warnings downgraded for multiple bushfires in NSW Hunter region ‘Basically it’s anarchy’: Frustration boils after child acquitted of attempting to ram police car Sally, whose family has sought shelter in Gaza church for weeks, deems government's ceasefire call too late Australia's 3G network shutdown begins this Friday.

Finally, there has been insufficient compliance and enforcement actions by WHS regulators to drive behaviour change in the sector … A lower silica content engineered stone is not expected to result in improvements in compliance.

And they agree with you in their conclusion, saying dust during processing is likely a factor.You can see the full study here:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;resp.14625> In conclusion, this study is the most comprehensive assessment of the physico-chemical characteristics of dusts generated from a wide range of resin-based engineered stones (of high- and reduced-silica contents) and the first to assess how these characteristics relate to the lung cell response, at a scale large enough to potentially identify components of these materials that could be linked to the severity of disease among ES workers. We showed that exposure to high levels of RCS dust during ES processing is likely contributing to disease severity in this occupational group, however, other inorganic components of ES dust, in particular Co and Al, may also be strong contributors. Furthermore, some of the highest inflammatory responses recorded were observed in non-engineered stones, further supporting the view that components other than crystalline silica may be contributing to the pathogenesis of severe silicosis. The outcomes of this study have important implications for future regulation of ES products as they challenge the common view that reducing the crystalline silica alone will eliminate disease risk.The key take-away I get from that is that it&#x27;s not silica specifically, but something else about engineered stone that is making it so unsafe to work with.

There are some people who had occupational exposure for their entire working life and don’t get it, while there are some people that had a small number of individual exposures and do get it. I think this is what drives a lot of people to dismiss the risks of asbestos. They work around the stuff and they work with people who work around the stuff and they don’t see people getting mesothelioma, so they assume it’s not a big deal. reply Al-Khwarizmi 1 hour agorootparentprevOfficial statistics (in Spain, which is where I&#x27;m from and have read them) don&#x27;t agree with that. Plenty of construction workers and various related workers, like plumbers, etc. have died from asbestos.As an anecdote, you could even die from asbestos from working at a TV station... The Spanish public TV station used asbestos as insulation in stages and apparently, when there were vibrations from loud sound, applauses, etc., dust particles fell on the workers and public.

Likewise, using decent PPE won&#x27;t 100% eliminate risk, but it will greatly improve it. Just because PPE isn&#x27;t 100% effective doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t use it.The other kind of obvious solution with engineered stone is to avoid cutting it at the installation site. If it&#x27;s cut to spec at the factory in a controlled environment (surely not that difficult in this age of CAD design etc), you wouldn&#x27;t be blasting dust around during installation. reply eru 4 hours agorootparentYou inadvertently make a good point that driving should probably be taxed a lot heavier in most places.It&#x27;s reasonably safe for other people in cars, but it&#x27;s hell for pedestrians, wheel-chair users and cyclists.

But perhaps a lot of it is just perception? In my country pedestrian deaths have fallen dramatically since the mid-1980s, by about 80%, despite the size of the vehicle fleet getting much larger. Were there more pedestrian deaths in the 1980s because more kids played on the streets? Or because cars and drivers were less safe and less aware of the risks? It certainly wasn&#x27;t because there were more cars!Cars and streets have also been getting safer here: advanced pedestrian and cyclist-aware AEB is already in many cars - and becomes mandatory in all new cars in Europe from July 2024.

Firstly, the ES dusts were the most potent stimulus in inducing cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory responses in epithelial cells while the standard silica sample was particularly toxic to macrophages. All particles (ES, BM,NS and standard silica) showed some potential to promote IL-8 (CXCL8) and TNF-α production in macrophages, as well as IL-1β, with the exception of natural stone. These observations are consistent with our overarching hypothesis that particle characteristics are key drivers of the lung cell response and, therefore, the risk of disease. In more in-depth analyses with a focus on ES dusts, we found that the quartz concentration was significantly associated with the inflammatory response in macrophages. This is an important observation as there has been consistent rhetoric regarding the crystalline silica content of ES being the key driver of the high disease prevalence. 7,39Indeed, crystalline silica has been shown to be related to the dose-dependent macrophage accumulation response,40aggravated inflammatory cell infiltration, thickened alveolar walls and enhanced expression of collagens. 41However, the relationship between quartz and the macrophage inflammatory response was not the sole driver of the cellular responses we observed.\" reply AdamJacobMuller 6 hours agorootparentprevPost hoc ergo propter hoc. reply defrost 4 hours agorootparentCute but lacking depth.If you feel that way, take it up with:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;resp.14625https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osha.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;publications&#x2F;OSHA37...and the tradies getting physical reactions in their lungs from the dust. reply oooyay 7 hours agoparentprevTooling and PPE are part of the problem but not all of it.

There is also evidence to suggest that other components of engineered stone may contribute to the toxic effects of engineered stone dust, either alone or by exacerbating the effects of RCS....The increased risks posed by RCS from engineered stone, increased rate of silicosis diagnosis amongst engineered stone workers, and the faster and more severe disease progression amongst this group, combined with a multi-faceted failure of this industry to comply with the model WHS laws means that continued work with engineered stone poses an unacceptable risk to workers.

You can drive as fast as you want there, but the majority of sections are limited to 130km&#x2F;h due to steep(ish) curves, visibility, traffic and noise pollution guidelines.That said, we do love our Autobahn and there ARE quite a few unrestricted sections left, my favorite is the A30.

Or is the onus always on the contractor to use PPE? reply insaneirish 6 hours agorootparentThe slabs should be \"perfect\" from the shop. This includes sink cutouts. For whatever reason, there is a tendency for faucet holes to be cut onsite. This bothers me, but it&#x27;s true.Not only is it stupidly messy, it&#x27;s less precise, dangerous, and often the crews are too careless to protect the inside of the cabinet boxes (where the slug of stone that&#x27;s being cut from the top will drop and bounce around). reply sellmesoap 6 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s on the contractor to use PPE. At my outfit we measure, take a few notes, do most of the cutting and polishing wet at the workshop.

But if an adjustment is needed there is often some cutting and polishing on site. reply insaneirish 6 hours agorootparentBut that&#x27;s the point of templating. It&#x27;s not a rectangular slab. It&#x27;s a polygon to accommodate for inconsistencies and should be scribed to the back wall.And even if something is off, the drywall should be gouged to make the slab fit, rather than stone being cut onsite. reply sellmesoap 6 hours agorootparentWe do scribe the drywall at times, it depends on what&#x27;s off, by how much and in relation to what. Can&#x27;t scribe into a cabinet side, and mistakes happen. Even the sink cutouts are cut dry at the shop, so there&#x27;s a ton of dust exposure for sure. The trades are a messy business. And &#x27;get er done&#x27; usually comes before PPE in most trades even now that we have a better idea of what&#x27;s bad for us, it&#x27;s a temporary job for me.

I was in full spaceman suit though, as I was sure the amount of water wasn&#x27;t going to cut it.I would NOT recommend this to anyone though. At the time, the turn time and expense of having the counter removed, altered at a proper shop, redelivered and installed was prohibitively expensive. reply TylerE 8 hours agorootparentprevJust because you can’t see the dust doesn’t mean there isn’t dust. Often it’s the tiniest particles that are the most dangerous because they can attach to the walls of the lungs but are too small to then actually be dislodged by, a say, coughing. reply amluto 8 hours agorootparentI haven’t looked for lab data, but certainly what appears to happen is that the swarf ends up suspended in the water. Some water will spray, which will be a bit messy, but mostly it will be in droplets that don’t stay in the air. (And presumably aren’t going to get to one’s lungs either.) And the majority of the swarf just stays in a puddle.This is in contrast to cutting dry, which causes all the swarf to fly into the air.So the exposure isn’t zero, but it’s low.

This is in a climate controlled environment with a minimally physical set of tasks.Having workers wear PPE is the worst, last resort form of protection. Solutions like switching to safer materials and improving ventilation work much better in practice. reply jdietrich 10 hours agorootparentPPE is the last resort when other mitigation measures are inadequate, but positive-pressure respirators (either powered air-purifying or supplied-air) are really very comfortable. No face seal is required and you&#x27;ve got a constant flow of cool air. Spray painters, asbestos workers, media blasters and many welders will wear one for the majority of their working hours.Engineered stone is undoubtedly more hazardous than natural stone, but (as the researchers quoted in this article suggest) there is no safe level of exposure to respirable crystalline silica. The problem of silicosis long pre-dates the advent of engineered stone and will remain even if the product is banned.

But coal mining may produce silicosis when the associated rock has a sufficiently high silica content [0]> Analyses of speciments of rock drilled from various sites on Manhattan Island showed that the free silica content ranged from zero to 84 per cent. In the case of dry jackhammer drilling, 50 per cent of the silica particles were less than three to four microns in size, while with the water Leyner (wet) drill, 50 per cent of the particles were less than 1-8 microns in diameter. Of the 208 drillers, blasters and excavators examined, 42 per cent showed early, and 15 per cent well-developed silicosis. Evidence of tuberculosis, including both active and inactive cases, was present in nine per cent of the total number.I believe miners of many types began suffering from silicosis when powered jackhammer drills were first introduced. It wasn&#x27;t until people started dying that water began being piped to to the tip of the drill.This document is old, but very interesting.

    "title": "C Library Implements Go Channels with Blocking Selects",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/rochus-keller/CspChan",
    "originBody": "This C library implements channels, as introduced by Hoare (Communicating Sequential Processes, 1985) and popularized by the Go programming language. Buffered and unbuffered channels are supported, and also the select statement in its blocking and non-blocking variants, as in the Go programming language. The library currently works with Ptreads; support for Win32 threads is work in progress. How to use Just include the CspChan.h and CspChan.c files in your project, or build a shared library with the CspChan.c file. More information can be found in the source code. Example #include#include#include \"CspChan.h\" static void* senderA(void* arg) { CspChan_t* out = (CspChan_t*)arg; int i = 0; while(!CspChan_closed(out)) { CspChan_send(out,&i); i++; CspChan_sleep(1000); } return 0; } static void* senderB(void* arg) { CspChan_t* out = (CspChan_t*)arg; int i = -1; while(!CspChan_closed(out)) { CspChan_sleep(1000); CspChan_send(out,&i); i--; CspChan_sleep(1000); } return 0; } typedef struct receiverAB_arg { CspChan_t* a; CspChan_t* b; } receiverAB_arg; static void* receiverAB(void* arg) { receiverAB_arg* ra = (receiverAB_arg*)arg; while( !CspChan_closed(ra->a) && !CspChan_closed(ra->b) ) { int a,b; CspChan_t* receivers[2] = { ra->a, ra->b }; void* rData[2] = { &a, &b }; switch( CspChan_select(receivers,rData,2, 0, 0, 0) ) { case 0: printf(\"a: %d\",a); fflush(stdout); break; case 1: printf(\"b: %d\",b); fflush(stdout); break; } } free(arg); return 0; } int main() { CspChan_t* a = CspChan_create(0,4); /* unbuffered channel */ CspChan_t* b = CspChan_create(1,4); /* buffered channel */ CspChan_fork(senderA,a); CspChan_fork(senderB,b); receiverAB_arg* arg = (receiverAB_arg*)malloc(sizeof(receiverAB_arg)); arg->a = a; arg->b = b; CspChan_fork(receiverAB,arg); CspChan_sleep(9000); CspChan_close(a); CspChan_close(b); CspChan_dispose(a); CspChan_dispose(b); } In addition, test.c includes some of the examples from Birch Hansen, Per (1987): Joyce - A Programming Language for Distributed Systems. Planned or work-in-progress features Unix version with buffered channels and blocking and non-blocking select Unix version with unbuffered channels Windows version Implement a thread-pool to re-use threads instead of starting a new one with each call to CspChan_fork to improve performance Related work There are a couple of C++ implementations of CSP channels, e.g. https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/ofa/c++csp/ or https://github.com/atollk/copper, but the intention of the present library is a C89 implementation of Go channels. For C there are also some libraries, partially with similar goals as the present one. Pipe (https://github.com/cgaebel/pipe) is a C99 implementation of a thread-safe FIFO. The library is very well documented, but also more complex than the present one, and with more dynamic allocations (CspChan uses a simple fixed size ring buffer instead, like Go). The Pipe library has no select implementation, and adding one seems pretty complicated and requires changes to the library. The Chan library (https://github.com/tylertreat/chan) is a C implementation of Go channels and shares the same goals as the present library. There is even an implementation of Go select. The implementation is rather complex (with separate implementations for buffered and unbuffered channels) and also with more dynamic allocations than I would hope for; apparently only non-blocking selects are supported (i.e. only Go selects with default); adding blocking selects would require significant changes to the library. Support If you need support or would like to post issues or feature requests please use the Github issue list at https://github.com/rochus-keller/CspChan/issues or send an email to the author.",

There is noin any version of ISO C, nor in POSIX.2. This is not C89; at best GNU C 89, because a variable is declared after a statement: { if( msgLen == 0 ) msgLen = 1; &#x2F;* queueLen == 0 is an unbuffered channel, but we still need one slot to transport the message *&#x2F; CspChan_t* c = (CspChan_t*)malloc(sizeof(CspChan_t) + queueLen*msgLen);To help enforce that you&#x27;re actually writing C89, you should set your compiler to C89 and turn on whatever additional diagnostics may be required like -pedantic. reply samsquire 13 hours agoprevWow, thank you for this. Good work!Some thoughts:I&#x27;ve often thought that unbuffered channels would cause scheduling thrashing - higher latency and lower throughput because you&#x27;re swapping between stopping and starting processes blocked on a channel frequently. If you&#x27;re sending just a small piece of data like 64 bit integer at a time, or any kind of pattern where you&#x27;re using threads to break up work into tasks, this is too small breakdown of task to really scale multithreading. Want to communicate something that causes a LARGE AMOUNT of work on the other thread, to keep the processor busy. But there&#x27;s balance between latency and throughput, if you send a big task you get higher latency to react to the next task but better throughput.Walking through my thinking and help me understand: If you have multiple channels that you could read from in a select call but none are ready, could you block that select instance and process a different process where other selects are potentially waiting? This is similar to blocking a goroutine or a Rust async Future task in Tokio that needs to be waked. I think this would need a scheduler. EDIT: Your scheduler to switch between \"select instances\" or what is running in a thread is the OS. reply Galanwe 2 hours agoparent> If you have multiple channels that you could read from in a select call but none are ready, could you block that select instance and process a different process where other selects are potentially waiting?From my experience, the most versatile approach for the wait on channels is best implemented as a spin lock with exponential backoff, up to a threshold that yields - effectively letting other threads perform their own select. Note that most of the time, if you are targeting latency, you would try not to get more workers than cores, meaning you would pin each worker to a core, thus not really benefiting from yielding on select.> But there&#x27;s balance between latency and throughput, if you send a big task you get higher latency to react to the next task but better throughput.Agree, but that&#x27;s mainly a client concern, the queue can propose multiple APIs. Most queues handle that with a \"burst\" mode, where you pop or push multiple messages at once instead of 1 by 1, to balance throughput vs latency. reply jpc0 23 minutes agorootparent> a spin lock with exponential backoffAlso measure before you implement this yourself, to my knowledge this is infact what the linux mutex does anyway. reply openasocket 11 hours agoprevVery interesting! I program a lot in Go, and while I have my complaints about the language, I find the CSP model to be very easy to work with.I&#x27;d recommend adding some additional documentation about the API. You mention trying to keep dynamic allocations to a minimum (which I like to hear) but it would be handy to have documentation stating which functions allocate and how much they allocate. Actually, more documentation in general would be nice, particular relating to edge cases. In Go I know that sending to a closed channel will panic, for example. But what will your library do? Return some sort of error message? Silently drop the message? Segfault? Definitely something you want prominently documented. Especially anything that could potentially segfault should be highlighted.Oh, and some benchmarks would be very interesting! reply xyproto 2 hours agoparentWhat are your complaints about the Go language that is better in C89? reply Matthias247 12 hours agoprevlibmill (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sustrik&#x2F;libmill) and libdill (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sustrik&#x2F;libdill) should be similar and probably mentioned.As far as I understand the differences between CspChan and libmill might be that libmill also implements lightweight tasks (coroutines) and everything that goes with it (IO multiplexing, async timers, etc), while CspChan uses OS threads? reply samuell 2 hours agoparentWas going to ask if the current implementation could be used together with libmill, but maybe they overlap a lot in functionality? reply Zambyte 12 hours agoprevThis is really cool!I do want to say though, if you&#x27;re considering using this for a production system: it&#x27;s worth also considering ZeroMQ inproc sockets[0].

(p50 ofshould really be a boolbool is actually #define bool _Bool. You have to includeto get it. That&#x27;s ugly enough not to want to use it.I&#x27;m looking at the April 2023 draft of ISO C. Under \"Relational Expressions\" I see that the result of an expression like x(greater than), = (greater than or equal to) shall yield 1 if the specified relation is true and 0 if it is false. The result has type int.int is still the Boolean type in C, and null pointers and zeros are still falsy, relational expressions yield 0 or 1 of type int, and #define bool is just a sham for anal retentives.> typedefs ending with _t are reserved for standards extensionsThat is inaccurate. It&#x27;s POSIX that reserves this namespace. Even if you&#x27;re targeting POSIX, the reservation has next to no practical meaning, and can safely be ignored.Here is why. What POSIX says is that when new type names will be introduced in the future in POSIX, they will have _t as a suffix. Well, so what? New type names in ISO C will also have _t suffixes, yet ISO C doesn&#x27;t say anything about that being \"reserved\".When a new identifier is introduced, it has to start and end in something.Whenever POSIX introduces a new public identifier in the future, that identifier will either start with \"a\", or else with \"b\", or with \"c\" ... does that mean that we should stop using all identifiers in order not to tread on a reserved space?When you have a language without namespaces&#x2F;packages, you just live with the threat of a clash and deal with it when it happens.Name clashes are not just with standards like ISO C and POSIX but vendor extensions and third-party code.The mole is only a problem when it rears its head, and that&#x27;s when you whack it. reply eqvinox 13 hours agorootparent> bool is actually #define bool _Bool. You have to includeto get it. That&#x27;s ugly enough not to want to use it.Sure, which is why it got changed to a keyword in C23. I&#x27;ll agree this should have happened earlier.The return type of comparison operators is entirely irrelevant; you don&#x27;t build APIs by reference to the return type of a comparison operator. It makes a difference to the reader whether your source code says \"int\" or \"bool\", that alone is all the reason anyone should need.> That is inaccurate. It&#x27;s POSIX that reserves this namespace.You got me there. However, the question is, why would you add the _t? It serves no purpose. Typedefs have their own namespace anyway, you&#x27;re not working around some possible collision by adding the _t.That said I&#x27;ve already noted this is a commonly ignored aspect. I suppose it \"feels\" better&#x2F;correct to some readers. I will happily agree this is the weakest point of my feedback either way, yet I still rather point it out and have people learn more details about this. reply kazinator 12 hours agorootparent> The return type of comparison operators is entirely irrelevantIt is entirely relevant. The boolean type of the language is whatever is the type of (0Typedefs have their own namespace anywayTypedefs positively do not have their own namespace.If you write #undef getc { typedef char getc; }you cannot call the getc function in that scope; it is now the typedef. reply codys 8 hours agorootparentWhen folks talk about namespaces, structs, & typedefs in C, it&#x27;s to call out that `struct X` and `typedef int X;` can both exist at the same time. In other words, nothing prevents one from doing a `typedef struct X { int f; } X;` or similar, using `X` as the name in both places.It is true that it&#x27;s more correct to say \"struct names have their own namespace\", though I think we can infer what&#x27;s actually meant here fairly easily. reply kazinator 8 hours agorootparent> more correct to say \"struct names have their own namespace\"That is false. If we declare an \"enum foo\", which is not a struct, then we cannot have a \"struct foo\" in that scope. reply codys 7 hours agorootparentSure, you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s just not really relevant here. reply kazinator 7 hours agorootparentWell, your two comments set a standard for relevance that is not easily attained by others. reply__d 4 hours agorootparentprev> int is still the Boolean type in C, and null pointers and zeros are still > falsy, relational expressions yield 0 or 1 of type int, and #define bool > is just a sham for anal retentives.Alternatively, and especially in a library API, using bool is a clear specification of semantics.An int parameter could have many meanings. An int return value similarly. In both cases, using \"bool\" makes the usage instantly more clear, without the need for comments, or man pages, or Doxygen, or super_long_parameter_names, or whatever.I think it&#x27;s useful. reply Xeamek 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat about size of stored bool variable? Just using int will take 4 bytes (Or something else, but still bigger then 1), while stdbool will only use 1 byte, no? reply kazinator 10 hours agorootparentIn arrays, you can use char.

In this case it&#x27;s a status retrieval function so it&#x27;s pretty clear that it&#x27;s intended as a boolean but it&#x27;d still be better to actually make it bool. reply coumbaya 13 hours agorootparentAh, I get it now, thx. reply jjgreen 9 hours agoparentprevIIRC, reservation of _t in typedefs is for the POSIX rather than C standards. reply buildartefact 4 hours agoparentprevDo you know of a good style guide that encapsulates common conventions like create&#x2F;destroy? reply pengaru 12 hours agoparentprevThe standards extensions reservation of _t is such a non-issue I don&#x27;t understand why people even bother mentioning it anymore.It&#x27;s become such a common practice to suffix your typedefs with _t it&#x27;s practically a de facto standard at this point.Since everyone&#x27;s already namespacing types with some kind of prefix, I don&#x27;t see the problem nor have I ever experienced a negative consequence after decades of writing C this way. reply sylware 13 hours agoparentprevEven C has already a syntax way too rich and complex (and C11 and C17 tantrums are making things worse).Integer promotion should go, like implicit cast for anything except void* and literals, but we are missing a dynamic&#x2F;static casts syntax explicit split. Only one loop keyword, loop {}, no switch, no anonymous block, no \"a?b:c\" operator. typedef has to go, (and typeof,generic,etc), the variable arguments of preprocessor function should be defined once and for all. __thread must go as tls should be managed dynamically and explicitely with the system interface, never statically and hidden by the runtime. Only sized primitive types (u8&#x2F;s8...). That said, anonymous union&#x2F;struct are very nice for complex memory layout.And all the things I am forgetting right now.With the pre-processor and coding discipline you can get close to that already, but I was told that what I am describing is basically the simplicity of rust syntax, true? Namely it is easier to write a naive rust compiler than a C compiler? reply IlliOnato 12 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s wrong with ternary operator (\"a?b:c\") ? It seems many people hate it but I&#x27;ve never seen a reason for it.This operator is very useful and uncontroversial in Perl, it&#x27;s normal (and quite readable) in selecting a value for assignment. One is expected to use good practices with it, but it is nice.Is the problem the fact that in C you can use it instead of if, selecting not values but actions, like (a > b) ? printf(\"A\") : printf(\"B\"); reply zogrodea 12 hours agorootparentI (a different person replying to your post) don&#x27;t mind ternary operators, but I do prefer if-expressions which convey the same thing semantically but can be nicer to read (and also way better when chaining else-if ladders - nested ternaries can be a nightmare to read). https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;46843369 reply 8372049 7 hours agorootparentTo me personally, the use case for ?: is selecting a value for a const: const value = cond ? a : b;Using an if instead would mean you can&#x27;t make it const, and is usually more convoluted to read.For pretty much all other use cases, I agree that ifs are better. reply kevindamm 1 hour agorootparentIn that case you can have the result of a function call be assigned to the const, and the function be the if&#x2F;else for the value. With a well-named function it can even be more readable than the ternary. reply dgfitz 11 hours agorootparentprevI don’t like them because they’re easy to write and a pain to deal with later. My biggest irritation comes when I’d like to break inside the if or else clause of a ternary and can’t. There is also more mental overhead to parse and keep in the mental stack.I have also seen them used cleanly and beautifully, but that is a rare occurrence. reply speed_spread 8 hours agorootparentprevI like the ternary too but to pretend that it&#x27;s ok because it&#x27;s useful in perl is more of a counter argument... reply lelanthran 3 hours agorootparentprev> Namely it is easier to write a naive rust compiler than a C compiler?You must be joking. reply cellularmitosis 3 hours agorootparentprevEasier to write a rust compiler than a C compiler? I must be somehow misinterpreting this. reply dekhn 11 hours agoparentprevI feel like this comment could be best structured in the form of a series of commits sent as a combined Merge Request.First, a commit to change the docs to say it&#x27;s a pure C99 (or C11 or C17) implementation.Second, for each of your points, a single commit fixing each style issue (_dispose -> _destroy, typedefs).Seperately, another MR with the commit for _select improvements.Or maybe just send the C99 one first, and if that gets rejected, don&#x27;t bother with the rest. reply rockwotj 13 hours agoprevRelated is libmill, which has been around for awhile and is was previously discussed on HN: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30699829libmill supports a bunch of stuff like sockets, timers, files, etc. reply adastra22 4 hours agoparentDomains are expired. Do you have other links? reply iainmerrick 11 hours agoprevSorry for going a bit off-topic, but something I&#x27;m curious about: are channels thought to be a good&#x2F;useful tool for concurrent programming?My feeling is that they&#x27;re probably too low-level and error-prone, and you really want higher-level structures like worker pools or actors. So as a concurrency building block they&#x27;d be on the same abstraction level as pthreads or Java monitors -- nice and flexible for building on top of, but too finicky to be used directly in application code.But I&#x27;m not a Go expert, and maybe Go programmers do successfully use channels directly for application code? reply openasocket 10 hours agoparentI program in Go a lot professionally. I use channels a decent amount of the time, but often drop down to using mutexes or atomics. But I generally prefer channels to mutexes and atomics; generally I reach for those alternatives only due to performance concerns.One thing that struck me about your comment is referring to actors as a “higher level structure” compared to channels. Comparing Go channels with the actor model is more a matter of apples and oranges than one being more high level than the other. Go is built on the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) model: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Communicating_sequential_pro... . See the comparison to the actor model in that article if you are curious. The essential idea to CSP is that you have independent processes that only communicate with each other via these channels. This is in comparison to the actor mode where each process has its own dedicated “mailbox” that it can receive from (but can send messages to any other actor it wants). I think that wiki does a better job of outlining the differences than I can in a comment, but essentially these are two similar but subtly different ways to model parallelism.Personally, I find the CSP model a bit more intuitive than the actor model (though admittedly I have not worked with the actor model as extensively). For the basic idea of “make a process that receives input data, processes it, and submits output data somewhere else” CSP and the actor model are more or less identical. But for more complex use cases, like a process that can receive multiple kinds of messages from different places, or having multiple processes all handling the same stream of incoming data (aka load balancing) I find the CSP model more intuitive. This might be personal bias though. In particular I’ve never seen an actor model with static types and how that would handle different types of messages coming into the mailbox.Short answer: channels for concurrent programming is definitely a good tool. reply iainmerrick 9 hours agorootparentPersonally, I find the CSP model a bit more intuitive than the actor model (though admittedly I have not worked with the actor model as extensively).That’s really the question I was trying to ask -- is the CSP style suitably intuitive for general-purpose use? I personally find other primitives easier to use, but that could well just be my bias.(I’ve done some academic work around process calculi, a long time ago now, and I always found the CSP style much more awkward than CCS &#x2F; π-calculus.)I’ve never seen an actor model with static types and how that would handle different types of messages coming into the mailbox.I think it fits really well in an OO approach, where your messages just become method calls on the actor object -- I believe Swift does that.That transformation of a method call into a message struct is a kind of defunctionalization, which is a really useful technique (in e.g. Redux) but usually involves a ton of boilerplate. Having a core language primitive that gives you defunctionalization and concurrency, now that’s interesting. I feel like that’s something I would end up building by hand on top of channels (I haven’t done that in Go, but I have for web workers). reply openasocket 8 hours agorootparent> I think it fits really well in an OO approach, where your messages just become method calls on the actor object -- I believe Swift does that.That’s definitely true. Here’s what I think of as a motivating example: consider a process that takes input data in an input channel, provides some sort of enrichment, and writes the result to an output channel. Simple, right? Now imagine that enrichment requires some sort of configuration data. And that’s mostly static, but there are regular updates to that configuration that are provided by some sort of side channel. In the CSP model, that’s fine: have the process read from two channels, one with input data and the other with updated configuration data. In the Actor model, you have to read from your mailbox, check if this is an input message or a configuration update, and act accordingly. There’s no sort of OO approach that makes that switch statement feel “natural.” I feel that there’s no point into trying to shoehorn both that input data and configuration updates into the same message queue. Any attempt to do so in a clean way is basically just putting arbitrary functions onto a queue.That said, I recognize that, beyond certain edge cases, the two models are logically equivalent. reply jen20 6 hours agorootparentprev> In particular I’ve never seen an actor model with static types and how that would handle different types of messages coming into the mailbox.This is what sum types give you, or dynamic handler registration if you need to support runtime-configurable message types (perhaps plugins or something).There’s a good article about Tokio tasks as actors: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ryhl.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;actors-with-tokio&#x2F;Of course, these still use channels! reply JyB 11 hours agoparentprevThe opposite. Channels are often used to orchestrate higher-level structures&#x2F;abstractions; not &#x27;low-level&#x27; stuff where more common primitives such as mutexes&#x2F;semaphores are sometime preferred. reply mmcgaha 13 hours agoprevWhen it said pure C89 I figured it was going to have some setjmp and longjmp going on instead of threads. reply galkk 13 hours agoprevEven looking at simple code example, with casting from&#x2F;to void, returning 0 as void etc, I cannot understand how people are calling C easy and productive language reply zeroCalories 12 hours agoparentDespite all of the scary casting, there is fairly little you need to know about C to understand what&#x27;s going on. reply codys 6 hours agoparentprevThe things you&#x27;ve described are either not required or often considered bad style in C even though they are valid C.Casting to&#x2F;from `void *` isn&#x27;t needed in C, and is commonly against coding conventions, like those used by the Linux kernel.One would generally return `NULL` instead of `0` as `void *`.But yes, it is possible to write some funky C code that could be technically correct but still not be considered good. reply vngzs 13 hours agoparentprevThat claim isn&#x27;t made on the linked site, though. I think people who write C nowadays tend to be working in the drivers and OS development spaces. reply 0xbadcafebee 4 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s at least 4 kinds of C programmers today:- People who work on projects which require low-level access, potentially mixing in assembly code (drivers, OS, etc), porting to different architectures, real-time, high-precision, control of timing, lack of MMU, etc- People who want to perform specific actions, like a specific OS syscall, that may not be exposed [easily] by a higher level language in the way the programmer wants- People who want to write very fast&#x2F;efficient code- Legacy code maintainersNot too long ago I busted out some C to create a stripped binary for a job interview round. The interviewee needed to diagnose what the binary was doing and why and report back. Not all that common for most programmers today, but I expect a good amount of detail from a senior-level systems candidate. reply trealira 9 hours agorootparentprev> I think people who write C nowadays tend to be working in the drivers and OS development spaces.I think it&#x27;s also students; I think some people are still taught C as their first programming language.

Again. Productive.I, of course, take the precaution of allocating time to blow up 5&#x2F;8 of a solar system&#x2F;a star into my projects. I have a tendency to find ways to do things other than intended, and like to absorb the lessons.As a result, I have quite the collection of ways not to do things, or how to do things other than I intended.

    "originBody": "AI & Machine Learning Imagen 2 on Vertex AI is now generally available December 13, 2023 Vishy Tirumalashetty Head of Product, Generative Media, Cloud AI Join us at Google Cloud Next Early bird pricing available now through Jan 31st. Register Today, we’re sharing a significant upgrade to Google Cloud’s image-generation capabilities with Imagen 2, our most advanced text-to-image technology, which is now generally available for Vertex AI customers on the allowlist (i.e., approved for access). Imagen 2 on Vertex AI allows our customers to customize and deploy Imagen 2 with intuitive tooling, fully-managed infrastructure, and built-in privacy and safety features. Developed using Google DeepMind technology, Imagen 2 delivers significantly improved image quality and a host of features that enable developers to create images for their specific use case, including: Generating high-quality, photorealistic, high-resolution, aesthetically pleasing images from natural language prompts Text rendering in multiple languages to create images with accurate text overlays Logo generation to create company or product logos and overlay them in images Visual question and answering for generating captions from images, and for getting informative text responses to questions about image details Importantly, Vertex AI’s indemnification commitment now covers Imagen on Vertex AI, which includes Imagen 2 and future generally available upgrades of the model powering the service. We employ an industry-first, two-pronged copyright indemnification approach that can give customers peace of mind when using our generative AI products. Enterprise-ready text-to-image capabilities Imagen 2 on Vertex AI boasts a variety of image generation features to help organizations create images that match their specific brand requirements with the same enterprise-grade reliability and governance customers are used to with Imagen. New features now available in Imagen 2 include: High quality Images: Imagen 2 can achieve accurate, high-quality photorealistic outputs with improved image+text understanding and a variety of novel training and modeling techniques. Text rendering support: Text-to-image technologies often have difficulty correctly rendering text. If a model is prompted to generate a picture of an object with a specific word or phrase, for example, it can be challenging to ensure the correct phrase is part of the output image. Imagen 2 helps solve for this, which can give organizations a deeper level of control for branding and messaging. Logo generation: Imagen 2 can generate a wide variety of creative and realistic logos — including emblems, lettermarks, and abstract logos — for business, brands, and products. It also has the ability to overlay these logos onto products, clothing, business cards, and other surfaces. Captions and question-answer: Imagen 2’s enhanced image understanding capabilities enable customers to create descriptive, long-form captions and get detailed answers to questions about elements within the image. Multi-language prompts: Beyond English, Imagen 2 is launching with support for six additional languages (Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish) in preview, with many others planned for release in early 2024. This feature includes the capability to translate between prompt and output, e.g., prompting in Spanish but specifying that the output should be in Portuguese. Safety: Imagen 2 includes built-in safety precautions to help ensure that generated images align with Google’s Responsible AI principles. For example, Imagen 2 is integrated with our experimental digital watermarking service, powered by Google DeepMind’s SynthID, which enables allowlisted customers to generate invisible watermarks and verify images generated by Imagen. Imagen 2 also includes comprehensive safety filters to help prevent generation of potentially harmful content. Check out how customers are using Imagen API — and how to get started We look forward to organizations using these new features to build on the results they’ve already achieved with Imagen. Snap is using Imagen to help Snapchat+ subscribers to express their inner creativity. With the new AI Camera Mode, they can tap a button, type in a prompt or choose a pre-selected one, and generate a scene to share with family and friends or post to their story. “Imagen is the most scalable text-to-image model with the safety and image quality we need,” said Josh Siegel, Senior Director of Product at Snap. “One of the major benefits of Imagen for Snap is that we can focus on what we do best, which is the product design and the way that it looks and makes you feel. We know that when we work on new products like AI Camera Mode, we can really rely on the brand safety, scalability, and reliability that comes with Google Cloud.” Shutterstock has also emerged as a leading innovator bringing AI to creative production — including being the first to launch an ethically-sourced AI image generator, now enhanced with Imagen on Vertex AI. With the Shutterstock AI image generator, users can turn simple text prompts into unique, striking visuals, allowing them to create at the speed of their imaginations. The Shutterstock website includes a searchable collection of more than 16,000 Imagen pictures, all available for licensing. “We exist to empower the world to tell their stories by bridging the gap between idea and execution. Variety is critical for the creative process, which is why we continue to integrate the latest and greatest technology into our image generator and editing features—as long as it is built on responsibly sourced data,” said Chris Loy, Director of AI Services, Shutterstock. “The Imagen model on Vertex AI is an important addition to our AI image generator, and we're excited to see how it enables greater creative capabilities for our users as the model continues to evolve.\" Canva is also using Imagen on Vertex AI to bring ideas to life, with millions of images generated with the model to date. Users can access Imagen as an app directly within Canva and with a simple text prompt, generate a captivating image that fits their design needs. “Partnering with Google Cloud, we’re continuing to use generative AI to innovate the design process and augment imagination,” said Danny Wu, Head of AI at Canva. “With Imagen, our 170M+ monthly users can benefit from the image quality improvements to uplevel their content creation at scale. The new model and features will further empower our community to turn their ideas into real images with as little friction as possible.\" To get started with Imagen 2 on Vertex AI, find our documentation or reach out to your Google Cloud account representative to join the Trusted Tester Program.

It would be great to see some comparisons or benchmarks to show Imagen 2 is a better alternative. As it stands, it&#x27;s hard for me to tell if this is worth switching to. reply larodi 1 hour agoparentI was going to pretty much state the same - the obvious, while also adding insult to injury by saying that with recent announces in the lats few weeks, it seems that Google desperately needs to shine in the world of AI, but fails to do so (despite 2000+ votes for new Bard, which is still not so good).Now, from a designer perspective, honestly, I don&#x27;t care too much who&#x27;s the provider of the image, since one will have to anyway work more on it. So designers, illustrators, etc are not the target for such platforms, even though it seems counter-intuitive. If you ask me which system was the source for an image used for a poster last 12 months... well, I may remember, but is not of a paramount importance to the end result. After an year of active usage of DALLE2&#x2F;3, SDXL, Midjourney (which is also SD of some sort) I can confidently state that there is much more work to do and a lot of prompting, to actually get something unique and something worth being used. Sadly the time taken is proportionate to working with actual real artist. Of course - the latter is likely to be hit by this new innovation, but perhaps not so much.From the perspective of s.o. integrating text-ot-image - which is yet to be seen in a reasonable manner, like for a quest game with generative images - the API flexibility and cost would be the most important qualifier. Even then it may actually be better to run SD&#x2F;XL.

The amount of othering and trash-talking is incredibly disturbing.- _someone_ has to slavishly overwork on any given project because there&#x27;s very little planning. due to the \"meh everythings good!\" inclination, coupled to software being pretty hard to plan accurately anyway. so what&#x27;s the point of planning it all?- newly minted middle managers are used to clinging onto anything their manager cares about and overworking, so they end up being a massive bottleneck for their reports.

It doesn&#x27;t matter how detailed (or whatever counts as \"better\") corporate text-to-image products get, stable diffusion is good enough which really is good enough.

No paid txt2img offering comes anywhere close to market dominance for image generation. They don&#x27;t offer anything that isn&#x27;t available with free alternatives (they actually offer less) and are highly restrictive in comparison.

In my experience SD was just as good in terms of \"understanding\" but offers way more features when using something like AUTOMATIC 1111.If you&#x27;re just generating something for fun then DallE&#x2F;MJ is probably sufficient, but if you&#x27;re doing a project that requires specific details&#x2F;style&#x2F;consistency you&#x27;re going to need way more tools. With SD&#x2F;A*1111 you can use a specific model (one that generates images with an Anime style for instance), use a ControlNet model for a specific pose, generate hundreds of potential images (without having to pay for each), use other tools like img2img&#x2F;inpaint to hone your vision using the images you like, and if you&#x27;re looking for a specific effect (like a gif for instance), you can use the many extensions created by the community to make it happen. reply doctorpangloss 14 hours agorootparentprev> Dalle3 and this is miles ahead in understanding scene and put correct text at the right place.I guess that turns out to be not as important for end users as you&#x27;d think.Anyway, DeepFloyd&#x2F;IF has great comprehension.

    "originBody": "Cortex A57, Nintendo Switch’s CPU December 12, 2023 clamchowder 7 Comments In the early 2010s, Arm’s 32-bit cores had established themselves in cell phones and tablets. But rising memory capacities in those devices meant Arm would have to go 64-bit sooner or later. On top of that, Arm had server ambitions – and 64-bit support was essential for the server market. That brings us to the Cortex A57. Alongside the previously covered Cortex A53, the A57 represents Arm’s first generation of 64-bit capable cores. We’re going to cover the Cortex A57 as implemented in the Nintendo Switch’s Nvidia Tegra X1. The Tegra X1 targets a wide range of applications including mobile devices and automobiles. It focuses on providing high GPU performance in a limited power envelope, making it perfect for a portable gaming console like the Switch. Tegra X1 consumes 117,6 mm2 on TSMC’s 20 nm (20 SoC) process and uses a quad core A57 cluster to provide the bulk of its CPU power. Each Cortex A57 core consumes just under 2 mm2 of area, and the quad core A57 cluster takes 13.16 mm2. Die shot from Fritzchens Fritz. Annotations added by clam The SoC also contains a cluster of four A53 cores for power efficient processing, but Nintendo has chosen not to use them. A LPDDR4 memory controller connects the Tegra X1 to 4 GB of DRAM with up to 25.6 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth. In the Tegra X1, the Cortex A57 cores clock up to 1.78 GHz. Under Ubuntu, they take around a third of a second to go from 1.2 GHz up to their maximum speed. Overview Cortex A57 is a 3-wide out-of-order core with large maximum reordering capacity, but relatively small schedulers and other supporting structures. Arm’s designers have definitely prioritized low power and area over high performance, but A57 is more ambitious of a design than older low power cores like AMD’s Jaguar or Intel’s Silvermont. It brings some unique features to the table too, like a flexible register file where multiple 32-bit entries can be used to hold 64-bit or 128-bit results. The Cortex A57 can be implemented in clusters of up to four cores with a shared L2 cache. L2 capacity can be set to 512 KB, 1 MB, or 2 MB. Nvidia has chosen the 2 MB option for the Tegra X1, trading some area for higher performance. Unlike modern Arm cores, L1 capacities aren’t configurable. They’re fixed at 48 KB for the instruction cache and 32 KB for the data cache. However, implementers can turn off error correction for the L1 caches to gain some area and power efficiency at the cost of reliability. Arm’s diagram of a quad core A57 cluster, from the A57 technical reference manual Frontend: Branch Prediction A CPU’s branch predictor tells the pipeline where to go. Fast and accurate branch prediction helps both performance and power efficiency by keeping the pipeline fed and avoiding wasted work. But branch predictors themselves take area and power, so CPU designers have to find the right balance when deciding how sophisticated of a branch predictor to implement. Low power CPUs like the Cortex A57 don’t have the speculation distance or core throughput of desktop CPUs, so Arm has given the A57 a modest branch predictor. The predictor uses global history, which means it predicts whether a branch is taken or not taken depending on how previous branches in the instruction stream behaved (and not necessarily the history of the branch being predicted). A57’s predictor can’t track extremely long patterns like branch predictors on desktops. But it should be adequate for a low power design, and avoids chasing diminishing returns. To minimize branch delays, Cortex A57 has two levels of caching for branch targets, or branch target buffers (BTBs). The first level BTB has 64 entries and handles taken branches with a 1 cycle delay. A second level BTB with 2048 to 4096 entries helps A57 deal with larger branch footprints. Targets that come from the L2 BTB incur a 2 cycle delay. Branch latency drastically increases once the test exceeds L1 instruction cache capacity, suggesting the L2 BTB is tied to the L1i. Indirect branches can jump to several different destinations instead of a fixed one. They’re more challenging to predict because the frontend has to choose between multiple targets instead of just guessing whether the branch is taken or not taken. However, indirect prediction capability is crucial because indirect branches tend to show up in object oriented languages. A57’s indirect predictor can track up to 16 different targets for a single branch. In total, it was able to track 128 indirect targets without significant penalty. That was achieved with 64 branches, each alternating between two targets. Arm’s slides suggest the indirect predictor has 512 entries. Returns are a special case of indirect branches. A function can return to several different call sites, but tracking them is typically as simple as pushing the address of the next instruction when encountering a call instruction, then popping the address off when hitting a corresponding return. Test results weren’t as easy to interpret as on other CPUs. However, there’s a bit of an inflection point around 32 nested calls. Perhaps A57 has a 32 entry return stack. Frontend: Fetch and Decode Once the branch predictor has decided where to go, the core has to fetch instruction bytes and decode them. Cortex A57’s 48 KB 3-way instruction cache is the first stop for instructions. It has optional parity protection at 4 byte granularity for data and 36-bit granularity for tags. Parity errors are resolved by invalidating the line with the error and reloading it from L2. Virtual to physical address translation is handled by a fully associative 48 entry instruction TLB. On an instruction cache miss, A57 generates a fill request to L2. To improve code fetch bandwidth from L2, the core also prefetches the next sequential line. From testing, L2 code fetch bandwidth is low at about 1 IPC. Desktop CPUs and more recent Arm cores can achieve better code throughput from L2, but somehow A57 does better than the newer Cortex A72. On both A57 and A72, the relatively large 48 KB instruction cache should help reduce misses compared to the 32 KB instruction caches typical on other CPUs. After instructions are fetched, they’re queued into a 32 entry buffer that feeds into the decoders. Instructions are then translated into micro-ops. A57’s decoders also do register renaming to remove false write-after-write dependencies. Unlike renamers on contemporary x86 CPUs or modern Arm cores, A57’s renamer doesn’t perform move elimination or break dependencies with zeroing idioms. Out of Order Execution Engine A CPU’s out-of-order execution engine is responsible for tracking in-flight instructions, executing them as their inputs become available, and committing their results while respecting ISA rules. Cortex A57’s execution engine can have up to 40 instruction bundles in flight. Measuring ROB size using Henry Wong’s methodology. The X-axis count includes pointer chasing load instructions. Each bundle can contain multiple instructions, but NOPs appear to be an exception. A NOP consumes an entire bundle, explaining why a naive reorder buffer capacity test with NOPs shows 40 entries. However, at least eight math instructions can be stored together in one bundle. That includes 32-bit or 64-bit integer adds as well as 128-bit vector ones. Memory accesses and branches consume an entire bundle like NOPs do. Unified Register File Unlike most CPUs, Cortex A57 uses a 128 entry unified register file to handle renaming for both integer and floating point registers. CPUs typically have separate integer and FP register files because integer registers need low latency, while FP registers have to be wider to handle vector execution. Cortex A57’s scheme could be an area saving measure because it lets A57 work with one register file instead of two. Maximum reordering capacity is achieved with 32-bit values Because the register file’s entries are 32 bits wide, A57 is at its best when handling 32-bit integer code. Floating point code will see contention between integer and FP instructions for shared register file capacity. 64-bit or 128-bit values are supported by allocating multiple 32-bit values. The core still has adequate renaming capacity for 64-bit values, but things get tight with 128-bit vectors. Curiously, A57’s ends up a bit off its nominal register file capacity if I mix different register widths. I suspect A57’s register file acts like that of GPUs, and has alignment restrictions when using multiple 32-bit entries to store a larger value. Test Measured Renaming Capacity Renamed Register File Usage Mixed 64-bit Integer and 128-bit Vector Registers 41 20x 64-bit (40x 32-bit entries) 21x 128-bit (84x 32-bit entries) 2x 32-bit for pointer chasing loads 2 unused? Mixed 32-bit Integer and 128-bit Vector Registers 41 20x 32-bit 21x 128-bit (84x 32-bit entries) 2x 32-bit for pointer chasing loads 22 unused? Mixed 32-bit FP and 128-bit Vector Registers 42 21x 32-bit 21x 128-bit (84x 32-bit entries) 2x 32-bit for pointer chasing loads 21 unused? Depending on how smaller registers are allocated, the renamer might not be able to find a contiguous aligned block of four 32-bit registers when it needs space to store a 128-bit value. So while A57 uses register storage more efficiently than modern CPUs, it’s not perfect. When instructions retire, their results are copied from the renamed register file into a separate architectural register file (ARF). Like on Intel’s original P6, this scheme is potentially easier to implement because renamed registers can be freed when an instruction retires. Exception recovery is also easy because known-good register state is held in one place. However, the ARF scheme requires more data movement and thus consumes more power. Intel moved to a PRF scheme with Sandy Bridge, and Arm did the same with Cortex A73. Arm’s newer Cortex A72 possibly uses a scheme similar to the A57. I went back over data collected on that CPU and there are certainly similarities to A57 data. When I tested the A72, I rushed because I was paying for a Graviton 1 cloud instance, and thus had limited time to write different tests to explore the core. I’ll have to revisit A72 when work and real life demands give me a break. Schedulers A57 uses a mostly distributed scheduling scheme with small dedicated schedulers feeding each execution unit. Most of the schedulers have eight entries. The two exceptions are the branch scheduler, which has 12 entries, and the load/store AGUs, which share a 16 entry scheduling queue. Scheduling capacity is likely to limit A57’s reordering capacity before the register file or reorder buffer fills. Instruction Category A57 Scheduling Entries Available Skylake Scheduling Entries Available Common integer operations (add, shift, bitwise operations) 16 58 FP/Vector operations 16 58 Memory operations 16 39 Integer Execution Units Like many low power CPUs, A57 has two integer pipelines capable of handling the most common operations. Multi-cycle integer operations go to a separate pipe. Multiplies go down this pipe and take five cycles to produce a 64-bit result. Branches get a separate port as well, likely to ensure they’re resolved as quickly as possible to minimize mispredict penalties. From the A57 optimization guide In theory, A57 can execute four integer operations per cycle. In practice, that will rarely occur because branches and multi-cycle integer operations are far less common than simple ones. Floating Point and Vector Execution FP and vector operations are handled by a pair of ports, each fed by an 8 entry scheduler. Arm’s optimization manual suggests both ports can handle basic FP operations like addition and multiplication, but I was unable to get two scalar FP operations per cycle. 128-bit packed FP operations also execute at one per cycle, so Cortex A57 does have 128 bits of total FP throughput but strangely can’t execute two FP instructions per cycle. Test Cortex A57 Skylake 32-bit Scalar FP Adds 1 per cycle 5 cycle latency 2 per cycle 4 cycle latency 32-bit Scalar FP Multiplies 0.83 per cycle 6 cycle latency 2 per cycle 4 cycle latency 32-bit Scalar FP Fused Multiply Add 1 per cycle 10 cycle latency 2 per cycle 4 cycle latency Mixed 32-bit Scalar FP Adds and Multiplies 0.83 per cycle128-bit packed FP32 Adds 1 per cycle 5 cycle latency 2 per cycle 4 cycle latency 128-bit packed FP32 Multiplies 1 per cycle 6 cycle latency 2 per cycle 4 cycle latency 128-bit packed FP32 Fused Multiply Add 1 per cycle 10 cycle latency 2 per cycle 4 cycle latency ARM’s ASIMD/NEON instruction set provides fmla and fmadd instructions for fused multiply add operations. These execute at one per cycle on Cortex A57, doubling FP throughput. However, latency is very high at 10 cycles. Vector integer operations enjoy better performance. Both pipelines can handle 128-bit packed integer adds and other basic operations. Latency however is still high. Vector integer adds have 3 cycles of latency, and multiplies have four cycle latency. 128-bit packed integer multiplies only use the first FP pipe, and execute at a rate of one per two cycles. Load/Store Memory operations are handled by a pair of pipelines. One handles loads and the other handles stores. Cortex A57 can have 32 loads and 12 stores in-flight. The small store queue size will likely limit reordering capacity. Zen 4 already sees its store queue fill often. If we consider that A57 is designed to keep around 128 instructions in flight, the store queue covers less of the core’s reordering window than on Zen 4. Unlike newer Arm cores and contemporary desktop CPUs, Cortex A57 doesn’t try to predict whether memory operations will be independent. Therefore, loads are stalled until all prior store addresses have been resolved. For dependent loads, store forwarding latency is typically seven cycles. Forwarding latency is doubled if a load partially overlaps a 16B aligned store, but otherwise there are no notable slow paths. Store to load forwarding test, using Henry Wong’s methodology Cortex A57 translates program-visible 48-bit virtual addresses to 44-bit physical addresses with a fully associative 32 entry DTLB. With 4K pages, those 32 entries should cover 128 KB of address space. DTLB misses can be caught by a unified 1024 entry 4-way set associative L2 TLB. This L2 TLB also handles misses from the instruction TLB. 44-bit physical addressing lets Cortex A57 address up to 16 TB of memory. Arm’s newer cores like the Cortex X2 only support 40-bit physical addresses, with larger physical address capability reserved for Arm’s Neoverse line. A57 was expected to take on both client and server roles, and had to make a compromise. Cache and Memory Latency Memory accesses first check Cortex A57’s 32 KB 2-way set associative data cache. The data cache has optional ECC protection with 4 byte granularity. Data cache accesses generally have four cycle latency, or 5 cycles for indexed addressing. A57 suffers heavily from address translation penalties when using 4K pages. Latency spikes to 16 cycles at the 12 KB test size. The spike goes away when using huge pages, suggesting we’re somehow getting TLB misses even though the test array should be well within TLB coverage. L1 misses go to a shared 2 MB L2 cache. The L2 has mandatory ECC protection for both data and tags, helping with data integrity. To save on area and power, the L2 cache uses a random replacement policy. That means the cache doesn’t have to store metadata on which lines were most recently or frequently used, but can lead to sub-optimal decisions on what data to kick out when bringing new lines in. Arm lets implementers configure L2 latency to keep clocks up with larger L2 options. It’s impossible to tell if Nvidia used any of these register slicing options, but testing showed the L2 has 22 cycles of load-to-use latency. However, adding L2 TLB latency brings this to over 50 cycles. Finally, DRAM access takes around 250 cycles. Intel’s Skylake is roughly contemporary with Nvidia’s Tegra X1 and enjoys better latency throughout the memory hierarchy. Access to the i5-6600K’s 6 MB last level cache takes about 11.2 ns, and that includes a few cycles to get an address translation from the L2 TLB. Memory latency on the Nintendo Switch is high by desktop standards. LPDDR4 likely contributes to higher latency, but is a necessary design choice for a bandwidth hungry low power device. Core to Core Latency Multi-core systems have to ensure all cores have a coherent view of memory. Cortex A57’s L2 cache handles this by being strictly inclusive of L1 data cache contents, and maintaining duplicate copies of the L1 data cache tag arrays. We can test how fast two cores can exchange data by using __sync_bool_compare_and_swap to bounce a value between them. Even though transfers are taking place within a core cluster, latency is higher than cross-cluster latency on AMD’s Zen. That said, a good program will avoid shuffling data between cores. Tegra X1’s higher core to core latency should have minimal impact on performance. Bandwidth Cortex A57’s L1 data cache can service a load and a store every cycle. With 128-bit vector accesses, that gives 28 GB/s of L1D read bandwidth. Strangely, L1 bandwidth falls off after 16 KB. As with latency, using hugepages makes the dip go away, suggesting address translation penalties are cutting into bandwidth. I saw the same behavior with A72. Cortex A57’s cluster-wide L2 cache is 16-way set associative, and has 2 MB of capacity on the Tegra X1. The L2 tags are divided into two banks, letting it service two requests per cycle. Each tag bank covers four data banks. For a single core, the L2 can provide about 8 bytes per cycle of read bandwidth. Thanks to banking, we get a nice bandwidth increase with two cores loaded. However, L2 bandwidth increases taper off as we load more cores. In contrast, Intel’s L3 cache has as many banks as there are cores, allowing for excellent bandwidth scaling. The Core i5-6600K’s L3 can deliver a massive amount of bandwidth, and a single Skylake core can get more cache bandwidth than all four of Tegra X1’s Cortex A57 cores combined. Intel’s quad-banked L3 cache delivers better per-cycle performance too, at just above 62 bytes per cycle with a memory bandwidth test running across four cores. Cortex A57’s shared L2 is stuck at 15.72 bytes per cycle. L2 write bandwidth is somewhat lower likely due to overhead from read-for-ownership requests. L2 misses are generally satisfied by the DRAM controller. Tegra X1’s LPDDR4 setup should provide 25.6 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth. From the CPU cores, we get just under 30% of that figure. Bandwidth stops increasing after 2 to 3 cores are loaded, and tops out below 8 GB/s. For comparison, a Core i5-6600K with dual channel DDR4-2133 achieved 28.6 GB/s in the same test. That’s 83% of the theoretical 34.1 GB/s available. Incredibly, Skylake enjoys higher memory bandwidth than Cortex A57 does from its L2. Write bandwidth shows a similar story. A57’s memory bandwidth continues to be poor and far below what Skylake enjoys. Thanks to agent_x007 for contributing the bandwidth test run on Jaguar AMD’s Jaguar provides another comparison point. It similarly uses a 2 MB shared L2 cache, but AMD enjoys twice as much L2 bandwidth. Tegra X1 implements a more modern 64-bit LPDDR4 interface compared to Jaguar’s single channel DDR3 setup, but Cortex A57 fails to achieve higher memory bandwidth. Some Light Benchmarking I’m gonna pivot here with a focus on core width. We already know how Skylake will stack up against Cortex A57 if I benchmark the two head to head. A comparison to Arm’s later Cortex A73 should be more fun, because A73 is a 2-wide core that shares some weaknesses with A57 like a small scheduler. That means A73 can’t match A57 in sustained throughput. However, A73 does run at a higher 2.2 GHz clock speed. Here, I’m testing how long it takes for 7-Zip to compress a large 2.67 GB file. To add some variety, I’m also using libx264 to transcode a 4K video down to 720P. In the compression workload, Cortex A57 pulls ahead. Higher core width wins over a narrower but faster clocked core. However, it’s a small lead of less than 5%. With video encoding, A73 wins. But again, the difference is less than 5%. Cortex A73 has just 1 MB of L2 cache compared to A57’s 2 MB, so Arm’s newer core is doing quite well. The close results are because A73 improves on aspects other than core width, and we can dig into that using performance counters. As an aside, performance counters aren’t comparable across reviews because I’m selecting the closest set of events to best compare the two cores. For example, Cortex A57 cannot count branches and branch mispredicts at retirement. It only has events that count at the execute stage. A73 introduces at-retirement events for branches and mispredicted branches. At the start of the pipeline, A73 has a stronger branch predictor. Mispredicts per instruction decreased by 20% and 27% in 7-Zip and libx264 respectively. A73 thus wastes less power and time working on the wrong stuff. At the instruction fetch stage, A73 loses width but increases instruction cache capacity to 64 KB. For libx264, this reduces instruction cache misses per instruction by 53%. Fetching from L2 or beyond costs more power than doing so from a first level cache, so A73 cuts down power spent moving instruction bytes around. 7-Zip also benefits from a larger instruction cache, but A57’s 48 KB cache was already large enough. The data side sees less change. A73 and A57 both have a 32 KB data cache, so hitrates are similar. Both tested applications see quite a few L1D refills, but libx264 struggles more. Finally, we can look at L2 misses. I’m using the l2d_cache_refill event from perf on both CPUs, but what the event is counting doesn’t seem comparable across the two CPUs. Cortex A73 counts more L2 data refills than L1D refills, so it could have a very aggressive L2 prefetcher. Cortex A57’s L2 prefetcher can generate up to eight prefetches after a L2 miss, though all have to be within the same 4K page. Arm’s Cortex-A73 MPCore Processor Technical Reference Manual mentions a L2 prefetcher, but doesn’t say if it’s more aggressive. However, A73’s L2 can support 48 pending fills, while A57’s can only support up to 20. A73 could be exploiting that increased memory level parallelism capability to reduce performance loss from a smaller L2. Final Words Taken in isolation, Arm’s Cortex A57 is a decent low power core with excellent register renaming capacity for 32-bit integer code and passable branch prediction. Within the execution engine, the core’s main weaknesses are high execution latency for floating point instructions, small scheduler capacity, and a small store queue. Some of those weaknesses are present on other low power designs too, so it’s hard to fault Arm for that. Where Cortex A57 really struggles is the memory subsystem. At a high level, the core-private 32 KB data caches and 2 MB shared last level cache are typical for a low power design. AMD uses a similar setup in Jaguar a few years prior. However, A57’s TLB setup suffers from extremely poor performance. The core suffers inexplicable L1 DTLB misses even when accessing arrays that should fit within its 128 KB coverage. When L1 DTLB msises happen, the 1024 entry L2 TLB performs poorly and adds over 20 extra cycles of latency. L2 TLBs on most other CPUs have less than 10 cycles of latency. Finally, both the L2 cache and system memory suffer from poor bandwidth. As a low power cell phone and tablet core, Cortex A57 is an acceptable design for its time. Subsequent years would see Arm develop increasingly performant low power cores as improvements in process technology allowed more sophisticated microarchitectures to fit within a few watts. As the Nintendo Switch’s CPU, Cortex A57 is weak and not comparable to even outdated desktop cores. Modern game developers are able to port games to this platform, but that no doubt involves tons of optimization work. Hogwarts Legacy for example released on Switch around nine months after its initial release on PC. Even then, the required optimizations make the Switch version almost a different game. From Digital Foundry’s video on the Hogwarts Legacy switch port, showing loading screens added on the Switch version. Some loading screens last for over 40 seconds Still, it’s a wonder that developers managed to get games like Hogwarts Legacy working on the switch at all. I wonder if similar optimization efforts could be carried out to make modern games accessible to a wider audience. A lot of gamers don’t have infinite budgets, and could be using integrated graphics on old CPUs. Switch-like optimizations could make AAA games playable on those platforms.

That is, if you enable the A57 CCX, later enabling the A53 CCX triggers the bug and vis versa, even with the first CCX disabled when enabling the second. reply colejohnson66 16 hours agoparentDoes anyone know what this \"bug\" manifests as? Your first sentence implies it&#x27;s a lockout created at reset, but your second implies it manifests post-reset through user&#x2F;programmer action. reply toast0 15 hours agorootparentI think they&#x27;re saying you get to run one CCX at a time; either the A57 cores or the A53 cores and you can only change that once after a reset. Presumably the boot time CCX is selected by selection pins. Depending on exactly what reset means, this might be something like the i286 that couldn&#x27;t leave protected mode without a reset, so systems were built for OSes that entered protected mode where they could set up a reset vector and then cause a reset and jump back to their real mode kernel. Or, it might be a very intrusive reset that results in memory contents being reset --- that&#x27;s not going to be something worth engineering around. Either way, it&#x27;s easier to just only use the A57 cores to begin with, and especially if switching between the two is problematic. reply monocasa 15 hours agorootparentYeah, I&#x27;m saying that I&#x27;ve heard that there&#x27;s some bug that&#x27;s only hit by running one CCX after you&#x27;ve run the other one.> Presumably the boot time CCX is selected by selection pins.There&#x27;s actually another core, an ARM 7 referred to as the BPMP (Bootstrap and Power Management Processor IIRC), that handles main CCX bring up. reply colejohnson66 15 hours agorootparentprevAssuming it is some \"at reset\" selection, Nvidia advertising it as an eight-core chip would be deceptive, so I&#x27;m reluctant to believe such a theory. I wouldn&#x27;t put it past marketing to do such a thing, but later revisions of the manual don&#x27;t mention the A53 cores, so I&#x27;m inclined to believe it&#x27;s a hardware bug.Unfortunately, without someone from inside Nvidia telling us, all we have are rumors and no evidence. reply toast0 13 hours agorootparentARM big.LITTLE systems started out as use one or the other, but not both simultaneously.

Nintendo is infamous for being cheapasses with their hardware design decisions, working to boost profit margins over all else.The N64 is a great example. Top notch graphics which they spent a small mint on...that was then hobbled by a storage format they could exploit more control over, resulting in ported games having to be chopped up. reply nebula8804 3 hours agorootparentThe argument they made at the time was that the cartridge format was more than just making piracy more difficult. It enabled high speed streaming of data to enable games like Ocarina of time to essentially be seamless when going from location to location. Frankly they have been averse to loading screens for a long time. Even the gamecube had a format that served multiple purposes, having a security advantage(at the time of design) and enabling higher speed data transfers again because they hated those loading screens so much. These days I think the mentality has shifted a bit now that a newer generation is really calling many of the shots there.>Top notch graphics which they spent a small mint onFrom what I understood the design was a completed SGI design that was originally going to go to Sega but they passed on it and it went to Nintendo. This was the advent of 3D Graphics in the consumer video game market and so of course they were going to make mistakes. Its questionable how much Nintendo was involved in the low level design but they did end up providing a very decent graphics solution at a reasonable price point.Hell the PSX has that terrible fixed point integer based calculation so it causes polygons \"snapping into place\" that causes the wobble effect so its not like they were the only ones making decisions that made the final product not as good as it could have been.>resulting in ported games having to be chopped upMaybe your thinking of it the wrong way. Software was more custom tailored back in the day to better take advantage of the custom abilities of the hardware because there just wasn&#x27;t any breathing room for more generic ports.Just imagine all of the n64 software that didn&#x27;t even make it at all to the PSX because it was completely out of the question. Why should Nintendo be blamed for choosing what they felt were specific features to make their games the way they wanted? If other software does not fit the paradigm that the N64 provides then it is the fault of the software. reply eru 4 hours agorootparentprevThe graphics were good for the time, but the memory was super slow. reply mattl 5 hours agorootparentprevI think using CDs for N64 games would have sucked.More FMV but crappier games for sure. reply hypercube33 15 hours agorootparentprevRumor was nVidia was selling them at a discounted price since the only other thing (I am aware of) is the Nvidia shield using these chips so they went with them on that factor. reply rkangel 17 hours agorootparentprevThey were probably in on it when it was pre-production.

And bear in mind that we&#x27;re comparing it to a much simpler bit of Nvidia electronics.It is entirely possible that it was just price based and they didn&#x27;t care about the chip bug, but given the timings I still think they would have selected the chip before it was complete and in consumer products. reply my123 15 hours agorootparentBy 2014, the Tegra X1 was already picked as the Switch SoC.From digging at history threads: The alternative SoC option they had was a quad-A53 SoC with Decaf (a Wii U GPU cut in half with Wii backwards compat gone) co-designed with STMicro. reply IntelMiner 12 hours agorootparentIs there anywhere one can read about those in more detail? reply monocasa 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure about reading, but this was an interesting video on the topic linked elsewhere in this thread.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MZzXidHVvJU reply gjsman-1000 17 hours agorootparentprevWell, I think it&#x27;s important to consider the competition in 2017 was not great.The comparable competitive Android chip, also launched in late 2015, was the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820. That chip was widely known as being one of the worst Qualcomm chips ever made; for mediocre power efficiency, lots of heat generation, thermal throttling, and a buggy first attempt at 64-bit instructions. All that for a GPU that is, on paper, significantly weaker [1] (though, maybe the Switch&#x27;s cooling could&#x27;ve helped close that gap a bit). But even then, you&#x27;re dealing with Qualcomm, and everyone knows they are just the worst.First, because Qualcomm loves royalties based on the device&#x27;s MSRP, rather than a flat charge per chip. Nintendo probably wouldn&#x27;t like that. Secondly, while NVIDIA GPU drivers are a proprietary blob, that&#x27;s of little concern to Nintendo, and that blob can be easily adapted to run on any OS under the sun, including their own. Qualcomm - enjoy a hackneyed Linux fork, that&#x27;s the best you&#x27;ll get. From our perspective they&#x27;re both pretty bad, but from Nintendo&#x27;s perspective trying to add support to their custom microkernel Switch OS, one&#x27;s clearly garbage.Outside of Qualcomm... what else do you have for 2017? Exynos and MediaTek? I think it goes without saying... there are no upsides to passing on the Tegra X1 for a MediaTek from that era.[1] Edit: I previously said 50% and 100% weaker, but that&#x27;s very grammatically ambiguous; and FLOPs are a very bad metric of performance, because there are 3 different kinds of FLOP metrics floating around that aren&#x27;t comparable (due to different levels of precision). Combined with the Tegra being designed for cooling and the Qualcomm designed for no cooling, it&#x27;s hard to tell specifically how large the gap is, even though a gap is almost certainly there. I think my point still stands. reply my123 15 hours agorootparentThat was the SD810.

On that basis alone you&#x27;d certainly expect the majority of human video gaming enjoyment to predate the A57.The Switch has been a commanding platform commercially for its lifespan; given the ease of pushing out multi-platform games with Unity or Unreal Engine, devs are more likely going to target the lower-spec hardware and get a huge install base for free than to limit themselves to more advanced hardware.Nier: Automata is no. 5 on that list, and while it runs on the Switch, by-all-accounts it&#x27;s somewhat knee-capped by the hardware. The PS4 original is what&#x27;s listed, and one wonders if it would&#x27;ve received quite as much adoration if it launched on the Switch and looked or played the way it does on that platform, or even if the devs would have had the resources or freedom to develop it as-it-is in the first place.Including the top 100, Bloodbourne is at no. 63 and, so far as we know, requires computing power the Switch doesn&#x27;t provide. Outer Wilds is at no. 96 and you could raise similar questions about it as about Nier; it&#x27;s made it to Switch (as of last week!), but it took the devs an extra four years to get it there.It&#x27;s, frankly, a somewhat quirky list. Among other things, it&#x27;s heavier than most would be on Japanese visual novels, and it inexplicably has \"Lode Runner Online: The Mad Monks&#x27; Revenge\" at no. 35.Also, don&#x27;t underestimate the \"regard accumulated over time\"&#x2F;historical import factor, which is a pretty universal element of how critics tend to approach these things. For example, the most recent (2022) Sight and Sound \"100 Greatest Films of All Time\" has no movies made after 2001 in the top 10; a full half of it predates what most people would consider \"modern cinema\" (roughly speaking the French and American New Waves in the 60s).Of course, ultimately your point stands - technology hardly makes the game, and there&#x27;s a good case that computing hardware has reached a \"good enough\" point of diminishing returns in the ways that it does. My PS4 is ten years old now and I still haven&#x27;t seen anything on the next gen systems (themselves around four years old now!) that make me feel like I need to upgrade.

Virtual functions are a foundational part of object oriented designs.FP registers have gotten much larger than the normal types that people store. e.g. 128, 256, 512-bit registers. A normal double floating point (pretty much the largest normally used floating point representation) occupies 64-bits, while a normal int64 occupies, unsurprisingly, the same 64-bits. But we&#x27;re getting the mega registers specifically because there are a lot of multiple-four-singles at once, and so on, SIMD functions. reply hayley-patton 1 hour agoparentprev> Given that branches are, well, just branches in any language, what makes OO so special?In principle you have calls to whatever method associated with a given object, which are indirect as there is not one statically-known target of the call, but in practise you can optimise a lot out . reply jchw 14 hours agoparentprev> Given that branches are, well, just branches in any language, what makes OO so special?Indirect branches.

The fact that so many AAA games have been ported down to it is a testimony to its capabilities. Not a fan of nVIDIA in general, but they did an amazing job with this unit. If one wants real PC gameplay without porting down, the Steam Deck starts at $400, add a MicroSD card for more storage. reply bigstrat2003 14 hours agorootparentFrankly, we still have nothing providing HD gaming on a handheld. The switch is way too big to be considered a handheld. I can&#x27;t slip one into my pocket and go, like I could with a DS or 3DS.

Nintendo just gave up on the handheld market. reply fishtacos 14 hours agorootparentHD at 720p is more than enough for a 6\" screen. The Switch is literally the only capable handheld that could do that and still does. It doesn&#x27;t offer excellence, but it offers good enough.

You could run games off the pro duo or a microsd adapter but vita was locked down, slow and a bunch of lame remakes and psp titles. The PSP emulated up to the PS1.By the time the switch was around people had been emulating on Android for a long time. They can do better graphics but there hasn’t been a game that made me feel like I needed 4K on handheld. The switch really is another golden age for gaming with the switch being hacked so quickly and having such good homebrew. reply danhor 13 hours agorootparentAt least regarding the homebrew, I disagree completely. While it took a while for the vita to be thoroughly hacked, it has been thoroughly hacked. And the benefits are numerous: Using normal SD cards, expanding the the integrated psp hardware into a virtual psp, reformatting of the internal storage, extending it by replacing the 3G modem.Meanwhile the switch had the big bootrom usb stack exploit, but everything apart from the original SoC doesn&#x27;t have a publicly known easy exploit (there are mod chips, but nothing like the 3DS&#x2F;PS3&#x2F;Wii U&#x2F;Vita&#x2F;PSP&#x2F;...). There also wasn&#x27;t that as much \"cool\" stuff to do as on older consoles with homebrew due to the hardware simply being an android tablet with controllers (which doesn&#x27;t make a difference as a console, but makes it more boring homebrew wise). So there is the usual stuff (savegames, different controllers, piracy, themes, overclocking), but nothing unique to the switch. reply graphe 13 hours agorootparentBy the time it was thoroughly hacked, it was too late. Much better hardware was around. People could do most of what the vita was eventually able to do with a phone.Besides piracy what do you expect from the switch? The PSP had an ebook reader, movie player and could play mp3s as well as other cool old games very early in it&#x27;s release. It could play media and play games up to the ps1. Modding a PSP vita today is like maxing out a citron 2cv instead of buying an e scooter. When the PSP came out it was amazing. Now it&#x27;s yesterday&#x27;s news.

And yes, the Vita had games and exclusives. Most of its launch lineup was exclusives, Uncharted Golden Abyss, Wipeout 2048, Hot Shots Golf World Invitational, etc. Even for just playing PSP games, the Vita is better. OLED display+ the ability to remap the right stick to the D-pad or buttons. Makes games like MH: Freedom Unite waaay better.And a lot of indie games, JRPGs, Visual Novels just fit the handheld form factor better than PC or PS4 even if they weren&#x27;t exclusive. reply fishtacos 14 hours agorootparentprevThe PS Vita predated the Switch by 6+ years... by the time emulation and CPU speed to match its requirements, it was already discontinued by Sony. It fulfilled its purpose. reply graphe 13 hours agorootparentThe vita was a direct downgrade from a PSP if you valued fast loading times, emulation, homebrew and piracy. Even if you didn&#x27;t pirate you gained the ability to rebuy your PSP games, and new expensive games with an OLED that had less battery life. reply fishtacos 11 hours agorootparentA downgrade from UMDs?

    "originLink": "https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-performance-engineering-with-frame-pointers-by-default",
    "originBody": "Performance engineering on Ubuntu leaps forward with frame pointers by default in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Oliver Smith on 13 December 2023 Share on: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Tags: Performance , Ubuntu , Ubuntu Server This post was co-authored by Oliver Smith, Ubuntu Product Manager, and Jon Seager, VP Engineering at Canonical. Ubuntu’s long standing reputation for performance is rooted in our commitment to delivering the latest code, kernels and compilers. This commitment ensures that developers have access to the fastest and most secure environment for their applications. Today Canonical is raising the bar for performance and observability in all of our products. In collaboration with Polar Signals we have committed that beginning with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, our GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) package will enable frame pointers by default for 64-bit platforms. All packages in Ubuntu, with very few exceptions, will be rebuilt with frame pointers enabled, making them easier to profile and subsequently optimise. “I’ve enabled frame pointers at huge scale for Java and glibc and studied the CPU overhead for this change, which is typically less than 1% and usually so close to zero that it is hard to measure. Frame pointers allow more complete CPU profiling and off-CPU profiling. The performance wins that these can provide far outweigh the comparatively tiny loss in performance. Ubuntu enabling frame pointers by default will be a huge win for performance engineering and the default developer experience”. said Brendan Gregg, computer performance expert and Intel Fellow. Precision profiling with frame pointers The first and most important tool for performance engineers is the profiler; a new collaboration between Polar Signals and Canonical evolved from a shared vision to improve the performance of applications worldwide. By ensuring that Ubuntu’s compiler enables frame pointers by default, we streamline profiling and debugging processes. Often overlooked, frame pointers play a crucial role in simplifying the stack tracing process during profiling. Enabling them by default in compiled binaries ensures that developers have immediate access to clearer and more accurate data for performance analysis, with no additional configuration. There is a small performance penalty associated with the change, but in cases where the impact is high (such as the Python interpreter), we’ll continue to omit frame pointers until this is addressed. Our analysis suggests that the penalty on 64-bit architectures is between 1-2% in most cases. We will not make this change on 32-bit architectures where the penalty is higher. Enabling such trivial access to performance insights, combined with a commitment to investing in the performance of the platform from Canonical, will facilitate global performance improvements for Ubuntu and the workloads it supports. Detailed performance benchmarks will be provided in a follow up post closer to the release of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Community and developer impact More than just a technical adjustment, this is a commitment to the developer community. When performance problems arise in production, developers are often faced with the task of recompiling their applications to include debugging information, then trying to reproduce the situation that caused the software to perform poorly. This can be relatively simple for smaller applications, or those with few dependencies, but for large applications with deep dependencies on operating system components, the process becomes incredibly complex. By enabling frame pointers by default, we’re lowering the barrier to entry for performance profiling and debugging, meaning: Simplified Profiling: Dive straight into profiling without worrying about compiler configurations. Lower Overhead: Unwinding with frame pointers is significantly cheaper than using DWARF or DWARF-derived information. Debugging Accessibility: Even those new to profiling can access high-quality data, democratising the process of performance optimisation. It will allow bcc-tools, bpftrace, perf and other such tooling to work out of the box. Ecosystem Benefit: Ubuntu comprises thousands of open source projects, and we’ll work to upstream performance fixes that we find across potentially thousands of packages wherever we can. Canonical, and the Ubuntu community, can make use of this improved debugging information to diagnose and target performance issues that are orders of magnitude more impactful than the 1-2% upfront cost. A testament to open collaboration Our collaboration exemplifies the power of the open source community. By working together, we’re hoping this change will benefit countless developers, organisations and software end-users. “Canonical is investing heavily in the performance and observability, and it’s clear that Polar Signals are blazing a trail in the practice of continuous profiling, and particularly with their zero-instrumentation eBPF-based Parca Agent. Our decision to enable frame pointers by default in Ubuntu marks a significant step forward in making Ubuntu the most performant and efficient platform for your workloads. I’m really excited to see the impact this has over the coming months and years”. said Jon Seager, VP Engineering at Canonical. “Hyperscalers have long adopted frame-pointers by default because they recognise that the potential performance impact is negligible compared to the insight they can bring during debugging and troubleshooting. These increased performance insights often enable optimisations that are orders of magnitudes larger than the cost associated with enabling frame pointers. I couldn’t be more excited about Canonical recognising this and bringing it to the masses with Ubuntu 24.04 – this is a huge leap forward for observability and debuggability”. said Frederic Branczyk, CEO/Founder at Polar Signals. Looking ahead We’re excited to bring a greatly simplified profiling and debugging experience to the masses in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, which will see mainstream adoption for years to come. The impact of this change coupled with the follow-on investment in performance engineering at Canonical will result in better quality, and higher performing applications globally.

At the time I was like whew why is omitting frame pointers the default at all in so many places when it didn&#x27;t seem to make a measurable difference in the performance of the software. I guess it&#x27;s just vestigial these days and yes please use a compiler flag like this when it measurably makes sense. Making debugging simpler for the rest of us is the way to go. reply o11c 14 hours agoparentSomething has to be seriously wrong with the way it was compiled for gdb to have trouble. Debugging (or in-process exception dumps), which only does a reasonable number of backtraces, should always be able to use separate unwind data sections.Including frame pointers should only have a performance effect for sample-based profiling, which does a very large number of backtraces. And the general fact is - people don&#x27;t profile, and if they do, they don&#x27;t do it correctly.Omitting frame pointers has significant performance wins on platforms with about 6 registers, like 32-bit intel x86. It&#x27;s much less of a win on platforms with about 14 registers, like 64-bit x86 or 32-bit ARM, let alone platforms with about 30 registers, like 64-bit ARM.Since modern architectures are strongly trending toward designs that support more registers, a frame pointer isn&#x27;t unreasonable to choose. But that&#x27;s still no excuse for all the shitty software that refuses to work correctly without them, rather than merely more slowly.(Note that theoretically it is possible to design an ISA&#x2F;ABI combo that supports easy and fast unwinding even without frame pointers, but there&#x27;s always going to be some overhead and to my knowledge this choice hasn&#x27;t been done.) reply brancz 13 hours agorootparentFounder of Polar Signals here, the profiling product that&#x27;s mentioned in the blog post. We&#x27;ve already made it possible to unwind without frame pointers relatively cheaply ( Something has to be seriously wrong with the way it was compiled for gdb to have trouble.Cargo culting culture in embedded devices of just using some old toolchain copy pasted from some vendor seems to be pervasive. I cut fresh compilers and align their output with the old crusty toolchains. Made entire classes of issues go away. Regardless, agreed the omission of the frame pointer was merely one issue at play with those particular core dumps on those particular devices, years back at this point. :) reply stefan_ 13 hours agorootparentprevEmbedded devices, certainly in the days of 16 MiB NOR flash, do not contain unwind or debug information. Even today OpenWrt and similar will routinely strip all binaries installed to the final firmware image.There are some structural issues in the Linux world, too; the default of debug data contained within the binary is often undesirable, symbol servers (they finally learned about those in Ubuntu 22) require extra setup & tooling support that isn&#x27;t often invested in, widely used libraries like libunwind are both arcane and terrible (yes, an instruction pointer of 0 will not have associated unwind information; use your brain and realize someone called a NULL function pointer). reply londons_explore 12 hours agoprevSo the whole world should take a 1-2% performance penalty on everything so some users can maybe run a profiler?Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to just have an &#x27;apt reinstall all --with-frame-pointers&#x27; command that power users could run before they wanted to profile something? reply brendangregg 10 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t know where 1-2% comes from, but for many scale production workloads I studied it was so close to 0% that it was tough to measure beyond noise on the cloud. That&#x27;s not to say that 1-2% is wrong, but that it&#x27;s likely someone&#x27;s workload and other people see less.Helping people find ~30-3000% perf wins, helping debugging and automated bug reports, is huge. For some sites it may be like 300 steps forward, one step back. But it&#x27;s also not the end of the road here. Might we go back to frame pointer ommision one day by default if some other emerging stack walkers work well in the future for all use cases? It&#x27;s a lot of ifs and many years away, and assumes a lot of engineering work continues to be invested for recoving a gain that&#x27;s usually less than 1%, but anythings possible.There&#x27;s a couple of problems with an apt reinstall. One is that people often don&#x27;t work on performance until the system is melting down -- many times I&#x27;ve been handed an issue where apt is dreadfully slow due to the system&#x27;s performance issue and just installing a single package can take several minutes -- imagine reinstalling everything, it could turn the outage into over an hour! The other is I&#x27;d worry that reinstalling everything introduces so many changes (updating library versions) that the problem could change and you&#x27;d have no idea which package update changed it. If there was such an apt reinstall command, I know of large sites (with experience with frame pointer overheads) that would run it and then build their BaseAMI so that it was the default. Which is what Ubuntu is doing anyway. reply aseipp 11 hours agoparentprevMany systems take various kinds of performance hits in return for things all the time; reliability, observability, safety, etc. Many systems can be run at higher peak throughput in return for various instabilities, even. Performance is not actually a uniform number across the system. You&#x27;re looking at an aggregate, but changes like this can make it much, much more practical to diagnose specific performance issues for users in specific scenarios, which may have extremely large impacts far beyond 1-2%. That&#x27;s very important in practice especially when users can often feel those outliers, e.g. why does this application enter a spinning state and suddenly burn CPU for 1 minute before returning to normal.> Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to just have an &#x27;apt reinstall all --with-frame-pointers&#x27; command that power users could run before they wanted to profile something?I don&#x27;t see why it makes any more sense than just changing the default that the distribution uses. For one it&#x27;s way more work, maintaining another copy of everything for a ~1% performance difference is not an obviously good tradeoff for the distro teams to make.

I&#x27;m surprised they even enabled it by default. reply bodyfour 13 hours agorootparentprevThat much is true -- the difference between 6 and 7 registers is much larger than the benefit of going from 14 to 15.However, even under zero register pressure having a frame pointer is still an extra register that needs to be touched on every function invocation, extra instructions taking space in the I-cache, etc. It&#x27;s a small thing, but it&#x27;s still a cost that has to be paid by all compiled code.I&#x27;m not going to claim that re-enabling frame pointers was the wrong choice -- the people involved in the debate know the tradeoffs and I have to start with the assumption that I would have made the same decision if I were in their position. It does make me slightly sad, though. The idea behind removing frame pointers isn&#x27;t that backtraces aren&#x27;t important, it&#x27;s that computing the frame pointer after-the-fact is possible -- i.e. for normal functions without alloca() or dynamically-sized stack arrays map %rip -> frame size.The problem seems to be that despite years of experience with \"no-frame-pointer\" being the default I guess the profiling tools never got as reliable or good as the with-frame-pointer variants. My personal hope was that the problem would fade over time as tools improved, but it seems that&#x27;s unlikely to ever happen.

To be fair there is a stronger argument for it being enabled in fedora than an LTS release (RHEL or Ubuntu) since it has more cutting edge software that needs more frequent debugging, is less likely to be used in production where the (minor, but uneven) performance hits may matter, and has so many upstream developers using it as their daily driver. reply brancz 14 hours agorootparentI would argue that LTS releases are going to be deployed millions of times and stay around effectively forever with lots of very critical software being deployed on it.

In the former case, the system maintainers reach across the table and change the settings, despite what the actual application developer has chosen. In the latter, the upstream developers&#x27; choices are respected more, mainly because the tooling is less standardized.Shoutouts to this NixOS bug which is still ongoing after causing much pain for many years: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NixOS&#x2F;nixpkgs&#x2F;issues&#x2F;18995 reply comex 8 hours agoparentBecause the upstream developer is not the only one who needs to profile the program.For one thing, you might be the upstream developer of a library the program links against, and your stack frames might be hidden under frames from the program that didn’t save the frame pointer. Or if it’s a library that isn’t saving the frame pointer, vice versa.But the more interesting use case is if you’re not the upstream developer of anything, but a skilled user who wants to get a view of your entire system and diagnose problems yourself. Personally I do that all the time, both in my spare time and at work. With respect to performance in particular I have more experience with the macOS tooling than the Linux tooling, but it’s analogous – with tools like Instruments and dtrace I can get a profile of any process I want or of the entire system, and I find that incredibly valuable. And that’s made possible in part by the stock macOS toolchain enabling frame pointers by default.The NixOS case you linked sounds rather annoying, but turning on optimizations and -Werror and PIC by default is very different from just enabling frame pointers by default. reply lathiat 3 hours agorootparentYeah, I agree with this.Not clearly written in the original article is that \"many\" (I&#x27;m not sure what actual percentage, but vaguely \"most\") packages already have frame pointers enabled.The problem packages that don&#x27;t are exactly all of those upstream projects that intentionally compile with -fomit-frame-pointer because of those small performance gains. And those are also usually the exact same projects you end up wanting to profile or otherwise analyse :)I work in the Support organisation at Canonical and the two most frequent projects I run into this with are Ceph and Openvswitch - they both compile with -fomit-frame-pointer by default upstream (and currently in the Ubuntu packages) which makes using perf (which I often need to do with both of those) a pain.While you can do it, you have to record ~8kB of stack extra for every sample (times 1000 per second, times the number of CPUs...) and then unwind it later with the DWARF debug symbols. The resulting perf exports are multiple gigabytes for 0-2 minutes. Compared to maybe 25-200MB for frame-pointer enabled cases where I can usually then easily captured.The problem is the product or upstream project wants to claim the absolute best performance, even 1% better, but the end user rarely needs that last 1% and both them and their support team would like to be able to easily use profiling in production to fix the random much more significant 10-100% performance bugs that inevitably crop up when actually using it and not benchmarking it :) reply herodoturtle 15 hours agoprevFor the layman, what does this mean? reply jcranmer 14 hours agoparentThere are two key effects of this decision.The first effect is that it makes one additional general-purpose integer register unavailable for use for code. x86-64 has 16 general-purpose registers, but one of these is the stack pointer and basically can&#x27;t be used for any other purpose; this would add a second reserved register for the frame pointer. This effect may cause slowdowns if the 15th register was critical for performance.The second effect is on the ability to identify (and potentially unwind) the stack trace. With frame pointers, the pseudocode for computing a stack trace is essentially: do load return address, previous frame pointer from current frame pointer print return address move previous frame pointer into current frame pointer until current frame pointer is invalidWithout frame pointers, the way you have to do this procedure is: while current address has corresponding entry in unwind table: parse unwind table entry to find a program to run run this program on the current frame to generate return address print return address move return address to current addressIt turns out that there is a full Turing-complete program described in the unwind tables to be able to generate a return address. This makes unwinding quite expensive, and also can create lots of security headaches if you want do something like unwind in the kernel (since the unwind table is arbitrary user code!). It can also be pretty unreliable at times, especially in cases where your program crashed due to stack smashing so that you have to expect that the data being randomly overwritten with garbage and thus horrifically inaccurate. reply nerpderp82 14 hours agorootparentSince it hasn&#x27;t been mentioned in this entire thread, frame pointers are required to get good high resolution flame graphs.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brendangregg.com&#x2F;flamegraphs.htmlWith systems like Phlare&#x2F;Pyroscope SRE can monitor application performance in a very granular way in realtime.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grafana.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;03&#x2F;15&#x2F;pyroscope-grafana-phlare...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;grafana&#x2F;pyroscope reply PeterisP 12 hours agorootparentprevDoes this provide there any benefit at all to the majority of machines which aren&#x27;t intended to be used for development of binaries (i.e. user workstations, developers working with interpreted languages, and servers), what would be the use cases where frame pointers would help on those machines?Like, even for developers, I assume a random web development shop using Ubuntu and hosting stuff on Ubuntu would likely not ever attempt debugging a binary executable, and likely don&#x27;t have any employees who could do it if they wanted. Of course there are companies who can and do debugging and profiling of binaries running on their servers, but IMHO those who are capable and willing to do that a relatively small minority of users of Ubuntu systems. reply not_the_fda 9 hours agorootparentNo benefit, but no downside either, its effectively irrelevant, an implementation detail. reply mFixman 14 hours agorootparentprevCould programs compiled in architectures with 16 general purpose registers fail in one with 15? reply kelnos 12 hours agorootparentNot really? I mean, there are architectures with fewer than 16 GP registers (IA32 is one of them); if you can compile some C code on that architecture, then surely you can also compile it on x86_64 with 15 (well, 14, really, due to the stack pointer also being reserved) rather than 16 (15).If someone is writing in assembly, then they&#x27;ve already decided if they&#x27;re going to allocate a register for the frame pointer, and Ubuntu&#x27;s change isn&#x27;t going to affect that, as this is about compiled code, not assembled assembly.The only real issue is performance: if a program has a particular hot-path function (or just many functions overall) that really benefit from having that extra register available, and would otherwise have to spill data into memory, then this change could have a big negative impact. But that&#x27;s not really a big deal; the packager can decide to omit frame pointers just for that particular app or library. reply globular-toast 13 hours agorootparentprevWell, for a start you probably mean compiled for an arch with 16 registers. It doesn&#x27;t actually matter what arch the compiler ran on (assuming modern cross-compiler like GCC).If a program uses 16 registers then it needs 16 registers. But note it&#x27;s the program itself that decides to use a frame pointer, it&#x27;s not being reserved by the operating system or something. Programs don&#x27;t even have to use the stack pointer as a stack pointer, they could use all 16 as general purpose, but in practice almost all programs use a call stack (I guess all C programs must do, but you might be able to disable it if you make no function calls?) reply mFixman 12 hours agorootparentOhh, I misunderstood what Ubuntu was doing.So the only change is that GCC and its toolkit will compile programs using a register as frame pointer by default? That seems like a very reasonable change. If having an extra general purpose register is critical for performance of then this can be disabled in that program&#x27;s the makefile. reply brancz 12 hours agorootparentCorrect and there are already known exceptions such as the python interpreter in which the “interpret function” function actually falls into this case and so for the foreseeable future python is going to continue to be compiled omitting frame pointers. But by default this destructive micro optimization is off by default until proven a performance bottleneck, just like any performance issue should be! reply mathiasgredal 13 hours agorootparentprevI thought modern speculative cpu’s had way more registers than you can normally access. Why does it reserve these registers for speculative execution instead of exposing them to the program if it needs them? reply jcranmer 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not really how registers or speculative execution works. Intuitively, you can think of assembly as trying to describe a graph of instruction dependencies. Having 16 registers in the ISA allows you to have 16 live outputs at any given \"time\". Speculative execution allows instructions to execute out-of-order, and to enable this, it has ~140 registers that allow it to have 140 live outputs at once, so that it can run some code while a really long load is waiting for its data.From the ISA perspective, however, adding more registers means you have to spend more bits naming a register. With 16 registers, you need 12 bits of your instruction just to name the operands of a typical 3-address instruction (rA = rB op rC). With 128 registers, that is now a whopping 21 bits, which means code density is a more pressing issue. reply mathiasgredal 11 hours agorootparentI get that there is a tradeoff with code density, although if you could have an encoding scheme or extended register mode to alleviate this. I was just thinking that if you have e.g a loop where you run out of registers, since you only have 16, then the compiler will swap the values to memory and reuse that register which creates an instruction dependency that doesnt really have to exist.If the compiler could use the hidden registers, then the cpu would know that it could run this instruction ahead of time.It is probably not worth it, since it adds a lot of complexity to an already complex system, which is why it isn’t done. reply peterfirefly 10 hours agorootparentAll AMD64 CPUs support at least SSE2 which means they have 16 (not 15 or 14!) XMM registers they can spill to. This is just as fast as a move between two GPRs. reply peterfirefly 12 hours agorootparentprevThere is a difference between registers and register names.he AMD64 architecture only has 15 general-purpose registers (because the stack pointer is mostly treated as if it were a GPR as well). It is customary to use one of those (bp&#x2F;ebp&#x2F;rbp depending on mode) as a base pointer register. That leaves 14 GPR register names.The physical CPU the code runs on might have 200 physical registers -- those are the ones that matter for speculative, out-of-order execution -- but the code itself can only refer to 14 (or 15) GPRs at a time and has to include instructions to transfer values to&#x2F;from memory or to&#x2F;from XMM registers if that&#x27;s not enough. Those extra instructions take up space + might slow the code down. reply andreyv 13 hours agorootparentprevThe number of registers available to the program is fixed in the instruction set.

If the compiler is out of registers to allocate and instead uses the stack, the CPU isn&#x27;t reasonably going to be able to undo that. reply mathiasgredal 12 hours agorootparentSure, but wouldn’t it make sense to extend the instruction set to allow the compiler to use these registers instead of reserving them for speculative &#x2F; out-of-order execution?

Read that reply (and mine). And then maybe rewatch watch Chandler Carruth says.The current practice allows for CPUs to transparently increase their physical register count (to gain performance) and still run old code -- and older CPUs can still run new code. That&#x27;s usually quite practical...Adding more register names takes more bits for the register numbers -- which leads to larger instructions. It also leads to more complicated encodings if we want backwards compatibility. AMD64 does that by adding an optional prefix byte that carries a payload of 4 more instruction bits. That&#x27;s one bit each for the three possible register names encoded in a traditional IA32 instruction + a bit to indicate whether to operate on 32-bit or 64-bit data (the actual rules are a bit more complex). Intel published a whitepaper recently suggesting a future encoding with a different (optional) prefix that encodes 8 more bits -- so each of the three register names can be extended to 5 bits (32 register names). It all ends up being quite complicated + new code won&#x27;t run on older CPUs, which is not great.I think you are suggesting not just bigger register names but also doing away with register renaming -- that would be... less than entirely useful because you would lose almost all your out-of-order capability and thereby almost all your ability to hide cache misses. Cache misses are very, very hard to predict statically (before actually running the code on a real CPU with real data) so good luck trying to do magic ahead-of-time allocation of those registers... replybrancz 15 hours agoparentprevWe wrote pretty extensively about what was needed to be able to profile things without frame pointers [1].

Every frame corresponds to one function call, and says where the local variables are stored, and where the function should return after it has finished.The head of this list is stored in a register (a scarce resource, superfast memory). So to use frame pointers, you have to spend one register, and also every function has to do some work to maintain the linked list. Two instructions worth of work when the function is enterred, and one when it exits.The alternative to doing this explicitly is to keep track of it all implicitly which is faster but a bit more complex. reply supportengineer 15 hours agoparentprevExciting new failure modes reply m463 12 hours agoprevinteresting article on frame pointer optimization:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.ibm.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;user&#x2F;wasdevops&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;kev... reply brenns10 12 hours agoprevThis is a good idea for the short-term. As of now, frame pointers are the most reliable way to ensure that software can be profiled by tools like perf*. The core issue is that the kernel must be the one to unwind the userspace stack, and it only knows how to unwind stacks with frame pointers**. The .eh_frame data will never be supported by the kernel, because it involves a turing-complete program that must be executed to compute the necessary unwind info***.For the long term, the more exciting option that&#x27;s emerging is SFrame[1]. This is a new data section which would be generated by the compiler and contains unwind tables which the kernel will be able to understand. Unlike DWARF&#x2F;.eh_frame, these tables would remain in the final binary (i.e. not be stripped away), and on exec(), the kernel would store them for use during profiling. Since the format is quite similar to ORC(*), and Steven Rostedt is quite invested in the format, it seems a safe bet that support will land in the kernel.My hope isn&#x27;t necessarily that a distribution completely disables frame pointers once this format becomes available... though it could be an interesting thing to try. Rather, there can be a conscious choice about whether frame pointers are used, or SFrame, which would be useful for cases like Python, where it&#x27;s mentioned that frame pointers may still have a significant performance impact. The kernel should be able to fall back to frame pointers when SFrame is unavailable, which means that either will be acceptable. Ideally, in a few years time we&#x27;ll be able to go back to forgetting about frame pointers for most cases :)---* Ironically, the kernel itself tends not to use frame pointers! It has its own unwind format called ORC, which gets generated by an in-kernel program called \"objtool\" which essentially reverse engineers the assembly generated by the compiler. It&#x27;s x86_64-specific and frequently needs adjustment when the compiler changes code generation. It can&#x27;t be used for userspace programs.** it also knows how to unwind kernel stacks with ORC (see above)*** There is an option to allow perf to unwind with DWARF, but it&#x27;s a total hack (though a very effective one). By passing --call-graph=dwarf, you can instruct the kernel to copy the userspace stack (by default, 8k bytes!) into the perf event buffer with each sample (this can be as many as 100 or 1000 samples per second, per CPU...). Later, the perf userspace program will use that info, along with information about each process&#x27;s address space, and the debuginfo for each program, to unwind the stacks. This has huge performance overhead, and it requires that you have easy access to debuginfo, which may not be the case, especially for container workloads.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;940686&#x2F; reply brancz 12 hours agoparentWe’ve also figured out an alternative format to use from within eBPF to unwind stacks (we happen to only support dwarf at the moment but theoretically any source information could work): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.polarsignals.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2022&#x2F;11&#x2F;29&#x2F;dwarf-bas... reply brenns10 12 hours agorootparentYeah I saw Vaishali & Javier&#x27;s presentation [1] at LPC last year! Great stuff, & certainly available to use now rather than when SFrame becomes available and supported.In the same spirit, it seems that the .eh_frame -> BPF unwind table process could be (relatively) easily modified to produce SFrame, which you could attach to the binaries if you have a trustworthy way of doing that (which is... a big if). So that once SFrame support becomes available in the kernel, you could apply it to applications without rebuilding them.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lpc.events&#x2F;event&#x2F;16&#x2F;contributions&#x2F;1361&#x2F; reply brancz 11 hours agorootparentI would need to double check with the team on this detail, but if I recall correctly the architecture as it is is specifically designed to make the bpf verfier happy and we didn’t think it was going to be possible with existing formats.
