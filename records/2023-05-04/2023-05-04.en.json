    "content": "MICROSOFT/TECHMicrosoft is forcing Outlook and Teams to open links in Edge, and IT admins are angry/ The latest gross web push from Microsoft sees businesses forced to use Edge for certain links.By Tom WarrenMay 3, 2023, 2:40 AM PDT|CommentsShare this storyIllustration: The VergeMicrosoft Edge is a good browser but for some reason Microsoft keeps trying to shove it down everyone\u2019s throat and make it more difficult to use rivals like Chrome or Firefox. Microsoft has now started notifying IT admins that it will force Outlook and Teams to ignore the default web browser on Windows and open links in Microsoft Edge instead.Reddit users have posted messages from the Microsoft 365 admin center that reveal how Microsoft is going to roll out this change. \u201cWeb links from Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts and Microsoft (MSA) accounts in the Outlook for Windows app will open in Microsoft Edge in a single view showing the opened link side-by-side with the email it came from,\u201d reads a message to IT admins from Microsoft.While this won\u2019t affect the default browser setting in Windows, it\u2019s yet another part of Microsoft 365 and Windows that totally ignores your default browser choice for links. Microsoft already does this with the Widgets system in Windows 11 and even the search experience, where you\u2019ll be forced into Edge if you click a link even if you have another browser set as default.Microsoft\u2019s message to IT admins. Image: paulanerspezi (Reddit)IT admins aren\u2019t happy with many complaining in various threads on Reddit, spotted by Neowin. If Outlook wasn\u2019t enough, Microsoft says \u201ca similar experience will arrive in Teams\u201d soon with web links from chats opening in Microsoft Edge side-by-side with Teams chats. Microsoft seems to be rolling this out gradually across Microsoft 365 users, and IT admins get 30 days notice before it rolls out to Outlook.Microsoft 365 Enterprise IT admins will be able to alter the policy, but those on Microsoft 365 for business will have to manage this change on individual machines. That\u2019s going to leave a lot of small businesses with the unnecessary headache of working out what has changed. Imagine being less tech savvy, clicking a link in Outlook, and thinking you\u2019ve lost all your favorites because it didn\u2019t open in your usual browser.I asked Microsoft to comment on the changes. \u201cThis change is designed to create an easier way for Outlook and Microsoft Teams users to reduce task switching across windows and tabs to help stay focused,\u201d says Katy Asher, senior director of communications at Microsoft, in a statement to The Verge. \u201cBy opening browser links in Microsoft Edge, the original message in Outlook or Teams can also be viewed alongside web content to easily access, read and respond to the message, using the matching authenticated profile. Customers have the option to disable this feature in settings.\u201dThe notifications to IT admins come just weeks after Microsoft promised significant changes to the way Windows manages which apps open certain files or links by default. At the time Microsoft said it believed \u201cwe have a responsibility to ensure user choices are respected\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cimportant that we lead by example with our own first party Microsoft products.\u201d Forcing people into Microsoft Edge and ignoring default browsers is anything but respecting user choice, and it\u2019s gross that Microsoft continues to abuse this.Microsoft tested a similar change to the default Windows 10 Mail app in 2018, in an attempt to force people into Edge for email links. That never came to pass, thanks to a backlash from Windows 10 testers. A similar change in 2020 saw Microsoft try and force Chrome\u2019s default search engine to Bing using the Office 365 installer, and IT admins weren\u2019t happy then either.Windows 11 also launched with a messy and cumbersome process to set default apps, which was a step back from Windows 10 and drew concern from competing browser makers like Mozilla, Opera, and Vivaldi. A Windows 11 update has improved that process, but it\u2019s clear Microsoft is still interested in finding ways to circumvent default browser choices.Microsoft has already been using aggressive prompts to stop you from using Chrome and even added a giant Bing button to Edge in an effort to push people to use its search engine. Microsoft has also faced criticism over adding buy now, pay later financing options into Edge and its plan to build a crypto wallet into Edge. Microsoft also added a prompt to Edge Dev recently that appears when you try to use Google\u2019s rival Bard AI chatbot. This relentless push of Edge, including through Windows Update, could all backfire for Microsoft and end up alienating Edge users instead of tempting them over from Chrome.Update, May 3rd 1PM ET: Article updated with comment from Microsoft.Most PopularYou no longer need a password to sign in to your Google accountDiscord is growing up, so everyone needs to pick a new usernameMicrosoft is forcing Outlook and Teams to open links in Edge, and IT admins are angryChatGPT can now find you a houseGoogle is changing Chrome\u2019s lock icon because nobody knows what it means",

    "hn_content": "Microsoft's latest move is angering IT admins, as the company is forcing Outlook and Teams to open links in Edge, even if another browser is set as default. Some suggest that Microsoft needs to reconsider its strategy and not become too hostile towards competitors and users. Others point out that the company has a long history of anti-competitive behavior. However, many still praise Microsoft for its products, such as C# and .NET ecosystem, and tools such as VS Code and Remote SSH. Some argue that Microsoft tries to stick to its tried and tested strategy of EEE (embrace, extend, extinguish) even with its ecosystem. Many people are interested in this post because of Microsoft's controversial behavior and the impact it can have on user experience and competition.Microsoft's open-source tools, including C# and .NET Core, have been commended by commenters. VSCode is another excellent open-source tool and now offers a new convenience of directly launching via GitHub repository pages. However, some argue that with the free VSCode offering being as good as VS, Microsoft may eventually stop making commercial IDEs and give the tooling away. The company has been accused of \"lateral moves to own markets,\" acquiring businesses in various industries, such as video games, developer ecosystems, and office software. There is also criticism of Microsoft from the 90s that still resurfaces today. However, some have still found value in some of their products such as Excel and Encarta 96.The post discusses the limitations of Apple's mobile operating system and its control over device features such as links, keyboards, and apps. Responses to the post include comments highlighting the difficulty of achieving a quality keyboard layout that can compete with the standard Apple keyboard, and concerns about limitations on user choice with regard to features such as navigation and voice assistants. There is also a discussion of the use of dark patterns and degraded user experiences by tech companies. Finally, readers shared workarounds such as browser add-ons that can improve the user experience in some cases.The thread contains various comments on the limitations of browser engines and changing default browsers. Some users suggest ways to change user-agents or use addons to improve search results or join meetings on Firefox. Others comment on Apple's control over browser options on iOS and Microsoft's intentions with open-source software. A few users also mention hidden features on HN like favoriting comments and org charts of Microsoft's different factions. Overall, the thread provides some background information on the challenges users face with browser limitations and platform control.Microsoft is facing backlash over forcing Windows 11 users to open links in Microsoft Edge, rather than a browser of their choosing. Many users are complaining about the lack of choice and the annoyance of having to manually switch browsers. The discussion has also touched on the topic of walled gardens in mobile OSs, where Apple and Google are accused of monopolistic practices. Microsoft, on the other hand, was effectively forced to open up the web by antitrust cases; however, it has now resorted to the same behavior. Microsoft Teams on Android has also been identified as forcing users to install Edge. Finally, one commenter notes that Microsoft's browser strategy seems to be tied to a desire to be competitive with offerings like Electron.A discussion about the control tech companies exercise over their apps on Android and iOS. Users note that Microsoft is using a \u201cdark pattern\u201d by pushing its Edge browser in popups on Android, probably because organizations prefer its control over application behaviour in the corporate context. A user also notes that Edge and Chrome use different engines despite being based on the same codebase while Apple does not allow non-WebKit engines on iOS. There is also discussion about browser links opening on apps, such as Google\u2019s which prefer Chrome over other browsers despite user preferences. This post highlights the subtle but opaque ways that tech giants can use to steer users towards their products.The post includes various comments on Microsoft's history and current behavior, including accusations of anti-competitive practices and dark patterns. Some comments compare Microsoft to Google and Apple, highlighting Apple's walled garden approach and Google's impact on non-Chromium Edge. Others praise Microsoft's software, such as Flight Sim and Visual Whatever IDEs, but also question their motivations and goals. The discussion touches on browser default settings and mobile market penetration, with some suggesting that Microsoft's main market is enterprise software. Overall, the post generates a debate around Microsoft's past and present policies and its role in the tech industry.Microsoft is hiring a former Yandex executive to increase its ad revenue. Apple and Google also partake in similar unsavory tactics. Google Assistant and Search's prompts for use on Android can be irritating. Microsoft copying Google's behavior to have users in the Microsoft ecosystem. Microsoft Teams is used in the enterprise space where user experience isn't a part of the buy decision, but executives' complaints could change that. Microsoft is more open than its competition. MS Office has deeply integrated itself into many companies, more so than smartphones have.",

Some comments argue whether the FDIC should provide equal coverage for small and large banks. Others debate the accuracy and visual representation of observablehq.com's chart of bank failures. Some argue that non-FDIC bank failures were not included, which misleadingly downplays the severity of the 2008 financial crisis. Several commenters share data and insights into the subject, but there is no new release or significant announcement in this post.The post features a discussion among users on the impact of the 2008 financial crisis compared to the current economic situation, with some users suggesting using GDP or M1 money supply to adjust for size. Others bring up the total bank assets doubled since 2008, with sarcastic comments on bank failures and fraudulent activity in the banking industry. One user praises FTX for its fraudulent activity, and another user highlights the transparency of tracking movements in crypto compared to USD-backed currencies. The discussion touches on various subjects such as historical data comparisons, financial transparency, and fraudulent activities in the banking and cryptocurrency industries.FTX has recovered more than $1bn worth of assets, including $800m in cash and $600m in settlements and investments receivable, following its bankruptcy in 2020 due to mismanagement and poor trading decisions.\n\nFTX's assets are primarily made up of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, with the majority of the recovery coming from Category A crypto tokens.\n\nThe recovery was partially made possible by the use of blockchain technology, highlighting its potential for tracing and recovering lost assets.\n\nHowever, questions remain about the true value of FTX's recovered assets, with some experts doubting the reported $7.3bn valuation due to concerns about the illiquidity and low trading volumes of certain tokens.The Tech Times reports on a discussion among commenters on the frequency of bank failures in the U.S. over the past century. The main point of discussion revolves around the size of banks and their business models, with some advocating for a return to smaller, local, community-scale banks, while others argue for larger banks with more diversified portfolios. The conversation also touches on recent trends in commercial real estate loans and the potential for a new cluster of bank failures. A notable event mentioned is the recent failure of three large banks, which stands in contrast to the many smaller bank failures in 2008. The article also notes the impressive data visualization work of Mike Bostock.The S&L crisis was caused by excessive lending, speculation, and risk-taking driven by the moral hazard created by deregulation and taxpayer bailout guarantees. Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic, etc might be the tip of an iceberg if they've all leveraged themselves on risky speculation bets in the hopes that they'll get bailouts if it all goes sour. Banks can offer incentives for certain levels of deposits better interest rates, better cards, better loans. FDIC limits are only up to $250K per bank, so having money spread out like that does not seem easy to manage. Car loans get paid down pretty fast. If there is no risk, then nothing is risky.Large corporate banks charge less NSF fees than credit unions, but they charge more overdraft fees. Banks need to retain their depositors to maintain stable liabilities, which is harder for community banks with a small customer base. Credit unions offer better rates with no bullshit fees. Banks with high visibility get poked first. The trend towards consolidation in economics is a form of preferential attachment. Banks with massive deposit inflows during the pandemic parked their money in \"safe\" investments and overcommitted, which caused a bank run. Preferential attachment may explain why so many banks have failed in Georgia. The 2022 recession could be less severe than the 2008 recession. R should be sqrt(assets) for asset-based limits on deposit insurance.A comment on a visualization of failed US banks highlights the shortcomings of circles as a representation of data, leading to ambiguous interpretations and minimal conclusions. The dimension of the circles overlapping on the x-axis adds more confusion. The graph visualization can only be read to reflect that 2008 had one significant failure and many small ones, while 2023 saw three failures, but not quite as big, with little more to be interpreted from the data. Some readers question the exclusion of Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns or other non-US banks in the graph. The failure of some banks in 2023 was due to lack of appropriate risk management to prepare for the increasing interest rate environment. Overall, the situation calls for better capital planning and tighter regulations.",

While the model may not be as accurate as the LLMs from OpenAI and Microsoft, it is seen to have potential as a useful tool for those doing standard coding tasks. The incorporation of a natural language element within the data also acts as a way to label code, which will be helpful for future projects.

The model completed Haskell and Clojure, proving its ability to complete programming tasks in multiple languages. The ability to fine-tune the model to a specific library for open source support has been suggested, and could be achieved through fine-tuning. It is difficult to believe that the model captures complex ideas and higher-level structures when token/parameter values are over 30.

Vulkan is intended for writing middleware rather than directly targeting the gaming API, benefiting Unity, Unreal, and Valve.WebGPU, a low-level graphics API, has been created to provide an alternative to OpenGL and Vulkan. WebGPU is designed to be easy to use, with complexity only added when necessary. WebGPU also aims to provide a modern, open-source ergonomics layer for Vulkan. Although developed for JavaScript, WebGPU can be used in Rust or C++ for standalone apps or in WebASM inside the browser. WebGPU is available with perfectly equal compatibility in JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, and Rust. However, WebGPU has three main problems: the absence of lines and text, WGSL, and complexity during initialization and pipeline construction. Despite these issues, WebGPU is a refreshing alternative to OpenGL and Vulkan, and offers compatibility across multiple platforms.WebGPU is a new API for GPU programming that is similar to Vulkan but offers easier cross-platform implementation. It is available in Chrome and Firefox, and Rust provides good support for it. WebGPU\u00a0can be used with C++ and JavaScript as well. There is potential for WebGPU to be used for shader programming in Rust, though it currently requires more build tooling. One limitation is the amount of \"pipeline objects\" needed, though Vulkan has recently tried to address this issue through \"shader objects.\" While there are some issues, WebGPU offers promise for easier cross-platform GPU programming.",

    "hn_content": "WebGPU is a new API for interfacing with a computer's graphics processing unit (GPU) through the web, supported by Apple, Google, and Microsoft, among others. The API is designed to be an alternative to Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem, making machine learning type workloads easier. There are currently few models that can be run on consumer GPUs, but smaller models are expected in the future. WebGPU is OS and hardware-neutral and is expected to make it easier to make visualizations, games, and VR apps in the browser. Although graphics processing is its main use case, it can also be used for physics simulations and other scientific workloads. There are plans to add subgroups, and Tensor cores could be added post-1.0.WebGPU, the new graphics API, has been released, allowing for parallel use of high-performance graphics processing units. While Metal was released in 2014, Apple had already stopped updating OpenGL in 2010, and they were lagging behind on OpenGL support for years before Metal was released. Apple did eventually join the Khronos working group, but the evidence contradicts the notion that they were pivotal or major players in developing Vulkan. WebGPU's declarative model is an API similar to the DOM for SVG, but Canvas and OpenGL/Vulkan are imperative. While WebGPU is currently available on Chrome 113, it will be some time before it is widely adopted, even on older Android systems.The article discusses different drawing tools in the browser, and many comments mention other options not included in the article, such as CSS, HTML elements, and fonts. Some comments discuss the use of SVG as a graphics API and mention projects using WebGPU, including the Bevy game engine and Wonnx. Other comments explore the potential of using a universal semantic layer for interfaces, and the limitations and benefits of using GPU features. Overall, the comments provide insight into the broader context of graphics and UI development on the web, including potential applications for WebGPU and the importance of considering user needs and flexibility in interface design.Web developers discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of using WebGPU instead of HTML and CSS for creating web applications, including text layout, editing, and selection engines, accessibility and screen reader compatibility, clipboard support, date pickers and file dialogs. Some argue that building a browser inside of virtual assembly code to run on a physical processor or in a VM may be more efficient than using an Electron app for HTML. Web developers also discuss the potential of application frameworks like Flutter moving to WebGPU and the performance and functionality of WebGPU compared to CUDA. The article also includes comments on the history of Vulkan and DirectX, with some speculating on their origins and conspiracy theories.WebGPU, a new technology that provides developers with easier access to graphics processing units, could revolutionize web-based gaming and other graphically-intensive applications. However, critics have raised concerns about the potential for this technology to enable fingerprinting, mining, and other malicious activities. Despite these concerns, WebGPU shows great promise in enhancing web-based graphics performance and could be a step towards browsers becoming the primary operating systems, as Chrome and Firefox have already implemented the technology. Developers can use a combination of Rust and TypeScript to build powerful web applications that are compatible with WebGPUs. While it's still in its early stages, WebGPU has vast potential for expanding graphics processing capabilities on the web.- Some argue that browsers are the best way to distribute applications due to their security and speed, making operating systems obsolete.\n- 3D applications in browsers can be useful, but WebGL is limited.\n- Programmers may expand app features to make it the operating system, leading to more bloated and complex apps.\n- OpenVG does not fit into the picture of the current discussion.\n- Some disagree with negative comments about Vulkan API, arguing that its language uses standardese to define relevant concepts.\n- Vulkan's cumbersome nature makes it less desirable compared to other APIs like WebGPU.\n- Vulkan is making progress in removing unnecessary entry barriers.",
    "hn_summary": "- WebGPU also has potential use cases in physics simulations and scientific workloads, and supports declarative programming models.\n- Web developers discuss the potential benefits of using WebGPU, such as better access to graphics processing units, but also raise concerns about its potential for malicious activities."

While passwords will be with us for some time to come, they are often frustrating to remember and put you at risk if they end up in the wrong hands.Last year \u2014 alongside FIDO Alliance, Apple and Microsoft \u2014 we announced we would begin work to support passkeys on our platform as an easier and more secure alternative to passwords. And today, ahead of World Password Day, we\u2019ve begun rolling out support for passkeys across Google Accounts on all major platforms. They\u2019ll be an additional option that people can use to sign in, alongside passwords, 2-Step Verification (2SV), etc.So maybe by next year\u2019s World Password Day, you won\u2019t even need to use your password, much less remember it!What are Passkeys?Passkeys are a new way to sign in to apps and websites. They\u2019re both easier to use and more secure than passwords, so users no longer need to rely on the names of pets, birthdays or the infamous \u201cpassword123.\u201d Instead, passkeys let users sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices: with a fingerprint, a face scan or a screen lock PIN. And, unlike passwords, passkeys are resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.Over the past year we\u2019ve shared updates on bringing passkey experiences to both Chrome and Android, which services like Docusign, Kayak, PayPal, Shopify and Yahoo! Japan have already deployed to streamline sign-in for their users. Starting today, this will be available as an option for Google Account users who want to try a passwordless sign-in experience.Passkeys for Google AccountsToday, passkeys for Google Accounts are available. You can try them out at g.co/passkeys and setting it up is easy.For Google Workspace accounts, administrators will soon have the option to enable passkeys for their end-users during sign-in.Of course, like any new beginning, the change to passkeys will take time. That\u2019s why passwords and 2SV will still work for Google Accounts.We look forward to helping people, and others in the industry, take this next leap to make signing in easier and safer with Google.POSTED IN:Safety & Security",

    "hn_content": "Google is introducing \"passkeys,\" which are based on public-key cryptography and can be used instead of passwords to authenticate users. Passkeys are stored on users' phones and make signing in more secure. They use biometrics to unlock the phone and are backed up and synced across devices signed into the same Google account. While initially there was confusion around what passkeys are, they are essentially private keys used to sign the challenge at login time. Passkeys are part of a purpose-built authentication process that leverages private keys as a component. Although they are owned by major tech companies and backed up to users' accounts, there are open-source and third-party options for using \"passkeys.\" However, losing access to all devices could result in loss of access to data.Google is piloting 'passkeys', a privacy-friendly password-free login technology that allows users to authenticate across devices with a biometric or PIN verification. The technology eliminates the need to remember passwords and reduces the risk of scams by replacing traditional authentication methods with an encrypted key stored locally on the users' device and in the cloud. It is hoped that the technology will protect user data in the event of data breaches at third-party websites. The technology has been designed to integrate with popular platforms such as Android, Google Drive and the Chrome browser, and Google expects other platforms to develop similar schemes to allow users to have a cross-platform product.Google has introduced a new system of private keys stored on devices called Passkeys. Passkeys are synced to the cloud using end-to-end encryption and can be used on both Android and iOS devices, with the option to use PINs or passwords if no mobile device is available. However, storing private keys on cloud-based services raises privacy concerns. Additionally, losing the device that stores the passkey means the user must have another way to authenticate it. The W3C Web Authentication Level 3 is set to provide hints to help users recover their lost passkey. Passkeys are a passwordless app that can eliminate the need for remembering and typing in passwords.Google's Passkeys authentication system allows users to replace passwords and second factors with biometrics. Passkeys cannot be shared with others and are tied to a single device. They can be authenticated through a secondary proprietary device or a Yubikey. Passkeys can be enrolled in different devices and used to login to accounts connected under different login methods. The Passkeys API allows third-party authenticators to be developed for on-device authentication across ecosystems that adhere to the WebAuthn standard, making on-device third-party authenticators on Android and iOS possible. Exporting Passkeys to other ecosystems is something that will likely come over time. There are concerns that Google's Passkeys could tether and lock users into their platform. However, Google has publicly stated its commitment to supporting third-party Passkeys.Google and Apple are pushing Passkeys, making anything WebAuthn-compatible viable. NFC rings have been suggested as a cool solution but with potential security issues. The trend towards relying on centralized identity providers denies users access to pseudonymity and leaves them open to privacy violations. There are many ways to provide these services without relying solely on a big corporation. Passkeys, however, make it easier to involve third parties in authentication and thus ease the difficulty of mass adoption. However, passkeys are a step backward, considering the risk of metadata harvesting and the possibility that one could lose access to their accounts if Google, Apple, or any other third parties lock them out. A solution that combines cryptographic keys or seeds with passphrases held in the mind may be better for authentication.The conversation revolves around the use of Passkeys and WebAuthN as a better alternative to passwords. There are concerns about the lack of choice for websites in accepting authenticators, which could lead to vendor lock-in. Some users worry about the use of attestation and its potential to restrict device choice. Others suggest using external hardware authenticators like Yubikey and Solokey. The possibility of opt-out functionality for passkey syncing/backups on a per-passkey level is discussed. The importance of competition in security and functionality is stressed. The conversation also touches on the need for cryptographic digital identity cards and the potential for loss of pseudonymity if such cards become ubiquitous.Passkeys, a new authentication method that replaces passwords with a piece of hardware, are discussed in this forum post. The iOS now requires interactive user consent for apps to Paste from clipboard, which is considered a big security win, while macOS does not yet. The authenticator can decide whether backups are allowed, but in the case of iOS, it does not expose that to the user. Passkeys are synced to the cloud by default on iOS and Android, which could be a good idea for many use cases but might not be what some users want. They work by creating an open-standard Yubikey or password manager with biometric authentication. FaceID could be considered a passkey, and it could be paired with a mobile driver's license to create an eID.Google wants to replace login passwords with \"passkeys,\" which uses phone authentication instead of a password. However, users have expressed doubts about the real security of passkeys and the integration with various services if the device is lost or stolen. Passkeys are synced to the cloud by default on iOS and Android, which may be useful for some users who want availability rather than security. But this has led to criticisms that Google may become the gatekeeper of such passkeys. There are also concerns that biometric data is not as secure compared to passwords. Furthermore, synchronization of passkeys is possible only with another device, which might put the validity of the system at risk.The comments discuss the limitations and drawbacks of biometric authentication, particularly its reliability, security, and potential vulnerabilities. While biometrics can serve as a more convenient alternative to traditional passwords, they are not foolproof and raise concerns about privacy and identity theft. The comments also explore how passkeys or PINs can help augment biometric authentication while improving security. However, PINs also have their limitations and can become vulnerable to brute-forcing or phishing attacks. Ultimately, the discussion highlights the trade-offs between convenience and security, especially in the context of emerging authentication technologies.Apple's secure enclave provides measures against brute-forcing and tampering, making PIN-based authentication off-device effective, but not when used on-device. The level of sophistication required to breach trusted compute silicon goes up when bypassing safeguards in the key derivation function, protecting against unsophisticated attackers like phishing and data breaches, but not nation-state level attackers. Passkeys do not need to be used, and passwords can be enforced with certain requirements, but cannot force users to use unique passwords or forbid them from storing them in easily accessible places. 2FA via SMS is still vulnerable, whereas 2FA with an app like Google Authenticator or VIPAccess is more secure because it is tied to a device, but tying it to a phone has drawbacks. Humankind will keep trying every wrong approach to passwords.",

    "content": "OpenLLaMA: An Open Reproduction of LLaMAIn this repo, we release a permissively licensed open source reproduction of Meta AI's LLaMA large language model. In this release, we're releasing a public preview of the 7B OpenLLaMA model that has been trained with 200 billion tokens. We provide PyTorch and Jax weights of pre-trained OpenLLaMA models, as well as evaluation results and comparison against the original LLaMA models. Stay tuned for our updates.JAX and PyTorch Weights on Huggingface Hub200B Tokens Checkpoint300B Tokens CheckpointUpdate 5/3/2023We have released a new checkpoint of OpenLLaMA 7B trained on 300B tokens. In communicating with our users, we have realized that many existing implementations of LLaMA does not prepend the BOS token (id=1) at generation time. Our 200B checkpoint is sensitive to this and may produce degraded results without BOS token at the beginning. Hence, we recommend always prepending the BOS token when using our 200B checkpoint.In an effort to make our model boradly compatible with existing implementations, we have now released a new 300B checkpoint, which is less sensitive to BOS token and can be used either way.Dataset and TrainingWe train our models on the RedPajama dataset released by Together, which is a reproduction of the LLaMA training dataset containing over 1.2 trillion tokens. We follow the exactly same preprocessing steps and training hyperparameters as the original LLaMA paper, including model architecture, context length, training steps, learning rate schedule, and optimizer. The only difference between our setting and the original one is the dataset used: OpenLLaMA employs the RedPajama dataset rather than the one utilized by the original LLaMA.We train the models on cloud TPU-v4s using EasyLM, a JAX based training pipeline we developed for training and fine-tuning language model. We employ a combination of normal data parallelism and fully sharded data parallelism (also know as ZeRO stage 3) to balance the training throughput and memory usage. Overall we reach a throughput of over 1900 tokens / second / TPU-v4 chip in our training run. The training loss can be seen in the figure below.EvaluationWe evaluated OpenLLaMA on a wide range of tasks using lm-evaluation-harness. The LLaMA results are generated by running the original LLaMA model on the same evaluation metrics. We note that our results for the LLaMA model differ slightly from the original LLaMA paper, which we believe is a result of different evaluation protocols. Similar differences have been reported in this issue of lm-evaluation-harness. Additionally, we present the results of GPT-J, a 6B parameter model trained on the Pile dataset by EleutherAI.The original LLaMA model was trained for 1 trillion tokens and GPT-J was trained for 500 billion tokens, whereas OpenLLaMA was trained on 200 billion tokens. We present the results in the table below. OpenLLaMA exhibits comparable performance to the original LLaMA and GPT-J across a majority of tasks, and outperforms them in some tasks. We expect that the performance of OpenLLaMA, after completing its training on 1 trillion tokens, will be enhanced even further.Task/Metric GPT-J 6B LLaMA 7B Open LLaMA 7B Preview 200B Tokensanli_r1/acc 0.32 0.35 0.34anli_r2/acc 0.34 0.34 0.35anli_r3/acc 0.35 0.37 0.34arc_challenge/acc 0.34 0.39 0.31arc_challenge/acc_norm 0.37 0.41 0.34arc_easy/acc 0.67 0.68 0.66arc_easy/acc_norm 0.62 0.52 0.59boolq/acc 0.66 0.75 0.67cb/acc 0.36 0.36 0.38cb/f1 0.26 0.24 0.29hellaswag/acc 0.50 0.56 0.47hellaswag/acc_norm 0.66 0.73 0.63openbookqa/acc 0.29 0.29 0.26openbookqa/acc_norm 0.38 0.41 0.37piqa/acc 0.75 0.78 0.74piqa/acc_norm 0.76 0.78 0.74record/em 0.88 0.91 0.87record/f1 0.89 0.91 0.88rte/acc 0.54 0.56 0.53truthfulqa_mc/mc1 0.20 0.21 0.21truthfulqa_mc/mc2 0.36 0.34 0.34wic/acc 0.50 0.50 0.50winogrande/acc 0.64 0.68 0.62wsc/acc 0.37 0.35 0.57Average 0.50 0.52 0.50Preview Weights Release and UsageTo encourage the feedback from the community, we release a preview checkpoint of our weights. The checkpoint can be downloaded from HuggingFace Hub. We release the weights in two formats: an EasyLM format to be use with our EasyLM framework, and a PyTorch format to be used with the Huggingface Transformers library.For using the weights in our EasyLM framework, please refer to the LLaMA documentation of EasyLM. Note that unlike the original LLaMA model, our OpenLLaMA tokenizer and weights are trained completely from scratch so it is no longer needed to obtain the original LLaMA tokenizer and weights. For using the weights in the transformers library, please follow the transformers LLaMA documentation. Note that we use BOS (beginning of sentence) token (id=1) during training, so it is important to prepend this token for best performance during few-shot evaluation.Both our training framework EasyLM and the preview checkpoint weights are licensed permissively under the Apache 2.0 license.Future PlansThe current release is only a preview of what the complete OpenLLaMA release will offer. We are currently focused on completing the training process on the entire RedPajama dataset. This can gives us a good apple-to-apple comparison between the original LLaMA and our OpenLLaMA. Other than the 7B model, we are also training a smaller 3B model in hope of facilitating language model usage in low resource use cases. Please stay tuned for our upcoming releases.ContactWe would love to get feedback from the community.

With the processors now officially unveiled by AMD, we're able to share much more detail. We're using Ryzen 5 7640U and Ryzen 7 7840U processors, both of which offer incredible CPU and GPU performance. These are both pre-orderable today, with batches shipping as early as Q3 this year.The Ryzen 5 7640U processor has 6 CPU cores clocked at a base frequency of 3.5GHz and up to a max boost of 4.9GHz, while the Ryzen 7 7840U has an amazing 8 cores and 16 processing threads clocked at a base of 3.3GHz and up to 5.1GHz max boost. These are all Zen 4 cores, which feature AMD's fastest processor technology ever. These chips are fabricated on TSMC's 4nm process node, meaning that even with such high performance, they are also extremely efficient. We've designed the thermal system to be able to handle the processors at up to 28W continuous load if you need to do some heavy crunching too.Ryzen-powered Framework Laptop users are also in for a treat when it comes to graphics performance. The Ryzen 7040 Series processors feature the latest generation AMD Radeon 700M Series graphics, the first AMD RDNA 3-based integrated graphics. The Ryzen 5 7640U has Radeon 760M graphics with 8 Compute Units while the Ryzen 7 7840U has Radeon 780M graphics with 12 Compute Units. This means the Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen\u2122 7040 Series) can handle a range of modern game titles directly. If you want to use an eGPU, you can do that too! This is because the Framework Laptop 13 with Ryzen\u2122 7040 Series processors has two fully capable USB4 ports, with the back left and back right Expansion Cards slots. The front left Expansion Card slot can handle both USB 3.2 and DisplayPort Alt Mode, while the front right Expansion Card can use USB 3.2. This does mean there is one Expansion Card slot that can't support the HDMI or DisplayPort Expansion Cards, and most OS's will provide a warning if you forget. You can charge your Framework Laptop through any of the four Expansion Cards as well.Like always, we've designed the Ryzen\u2122 7040 Series-based Mainboard for maximum flexibility. You can upgrade your existing 11th Gen or 12th Gen Intel Core Framework Laptop using the new Mainboard, and you can use the Mainboard as a standalone computer, putting it in the Cooler Master Mainboard Case or 3D printing your own. If you're upgrading your Framework Laptop to the new Mainboard, remember that you'll need DDR5 SO-DIMMs up to DDR5-5600, along with a Ryzen-compatible RZ616 or similar WiFi card. All of these are pre-orderable in the Framework Marketplace today!",

The framework laptop with Intel graphics experiences occasional driver freezes and crashes.Preorders are now open for the Framework Laptop 13 with AMD Ryzen preinstalled. The new feature is the specific CPU announcement for Ryzen 5 7640U and Ryzen 7 7840U. Replacement parts are available in the Marketplace, and both US English Input Covers and US English Keyboards are in stock. While Hibernate works well, \"smart sleep\" solutions are uniformly worse than the Hibernate option due to the non-compatibility of lockdown mode with hibernation, limiting the user's options. For a similar setup to Macbooks, \"suspend-then-hibernate\" can be enabled with logind/systemd, but it can be complicated to set up. Linux support is a concern, with issues such as integrated graphics tearing and resume/suspend problems. Readers are interested in modularity and reusability, making the Framework Laptop 13 a significant post.Framework, the open laptop manufacturer, releases a new series of mainboards that feature DDR5 SO-DIMMs and perfectly fit into its modular laptop design. They also promote third-party enclosures and claim to be fostering an ecosystem, despite being the sole supplier of some of their device parts. However, some argue that even if Framework publishes specs and promotes openness, they are still essentially a locked-in laptop ecosystem, much like Dell or Lenovo. There is discussion around the usefulness of ARM-based laptops and the lack of flexible Linux support for them. Some users express disappointment with the layout of the keyboard and suggest alternative key mapping solutions. Others criticize the price point and competitiveness of Framework compared to other vendors.The post includes a mix of comments discussing various topics related to laptops and computer hardware. Some notable points:\n\n- The Framework laptop, which is praised for its repairability and customizability, is now available for pre-order with AMD Ryzen 5 or 7 processors.\n- Readers discuss the pros and cons of different processor architectures, including ARM, RISC-V, and x86.\n- Some readers express disappointment with the Framework keyboard layout and lack of touchscreen support.\n- Discussions also touch on topics such as power consumption, availability in different countries, and the history of portable computers.The post includes comments from users discussing their preferences for touchscreens on laptops. Some of the use cases mentioned include signing documents, playing games, scrolling, and developing mobile websites/apps. Some users mention that touchscreens add weight and decrease battery life, while others argue that touchscreens can improve the user experience for certain tasks. The post also includes a discussion on keyboard layouts and whether or not a DVORAK layout is necessary for hackers. There is no specific new or exciting information in this post, but it provides insights into user preferences for touchscreens and keyboard layouts.",

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News post about a book called \"A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics\" has sparked a discussion about the differences between discrete and continuous mathematics. Some commenters recommended exploring coalgebras, while others argued that continuous mathematics is easier to imagine and prove results about than the discrete. There were also suggestions for other resources and areas of math to explore, such as Coq or Idris for bridging programming, math, and logic, and machine learning's use of approximations to calculus and continuous functions. Additionally, some commenters found the introduction of proofs challenging.A discussion on the use of formal language and mathematical notation in proofs and programming. Some argue that mathematical language is necessary for rigor and precision, while others claim that code can be used as a substitute for mathematical notation. Competitive programming is mentioned as a potential aid to understanding mathematical concepts. The importance of learning mathematical language for effectively using and understanding research papers is emphasized. A book on math for non-mathematicians is recommended for its introduction to groups. Overall, the discussion highlights the challenges and benefits of learning and using mathematical notation in programming and mathematical fields.- No meaningful content or tech news in the text.\n- One user shares their approach in problem-solving by first figuring out the math and then writing the program.\n- Y Combinator has opened applications for Summer 2023.",

    "hn_content": "The usage of the US dollar is declining globally, but not one currency is replacing it.\nCountries are diversifying their portfolios by purchasing other currencies.\nConversations about a single currency replacing the dollar are a fallacy.\nThe move away from the dollar would hurt the US by limiting the Fed and increasing inflation while enabling other countries to have more antagonistic foreign policies towards the US.\nAlthough EVs and renewables are reducing oil demand, oil remains pivotal for global GDP.\nAlternative energy still depends on hydrocarbons, mainly oil, and plastic production still uses fossil fuel carbon.\nUS dollar demand reflects how much foreign investors trust the American economy, political, and judicial system.Countries are moving away from the US dollar due to a lack of confidence in the US government and institutions. The use of the US dollar as a reserve currency and trading currency between non-US countries creates demand for the currency itself. While foreign investment in the US does happen, demand for dollars without investment is more significant. The de-dollarization occurring will not hurt the US, but it could make foreign investments in the US less attractive if the value of the dollar goes down due to lower demand. Moving towards a diversified portfolio of currencies and assets can minimize financial risk and foreign economic-political influence. The move away from the US dollar as an international currency is challenging due to strong network effects behind the currency's status. A single currency makes commerce easier but can be problematic for small, poor nations. Transactions using the US dollar are performed through US banks, and the US is becoming an unreliable party that could freeze accounts or decline transactions.The use of the US dollar in global trade has declined but countries still hold US treasuries to serve international debt and protect against currency risk. De-dollarization is mainly happening with China, but it is a slow-moving train. Yuan is not likely to become a world reserve currency, primarily because China wants to retain control over its economy while avoiding the dollar. China's economy is crashing fast with a 50% real estate price cut, 100k+ housing inventory for sale in major tier 1 cities, 80% factory order decline from foreign companies, and a\u00a0400% debt to GDP. Russia has a good incentive to de-dollarize now, and it's actually harder for China because holding Yuan is not an option for them.\u00a0No meaningful content for a summary on cutting-edge tech news.There is a discussion about the potential of mining deeper in the Earth to extract gold and other valuable minerals due to advances in technology. Theories include heavier elements sinking to the bottom, creating more abundance at deeper levels, but there is some disagreement. The conversation also addresses the impact of new cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and whether countries moving away from the US dollar reserve system could be a cause for concern. Finally, there is brief discussion on the history of US military involvement across the world and how it has created bad blood with some countries.- The post discusses the relationship between Europe and the United States, with some commenters pointing to the historical reliability of the US as an ally.\n- Some commenters express doubt about the trustworthiness of the US government and point to various issues, including the US's military involvement in the world, the country's economic decline, and the potential motivations behind covert operations such as the alleged destruction of the Nord Stream Pipeline.\n- Another commenter suggests that the decline of the US dollar as a reserve currency may contribute to a more peaceful world order, but some express skepticism that the US will relinquish its privilege without a fight.The post discusses the potential consequences of de-dollarization in a multi-polar world. The discussion includes opinions on the actions of the US and other world powers. Some commentators argue that China's interactions with the world have been largely economic rather than militaristic, unlike the US. Others argue that the US has done immoral things but that it is a common problem for countries with power. There is also a brief discussion of modern monetary theory and its predictions regarding inflation. However, some commentators feel that MMT lacks rationality and neglects important historical examples of debasing currency. Overall, the post provides an interesting perspective on the potential consequences of changing world order and the role of different world powers.The post discusses the concept of money printing and its relation to Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). It argues that MMT is not a theory of money printing, but rather a theory of money and accounting. The author believes in accounting identities and cautions against violating them for political framing. The post highlights the importance of the ratcheting mechanism in limiting the effects of money creation, but notes that deflation is a scary issue that must be avoided. The comments section provides additional insights into the mechanisms of deflation and inflation, and the potential consequences of unchecked financial policies. There is also discussion of the role of tax loopholes and how they can affect the ratcheting mechanism, as well as mention of de-dollarization and the global push to internationalize currencies.",
