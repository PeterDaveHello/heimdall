    "originBody": "Our developer account was removed by Apple, and they haven't paid out $108,878My name is Viktor Seraleev, and I live in Chile. I’m founder of Sarafan Mobile Limited (team ID G5293S9UFX). Our developer account was closed on September 21, 2023. We specialize in developing photo and video applications for creators.According to App Store benchmarks, almost all of our applications consistently ranked in the highest category for retention on the 1st and 28th day. The average rating for our applications was above 4.5. You can check out our apps on Google Play, where they also boast excellent performance. Further validating the high quality of our applications are approved grants from Xiaomi, totaling $150,000 for advertising expenses across three of our apps. The removal of applications resulted in the following losses:Apple has not paid us $108,878 revenue (this amount is for 3 months). Our 6 applications had a total of $33,680 MRR as of September 20, 2023. One day before removal, we had 1209 active trials. We are left without means of existence. The applications were our sole source of income. I cannot convey the challenges that we and our families have faced due to the account termination.Here's our story: On August 21, 2023, Apple removed our Reely application during the update review. Along with the removal, we received a notification citing a violation of section 3.2(f) of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement:Upon further review of the activity associated with your Apple Developer Program membership, we have determined that your membership, or a membership associated with your account, has been used for dishonest or fraudulent activity. Therefore, your Apple Developer Program account has been flagged for removal. If you would like to appeal this termination decision to the App Review Board, you must do so within 30 calendar days.The notice did not identify any developer accounts that Sarafan’s account was allegedly associated with. The notice also did not identify what steps Sarafan was required to take to preserve its account, stating only that Sarafan had 30 days to appeal the decision. I removed access from all accounts, leaving only the full-time developers. Additionally, I asked the developers to log out of all accounts they might be connected to. We addressed potential violations and filed an appeal on the same day. On September 6, 2023, we received a rejection:",

Take down the reviews, yes. But closing the developer account creates a big opportunity to eliminate competition by buying fake reviews for your competitors. There&#x27;s also nothing developers can do to prevent this since they can&#x27;t curate or reject reviews from what I know.That said, other commenters are pointing out a very large revenue figure relative to the popularity of these apps. That smells more like money laundering or fraud. In that scenario, Apple should have been more specific in their communications. reply judge2020 16 hours agoparentThis was talked about by Phillip Shoemaker (head of App Store Review 2009-2016) in this talk[0], where some developers figured out that if they hired marketing firms to commit review fraud on a competitor’s app, their competitor would get terminated because there’s no clear way to actually attribute the fraud to the developer.I guess the App Store fraud prevention team hasn’t necessarily found a good solution yet.0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;tJeEuxn9mug?t=22m57s&si=CVfkqSqEULyFTx-8 reply munk-a 14 hours agorootparentIf Apple isn&#x27;t able to police this then maybe it&#x27;s unhealthy for the market to be completely controlled by them. They make billions off the AppStore and their refusal to reinvest in proper moderation (especially for an app worth hundreds of thousands in revenue) is quite telling. reply terminous 14 hours agorootparentThis isn&#x27;t an Apple problem, it&#x27;s a problem with every business review platform. If a shady marketing firm takes a contract to give an app fake 5 star reviews, there&#x27;s no way for the review platform to know if that shady marketing firm was hired by the app&#x27;s developer or their competitor. Only the marketing firm knows. reply _pigpen__ 14 hours agorootparentIf the App Store is the only vehicle for selling mobile apps on Apple devices, then by virtue of their monopoly, they have a duty to be entirely transparent and fair. It’s entirely an Apple problem. reply GuB-42 10 hours agorootparentThey are transparent and fair. Fake reviews are not allowed. Apple has no way to know if you hired a fake review company or if some competitor did. Their moderation team can only check for fake reviews, not who paid for them. Of course, if they ask developers if they did something wrong and they did, they will get lied to.And it shouldn&#x27;t be Apple&#x27;s problem. Apple is not a court of law. They have no business knowing about their developers internal affairs, imagine the conflicts of interest. This is a matter for an actual court of law, that can issue warrants and subpoenas, where perjury is a thing, where there is fair trail and where you can ask damage and the guilty party get charged for fraud. You obviously don&#x27;t want to give these powers to a private company. reply DelightOne 14 hours agorootparentprevExcept that Apple ist the gatekeeper here. reply type0 9 hours agorootparentApple engages in a lot of anti-competitive practices.

Manual review. Apple chooses not to rely on manual review and we shouldn&#x27;t discount this decision of theirs. reply Aeolun 9 hours agorootparentprevThen maybe they shouldn’t use fake reviews as a heuristic for termination? reply lwhi 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is and has always been the fundamental problem with Apple owning the app ecosystem. reply brookst 11 hours agorootparentprevI think you just said any company that cannot practice moderation with absolute perfection should not be in business? reply euroderf 12 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t this kind of the core of the problem with Yelp ? reply silenced_trope 15 hours agorootparentprevpretty clever, it reminds me of the early days of the app store when apps would be taken down for copyright strikes but if you provided proof you&#x27;d be given \"immunity\" from further strikes taking down your app while Apple investigatesit became a strategy to copyright strike your own app, have proof ready so that no downtime was necessary, then you have the temporary immunity so that competitors couldn&#x27;t submit a copyright strike, which costed them nothing to do and had no consequences if they were wrong about it reply araes 12 hours agorootparentThis is actually what I started thinking when I got to the end of the article. Maybe just immediate human snatch and grab cynicism.That the author hired somebody to dump review, does something fishy with money like those above noted, and then sues for more money.Levine over at Bloomberg had an interesting article where ransomware gangs are now filing SEC reports, as a way to pressure companies to pay, or minimize ROI. reply Obscurity4340 14 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t get how this sort of short-term thinking to the extremth degree is ever worth it or sustainable... reply lmm 11 hours agorootparentIt probably isn&#x27;t now, but in the early days the iphone app store was a giant pinata full of money for anyone who wanted to knock up a flashlight app or whatever. reply CamperBob2 13 hours agorootparentprevBlame Apple for forcing developers (and encouraging bad guys) to spend more time thinking about the App Store rules than they do themselves. reply sshine 13 hours agorootparentprevA friend of mine upvoted all of my StackOverflow posts daily for a period of time until it got flagged and the points were removed. He did it again later, and it got flagged again with a warning. I had to ask him to stop upvoting all my posts, because it was indistinguishable from me giving myself points via a proxy account. reply san_dimitri 15 hours agorootparentprevHmm interesting. I wonder what happen if there were a lot of fake reviews on Apple’s own apps. I am sure this policy would not apply to themselves. reply KennyBlanken 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s apparently common on Twitch for scammers to try and blackmail streamers by threatening to followbot them.Not every streamer knows that they can forward such threats to Twitch&#x27;s support staff, and if they don&#x27;t, their stream is at risk from automated bot detection penalizing them. reply ano-ther 13 hours agorootparentprevThat’s a very thorny problem.

The ability for them to completely control software and business activities on top of something that is almost as essential as public transportation is appalling.The DOJ needs to remove the \"app store\" racket for essential computing devices. Software needs to be freely installable, sans vendor control, unfair competition, scare tactics, mandatory taxation, and adversarial ad placement by the cellphone duopoly.Not only is cell phone compute freedom essential, but we desperately need more than just two vendors. reply wongarsu 14 hours agorootparentAndroid removed the big technical measures that gave Google&#x27;s Play Store a competitive advantage over alternatives, in no small part because of EU pressure. And while the Play Store is by far the biggest player in town, Amazon&#x27;s Appstore, Huawei&#x27;s AppGallery and F-Droid are all notable alternatives.Meanwhile on iOS the best we seem to get is the EU Digital Markets Act setting some rules for fairness on the big marketplaces. reply coredog64 14 hours agorootparentGoogle pressures device OEMS into joining the OHA, after which they can&#x27;t create AOSP devices. Allegedly, Amazon is giving up on Android for their own hardware. reply type0 8 hours agorootparent> Allegedly, Amazon is giving up on Android for their own hardware.Ah, that was news to me, so Amazon Vega is predicted to be some sort of immutable OS with web apps. It seems they are thinking of starting some Chrome OS resembling thing. iOS also intended to only have Web apps and look where we are now. I don&#x27;t have high hopes for OS developed for Fire devices, it will be soaked in DRM and filled with ads. reply judge2020 15 hours agorootparentprevOne of the main draws of iOS is its resistance to malware, adware, and outright scam apps. Requiring third party app stores disproportionately harms those that purchased the device specifically for these purposes (such as people at higher risks of being targeted by nation state actors). And this isn’t something that can be addressed with a new uber-secure product just for these people, because the EU will deem it a gatekeeper if enough people buy it - so I guess you have to create a hard cutoff for how many can purchase the product ever, or means test “do you actually deserve security?”. reply Keyframe 15 hours agorootparentOne of the main draws of iOS is its resistance to malware, adware, and outright scam apps.Have we visited the same appstore? Just few days ago I tried to find a puzzle game for my kid and myself to play together. A whole bunch of them, from top results, resulted in games which had shady dark UI initial screens trying to get to $14.99 or similar monthly subscriptions. Eventually I caved in to arcade sub because I couldn&#x27;t trust any of the results or find a normal paid one (once). Scammy at best. reply TylerE 11 hours agorootparentLooked at android recently? It’s far far worse. Also “has ads” isn’t a synonym for “malware”. reply Keyframe 11 hours agorootparentYes, I have and to be honest I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all, apart google at least pretending it cares with play protect. reply janc_ 11 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s only true for some Android application stores. reply lapcat 15 hours agorootparentprev> One of the main draws of iOS is its resistance to malware, adware, and outright scam apps.The crApp Store is full of scams. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2021&#x2F;06&#x2F;06&#x2F;apple-a...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;chatgpt-scams-apple-app-store-go...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2023&#x2F;02&#x2F;pig-b...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;gordonkelly&#x2F;2021&#x2F;05&#x2F;15&#x2F;apple-ip...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;developer-exposes-another-mul...There&#x27;s practically endless proof and documentation for this.The App Store is actually a honeypot for scammers. It&#x27;s a single point of failure, because once you get past app review, which is easy, you&#x27;re home free, and it&#x27;s also relatively easy to manipulate App Store search, App Store ratings and reviews, and App Store Search Ads.As a non-scam App Store developer, my biggest problem is discovery, i.e., getting my app in front of the eyeballs of potential customers. It&#x27;s vastly easier to do that in the App Store than it is via so-called sideloading, especially if you have no ethics. (Unfortunately, I do have ethics, which significantly limits my options for discovery.) reply quitit 14 hours agorootparentI hear your argument, but it&#x27;s not convincing.Your logic states that because an app can occasionally slip through the review process, that we should remove -all- protections. That isn&#x27;t better, that&#x27;s worse.A scam is also a relatively low bar to set for such drastic change, since scams also frequently occur over chat apps and the kinds of access that side-loading and 3rd party stores can avail opens the door to significantly more sophisticated malware. If you truly think the situation right now is bad, just wait until there are no protections for users.You should also recognise that there is actual data for malware on these platforms. Every year Nokia drive home the same point for why Android has such an outsized share of malware: \"...most smartphone malware is distributed as trojanized applications and since Android users can load application from just about anywhere, it’s much easier to trick them into installing applications that are infected with malware.\"Since all experts point to the same sources of malware - perhaps that&#x27;s not the change we should be legislating. How about we do something different. reply shopvaccer 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been using an antimalware system which has been highly successful at blocking all sorts of malware. It&#x27;s where I don&#x27;t run invasive closed source programs on my computers and give them access to all my shit, and I don&#x27;t just give my credentials and money to anyone that asks. In other words, basic computer practices from decades ago.I know that this system may be unattainable for some, namely children, the elderly and the intellectually disabled. But maybe we shouldn&#x27;t be designing general purpose computers around the lowest common denominators of society, for the same reason you wouldn&#x27;t design a car for the legally blind or a book for the illiterate.The nature of smartphones and the internet has some pretty large consequences for the economy, politics, war, and global surveilance. I understand that some people don&#x27;t know how to manage their own computer, but if you really think everyone&#x27;s computers should be controlled by dictators and buerocrats maybe you should just go live in a third world country instead. reply quitit 14 hours agorootparentIf the concept here is choice, then why not force apple to clearly advertise that side loading and 3rd party apps stores are not available. The same way that Samsung and Huawei promote theirs?Then the consumer can make that decision for themselves.Your position here seems to be that consumers are too dumb to make that decision, but clever enough to fend off sophisticated malware attacks. You are even so gracious to note that perhaps this might be out of reach for ordinary users (well done you! you nearly got there)If only there was a large and popular platform of devices with side-loading and 3rd party app stores available for us to already see the consequences of what this change does to malware rates. Let&#x27;s call this hypothetical platform \"Android\", and then a well respected security report, say by Nokia, could include statistics about this \"Android\" malware.Well, you&#x27;re in luck dear friend! Actual security experts state: \"most smartphone malware is distributed as trojanized applications and since Android users can load application from just about anywhere, it’s much easier to trick them into installing applications that are infected with malware\". (worth stating twice because I don&#x27;t think it sunk in the first time.)So real security experts are advising the opposite approach from you, funny that.As for a 3rd world country, maybe you should run one since you have the ego of a dictator. reply janc_ 11 hours agorootparentprevAbout 99.9% of apps in the Google Play Store contain spyware (and I doubt it&#x27;s much better in Apple&#x27;s store?). reply judge2020 9 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a difference between spyware and a library that sends the company usage details about how you use their app. Even apps with ads are only forbidden from using bespoke APIs (other than the built-in prompt \"allow \" to track you across other apps and websites) to track users&#x27; activity and correlate it with other sessions. reply Manuel_D 15 hours agorootparentprevJust don&#x27;t use the third party app store if you&#x27;re worried about scams. Requiring that apple permit 3rd party app stores does not force users to use said 3rd part stores. reply quitit 15 hours agorootparentThis sounds like a fair point until remembering that things like Boss-ware exist.An insurer&#x2F; health insurer, employer, government, etc will require it, and just like that the \"just don&#x27;t use them\" crowd will hold up their hands and pretend that no one could have imagined this disaster.If the problem is truly Apple exhibiting favouritism or limiting competition through their app approval process: then the EU should have just forced them to spin it out into an independent entity for the EU stores, or even take control of it themselves - but they didn&#x27;t and 2024&#x2F;25 is going to be a shitshow for it.Legislating for side loading and multiple app stores is the least imaginative and most obviously flawed approach to the competition problem and the sole reason why Android&#x27;s share of malware is staggering in comparison to iOS. reply waprin 14 hours agorootparentIf you’re required to install software on your phone for work then your employer should be legally required to pay for your phone. And then if you want your own phone you pay for it yourself. And if your employers IT team lets corporate devices get malware that’s on them. This is a weird edge case to get hung up on.You’re making a very simple issue way more complicated than it needs to be. Having Apple spin out EU specific new corporate entities with unclear relationships to its parent company sounds extremely complex.Requiring Apple to allow people to install apps they want on their own device is pretty simple and should be a fundamental expectation of a free society.If normal user wants the walled garden Apple experience, that’s fine. Make it unintuitive to install third party apps. Require checking a big red disclaimer that you might brick your phone. But just have some sort of path where if party A made an app and party B wants it on the device they paid a lot of money for, they can do that without some unqualified drone in Cupertino blocking it .Countless examples of the App Store review being broken , and just on principle, Apple has what’s effectively a monopoly on mobile phones in that you can’t make a mobile app and ignore iPhone and for them to unilaterally decide all software that’s allowed is way too much power.Somehow Microsoft went to the Supreme Court for putting IE on the desktop but Apple is off the hook for a complete lockdown. At least you could download Netscape on Windows 95! What Apple is doing is like if AOL and AOL keywords became the only entry point to the web. Then you go on Hacker News and people say that’s s good thing because AOL only allows quality websites and otherwise people make malware and scam websites. It doesn’t matter, it’s too much power for one company and mobile phones are more critical to society in 2023 than the web was in the 90s. Mobile phones are not appliances.It’s still unfathomable to me this is even a conversation on this website. Apples complete lockdown of the most important computing devices is plainly bad for consumers and society. reply quitit 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m making a pretty valid point(note Android&#x27;s outsized malware share) and we&#x27;ll get to see it play out next year in the EU.It&#x27;s interesting to me that your core argument is about making a choice whether or not to embrace side-loading and 3rd party app stores. However aren&#x27;t users making this choice when they buy the phone to begin with. Side loading and 3rd party app stores aren&#x27;t a secret, many Android manufacturers use this as a selling point and include their own stores baked-in.I&#x27;m somehow to believe that users are simultaneously clever and dumb - and I&#x27;m not buying it. reply Guvante 11 hours agorootparentI like how you call users dumb for choosing Apple and clever for wanting to sideload.Or how else do you claim there is two sides here?Pretending that Apple is protecting consumers is silly, they have repeatedly said internally the lock is for revenue alone. No claim of security protection has lasted past \"wouldn&#x27;t sideloaded apps be sandboxed the same as App Store apps and thus have the same security overall\"? (Apple failed to counter that point) reply quitit 9 hours agorootparent>I like how you call users dumb for choosing Apple and clever for wanting to sideload.That&#x27;s clearly not what is written, don&#x27;t invent a false narrative with your lack of comprehension skills.Also going to need a citation for this beauty:>\"they [apple] have repeatedly said internally the lock is for revenue alone\"But judging from your reading skills earlier, I don&#x27;t have confidence in it being forthcoming. reply judge2020 9 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like the poster means that people who buy one or the other are choosing between either \"(nearly) absolute\" security or freedom in being able to install software without the manufacturer&#x27;s consent. reply judge2020 9 hours agorootparentprev> If you’re required to install software on your phone for work then your employer should be legally required to pay for your phone. And then if you want your own phone you pay for it yourself. And if your employers IT team lets corporate devices get malware that’s on them. This is a weird edge case to get hung up on.I&#x27;ll support any sideloading regulation that includes all of these protections. As it stands this is only a law in some countries&#x2F;regions and certainly not something everyone will be protected by if they happen to be outside of EU (and maybe US) jurisdiction. reply Manuel_D 14 hours agorootparentprevIf your company mandates installation of malware, then that&#x27;s not something an app store can fix. If your company mandates the installation of malware and it&#x27;s not available on the Apple AppStore, do you think they&#x27;d just say, \"well okie dokie I guess the policy doesn&#x27;t apply to you\"? No, they&#x27;d require you carry a compliant device.If my company is mandating the installation of software on my devices, I&#x27;ll request a corporate device and assume the company has root access on said device. reply ghostpepper 14 hours agorootparentPeople who have plenty of options for switching jobs are generally not the first target for oppressive technology reply Manuel_D 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure how this is relevant to my point: \"sorry your app isn&#x27;t on the Apple app store\" probably isn&#x27;t enough to stop an oppressive employer from forcing employees to install spyware. reply ThatPlayer 14 hours agorootparentprevIt is also already possible through MDM to force install of apps separate from the app store.Employer installed apps is a use case Apple officially support. reply Grayskull 14 hours agorootparentprev> An insurer&#x2F; health insurer, employer, government, etc will require it, and just like that the \"just don&#x27;t use them\" crowd will hold up their hands and pretend that no one could have imagined this disaster.On Android where alternate storefronts are a possibility, I have yet to be made aware of a single instance of this happening. Not even Epic in their crusade against established mobile stores made its&#x27; own platform. reply quitit 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a naive point to take for two reasons:1. You&#x27;re not looking very hard, surveillance ware exists for employment, examinations and so on. It&#x27;s not available on iOS, but is available on Android via side loading. Both Facebook and Google used iOS certificates to side load tracking apps onto iOS for regular consumers. Even rental cars brands have utilised surveillance software to track speed and apply fines. The more you dig here the more you find: it&#x27;s not some outlandish concept.2. The inability to run such types of software on iOS prevents these approaches from moving forward across the industry. Much the same way that QR codes weren&#x27;t widely utilised until both Android and iOS supported it. reply erikerikson 15 hours agorootparentprev> Requiring third party app storesThat&#x27;s doing a lot of work. There&#x27;s \"... to be usable\" but also \"... to be automatically and unfilterably merged\".They are very different situations. What specifically are you concerned about? I&#x27;d guess that latter but you seem to be defending the former as though it is the latter. reply wavemode 15 hours agorootparentprevApple doesn&#x27;t want third-party stores because it would cut into their profits.

Chances are Apple still has every right to charge a percentage of revenue as the licensing fee for usage of iOS APIs. reply wavemode 14 hours agorootparentAny regulation that requires allowing third-party stores, would be an anti-monopolistic move.

I am sure there must be some bad app stores out there, but the well known ones like F-Droid are probably better curated than Google&#x27;s own.Linux has always allowed third party repositories. Again, rarely a source of problems - again, there must be some bad things out there but the percentage of users affected is tiny. reply janc_ 11 hours agorootparentIn fact, F-Droid is infinitely better than Google&#x27;s own app store, where almost all apps contain spyware... reply Andrew_nenakhov 13 hours agorootparentprevIf you want to resist malware, Just don&#x27;t sideload apps and don&#x27;t install apps from third party app stores.Refusing other users the freedom to run the apps they want without Apple&#x27;s permission just because you might get mildly inconvenienced by it seems very immoral to me. reply realusername 15 hours agorootparentprev> One of the main draws of iOS is its resistance to malware, adware, and outright scam apps.Well no, the appstore is as full of scams, malware and adware as everywhere else.They managed somehow to convince people it&#x27;s a safe space though, not sure how but I consider it a bad thing since people are more likely to trust it blindly.> such as people at higher risks of being targeted by nation state actorshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;absher-%D8%A3%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B...The Saudi Arabian app to track what your wife is doing is still on the appstore, no need for a thirdparty store. reply elashri 13 hours agorootparent> The Saudi Arabian app to track what your wife is doing is still on the appstore, no need for a thirdparty store.While I usually don&#x27;t like the saudi system but this app in particular is about making it easy to manage official government paperwork online [1]. This applies for all residents (citizens or not) and people really like it. So it is not an app to track females movements. While you can disagree or agree on the male approval requirements for a female to travel (I disagree) but it is not like it tracks movements using GPS or any invasive data. It just make it easier to manage the permits and all other interactions with the government without having to drive long distances and wait in lines.Well as a complete outsider in another country who probably never went to Saudi Arabia like yourself, I would be more careful.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Absher_(application) reply realusername 13 hours agorootparentThe app is doing both purpose since they follow their local laws, you can also read the wikipedia entry on the impact on women.I&#x27;m open to some kind of argument like \"apple has no choice in such dictatorship\" but this argument is contradictory with the argument that its protecting from nation states.And since we mentioned Saudi arabia, we can also mention China where icloud is dodgy, it&#x27;s not a unique case. I&#x27;m sure they are others I don&#x27;t know about. reply elashri 13 hours agorootparentWell, I was just responding to your particular claim that this app is tracking \"what your wife is doing\". But unless the wife is exclusively moving by airplanes (so that the app will notify male guardian she entered airport) that&#x27;s is not tracking what wife is doing. It doesn&#x27;t give information about activities or locations like saying many other apps.This is one service among all other government interactions services that the app provide.

Even Android, which as you know is Linux, has closed binary blobs in its kernel tree.You can get away with that somewhat for devices like the SoC on the Raspberry Pi. But things get a lot more complex when half the stuff that makes your phone usable is closed hardware and firmware blobs.

For example the EU makes it mandatory that patents on standards are licensable to other parties. Granted that’s not exactly the same thing but it does illustrate how governments want competition. Or at least in the EU they do.The problem with binary blobs is entirely a corporate one. And frankly I don’t blame them for wanting to keep their products closed.

I want to be on the open web, not in some walled garden, no matter who owns it. reply lotsofpulp 12 hours agorootparentUnless those companies are stopping someone from visiting different domains, I would not describe that as the internet being siloed.The most popular destinations on the internet may be “siloed”, or most business will occur in the silos, but the internet itself is as accessible as it ever was. reply jacquesm 12 hours agorootparentThis makes no sense. These companies dictate what you see, when you see it and how you see it. They are just not throwing their weight around as much as they could yet. But if Google decides that your website no longer exists it effectively doesn&#x27;t exist any more. reply lotsofpulp 11 hours agorootparentI recall visiting websites before Google was even made. In any case, the internet does not only exist within Google’s search index.For example, I can post a URL in this comment, and you would be able to visit it, even if Google did not keep it in its search index.The only question is how much work do people want to do to spread knowledge of theirs or others’ website, and how much work do people want to do to find them.And it is much easier these days than even pre Google, since there are very capable alternatives to Google (and ubiquitous broadband). reply jacquesm 11 hours agorootparentGood luck with that. If Chrome won&#x27;t display it that&#x27;s that for 45% of your possible visitors. If the domain-without-a-tld doesn&#x27;t come up as the first link in your average browser that&#x27;s another 40% or so, if your ISP doesn&#x27;t like you or if your certificate is the wrong color (or your bits for that matter) then that&#x27;s the remainder. To compare the web as it is today with what went before is a bit silly because we have moved on from there and the party that controls your browser, your search, your income, your document store, your email and your phone may well be one and the same. replymortallywounded 16 hours agoprevSomething feels off... those apps don&#x27;t seem like 33K&#x2F;MRR worthy.

But these icons, names, and type of apps I typically associate with trash behaviour I wish was removed from the app store.

It tries to bait people in thinking \"oh it&#x27;s just $3.99\", and then forgetting and now paying $17&#x2F;month for a photo collage app.How is that predatory? It makes perfect sense to me and I’d probably do it myself if I ever were to sell an app this way. If someone just installs my app once, to make a single video, then immediately cancels, I still want to make some money off that.That’s probably how 90% of these apps are used. reply cfpg 13 hours agorootparentprevI agree, even the author aludes to this when refering to trials and how to cancel them. (text in parenthesis added by me)> One day before removal, we had 1209 active trials. (money in our pockets)> [...] established a help center with articles on canceling trials (cause we have a UI team dedicated on making it complicated) reply Aeolun 8 hours agorootparentCancelling anything on an Apple device cannot possibly be complicated. It’s a single screen in settings, and there’s nothing app developers can do to mess with that. reply mike_d 12 hours agorootparentprevI would bet that they got cancelled because of end user complaints directly to Apple and&#x2F;or chargebacks from credit card companies. reply benjaminwootton 12 hours agorootparentprevI find that a little harsh. The prices are clear, and you can either pass or remember to cancel. reply madeofpalk 14 hours agorootparentprevI think the most charitable thing you can say is this developer played with fire - engaging in scummy subscription pricing tactics - and got burnt. Neither App Store nor this developer played honourably. reply LeifCarrotson 14 hours agorootparentGot burnt, but only after pulling the average annual Chilean income every month for an unspecified amount of time. reply seanvelasco 15 hours agorootparentprevthis is exactly what i feel about most of the apps on the app store over the years, but i was never able to actually articulate it. very eloquently put! reply namanyayg 16 hours agoparentprevOne way apps get high MRR is by offering free trial for a small period, then charging for subscriptions laterThe user forgets about the subscriptions and ends up paying for a while before cancellingThis is probably what apple means by \"bait and switch\"Of course I can&#x27;t say if these app did this or not, I am just saying this is a common practice reply RajT88 15 hours agorootparent> I am just saying this is a common practiceThis is how AppleTV works. I assume Apple does this with other services too. reply ssijak 16 hours agorootparentprevthat is done by literally 80% of the paid apps. so I suspect that is not the banned behavior. it&#x27;s the same on the web, you sign up for a free trial but leave the CC reply natch 16 hours agorootparent“Everyone (80%) does it so it’s ok”That may be true but it may just be that Apple hates this but has trouble writing the right set of rules that don’t throw the baby out with the bath water.And then when they get the slightest excuse (the fake fake reviews yes double fake) then they take the opportunity to close the unpleasant account.Actually if 20% of the apps don’t do these scummy dark patterns, I’d just as soon see only those better apps in the store. reply mikepurvis 16 hours agorootparentprevI appreciate that you can cancel the subscription right away at the start of the trial and Apple and the vendor isn&#x27;t notified. reply newaccount74 14 hours agorootparentCurious that this doesn&#x27;t work for Apple services. If you cancel the free trial, you lose access immediately.I was a bit disappointed that they don&#x27;t live up to the standards they expect of 3rd party devs. reply SpaceManNabs 14 hours agorootparentprevThe developer might be scummy (very arguable tbh), but Apple being the arbitrator of what scummy bait and switch behavior is allowed is not acceptable.I don&#x27;t see apple going after gambling like behavior in freemium games as long as they get a 30% cut for example.If apple can&#x27;t enforce an ethical stance as a standard uniformly, then they aren&#x27;t being ethical. reply olliej 16 hours agorootparentprevbut remember the App Store review protects people from bait and switch! &#x2F;s reply Terretta 14 hours agoparentprev> some kind of manipulationThey tell you what kind of manipulation, in what they hastily tried to unwind when caught... a whole TODO list for scammy apps:\"Within 10 days, we updated each of the six applications: removed all rating requests, revised all payment screens in line with Apple&#x27;s recommendations, added Intercom for swift user assistance, established a help center with articles on canceling trials, requesting refunds, and implemented subscription management directly within the applications.\" reply slezyr 16 hours agoparentprevRussian guy saying that he is in Chile in the first sentence?

I know plenty of my colleagues migrated out of Russia to Germany, Israel, Turkey, and Greece following the war and started businesses there or continued already existing ones in a new locale. They wanted a new life for themselves, not under the rule of a crazed dictator. reply mm263 15 hours agorootparentprevThe company is liquidated, which means he doesn&#x27;t do business in Russia. Also, I love living in the world where doing business is suspicious because of my nationality. reply treprinum 15 hours agorootparentA former colleague was denied studying at Berkeley due to being Russian (they told him that). reply rchaud 14 hours agorootparentThe US consulate in Russia is closed since the war began -- getting a visa wouldnt be easy, and universities have to get DHS approval to issue an I-20 status document to a non-American. And that&#x27;s before any issues around eligibility for scholarships, bursaries or loans.As a foreign student myself, I would not risk trying to navigate the US visa process knowing my status could be jeopardized at any time. Berkeley isn&#x27;t the only university in the world worth attending. reply oleg_antonyan 15 hours agorootparentprev404 Such World Not Found The war only made this much worse, but essentially \"wrong nationality\" has always been a factor for banks&#x27; KYC, for example reply Aeolun 8 hours agorootparentprevIt was really weird to see someone ask me to implement fraud detection logic, think “This is gonna be hard” and then hear: “If postal code is x, it’s fraud, if not, let em through”.

Of course, you can say: &#x27;Well, he is Russian, so it is more likely that he does that, so it is fair to treat him with more suspicion.&#x27;And you know what? Some other people might say: &#x27;Well, this guy is black, and black guys are more likely to commit crimes, so it makes sense if we follow him around the store to make sure that he doesn&#x27;t steal anything.&#x27; And some other people might say: &#x27;Well, he looks like he might be a Muslim, and radical Islamists are more likely to be terrorists, so it is fair that we select him for some additional screening at the airport.&#x27;Would you agree with all those people as well?

This kind of thing usually happens when you learn a language by pasting together tutorials and stackoverflow answers, and therefore don't know some easier/simpler way to do it.

Don't know why its needed here though. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]loptr 1 point2 points3 points 11 hours ago (0 children) Yeah, absolutely, I understand the normal application of it, but since it's not a deep copy/clone, it doesn't make any difference (to my knowledge). And if it was a deep copy then the reference to the node in the DOM would be severed so manipulating it wouldn't affect any of the elements on the page, so that aspect wouldn't be desirable anyway. XD And as u/intramatic, pointed out using document.querySelector() would yield the first item directly, so would have been the most straightforward choice. I'm not really criticizing or anything, my guess is that the function might have started out with handling all occurrences and was then trimmed down to its bare minimum without refactoring. But when it comes to JavaScript there are so many odd little behaviors and tricks that it's worth asking to see if there's a nugget of knowledge I've missed before, or if it's just a happenstance/result of quick and dirty coding. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]londons_explorer 1 point2 points3 points 11 hours ago (2 children) NodeLists are super annoying.

This was and continues to be a thing with Twitch. They made streams unplayable without ads. There happened to be a workaround with the pop-out video player that would give you an ad-free 480p stream. Once that got popular after they finally banned adblockers, it took them a few weeks but eventually the extension that auto-detected and auto-opened the pop-out player is broken. It is almost impossible to get around ads on Twitch anymore. I noticed someone asked if this technique would work on Twitch ads, and I have a feeling the answer is no. They did a lot of work on their CDN/video player to ensure the ad MUST play before it will start the stream. New workaround pop up but they are sniped pretty quick by Twitch. That said, we need people like you to keep the pressure on these companies that we're not just going to bow down to their will. There are plenty of other ways they could have gone about this. I will never pay for Youtube Premium, the only way is if it was like $3/month for zero ads.

I couldn't scrub off the habit of clicking the Twitch icon in my bookmarks every so often just yet (talk about an addiction lol), but then the first ad shows up and I immediately close the tab and move on to somewhere else. My watchtime has gone down, dramatically, and the sole reason for this is ads. My brain just rewired itself to close tabs whenever an ad appears, to the point that on the rare occasion I'm actually sticking around on a stream, the streamer will eventually run some ads and I'll close the tab only to tell myself, after the fact: \"hey, I was watching that!\" I refuse to believe I'm an outlier. And I think if YouTube really starts agressively fighting back adblockers they'll kill their own platform. Their ad program is already so much more invasive than twitch's (streamers have options I think, and outside the automatic roll of ads whenever you check in, you can go up to 1 hour of watchtime without a single ad), the non-adblocked YT experience is a million billion times worse. Ads before, inside and after a fucking 8 minutes video. Double ads. Fucking 4-minute ads on the mobile version that prevent you from just falling asleep to whatever video you put on because HERE'S 4 MINUTES OF SOME RANDOM MF PLAYING RAID SHADOW LEGENDS.

If reddit people are my friends then yes, everyone I know uses an adblocker. But I wonder sometimes why advertisers waste their money until I remember that probably <1% of the population uses an adblocker. Which then begs the question of why are corporations this greedy? How much are they really missing out on? I mean the type of people who block ads aren't the type that are ever going to click on one anyway so they're just squeezing impression revenue out of every orifice. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]CaspianRoach 6 points7 points8 points 19 hours ago (2 children) seems that almost everyone just wants to block/skip them? You're right, it seems that way. Because you're a more advanced user than the regular user and browse reddit about such topics, it will naturally feel to you that everything is on fire regarding youtube ads. Most, MOST, the vast majority of people just do not care about them. They do not have an adblocker, they never cared to get one, and they don't even know that it's an option. They will just watch the ads, as people before them watched ads on television and don't think twice about them. The ads still work perfectly fine, you're just not the number one target audience. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]Septem_151 1 point2 points3 points 7 hours ago (1 child) That blows my mind.

Many of them do not even fully understand their own tools, not to mention learning or just understanding other technologies.

I ignored it for months until I watched one by accident. And boy did I discovered it was in fact a brilliant channel with probably one of the most impressive animation and music on YouTube, an incredible narrator, one of the rare YouTube channels which provides links to studies for anything sentence they say and all of this full of poetry. Also a very non intrusive business model with pertinents sponsorships at the end of the videos and their own merchandise marketplace with actually nice items and artwork to buy.The even sadder thing is that their thumbnails are in fact pretty good but they mostly suffered from the fact that my brain is now programmed to avoid anything catchy. reply brandnewideas 31 minutes agorootparentIgnoring the fact that KURZGESAGT is a blatant propaganda conduit, the art-style they use in their animations is so flat and devoid of any personality at all, I&#x27;m actively repulsed by it. reply pjerem 21 minutes agorootparentI’m open to debate but propaganda for what exactly ?There was only one of their video I felt awkward was their video about the fact we will tackle climate change, I felt like they were I little too techno optimistic.

To work normally, the interface and external clock both needed to be set to the same thing (say, 48 or 192 kHz, or whatever you wanted). We quickly discovered that if the interface was set lower than the clock, any audio playback would be sped up and high pitch (and vice versa) -- not only playback from the DAW, but from anything, even YouTube videos and so forth. And of course the a&#x2F;v sync was maintained, so the picture would also be sped up to match.I wonder if this effect could be completely virtualized as an audio driver, where you choose this middleware as the default output device in the OS, and it messes with the audio clock speed: essentially overclocking the upstream (OS) side whenever an ad is detected, and dropping samples (basically a rudimentary sample rate conversion) proportionately so the downstream (hardware) side never skips a beat. I don&#x27;t know how an extension&#x2F;userscript would be able to communicate with said middleware, but maybe there&#x27;s a way.Aside: I wonder what would happen with live streams. Probably just periodic buffering, not from congestion but from the analog to digital conversion consuming the stream faster than it&#x27;s being created. Theoretically a very miniscule version of this problem always occurs if the DAC on the production side is running slightly lower clock speed (say, 47999 Hz) than the ADC on the consumer side (say, 48001 Hz) and the player knows how to gracefully compensate to avoid occasional buffering (or buffering does occur but it&#x27;s too brief for anyone to notice).

What they performed on the on-demand video market was a form of predatory dumping, and when all the competition was gone they used that position as well as other positions to extract \"value\" and cash out. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;p&#x2F;predatorydumping.asp reply orhmeh09 6 hours agorootparentprevI have been required to use YouTube for school and for work reply malnourish 6 hours agorootparentprevI watch maybe, maybe one YouTube video per month on average.

The hardest one to cut out is Google Maps, which doesn&#x27;t have an ad free option.Anyway, the value they receive is incidental: if I like content, I&#x27;ll tell my friends about it. Not all of my friends dislike ads. I \"market\" the content via word of mouth. The content markets the subscriptions. Or the ads. Either one.If I stop watching the content entirely (due to it becoming harder to discover) then fewer of my friends know about it. So it&#x27;s not quite as black and white as you want it to be.

No such thing happens. No money changes hands, there is no transaction.What does happen, is I make a request, and Google sends some bits to me over the Internet for free, and then those bits are sitting on my PC, and my PC is my property. I have the right to do whatever I want with my property and the bits on it. If I want to transform the bits in some way, render video from some of them and not from others, all on my PC in my own home, then I can. With a few exceptions, courts have upheld that general right. Ad blocking isn&#x27;t illegal, circumventing their anti-ad blocking isn&#x27;t illegal, and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with a \"trade\" because there wasn&#x27;t one, Google just sends some bits for free to anyone who asks the right way.Now Google can of course choose to refuse service to me for any reason they want. They can make their anti-ad blocking more sophisticated. That&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;ll use a competitor in that case, and we need to make sure the government enforces the antitrust laws on the books so that there&#x27;s more competition against Google anyway. Whether YouTube is a criminal monopoly or not is currently up for debate, probably the answer is yes.At any rate your understanding of the relationship is legally and morally flawed. You claim there is a trade between me and a probably criminal organization, where in fact there is none. On the other hand my right to control my property is one of the most fundamental rights out there. You better believe Google feels that way about their property and spends billions to protect&#x2F;expand their own property rights!So I am confused as to why you want Google to have property rights, but not the rest of us.But hey, \"You will own nothing and be happy,\" right? We&#x27;re all really just renting our hardware I guess? It&#x27;s 2023 and the concept of us little peons owning and controlling anything is obsolete, just do what Master says right?BTW, FWIW my property rights are inalienable. I possess these rights because I was born a human, yes they are also upheld in the US Constitution, UN Declaration on Human rights etc. While government has mostly upheld them they don&#x27;t come from government, they come from us being born human, so even if a government said what I was doing was illegal, it would be moral to ignore that government, resist and do it anyway. What&#x27;s crazy to me is that people seem to be OK with handwaving away a basic human right just so that a corporation can make more profit off of entertainment content. reply Jensson 7 hours agorootparent> I have the right to do whatever I want with my property and the bits on itThat is false. You might think that you should have that right, but you don&#x27;t. reply oaththrowaway 6 hours agorootparentCome and take it replyoaththrowaway 9 hours agorootparentprevIf it has no value then why don&#x27;t they stop? reply Jensson 9 hours agorootparentBecause they show ads to people. Do you think they should stop collecting your data just because you block their ads? I don&#x27;t see why that would make any sense, they have no reason to incentivize ad block use. reply oaththrowaway 8 hours agorootparentBut even if I pay them, they still collect my data. I lose either way. I&#x27;ll pick the way that is better for me in that situation reply Jensson 8 hours agorootparentBut that isn&#x27;t a fair trade, you argued that your data is worth enough to them that you should be allowed to use their server resources without anything extra from you. But that isn&#x27;t true, every user like you costs them much more money than they earn.In such a situation where one part pays for the other parts benefits, you should expect the part that just loses out to try to end the trade. And that is what we see happening here, youtube tries to block you since youtube doesn&#x27;t want you as a user, since you lose them money. reply oaththrowaway 8 hours agorootparentNo, you argued that my data wasn&#x27;t worth anything. I argued that if it wasn&#x27;t they wouldn&#x27;t desperately try and get all my credit, medical, schooling, and browsing history.What they do is incredibly immoral and despicable. There is no opt-out (even if I pay them money). Even if I never use their services they still try to vacuum up all my data.Me watching a few YouTube videos a week is a better deal for them than it is for me. reply Jensson 8 hours agorootparent> you argued that my data wasn&#x27;t worth anythingIf you block all their ads. They get your data since they intend to display ads to you. I said that in the first post, did you miss that? reply oaththrowaway 8 hours agorootparentSo why are they spying on me when I still pay them? Or are you going to still pretend that hasn&#x27;t been brought up 3 times now? Or that there is no opt out for their other tracking? reply Jensson 7 hours agorootparent> So why are they spying on me when I still pay themSince you pay them you have an account and is logged in. They do use the data they have collected about you to serve you targeted videos even if they don&#x27;t serve you targeted ads, they say that in their privacy policy document. Targeted videos are for your convenience.If you don&#x27;t want it to target videos to you you can disable all that data collection here, at least I can (Not sure if you can outside of EU):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myaccount.google.com&#x2F;yourdata&#x2F;youtubeSo go and disable all that if you feel their video targeting isn&#x27;t worth collecting your data, but there is no way for them to target videos without having any data about you. reply oaththrowaway 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t want targeted videos. I don&#x27;t even want them to know I exist. Even if I never used YouTube, that is impossible.Their tracking is all encompassing and invasive, even without a Google account. They are a menace to the world and it should be an obligation to block their ads. If Google disappeared tomorrow the world would be better off. reply Jensson 7 hours agorootparentSounds like the issue is completely different then from what you brought up in your original post. You just hate Google and want to hurt them as much as possible, so then it makes sense for you to block them and consume their resources as much as possible. Thanks, that explains your position much better, why didn&#x27;t you just say that from the start instead of beating around the bush for so long? reply oaththrowaway 6 hours agorootparentNothing I just said is inconsistent with what I posted earlier.

This gives me two (slightly) different views into what the Youtube algorithm wants me to see, based on what I happen to watch on each machine. I occasionally reset cookies on the logged out machine.I definitely avoid watching ads, except the non-national spots on local TV where I kinda like the local city flavor of the ads. Is that grifting? I dunno. The ads are still there in aggregate, I just won&#x27;t give them my brain space.

I don&#x27;t have to tell myself anything to know that blocking ads is the ethical thing to do. They are already a moral perversion.Edit:I kind of consider it disgusting that watching a video is considered by anybody to be \"payment\", or that anybody legitimately believes it&#x27;s somebody&#x27;s duty to watch an advertisement. The worship of abusive corporations in our culture has gotten insane.You already aren&#x27;t understanding us when you come in believing that we&#x27;re convincing ourselves of anything. We actually do have an ethical and moral map that is consistent with blocking ads, and we don&#x27;t consider not watching a commercial to be the same thing as theft, or even to be morally questionable. reply ffgjgf1 1 hour agorootparentprev> that is fraud.I don’t think that true.

That&#x27;s why you never see ads for good products that you would actually want to buy – because people who buy those kind of products make informed purchases by comparing price, features and quality.We could dream of an internet where companies would advertise their products on relevant videos and be done with that, but they probably won&#x27;t increase sales that way. Because the audience would buy their product anyway if it fit their needs.In 2023 there are two methods of marketing:Method 1 is competing on price, features and quality. Customers will buy your product if it fits their wants and their budget.Method 2 is advertising, where the product itself has little to no influence on sales. Certain groups of people will buy your product because you&#x27;ve made them feel they should. reply sanswork 4 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s more likely that you are just a standard consumer that doesn&#x27;t recognise non-obvious advertising than you only buy products that don&#x27;t advertise.How do you or the people doing the comparisons you read know the product exists without advertising? reply lp0_on_fire 7 hours agoparentprev> Forcing someone to watch your ad most likely triggers negative connotations about your brand.I will give up driving before ever purchasing anything from Liberty Mutual and I caution everyone who will listen that they are a shitty company who will grift you for your last cent precisely because of this.

Everything gets post processed sanitized on the final disaply layer with no interaction to the outside. reply jlokier 10 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not the endgame.Eventually each ad has an embedded AI that must be run to see the content after the ad. That AI evaluates whether there&#x27;s a human who looks and behaves like you watching the ad. The endgame requires your AI to do a convincing impression of you to the ad AI, and to hide other signals that would reveal you doing something else, like the sound of a flushing toilet.When your AI is pushed by more advanced ad AI to be very convincing, it has to start purchasing things occasionally, just like a typical human. It occasionally buys the things in the ads, the way humans are expected to, to avoid revealing it&#x27;s not you.This spirals out of control when your AI has to buy more things than a human would, because the ad AIs co-evolve with your AI to expect that.

Technically the browser is pulling chunks of video from their servers, and the ad content is pulled from different servers which ad blockers restrict. If the ad chunks weren&#x27;t identifiable, there would be no practical way of blocking them. It&#x27;d be like removing commercials - or those in-video sponsorship segments - from a live broadcast.It seems YouTube is creating an arms race with ad blockers and alienating users by threatening bans than simply changing the way the ads are served. Yes, there&#x27;s a whole industry around bidding for, dynamically serving and tracking ads using VAST and all that, but I&#x27;m positive Google has the market power to change that. reply xeckr 10 hours agoparentHere&#x27;s a way to counter your proposal:- Fetch the video multiple times- Cut out the non-overlapping segments from the video shown to the user.This assumes that a different ad is shown every time.

Presumably, YouTube can make more from personalized ads. However, if they embedded these ads in the main video stream caching would be more challenging. reply krackers 8 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s referring to actually baking in the ads into the video stream, but rather just having video URLs transparently redirect to ad content.So for instance, if normally the first 100 bytes of the video (as fetched via yt-dl) are like \"googlevideo.com&#x2F;gibberish-id?signature&rage=0-100\", then you could transparently insert an ad into the next 100 bytes by making \"googlevideo.com&#x2F;gibberish-id?signature&rage=100-200\" return the ad. Of course this makes the serving logic much more complicated, so it&#x27;s probably why they don&#x27;t do it. You&#x27;d also have to appropriately cut on a keyframe, muck around with muxing so things splice properly, and so on.Another possibility to enforce that ads are seen (or at least things are appropriately delayed) is to simply only return video URLs if there was a \"pingback\" that an ad was seen. So if you serve a 10 sec ad, but the user requests a video URL before the 10 seconds are up, just reject it. This requires a bit more logic on the serving end to track state, but is easier than the previous proposal. reply monkeywork 11 hours agoparentprevThere is an entire ecosystem built up around youtube timecodes as bookmarks.

There must be some internal engineering reason(s) behind it. reply city41 9 hours agorootparentOne small reason is they use ads as \"payment\" for things. Scrubbing through a video looking for a certain spot will require you to watch an ad almost every time you stop scrubbing. They also make you watch an ad if you pause the video for too long. When you unpause it, it immediately jumps into an ad.

    "originBody": "Public Sector 14 US govt pays AT&T to let cops search Americans' phone records – 'usually' without a warrant 14 At least get a court order before mining Hemisphere Project data, says Senator Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Wed 22 Nov 2023 // 01:35 UTC A senator has complained that American law enforcement agencies snoop on US citizens and residents, seemingly without regard for the privacy provisions of the Fourth Amendment, under a secret program called the Hemisphere Project that allows police to conduct searches of trillions of phone records. According to Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), these searches \"usually\" happen without warrants. And after more than a decade of keeping people — lawmakers included — in the dark about Hemisphere, Wyden wants the Justice Department to reveal information about what he called a \"long-running dragnet surveillance program.\" \"I have serious concerns about the legality of this surveillance program, and the materials provided by the DoJ contain troubling information that would justifiably outrage many Americans and other members of Congress,\" Wyden wrote in a letter [PDF] to US Attorney General Merrick Garland. Under Hemisphere, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) pays telco AT&T to provide all federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies with the ability to request searches of trillions of domestic phone records dating back to at least 1987, plus the four billion call records added every day. We are required by law to comply with subpoenas, warrants and court orders from government and law enforcement AT&T declined to answer any specific questions about Hemisphere, but a spokesperson told The Register: \"To be clear, any information referred to in Senator Wyden's letter would be compelled by subpoena, warrant, or court order.\" \"We defer to the Justice Department, to whom Senator Wyden's letter is addressed, for comment,\" the AT&T spokesperson said. \"Like all companies, we are required by law to comply with subpoenas, warrants and court orders from government and law enforcement agencies.\" According to Wyden, federal and state law enforcement agencies can request a Hemisphere search with a subpoena — but many law enforcement agencies can issue these themselves. Additionally, any law enforcement agency across the country can request access to these searches, and they aren't limited to drug-related investigations, according to the Oregon senator. Hemisphere first came to light in a 2013 New York Times report that alleged the \"scale and longevity of the data storage appears to be unmatched by other government programs, including the NSA's gathering of phone call logs under the Patriot Act.\" It's not classified, but that doesn't mean the Feds want you to see it Privacy advocates including the Electronic Frontier Foundations have filed Freedom of Information Act and state-level public records lawsuits to learn more about the secret snooping program. Few have made a dent: it appears that the Feds are doing everything they can to keep Hemisphere secret. Although the program and its documents are not classified, the Justice Department has marked them as \"Law Enforcement Sensitive,\" meaning their disclosure could hurt ongoing investigations. This designation also prevents the documents from being publicly released. Senator Wyden wants the designation removed. Additionally, Hemisphere is not subject to a federal Privacy Impact Assessment due to its funding structure, it's claimed. The White House doesn't directly pay AT&T - instead the ONDCP provides a grant to the Houston High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, which is a partnership between federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. And this partnership, in turn, pays AT&T to operate this surveillance scheme. In Wyden's letter, he quotes a law enforcement official who described Hemisphere as \"AT&T's Super Search Engine\" and \"Google on Steroids.\" He also cites ONDCP slides and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) emails disclosing that AT&T searches records kept by its wholesale division, which carries communications on behalf of other telecom companies and their customers. Uncle Sam snooping on US folks? Not without a warrant, lawmakers agree US Commerce Dept pinky swears it won't push American spyware on world-plus-dog Google, Amazon, Microsoft make the Mozilla naughty list for Christmas shopping Your ex isn't the only one stalking your social media posts. The Feds are, too Another ONDCP document purportedly states that Hemisphere \"can be used to identify alternate numbers used by a target, obtain location data and 'two levels of call detail records for one target number'.” That provision means Hemisphere searches can pull in phone records of everyone who communicated with the target of an investigation. In other words: there's some serious snooping happening. This letter to DOJ comes as Wyden and other lawmakers from both parties, in the US Senate and House of Representatives, have introduced the Government Surveillance Reform Act, which would, among other things, require an independent court order before allowing surveillance of Americans' phone records. ® Sponsored: Maintaining a state of readiness to deal with cyber attacks Share More about Government Privacy Surveillance More like these × More about Government Privacy Surveillance Narrower topics cookies Federal government of the United States Government of the United Kingdom Insider Trading NSO Group Privacy Sandbox Broader topics Sector Security More about Share 14 COMMENTS More about Government Privacy Surveillance More like these × More about Government Privacy Surveillance Narrower topics cookies Federal government of the United States Government of the United Kingdom Insider Trading NSO Group Privacy Sandbox Broader topics Sector Security TIP US OFF Send us news",

Most of the rich and famous don&#x27;t have phone numbers, or even mailing addresses. They have companies that in turn manage their devices and properties, usually run through a \"family office\" of attorneys and accountants. So the NSA will have a list of numbers associated with their production company or family law firm, which would require further human investigation to determine which was actually in a person&#x27;s pocket day to day.Politicians have started adopting such structures too. House Speaker Mike Johnson famously has no bank account. He does, just not under his name. It would be managed by his family office. reply landemva 12 hours agorootparentI worked for telcos, and the rich & famous & royalty typically had their accounts restricted from access by regular CSRs. I know there were restrictions built into the internal systems, though it didn&#x27;t apply to my role.Now the elite use Telegram groups, Signal, and rotate SIM cards. Everybody should be doing life this way, so the telcos become dumb data pipes. reply ajb 13 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think this is close to universal among rich and famous, although no doubt you are correct about some. For one thing there is a principal agent problem in giving this kind of personal service company control over all your comms. Big impersonal companies can be more relied on to treat everyone the same. Many famous people will just sign up under a pseudonym.Family offices are also an artifact of generational wealth. Plenty of famous people aren&#x27;t rich enough for something that heavily staffed. Also newly wealthy will often want to be able to deal with existing friends and family on the same basis as before.Indirectly, I&#x27;ve been able to observe some of the habits of someone with stratospheric levels of wealth. They had a phone number, but changed it frequently. reply raincom 8 hours agorootparentprevIn some respects, uber wealthy and street&#x2F;cyber savvy criminals act same: use intermediaries, use cash, use trusts incorporated in states&#x2F;places, where it is hard to trace beneficiaries, burner phones bought with cash, by intermediaries, frequent change of phones, no trace of their names on data brokers, consultants who help get rid of any trace in data brokers, etc. reply altcognito 18 hours agorootparentprevThe rich and powerful always have ways of protecting themselves.

The easiest way is if they get caught violating policy.

Same in the military, except the military doesn’t have to deal with civilian courts and shit rolls down hill more explicitly. reply jonathankoren 7 hours agorootparentCops are almost never fired. Placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation? While the press is in a tizzy? Sure. Fired? No. Almost all cops found in violation of policies win on internal appeal. Even in the extremely rare case when they are fired, they’re rehired in a neighboring jurisdiction post haste.The courts? PUH-LEASE! Prosecutors never prosecute. Even if they go to a grand jury, they end up instructing the grand jury to pass a no-bill (i.e. not enough evidence of a crime), thus letting them was their hands and say, “Gosh! The jury didn’t indict. Can’t do anything,” when in actually grand juries indict everyone. (When I was on a federal grand jury, the AUSA told us that if we were going to pass a no-bill, to tell him so he could bring more evidence (a legitimate ask) and told us that a no-bill would result the a call to him, and his boss, from the Attorney General himself.) Then of course there’s qualified immunity and case law that is overly differential to police actions — even when they violate procedure.It’s bullshit. Cops are completely unaccountable.

It might seem extremely unlikely for someone inconsequential like, let&#x27;s be honest, many of us here to come to the attention of a national body; but history shows that all it takes is being affiliated with a group or movement that makes the federal government nervous to become the subject of FBI scrutiny, and this likelihood is heightened the easier surveillance becomes. reply tagyro 16 hours agoprevMore info about Hemisphere on the EFF website @ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;cases&#x2F;hemisphere reply rsingel 15 hours agoparentAlso a reminder that AT&T has long done more than just collect records and let the feds have them.They&#x27;ve been data-mining them to create community maps and maybe even your historical location.They&#x27;ve done so for decades and in the early 2000s even invented their own programming language to do it.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20170129095532&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired... reply maerF0x0 13 hours agoprev> Few have made a dent: it appears that the Feds are doing everything they can to keep Hemisphere secret.This to me is the most concerning part.

It sounds nice in theory, but the inevitable result in practice has been total immunity for all lawbreaking, because of a compliant court system which sets the bar for \"should have known it was illegal\" to be impossibly high. Maybe at one point before we knew this it was possible to argue for QI in good faith, but now we empirically know it&#x27;s an unworkable standard and should be scrapped.Besides, civilians get the \"ignorantia juris non excusat\" [0] principle, and the rule of law means that everybody, including government officials and law enforcement, should be held to the same standard.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ignorantia_juris_non_excusat reply doublerabbit 17 hours agorootparentprevWhy not both? reply JumpCrisscross 17 hours agorootparent> Why not both?Because if I do what my boss told me to do, what has been done for ages without consequence, and you’re going to pass a law putting me in jail for it, I will expend every effort to thwart it. If, on the other hand, you’re saying “stop it,” my give-a-shit factor is lower.The broader public is indifferent about the Fourth Amendment. Polling and elections and listening to phone calls from constituents shows this. Activating a concentrated mass of political energy against yourself, in this context, is not a bright idea.Also, it’s wild how cavalierly we’re willing to contemplate taking away someone’s freedoms in a conversation about other freedoms. reply godelski 14 hours agorootparent> Because if I do what my boss told me to doBecause we have explicit laws set up that already say this isn&#x27;t an excuse. If your boss tells you to rob his neighbor, that won&#x27;t save you. If your boss tells you to drive drunk you&#x27;ll still get arrested for drunk driving. The agency is yours. The question is if a reasonable person would know this a violation of the fourth amendment and I&#x27;m pretty confident the answer is definitively yes. And we&#x27;re talking about cops, who are trained professionals. Who are supposed to be trained in the law. They should know more than a reasonable person.> The broader public is indifferent about the Fourth Amendment.You&#x27;re confused. The broader public is jaded. They&#x27;ve given up hope after decades of abuse. Losing hope is not the same as being indifferent. Even ambivalent would be a better word but I&#x27;d still say jaded. We&#x27;re tired. We&#x27;re exhausted. Depressed. Worn out. But not indifferent. reply JoeAltmaier 16 hours agorootparentprevThis was supposed to be an important freedom; a pivotal one in fact. It deserves more protection than \"oopsie! Ok we promise to stop violating the rights of untold thousands\".I think it shows considerable restraint, to ask for the incarceration of a handful of offenders, compared to the flagrant abuse of the rest of everybody. reply JumpCrisscross 16 hours agorootparent> was supposed to be an important freedomIt is. But that’s not how voters see it. Electorally, pushing for incarceration is a few steps behind “defund the police.” reply some_furry 16 hours agorootparentprev> Also, it’s wild how cavalierly we’re willing to contemplate taking away someone’s freedoms in a conversation about other freedoms.When someone abuses power and privilege in order to take away freedoms from the powerless, the powerless wanting to take away the freedoms of the powerful is to be expected.Even if you take this one capability away from the privileged and powerful, they will remain privileged and powerful. They&#x27;ve demonstrated a willingness to abuse their position to hurt others.In contrast with removing only one capability from their arsenal, it would be better if the abusers would also be stripped of their power and privilege for having abused one of said powers and privileges.That doesn&#x27;t necessarily require incarceration, logically speaking. Sure, the wounded may feel better if it did, but the goal of policy in this situation isn&#x27;t to please. But at least the individuals who violated constitutional rights are no longer trustworthy. reply JumpCrisscross 16 hours agorootparent> Even if you take this one capability away from the privileged and powerful, they will remain privileged and powerfulI’m all for firing the people and banning them from public service. I just don’t see the benefit of putting them in jail. From their perspective, what they’re doing is legal. Moreover, it’s deeply precedented.And again, it’s a false economy.

But, are they compelled by law to keep 40 years’ worth of call records, and not only keep them but in an easily indexed manner?If they aren’t, then clearly there is something going on. Those records probably aren’t that cheap to keep around, compared to not keeping them around.

This has much wider applicability than the drug investigation mandate: e.g. you could use such capability to identify who is meeting with which investigative journalist. reply rollcat 18 hours agorootparentI think most privacy-conscious people have a pretty good idea about how to maintain proper private key hygiene (key should never leave the device, use FDE + a passphrase or a hardware token, etc). But we&#x27;ve been leaking metadata (such as mail headers) left and right ever since PGP was a hot new thing, something which should&#x27;ve been our primary concern no later than since Snowden&#x2F;2013.It would be good to have a proper field guide written down, that&#x27;s a little more in-depth than \"leave your phone at home\", weighing risks vs convenience, going into detail on what kinds of metadata you might be leaking, etc. Most of us have some rough idea but it isn&#x27;t at all obvious the way we know \"MD5 is broken\". reply upofadown 17 hours agorootparentprevAT&T would know where you are from connections to the towers.

I&#x27;ve opted for porting my phone number to JMP.chat which does offer E2EE. However, the recipient must also have an encrypted Jabber account. reply badrabbit 18 hours agorootparentprevIs that why Signal collects your phone number? Hah.Any E2E app that doesn&#x27;t collect your phone number or any identifiable info that you can use as a standalone app on the desktop and E2EE is the only way it works (not optional or opportunistic like jabber&#x2F;xmpp, whatsapp, matrix, telegram,etc...) and is developed ouside the US by a well known&#x2F;reputed dev(s). Is what I recommed.Check out wire and briar if they meet these requirements. Personally, I would not use digital media if I don&#x27;t want the US gov knowing about it entirely. The solution is legislative not technical. Kind of like how you get a free TSA body massage at the airport, the people have willed it. reply woodruffw 18 hours agorootparent“End-to-end encrypted” and “private identity mapping” are orthogonal properties: a chat system can have both, but doing so is significantly harder (both in terms of engineering complexity and teaching users to operate the system safely).Signal chooses (or more accurately chose, since they’re working on eliminating it) to depend on telephone numbers for identity mapping, which was and is a reasonable design constraint given their target audience. reply throw10920 18 hours agorootparent> which was and is a reasonable design constraint given their target audienceWho do you think their target audience is, and why do you think that this a reasonable constraint? reply woodruffw 17 hours agorootparentNon-technical users, including people who don’t know what “end-to-end encryption” means.

Parsimony is a significant virtue in E2EE designs.But for those users: you can effectively use Signal without a phone number by using a virtual number or similar for the one-time registration process. That’s clunky and not ideal, but IMO is a reasonable hurdle for “bonsai” users. reply badrabbit 14 hours agorootparentprevAnd those people assume their phone number will not be revealed to random contacts and their contacts! A phone number on its own is PII! It is in some contexts more dangerous than knowing your drivers license or social security number.What utter deception! And why i distrust signal even more! The entire world uses whatsapp which has its own identifiers as do most messaging apps. Signal deviated and went out of its way to collect the one piece of information even more identifying than your full name and address! Lol reply woodruffw 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know anybody who thinks this. If you use a standard population distribution: it&#x27;s safe to assume a slight majority of Signal&#x27;s user base remembers when phone numbers were publicly accessible through printed phone books. Contact sharing is a substantially less problematic subset of that. reply badrabbit 14 hours agorootparentBut when you use any messaging app they show your nick (and signal lets you set your name), the natural assumption which I too had was that phone numbers are used for sms only to invite others but on singal my name&#x2F;nick is used like whatsapp, viber,etc..> Contact sharing is a substantially less problematic subset of that.HN rate limits me so please look at other comments i made on this thread about why this is decidedly more dangerous than just about any insecurity you know about. Nothing is more dangerous than false security especially when most people don&#x27;t think in detail about security, they just assume signal will take care of it. I have an example about sources being revealed when a journalist&#x27;s phone is compromised (many more examples).For the general population, are you saying man in the middle attacks are of a greater risk than the other person&#x27;s phone being compromised? Because if so I would strongly disagree with that and can provide sources to back that up (but save me time and look into all the pegasus pwnages and mobile stealers). In which case, in the threat model that matters most to the general polulation, signal compromised by sharing the one piece of information that is so good at identifying people it is the most popular anti-fraud identifier: phone numbers!My trust in it is even lesser by how everyone rallies in defense of signal and downvotes any critique of it like with this thread. Be wary of crap you&#x27;re not allowed to question! reply woodruffw 13 hours agorootparent> the natural assumption which I too had was that phone numbers are used for sms only to invite others but on singal my name&#x2F;nick is used like whatsapp, viber,etc..I don&#x27;t know about Viber, but this isn&#x27;t true for WhatsApp. If someone sends you a message on WhatsApp, you can see their phone number.Again: the overwhelming threat model is here is \"two individuals that already know each other want to communicate privately.\" That&#x27;s what Signal facilitates, and it does so pretty well given the purity compromises that need to happen to do that for non-technical users. They&#x27;re not worried about leaking phone numbers, because they&#x27;re already shared.Finally: there&#x27;s a good chance you being downvoted here because (1) these comments are indistinguishable from FUD, and (2) you&#x27;re making claims (and now talking about examples) without citing them. I&#x27;ll lead by example here: we know that the FBI can only retrieve minimal metadata from Signal[1], and various foreign intelligence services have more luck deploying malware to phones[2] than they do actually breaking anything about Signal&#x27;s design. Nation state adversaries don&#x27;t have trouble finding peoples&#x27; phone numbers.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;therecord.media&#x2F;fbi-document-shows-what-data-can-be-...[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-cia-didnt-break-sign... replybarsonme 18 hours agorootparentprevTheir target audience is literally the general population. It should be obvious why phone numbers are a reasonable constraint. reply badrabbit 14 hours agorootparentNo, that&#x27;s the deception of signal. The general population is already using other identifiers like whatsapp and viber numbers (which almost every country outside the US use even more than sms). Signal refuses to opt-out of phone number collection and usage. With the tens of millions at their disposal and with the time they spend on mobile payments, crypto,etc... you are telling me they can&#x27;t auto-generate identifiers as alternative to phone numbers? They can&#x27;t make it alphanumeric and consider any id that is all numbers a phone?It&#x27;s all culting around tech&#x2F;crypto personalities and ignoring the obvious things that don&#x27;t pass the smell test.Explain to me why Signal is special as opposed to more popular apps made for the general population that also do E2EE? Explain to me specifically why phone numbers and mobile usage is not optional? Even after like a decade of people begging for it?This is a lot like PGP email, the same circles of people promoted it (still do in some cases) but the government loves it because email metadata is unencrypted and tech circles insist on email dependency on every app because of the same cult mindset even though hostile middle parties love it. Everything I do in amazon, netflix, uber, slack you name it you can tell my whole life pattern just looking at email subjecte in the clear on an MTA! All because of tech sector refusal to apply critical thinking and creativity when it comes to these things.So again I ask, if I am allowed to criticaly examine Signal: why is it special and unique that it needs phone numbers no matter what? Especially given device compromise of people you talk to is not in their threat model. e.g.: you are a source and the journalist&#x27;s phone is compromised, that is exactly what governments do! If signal didn&#x27;t collect phone numbers all they would see on the journalist&#x27;s phone would be your nick or in-app id, but thanks to signal they can find out who the source is, and using exploit kits like pegasus this way is not uncommon! Real people are put in danger by signal.Look at all my downvotes and tell me this is not tech sector conspiracy or at best culting after personalities. reply badrabbit 14 hours agorootparentprevBullshit! When you compromise the phone of someone you find out the phone numbers of everyone they talked to. I won&#x27;t even get into how signal can abuse this willingly or against their will.Signal is no better than just using imessage or whatsapp. The terribly deceptive thing about it is that it is marketed as a super secure messaging app better than alternatives but in the most important way that matters: not crypto but metadata and plausible deniability it makes such compromises. Explain to me why signal on the desktop can&#x27;t function without a mobile app?! Governments have complete control over mobile phone infrastructure and can perform targeted compromises by using signal contacts for target selection.Do not use signal thinking it will protect you better than any other encrypted app. Governments and private partires are not out there cracking the crypto itself. reply woodruffw 14 hours agorootparentDo you have something _in evidence_ indicating that Signal is abusing contact information?The rest of this is scattershot: what matters for the overwhelming majority of use cases is end-to-end encryption between parties that know each others&#x27; identities but aren&#x27;t necessarily technically proficient enough to play key management games. This is the user story that matters for dissidents, journalists, public figures, and ordinary people: if you aren&#x27;t servicing those people, then it&#x27;s extremely likely that you&#x27;re (1) servicing nobody at all, or (2) servicing people who treat security as a LARP rather than a practical concern. reply badrabbit 11 hours agorootparentSignal is not the abuser, threat actors are.> between parties that know each others&#x27; identitiesAnd Signal needs to collect their identities and reveal them to each other despite the risk of one of them getting compromised?> This is the user story that matters for dissidents, journalists, public figures, and ordinary peopleWhen you are outed as a source, as the romantic partner of an estranged spouse, as the public figure losing an election because of an embarassing message,etc... it matters.

None of these people are concerned about the FBI doing a forensic investigation or wiretapping them.> servicing people who treat security as a LARP rather than a practical concern.Or normal people who don&#x27;t know enough to think about security and threat models who simply trust you the tech savvy person recommending them Signal which will protect them, you know, the general population.

You made the call, AT&T was only the common carrier connecting you. Regardless, of whether or not they paid to conduct the search. Now the judiciary is pretty slanted to supporting law enforcement so it will take time to play out. Often the higher courts are more apt at deciding these issues (ie less bias)That said, there’s a tendency in the US justice system to protect the system. So we will see how it shakes out in 5 years while this makes its way through reply bdowling 16 hours agorootparentHistorically, here’s how it works: Suppose the police come to your door and say, “Hi, we’re investigating your neighbor for a crime and we would like to see the footage from your security camera for the last few days.” At that point, you can choose whether you share the records with the police. It’s up to you. You may demand to see a search warrant, but you do not need to. Your neighbor does not get a say in whether you help the police.Here, the same pattern applies, but the scale of cooperation is staggering. “Quantity has a quality all its own,” on steroids. In the case of AT&T, their cooperation includes trillions of records and affects literally everyone who has used a phone since 1987.The issue, according to the article, is not whether voluntary sharing of records is constitutional, but whether the public should have a right to know the details of how the system works. reply Jensson 18 hours agorootparentprev> If government comes to you and says, “hey, so we have the ability to regulate you, imprison you, etc. Now we can do that, or you can accept this payment to give us access to private records — you have a day to decide”Who said the Government blackmailed them?

    "originBody": "NEWS FEATURE 21 November 2023 Polio is on the brink of eradication. Here's how to keep it from coming back The campaign to eradicate polio could succeed in the next few years. But that’s just the beginning of a new challenge — keeping it away. Aisling Irwin Twitter Facebook Email A child in Tanzania has his finger marked to show that he has received a polio vaccine during a door-to-door campaign in 2022.Credit: Ericky Boniphace/AFP via Getty Nobody expected polio to be back. It’s 2040, a decade since the disease was eradicated. The global health campaign that vanquished the virus has disbanded; immunization efforts have slackened. Then, one day, a sick child in a conflict-wracked country develops paralysis; the cause turns out to be polio. Scientists trace the origin of the virus to a laboratory on the other side of the world. A technician at the lab had handled a forgotten batch of polio-infected material — and then visited their family abroad. As cases multiply, the World Health Organization (WHO) appeals for help to conduct emergency immunization campaigns, but stocks of vaccines are low and few members of staff have direct experience of polio outbreaks. Soon there are tens of thousands of cases: millions more people around the world who haven’t had the vaccine are at risk. This is just one of many possible scenarios that could follow polio eradication. Although the world has not yet eliminated poliovirus, many observers think it could be gone within three years. The polio-eradication campaign has increased its intensity and funding in the past year in the hope of finally meeting a deadline that’s been postponed many times since efforts were launched in 1988. The front lines are Afghanistan and Pakistan, where pockets of wild polio persist but are shrinking (see ‘Wild polio tamed’), and a swathe of Africa, where a polio vaccine that includes live virus has itself seeded outbreaks. There are signs that health campaigns are now bringing these vaccine-derived episodes under control. Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative The final steps towards eradication are formidable, and it’s not clear when — or whether — nations will reach this goal. Nonetheless, with the demise of the virus in sight, health authorities are planning what happens next. That’s because eradication is not extinction. Polio could lurk in testing labs and manufacturing facilities — from which it has leaked in the past — and even in some people. Mistakes years after eradication could let polio into an unprotected population where it could “wreak havoc”, says virologist Konstantin Chumakov, former associate director of vaccine research at the FDA Office of Vaccines Research and Review in Silver Spring, Maryland. The end of polio is only the beginning of another effort: developing the resilience to keep it away, says Liam Donaldson, a public-health specialist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK, and the lead author of a series of independent reports on the campaign’s progress (see go.nature.com/49hho4a). “People have signed up to polio eradication, but they’ve not signed up to the longer journey.” Stamping it out Only one human disease has so far been declared eradicated: smallpox, in 1980. Polio has been more complex, says David Heymann, who heads the WHO’s Containment Advisory Group. That’s because of a key difference: every smallpox infection produces symptoms, but polio can silently infect up to 1,000 people before causing a case of paralysis. The other snag is that polio can be caused not only by the wild virus, but also, in very rare cases, by the vaccines deployed to prevent it. Eradication means getting rid of both forms for good. The main tool is vaccination. Industrialized, polio-free countries use an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), which doesn’t prevent the virus infecting the body and being shed in stools, but does protect against paralysis. Provided that immunization levels with IPV remain high and sanitation is good, a rogue poliovirus will probably peter out, according to Concepcion Estivariz, a polio researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. But because the inactivated vaccine can’t block transmission, children in at-risk countries still receive another type: an oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) that contains an attenuated form of the live virus, and can stop polio’s spread — which is crucial for eradication. It’s also cheaper and easier to deliver than IPV, which is administered by injection. The oral campaign has been hugely successful. Since 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) estimates it has prevented 20 million cases of polio paralysis. A chemist processes samples at the National Polio and Measles Laboratory in Bangladesh.Credit: G.M.B. Akash/Panos But OPV has some important downsides. There is a low risk that the vaccine itself can cause paralysis. And, on rare occasions, the weakened virus used in the vaccine can mutate sufficiently to regain virulence. This can lead to outbreaks of cases known as vaccine-derived polio among people who have not been vaccinated fully or at all. “If we continue OPV,” says Estivariz, “we never stop the circle.” Most countries are now using IPV in their routine immunization programmes alongside OPV, and the WHO recommends that IPV administration should continue for a decade after disease transmission has been stopped, to protect against any accidental releases or hidden pockets of the virus. Polio will be certified as eradicated when no case has been observed for three years, and when there is no sign of it in environmental surveillance data — that is, in samples of waste water. A year after that, OPV must be withdrawn to prevent vaccine-derived polio. The problem, however, is that removing it will be an extraordinarily delicate manoeuvre. Done messily, this process could trigger the return of the virus. In 2016, for instance, the withdrawal of an OPV across 150 countries went disastrously wrong. “The results were sobering”, says Kimberly Thompson, an epidemiologist at the research non-profit organization Kid Risk, in Orlando, Florida. There are three strains of wild polio — types 1, 2 and 3. Type 2 was declared eradicated in 2015, and type 3 followed in 2019. The oral vaccine contained attenuated versions of all three strains, but after type 2 was eradicated, the aim was to withdraw vaccines containing that strain to minimize the risk of seeding vaccine-derived type 2 polio. So the GPEI orchestrated a two-week period in April 2016 in which all three-strain oral vaccines were switched for versions containing just types 1 and 3. Swiftly, however, cases of vaccine-derived type 2 polio began to build — in two countries in 2016, spreading to 24 countries by 2020, with countries in Africa worst affected. A case popped up in the United States in 2022, and the United Kingdom found the virus in wastewater samples. The cumulative number of paralysis cases so far is just over 3,200; the yearly total peaked at more than 1,000 in 2020 and now seems to be declining, with 238 recorded so far this year (see ‘Rare and receding: vaccine-derived polio’). African countries are still running multiple emergency campaigns delivering oral type 2 vaccines to stamp these outbreaks out. Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative Why the rebound? First, populations in the regions affected weren’t sufficiently vaccinated beforehand with IPV, which would have protected them until any outbreaks could be controlled. This was partly owing to a gap in vaccine supply, says Ondrej Mach, who co-chairs a new GPEI group that will oversee future withdrawals of the oral vaccine. What’s more, says Mach, just before the switch, vaccine-derived type 2 polio was detected in Nigeria. Transmission was probably already under way in Nigeria and other countries, adds Mach, and the emergency type 2 vaccine seeded further outbreaks. Since 2021, however, this seeding has become much less likely: vaccination campaigns are controlling the outbreaks using a genetically engineered oral vaccine, which has an even lower chance of becoming virulent than the OPVs used previously. What risks does the post-polio world face if full oral withdrawal goes wrong? An analysis by Kid Risk and the CDC gave one answer (D. A. Kalkowska et al. Risk Anal. https://doi.org/k428; 2023). Their model considers what might happen if all OPV use stopped in 2027 but vaccine-derived polio was not completely eliminated beforehand and outbreak responses were weak. In one scenario, the model predicts that there could be as many as 40,000 cases of paralysis caused by vaccine-derived polio 8 years after OPV administration is discontinued. To avoid this, the authors suggest that population immunity in areas with polio cases today needs to be very high — about 90% — just before withdrawal. Thompson says that most countries have achieved this in the past, at least for short periods of time. Keeping a lookout Even after OPVs are successfully withdrawn, therefore, countries can’t let their guard down. They must put in place surveillance “to detect any poliovirus, no matter where in the world it appears and however fleetingly”, says a report by the Transition Independent Monitoring Board, an independent group of scientists that reports periodically on the polio endgame and is chaired by Donaldson. Polio surveillance takes two main forms: searching for cases of paralysis that might be caused by polio; and monitoring waste water for any virus shed by carriers. Both will be crucial for years, as an example from Malawi shows. The country had been free from wild polio for three decades when, in 2021, a stool sample from a three-year-old with paralysis arrived at the national laboratory to be sent abroad for testing. The sample sat for two months before it was shipped with others, says Jamal Ahmed, who coordinates polio eradication for the WHO in its African region, which comprises 47 countries. The result came back a month later: it was wild polio type 1, not seen in the continent since 2016. Sequencing traced its origin to Pakistan, but also revealed that the virus had been circulating for two years undetected — possibly in Malawi, and possibly elsewhere. Because Malawi had no wastewater surveillance at the time, it was impossible to know.

Six campaign rounds later, says Ahmed, Malawi has seen no more cases of wild polio. And, with the WHO’s help, the country swiftly installed environmental surveillance sites. The episode also showed that the emergency vaccination programme wasn’t up to the job, says Jay Wenger, who leads the polio programme at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington. “We had to rebuild the polio infrastructure we had before” to get rid of the virus, he says. Global wastewater surveillance has become a bigger priority since the COVID-19 pandemic, says Donaldson, because politicians are paying more attention to trends in disease. Ahmed says that 41 of the 47 member states of WHO Africa now have environmental polio surveillance, and that the rest will soon catch up. Innovations are helping to speed up a process in which timeliness is crucial. One breakthrough is direct detection, a method that leapfrogs several of the conventional stages of the testing process; for example, by extracting RNA directly from samples without the need to culture them. The threat of escape No matter how successful the eradication effort is, the virus will remain in research institutes and vaccine-manufacturing facilities — and in an unknown number of routine diagnostic labs. Escapes happen. Last year, a lab worker at a manufacturing facility in Utrecht, the Netherlands, picked up type 3 virus at the facility, and this was then detected in wastewater surveillance outside the plant. No cases of paralysis resulted. Vaccine manufacturing is “a huge containment nightmare”, says Mach. The WHO has a plan for poliovirus containment that urges nations to minimize the number of facilities retaining poliovirus materials and to destroy any unnecessary stocks. At the moment, the WHO knows of 74 facilities that hold polio, in 22 countries. Can the world really stop wild polio by the end of 2023? The first step was for each country to set up a national authority for containment by 2018, to ensure that facilities comply with biosafety requirements. China and Romania have not yet done this, and other countries have missed subsequent deadlines. Even for compliant facilities, forgotten samples remain a threat, says Andy Macadam at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in Potters Bar, UK. “All you have to do is mislabel the tube.” And polio might lurk in some facilities that are not even subject to the containment plan, says Heymann. This could include frozen stool samples taken for other reasons at a time when polio was circulating. Since 2000, there have been 21 reported incidents of poliovirus release from laboratories and vaccine-production facilities in 8 countries, with 16 cases of polio as a result, according to Derek Ehrhardt, who heads the WHO’s poliovirus containment unit. Most cases have been in vaccine-manufacturing facilities, but five of them were in research labs in which workers discovered that vials containing poliovirus were mislabelled (none of those cross-contamination incidents led to paralysis). The solution, says Heymann, is better biosecurity in all labs. To reduce the need for live virus, scientists are developing ways to produce the inactivated vaccine without it — for example, by using a non-infectious, genetically engineered starting material, or by designing vaccines from virus-like particles or messenger RNA. A surprising source There is yet another source of poliovirus, unforeseen 35 years ago when eradication efforts began. In most people who receive the oral vaccine, the immune system generates antibodies that protect them against the virus. But in a small number of people born with particular immune deficiency disorders, the immune system allows the attenuated virus from the vaccine to live on, evolving as time goes by and emerging in their stools. No drugs have been proved to cure an ongoing polio infection. Only some of the several hundred types of immunodeficiency lead to chronic retention of poliovirus. No one knows how many people are affected, and no such shedding is known to have triggered a polio outbreak, although it might have contributed to one in the Philippines in 2019–21. But, says Mach, even one person retaining and shedding poliovirus is incompatible with eradication. “We have to do something.” An international — if patchy — search for people with these immune disorders who have chronic polio has produced a register of 200 individuals. New polio vaccine poised to get emergency WHO approval One person with the condition lives in the United Kingdom and was vaccinated with OPV as a child. For more than 20 years, he asymptomatically carried — and shed — the attenuated virus, which evolved to its disease-causing form. His gut was “essentially a culture vessel”, says David Boyle at PATH, a non-profit medical-research organization based in Seattle, Washington. That’s why scientists were surprised to learn that the person’s infection had gone. It disappeared after he received the antiviral drug remdesivir for severe COVID-19 in August 2021. This could be coincidence, says Macadam, but it bolsters the case that antivirals could be used to treat polio infection (two such drugs are being explored as polio treatments). Monoclonal antibodies are also under development. Complacency and responsibility Keeping vaccination rates high for at least a decade after eradication will be the best protection — but there are fears that commitment to IPVs might wane once eradication has been declared. Routine immunization campaigns struggle to reach every child, especially during conflict, disasters or pandemics. COVID-19 drove the number of unvaccinated or undervaccinated children up to 23 million in 2020. Added to this is the growing problem in some regions of vaccine scepticism and complacency, which grew worse because of activism against COVID-19 vaccines, says Peter Hotez, a vaccine specialist and public advocate at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Spate of polio outbreaks worldwide puts scientists on alert With so much to be done to maintain a polio-free world, Donaldson is asking who will be accountable once the GPEI disbands a year after eradication, handing its responsibilities to WHO departments, partners and national health programmes. A transition has already begun in some countries, but many have struggled to find their own funding amid changing government priorities. Slackening efforts now could bring bigger problems in the future, says Aidan O’Leary, who directs polio eradication at the WHO. “If we collectively take our eye off the ball and don’t build the resilience of health systems going forward, then we face further problems down the line.” But done well, says O’Leary, the post-polio world could bring wider health benefits for everyone: better surveillance and immunization measures, and more joined-up health services. “The last mile of the polio eradication programme”, he says, “is the first mile for global public-health security.” Nature 623, 680-682 (2023) doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-03602-5 Reprints and Permissions Latest on: Infection Public health Vaccines Latent human herpesvirus 6 is reactivated in CAR T cells ARTICLE 08 NOV 23 Dengue is spreading.

That polio has no cure, or that we we don&#x27;t know how to cure paralysis due to nerve and motor neuron destruction?The former I think people accept because if we can eradicate it through vaccination then it&#x27;s a problem solved, so we are working towards that. The latter I don&#x27;t think anyone actually accepts, it&#x27;s just a hard problem and progress is slow. reply DoreenMichele 13 hours agorootparentYou tend to hear mostly about research into repairing nerves damaged due to injury. It seems to me that a broken neck would be a harder thing to fix than neurons impaired by infection.It seems likely to me that if you can identify the nutrients depleted by the infection and also actually clear the infection from the body, this should be relatively easy to repair compared to something like a broken neck.I did a quick search (\"are there any organizations working specifically on polio paralysis\" on Bing) and most hits are about the news currently under discussion, not about research into treating the paralysis. I did find this page on The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation site:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.christopherreeve.org&#x2F;todays-care&#x2F;living-with-par...They indicate there are a lot of studies on Post Polio Syndrome, which is not per se research into treating paralysis. Some stats from the page:Over 12 million people, worldwide have been affected by polio as indicated by the CDC.There is no central system for reporting post-polio syndrome, but it is estimated that 300,000 individuals are survivors of polio in the United States and have mild to severe symptoms.Of the 300,000 survivors of polio, it is estimated that of one fourth to one half may develop some form of post-polio symptoms. reply dralley 11 hours agorootparent> It seems to me that a broken neck would be a harder thing to fix than neurons impaired by infection.Does it?

Viruses (especially ones like Polio) wreak havoc. A broken neck is mostly \"superficial\", in that the connection is severed but the underlying structures can be mostly undamaged. Polio is destroying motor neurons throughout the CNS, including the brain (which in general is always going to be the hardest organ on which to perform any interventions).But even when a virus is not targeting the CNS, generally they have the ability to do a lot more lasting damage than blunt force trauma, as a virus can cause DNA mutations &#x2F; changes at a sub-cellular level, which you will not see from BFT.Compare it to a skin issue. Which is more difficult to treat: a large blister caused by touching the hot stove, or a blister caused by herpes? reply DoreenMichele 7 hours agorootparentI live with a serious genetic disorder and deal a lot with illness. I&#x27;ve pursued a lot of alternative remedies to cope with a condition Western medicine can&#x27;t fix.In my experience, viral infections aren&#x27;t that hard to treat and I no longer get fever blisters (which happen to be caused by herpes, coincidentally). There are lots of natural antivirals out there and this was common knowledge on an email list I once frequented which no longer exists.I list it as my personal opinion not to say that it&#x27;s merely a wild-assed guess based on nothing in particular but to say that you aren&#x27;t going to change my mind and I don&#x27;t have any sources to cite and don&#x27;t wish to get into an argument over it. replyDoreenMichele 15 hours agoprevTheir imagined future resurgence scenario -- someone in a lab gets infected, then travels abroad -- highlights one of the reasons developed countries need to help less developed countries: Out of enlightened self interest, not \"charity\" nor \"the goodness of their hearts.\"We currently are de facto breeding antibiotic resistant infections in places without adequate sanitation or water infrastructure and you can go from pretty much anywhere on the planet to pretty much anywhere else these days in 24 hours or less. When people from developed countries get sick while someplace else, they are often medevaced out to get them good care in a modern facility, thereby potentially exposing people in their country to whatever they have.We need to do a better job of providing basics like adequate water infrastructure worldwide if we want to be free from such diseases in our cushy developed countries. reply robertlagrant 11 hours agoparent> We currently are de facto breeding antibiotic resistant infectionsFor my understanding, if no one else&#x27;s: are there a lot of places without decent water, but with antibiotics? What&#x27;s causing that strange inconsistency? reply akdor1154 11 hours agorootparentAnecdotal, but most towns in Vietnam you&#x27;d want to boil your water, and if you want antibiotics you go to the pharmacy, pay about $2, and get some.What&#x27;s causing it? The free market is working great to build the systems to get drugs to people. In fact if a pharmacist refused to give out antibiotics when they weren&#x27;t needed, the pharmacist would probably just go out of business because the customer would just head up the street to the next guy.The free market is not so hot at building expensive infrastructure like safe water in a tropical biome, that requires government involvement (not meaning to rag on SE Asian governments: building this stuff is difficult even if your country has been stable for the last 100 years, which is a luxury they haven&#x27;t been lucky enough to have) reply otherme123 1 hour agorootparentIt&#x27;s a well known problem in economy: the tragedy of the commons.In a free market, even the river or the sea has an owner (might be a group of people), so you cannot throw your waste on a river that is not yours.

That&#x27;s a little misleading though, since a large amount of basic and applied research is funded through the military (such as through DARPA and other agencies). If we reduce here we&#x27;d need corresponding increases elsewhere to avoid starving basic research. There are some expenditures that are wasteful there (I&#x27;m not sure how well the F-22 will handle the shift to drone warfare), so we could back there if we wanted to.Funding for many other agencies is actually too low to accomplish their stated mission. We either need to reduce the scope of what they are legally required to do or increase funding. For the IRS, one thing we could do is to simplify the tax code to make audits less expensive. Similar changes could be made for the INS.As for wastefulness, if you compare the government to private companies to implement the same standards, government is always cheaper. The only way private companies get cheaper is to provide less or offset the cost in some other way (unexpected externalities). The real reason expenses are so high is that the government is big -- it provides services to every person in the US and many others around the world. It covers a large number of markets from healthcare, security, finance, etc. There is literally no company comparable to the Federal government in totality. But if you compare just the pieces you still find government usually comes out ahead.*\"Entitlements\" really should be considered contractual obligations and treated separately from the budget -- after all, would we allow a private company to include disbursements from their pension fund as part of their budget? Fuck no, that&#x27;s a separate pile of money that doesn&#x27;t belong to you. The entire framing around \"entitlements\" is designed to trick people out of their money. reply HALtheWise 7 hours agorootparentprev> spending their untold riches to make the government better is not in vogue. Never has been.Isn&#x27;t this just lobbying&#x2F;political contributions? That definitely happens, but I think I&#x27;m generally more in favor of keeping the government and laws somewhat isolated from the influence of money, and keeping philanthropic organizations as a separate category from government agencies.For the most part, private organizations (especially nonprofits) seem mostly willing to operate within the bounds of the laws as currently written, and government organizations like the CIA and NSA and military seem much less perturbed by commiting physical violence to achieve their aims. There are maybe some exceptions, but I can think of a lot more examples of governments being toppled by the CIA than by nonprofits (unless you count the Taliban and ilk as charities, which seems like a stretch). reply claytongulick 11 hours agorootparentprev> stewing in anger and grievancesIt seems as if the targets of your ire are not the only ones in the stewpot. reply mptest 13 hours agorootparentprevAnd since philanthropic approaches to such aspirations demonstrably do not work, we need extremely high taxes on the ultra wealthy.Before the six-seven digit earning engineers here lambast me, I&#x27;m talking billionaires.No one intelligent can&#x2F;has yet looked me in the eye and told me earnestly: anyone with a billion + $ would have a single degree lower quality of life if their wealth was capped at 999 millionIf you want empirics google \"highest marginal tax rate 1950- present\" and \"infrastructure spending 1950- present\". reply GuB-42 9 hours agorootparentSince we are talking about health, the ultra wealthy are still human beings, they get sick and die like the rest of us.And they want to stay healthy and live long, also like the rest of us.It means it is in their own selfish interest to invest loads of money into health, because that is what will help them achieve that goal.But again, their body is much like our bodies, so every advance in medicine that can help them live longer will ultimately help us live longer. Maybe at first, only the wealthy will be able to get these state of the art treatment, but processes will improve, patents will expire, and sooner or later, they will be available to all of us.This is one instance where there is no real need to \"tax the rich\", research is good for all of mankind, the rich are not taking away knowledge from the poor. This is in contrast to natural resources, like land. If the rich want to build their manor on some good spot, the poor that live there will have to leave.

Philanthropists also die on a shorter time frame than states and their successors may not want to continue to support the same things.I don&#x27;t think the claim was that philanthropy doesn&#x27;t work. But it doesn&#x27;t scale to the levels of what a state can achieve. And therefore it is an inefficient way to use the resources.

If I had to identify one organization that has contributed the _most_ to positive changes in public health infrastructure in the last decade it would be them, above any governments, churches, or other non-billionare organizations.Reaching back further, many&#x2F;most top universities have billionaires to thank for their existence (Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, etc.), the widespread existence of public libraries is mostly due to Andrew Carnegie, and a lot of tech&#x2F;science innovation comes from for-profit companies primarily controlled by or funded by billionaires.I won&#x27;t deny that billionaire philanthropy _sometimes_ doesn&#x27;t work, but that&#x27;s true for any system of building infrastructure that I can imagine, and is a far cry from your claim that philanthropy is demonstrably an ineffective way to solve public infrastructure problems.I&#x27;m curious if there are other processes you see as being historically more effective, either overall or per-dollar, at producing effective public health outcomes than philanthropic organizations? If so, I&#x27;d definitely like to find ways to give them more resources. reply tga_d 6 hours agorootparentSaying the eradication of Polio \"was primarily funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\" is a vast overstatement.

There&#x27;s no solid evidence that billionaires made such programs successful, especially given that the polio eradication effort has notoriously been mired by repeated setbacks.It&#x27;s also a vast overstatement to claim \"most top universities have billionaires to thank for their existence\" or that \"the widespread existence of public libraries is mostly due to\" Carnegie libraries. Most top universities in the world are public institutions, and public libraries existed long before Carnegie (there was never a point in American history where most public libraries were Carnegie libraries, let alone in other countries). reply mptest 6 hours agorootparentprevOk, so first off happy thanksgiving.

The reason is very simple - the rate of population growth exceeds the rate of infrastructure development by large margin. You can make large investments and build everything for 1 million people, but after two decades there are now 2 million people and then 4 and then 8. Africa started out with 200 million people After the WW2 period. In the beginning of this century there were around 800 people. Now there are 1.5 billion people. The rate of population growth is just unbearable. And Africa is here just an example. The same problem affects also India and other places. reply andrewmutz 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not the reason that nations stay \"developing\". Nations stay \"developing\" due to extractive economic and political institutions that prevent economic growth. Great book about the topic by economist Daron Acemoglu (\"Why nations fail\").The reason that countries that have high population growth tend to be poor is because when a country gets rich its people have fewer children. The high fertility rate does not cause the poverty, instead its the other way around: the poverty causes the high fertility rate. reply genman 13 hours agorootparentI can&#x27;t agree with this unfortunately. While getting rich further lowers the fertility rate then there is a certain threshold that must be first exceeded to get rich (relatively speaking of course).There must be a feedback loop that incentivizes to get better education, to get better productivity to get richer. Raising a child is expensive, raising a highly educated child is very expensive. If you have 8 children then you can barely feed them unless you are very rich indeed. Even if you manage to provide good education for few of your children then the larger part of them continues the poverty loop. Breaking out of poverty requires breaking of this loop.It should be very obvious - if your economy grows 5% but your population grows 10% then everybody is getting poorer as the growth per capita is negative. The same applies for everything, education, sanitation, food production. If you capacity to provide any of them is lower than the population growth then the amount of the poor continues to increase. reply DoreenMichele 12 hours agorootparentAnd providing more basics, like improved agriculture, education and essential infrastructure like clean water access, is a better means to combat that issue than sending in surgeons to play hero and have a feel-good moment without making any real difference in the root causes that led to someone needing surgery. reply genman 12 hours agorootparentCurrent problem in Africa is that their capacity to produce food, while it is increasing relatively fast, doesn&#x27;t increase enough to keep up with the population growth. This is why Russia can play with the grain shortage to begin with. reply DoreenMichele 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think we really disagree per se. Not sure why you seem so adversarial.And Russia is probably not playing with the grain shortage. They had an agreement in place to let the country they are at war with sell grain because it&#x27;s so critical.It&#x27;s probably more complicated than that and a tangent. reply genman 11 hours agorootparentNo, I don&#x27;t think that I provided a counter argument but rather a supplementary one. Population growth rate is a huge problem that hinders capacity to provide enough aid.Russia certainly used the risk of hunger as a weapon to increase political pressure on Ukraine on the international level. Fortunately that attempt didn&#x27;t play out and Russia was instead pressurized to make concessions. But they stopped the agreement the same moment they thought that it is not beneficial for them anymore. But this is just a side topic and was given as an example how the African incapacity to keep up with the population growth has wider geopolitical implications. reply DoreenMichele 9 hours agorootparentAh, so it&#x27;s me. Thank you.There was a time when HN was more conversational than it typically seems these days. It gets hard to assume someone is making conversation rather than making an argument when the default seems to be the latter. replyBariumBlue 15 hours agorootparentprevThe Malthusian argument is incorrect and I disagree with the concept of physical infrastructure being the end-all-be-all. Japan, South Korea, Germany, as well as the USSR had explosive growth after WW2 not because they had massive existing infrastructure, but because of social systems & processes that enable a reliable, stable, productive society.If the societies are fragile (vulnerable to drought, markets, or violence), or rotting (corruption, superstition, tribalism), even great infrastructure can make for subpar growth.An analogy I always think of are Wadis (dry riverbeds); in very dry places with little rainfall (like Hudaydah in Yemen &#x2F; Saudi Arabia), when it DOES rain, the dry dirt riverbeds don&#x27;t soak up any water and transport it all out in flash floods - but it IS possible (and has been done) to invest in the land&#x27;s ability to hold that water rather than purge it. Similarly, in a \"always-developing\" society, there&#x27;d have to be a investment in the people to ensure they can benefit from solutions to their issues. reply epicureanideal 15 hours agorootparentI don’t think they’re making a Malthusian argument. It’s about the difference in the rate of change or two variables, not the absolute carrying capacity of a set of resources as in the Malthusian argument. reply DoreenMichele 15 hours agorootparentprevMalawi is one of the countries mentioned in this article as a source of polio outbreaks. A famous singer has invested millions in hospitals there and they still lack adequate water infrastructure. I imagine their post operative stats are probably not great. Getting surgery in a modern hospital and going home to inadequate clean water and inadequate nutrition likely actively fosters post operative infections.Population growth tends to stop with adequate education plus reproductive rights for women. Development isn&#x27;t just about infrastructure. It&#x27;s also about culture, education, developing the local population so they can sustain a more developed society.My recollection: water.org was started by a man who went to Africa with a medical charity, concluded that a lot of the health issues they were treating were directly caused by lack of clean water, decided we should fix that.We already invest in other countries, just not necessarily wisely. Advanced surgery being brought to primitive conditions is more about people wanting to feel heroic than about really improving things. reply epicureanideal 15 hours agorootparentprevAlthough some might be interpreting the previous poster as having some bad motives for saying what they’re saying, it does seem to be objectively true that population growth in developing countries is absolutely huge. If the population level had remained the same as 50 years ago the level of development would be much higher. But of course the population growth rate is declining so standards of living should hopefully start to catch up. reply genman 12 hours agorootparentYes and no. This is my argument indeed that if the population growth stayed lower then a lot more people would have been able to rise above the poverty level (or even much higher).UN prediction for Africa is that they fall close to the reproduction threshold for the end of century. Until that the poverty trap will continue. It also means that by that time now 4 billion people require their needs satisfied instead.But the population growth has been huge and exponential.

[0]Polio the disease caused by polio virus could be eradicated with widespread and continuous vaccination.The problem is the current vaccine used in most places around the world is an attenuated live virus vaccine.It gives the recipient immunity by infecting them with a strain that doesn’t cause disease in most people but is still able to replicate in the gut and spread to others and eventually reverts to being able to cause disease. So anyone who isn’t vaccinated can still get the reverted vaccine strain. The most common cause of polio outbreaks now is the vaccine strain.In rich countries they use an inactivated vaccine that works great against disease and can’t become virulent but is expensive, requires more infrastructure for delivery (needles etc), and doesn’t give enough immunity to prevent spreading the virus if infected.There are possible solutions to all of these problems but they require research and the eradication campaigners are making research more and more difficult by restricting which labs can work on polio research.The podcast TWiV is hosted by the guy who first figured out the Polio virus genome and they frequently discuss it.

While vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary, recent studies show that flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to those used to make flu vaccines> How well flu vaccines work (or their ability to protect against a certain outcome) can vary from season to season. Protection can vary depending on who is being vaccinated. At least two factors play an important role in determining the likelihood that vaccination will protect a person from flu illness: 1) characteristics of the person being vaccinated (such as their age and health), and 2) how well the vaccines “match” the flu viruses spreading in the community. When flu vaccines are not well matched to some viruses spreading in the community, vaccination may provide little or no protection against illness caused by those viruses.Compare it with something like tetanus vaccines:> Today, diphtheria and tetanus are at historic low rates in the United States. No one has ever studied the efficacy of tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid in a vaccine trial. However, experts infer efficacy from protective antitoxin levels.

If you tell an unsophisticated healthcare consumer a vaccine is junk, you should be fired. If you provide efficacy around different types or classes of vaccines and allow the healthcare consumer to make an informed decision, that is reasonable. It is about the information delivered and its delivery in significant matters.Tangentially, there is no value in arguing with antivaxxers or conspiracy theorists. You might as well attempt to talk them out of their religion. Effort better spent elsewhere. Regardless, informed consent must be mandatory in a healthcare or medical setting, so the patient can make a choice with all available information. I am not arguing choice in this subthread. I’m also not willing to argue vaccine safety data or statistics. reply TheBlight 17 hours agorootparentprevIs it logical to assume all vaccines are equally well-made, safe and effective?

Become a Redditor and subscribe to one of thousands of communities. × 9650 9651 9652 ArticleDespite having just 5.8% sales, over 38% of bug reports come from the Linux community (self.gamedev) submitted 2 years ago by koderski@KoderaSoftware 38% of my bug reports come from the Linux community My game - ΔV: Rings of Saturn (shameless plug) - is out in Early Access for two years now, and as you can expect, there are bugs. But I did find that a disproportionally big amount of these bugs was reported by players using Linux to play. I started to investigate, and my findings did surprise me. Let’s talk numbers. Percentages are easy to talk about, but when I read just them, I always wonder - what is the sample size? Is it small enough for the percentage to be just noise? As of today, I sold a little over 12,000 units of ΔV in total. 700 of these units were bought by Linux players. That’s 5.8%. I got 1040 bug reports in total, out of which roughly 400 are made by Linux players. That’s one report per 11.5 users on average, and one report per 1.75 Linux players. That’s right, an average Linux player will get you 650% more bug reports. A lot of extra work for just 5.8% of extra units, right? Wrong. Bugs exist whenever you know about them, or not. Do you know how many of these 400 bug reports were actually platform-specific? 3. Literally only 3 things were problems that came out just on Linux. The rest of them were affecting everyone - the thing is, the Linux community is exceptionally well trained in reporting bugs. That is just the open-source way. This 5.8% of players found 38% of all the bugs that affected everyone. Just like having your own 700-person strong QA team. That was not 38% extra work for me, that was just free QA! But that’s not all. The report quality is stellar. I mean we have all seen bug reports like: “it crashes for me after a few hours”. Do you know what a developer can do with such a report? Feel sorry at best. You can’t really fix any bug unless you can replicate it, see it with your own eyes, peek inside and finally see that it’s fixed. And with bug reports from Linux players is just something else. You get all the software/os versions, all the logs, you get core dumps and you get replication steps. Sometimes I got with the player over discord and we quickly iterated a few versions with progressive fixes to isolate the problem. You just don’t get that kind of engagement from anyone else. Worth it? Oh, yes - at least for me. Not for the extra sales - although it’s nice. It’s worth it to get the massive feedback boost and free, hundred-people strong QA team on your side. An invaluable asset for an independent game studio. 545 comments share save hide report top 200 commentsshow 500 sorted by: best topnewcontroversialoldrandomq&alive (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

Wayland is still fairly new, but I’m hoping that Valve will make the “political” move to choose Wayland for their OS for performance reasons. That should get more developers on board and supporting it to help hasten the transition. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]frozenpicklesyt 6 points7 points8 points 2 years ago (9 children) I think that's wishful thinking, though it would certainly expedite Wayland's development and adoption. Should be worth a good discussion either way. permalink embed save parent report reply [–][deleted] 4 points5 points6 points 2 years ago (2 children) The only games that are broken at the moment are the ones that try to use Wayland (because they were made before Wayland was a thing, so there was no reason to specify Xorg only), and those are native games. The solution to that problem is just make some env vars at launch to specify Xorg and then it'll use XWayland automatically. Hollow knight is the only example of this that I have found so far. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]frozenpicklesyt 4 points5 points6 points 2 years ago (1 child) I'm just a tad worried about potential jank that comes with using multiple compatibility layers automatically, without any user configuration.

The problem is that, even though there are several compatibility layers available, when I finish working for the day/week I just want to play my game - not troubleshoot why update X to Y thing prevents me from hearing my game's audio, etc. Linux gaming just isn't there for the average person. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]Ryder17z 13 points14 points15 points 2 years ago (1 child) It really depends on what games your playing though.

Sometimes I got with the player over discord and we quickly iterated a few versions with progressive fixes to isolate the problem. You just don’t get that kind of engagement from anyone else. This is the information that I firmly believe is missing from numerous other \"Linux users have a disproportionately high number of bug reports\" posts. As you note, Linux users are trained to 1) actually submit bug reports rather than just complain to their friends on social media, and 2) are trained to make high quality reports that effectively assist the developer in resolving the issue. permalink embed save report reply [–]koderski@KoderaSoftware[S] 383 points384 points385 points 2 years ago (36 children) That was a revelation. You don't get more bugs to fix, you are just more aware of the bugs you already have. True, some of them are easier to trigger on Linux - specifically some race conditions - but they affect everyone, you just get vague \"oh it crashes sometimes\" reports that are not really helpful in fixing stuff. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]triffid_hunter 127 points128 points129 points 2 years ago (34 children) some of them are easier to trigger on Linux - specifically some race conditions This sounds worthy of a blog post that I'd love to read - is it because Linux is unusually fast at some things compared to other OSes or just because it does things differently? permalink embed save parent report reply [–]koderski@KoderaSoftware[S] 151 points152 points153 points 2 years ago (28 children) The timings are just different, so I suspect some race conditions are easier to catch on Windows and other on Linux - but these on Windows, I catch myself :) permalink embed save parent report reply [–]pipnina 67 points68 points69 points 2 years ago (16 children) Are race conditions related to threading? Because Windows' thread creation and merging is SUPER slow compared to Linux'. Same for anything IO based IIRC? One of the reasons why loading a super-heavy modded Stellaris to the main menu might take 1m30s on my Linux + SATA-SSD system but take 8 minutes on my friend's Win10+SATA-SSD system, and over 20 minutes on another friend's Win10+7200RPM HDD system. It's an extreme case, but in a situation where fast creation and merging of threads, or heavy IO is being done, it will create notable differences. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]koderski@KoderaSoftware[S] 57 points58 points59 points 2 years ago (1 child) 99% threads - due to overall small size of my assets, I just load all 0.5GB into RAM at boot. Some things just run in different order on Linux most of the time. Things like initializing starships. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]Impressive_Change593 3 points4 points5 points 1 year ago (0 children) Things like initializing starships I guess thats because of your game but it sounds like a spacex reference lol permalink embed save parent report reply [–]Plankton_Plus 16 points17 points18 points 2 years ago (0 children) Are race conditions related to threading? Yes, but also no. Race conditions are some of the hardest bugs to find because they depend on such subtle timings (across at least two threads, yes). For example, moving your mouse and causing an interrupt at the exact right nanosecond could trigger the bug. Linux does things slightly differently, so the two threads may line up differently and more reliably trigger the race condition. This doesn't mean that Linux is faster, slower, better, or worse. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]CatProgrammer 15 points16 points17 points 2 years ago (12 children) I thought Windows thread creation was relatively fast, it's process creation that's much slower. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]koderski@KoderaSoftware[S] 30 points31 points32 points 2 years ago (8 children) It doesn't really matter which one is faster - what matters it that they tend to run in different order. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]CatProgrammer 12 points13 points14 points 2 years ago (7 children) Which is an indication that they use different scheduling algorithms, or possibly that some higher-level synchronization constructs (semaphores/etc.) are implemented differently. Makes me wonder how useful testing on different processors and architectures would be for games, as then you have hardware-level differences that can affect scheduling and ordering of concurrent operations and might reveal more race conditions. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]hegbork 9 points10 points11 points 2 years ago (0 children) I once worked on a project where we specifically made sure to run all tests on sparc64 because it had a nasty memory model (if you don't lock correctly, your other CPU may not see the memory you changed), big endian, 64 bit when most of the world at that time was still 32, and was very brutal about alignment issues. It was invaluable to catch those kinds of inattentiveness bugs early in development. permalink embed save parent report reply [–][deleted] 5 points6 points7 points 2 years ago (0 children) I notice a difference depending whether my laptop is running on battery power or not, some race conditions rarely happen when it's on AC, but happen much more frequently when it's on battery and throttled down. Same with CI services like Travis and whatnot which tend to be fairly slow and are much more likely to show race conditions. I don't really know much about Windows or how it implements threading, but it doesn't necessarily need to be some deep difference; just a few fractions of a second more or less here and there can make a massive impact in how often a race condition actually happens. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]Techfreak102 3 points4 points5 points 2 years ago (2 children) Makes me wonder how useful testing on different processors and architectures would be for games, as then you have hardware-level differences that can affect scheduling and ordering of concurrent operations and might reveal more race conditions. It’s super important in software development as a whole. I’m a software dev on statistical software for a massive company, and we do a significant amount of architecture-focused testing in order to make sure we don’t have race conditions in certain configurations. We even have some resources dedicated specifically to mimic some of our high priority clients’ architectures, to make sure things work correctly with their specific setup. In terms of the gaming industry, this is exactly why consoles don’t have modifiable parts. If you have a static architecture, with known algorithms underpinning all of your important processes, you can streamline development a significant bit, as well as utilize architecture-specific optimizations that you maybe couldn’t implement in an architecture-agnostic piece of code. This sort of stuff is part of the reason that console exclusives very rarely make their way to different platforms, because the game was almost certainly developed with the original console’s architecture in mind. permalink embed save parent report reply load more comments (2 replies) load more comments (2 replies) [–]Plankton_Plus 3 points4 points5 points 2 years ago (2 children) Thread creation is relatively slow on any platform, Windows may be the worst culprit, but you rarely care about that stuff. You typically have a pool of threads sitting around doing nothing that you can pull from, or a set number of threads each with a specific purpose. With game development you typically want to avoid \"creating\" things as much as possible: allocating memory, creating threads, creating file handles (opening files), etc. Re-use is king in game development, and also some other development disciplines. The absolute fastest thing you can do is nothing at all. My point is: there may well be a difference, but you shouldn't really care. permalink embed save parent report reply load more comments (2 replies) [–]triffid_hunter 25 points26 points27 points 2 years ago (2 children) Still, as a Linux power user with a generalised interest in software and a career in electronics+embedded, I want details! permalink embed save parent report reply [–]koderski@KoderaSoftware[S] 46 points47 points48 points 2 years ago (1 child) There are not so much low-level details, really. I got a bunch of reports (\"game is crashing when I have geologists, here are logs/versions/cores\"), I send out huge binaries with debug symbols with them, got a core back that pointed exactly to the problem.

Well the biggest myth one was Planetary Annihilation and one of their devs on Twitter. I've been trying to fire fight against that one for such a long time. A former dev at Uber Ent said pretty flat without any real provocation \"Linux was 0.1% users but 20% bug reports\". It was widely shared, a top post on /r/gaming and /r/games multiple gaming news sites and gaming news shows on youtube picked up on it and signal boosted it. They didn't read the followup posts in which the dev admitted he didn't know what the issues were, didn't work on the port himself and then eventually he apologized admitting that he now knows a lot more about porting to Linux from the replies and admitted he was wrong. PA for those who didn't know had Linux as a stretch goal for Kickstarter and actually had a higher amount of users than 0.1% because people like me were buying the game because they said they would support Linux. Those users wouldn't be counted as purchases on Linux under the Steam stats. They went with Coherent gameface as the UI for the game which didn't work on Radeon or Intel graphics but didn't try and fix it or even refund users. They had an alpha and beta which were open to kickstarter backers and the game was obviously not tested on Linux at all. If you release any software you would at least play it once on the system you are targeting but even having 1 machine with Ubuntu on it was too much for Uber Ent even though they were literally kickstarted with that in mind. Like the OP the Linux people actually wanted to get the game running on Linux so there were bug reports. But the myth though was signal boosted way more than the truth which was those bug reports were self-inflicted. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]qwertyuiop924 29 points30 points31 points 2 years ago (6 children) Ah yes. A variant on the classic \"Linux users suck and are angry at us, Linux isn't worth supporting!\" I mean, maybe Linux actually isn't worth supporting for you. I get it. I'm a Linux user but I can't expect to be everyone's priority. But have you considered why your Linux users are so bitter and abrasive? Because if all your Linux users are angry with you, maybe they have a reason. Like, for example, that you charged them the same price you'd charge a windows user for a buggy port that performs poorly and treat them like second-class citizens. Or maybe you released a mediocre-ish port, said your next game would get ported to Linux, never ported it, and couldn't even be bothered to confirm that the port wasn't coming. I mean, hypothetically. It's not like any game studio would do something like that... permalink embed save parent report reply [–]Jeoshua 11 points12 points13 points 2 years ago (0 children) It's that very kind of behavior that I believe led Valve to push Proton over Native. That way there are less issues with games simply being coded poorly for Linux and, instead, they're just coded the way they're coded before and they run on Linux. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]maugrerain 4 points5 points6 points 2 years ago (0 children) Oh, I felt that with Ark: SE. I bought the game during early access to play with friends, only on one Friday evening (peak playing time) we were preparing to raid a base when the devs pushed an update. All the Windows users were able to rejoin the server just fine while I, being on Linux, kept experiencing a crash. Then there is/was a Linux specific bug that existed for years with water where copying a file from another map fixes it, yet the developers don't seem interested. Then other games simply drop Linux after supporting it for a while. It's easy to see why Linux players lose trust in certain game developers. Yet, as shown here, Linux users are often willing to pay more for a game that supports Linux and will take the time working with developers to try to make it work. permalink embed save parent report reply load more comments (4 replies) load more comments (2 replies) [–]suur-siil 123 points124 points125 points 2 years ago (11 children) Linux users also enjoy it when a proprietary software dev replies positively to them and invites them to help with diagnosing the bug or testing the fix (instead of just \"we don't provide support for Linux users, fuck off\").

It always seems to go something like this: User: My program doesn't work, please help. Tech: What program? User: Adobe Tech: Adobe what? User: I don't know. It says Adobe. Tech: Adobe is a company that makes dozens of products, we still need to know what software you're using. Does it say anything else? User: Photo something. Tech: Photoshop? User: Maybe, I dunno. Tech: Okay, what version?User: I don't know. Tech: Did you follow my instructions to see the version? User: Yes. (editor's note: \"yes\" really means \"no\") Tech: So what did it say? User: I don't know Tech: Okay, fine, we'll skip that for now, maybe I can still help you. What's the problem you're having? User: A message pops up and it closes. Tech: What does the message say? User: I don't know. Tech: Can you make it happen again and tell me what the message says? User: Okay. Tech: Well, what did it say? User: I don't know, some technical mumbo jumbo. Tech: Can you please be more specific? User: It said something about an error. Tech: That's really vague. Can you read me the exact message please. User: No, I closed it. ...and so on. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]GuyWithLag 12 points13 points14 points 2 years ago (0 children) No, this is _exactly_ how a toddler behaves. Something is not to their liking, they may not know what, but they know they don't like it, so they cry for Someone Else to fix it. Same thing with the excerpt above (I've lived through it more times than alcohol can wipe from memory): ToddlerUser finds something isn't to his liking (whatever that means), he complains for Someone Else to fix it. He/she/ve/it complains to you, and that's it, they are absolved. Any question that you pose upon them makes them feel as if it's Their Problem again, and not Someone Else's, and because they're pain-aversive they want to make it Someone Else's as fast as possible, but as they're in pain-aversion mode they really really don't want to think too much, else it might become Their Problem again. permalink embed save parent report reply load more comments (1 reply) [–]SaysStupidShit10x 6 points7 points8 points 2 years ago (1 child) A lot more root cause analysis rather than hey this random thing happened to me when I pressed this totally unrelated button permalink embed save parent report reply load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (22 replies) [–]Livid_Charity7077 72 points73 points74 points 2 years ago (13 children) Thanks for this post. I've sent some very detailed bug reports for games that were ported to linux, sometimes with patches or proposed fixes in third party libraries attached, and I hope they're similarly appreciated. For example, I remember once I was trying to track down an issue with how a game opened a config file (documentation wasn't clear) so I quickly strace'd all file syscalls to see where the game looked for its config. While I was doing so I noticed a bunch of failed attempts to open a library with a space in the name, like \"libsomeextension-1.2 .so\" -- note the space in the middle of the filename. The framework was also searching for the library with a \".dll\" extension, so I'm sure the bug existed on Windows as well. I sent over a very specific bug report saying hey bud, check where you define the constant string for libsomeextension because it looks like you have accidental whitespace in a constant where you define this library name. The library was totally unimportant, I think a plugin to manipulate lights on a particular brand of keyboard. I'm sure they just shipped without figuring out why that particular feature wasn't working. There are bug reports like \"it doesn't work,\" and there are bug reports like \"here is the specific issue and proposed fix, sorry it's not OSS or I'd send a patch.\" permalink embed save report reply [–]harrybrown98 30 points31 points32 points 2 years ago (12 children) Hear that game developers... lots of Linux users have the skills necessary to fix bugs for you.

This allows anyone who wants to pull the source code to build and run it, mess with the core mechanics, investigate bugs, and so on. It a decent solution for open sourcing your own game without exposing paid assets - but they've also pointed out that having this weird extra conditional layer for many critical assets (and their associated scripts) has led to less maintainability/modularity/internal cohesion in their code. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]Jukibom 13 points14 points15 points 2 years ago (0 children) Couldn't have said it better myself :D permalink embed save parent report reply load more comments (3 replies) load more comments (1 reply) [–]disintegore 45 points46 points47 points 2 years ago (1 child) There is more to open sourcing video games than just the free QA labour you might get out of it.

Even if they don't work in computing, Linux users are generally taught that debugging is a communal process. If you come to the community with a problem, you'll be asked to help the community help you solve your problem by providing information and your own analysis if you've got the experience to do that.

I really appreciate too, when developers do a good job of making a logs, etc. easy to access. (Even if it's just inside the Steam directory, or inside Unity's place for the game's data in .config, etc. — if I can find it in a few guess, excellent. If you have some sort of Wiki that says where to go, perfect!) I also greatly appreciate when devs are responsive & empathetic in bug reports, even if it isn't ultimately fixable. permalink embed save report reply [–]paulsmithkc 42 points43 points44 points 2 years ago (4 children) Is it possible that Linux users are more likely to: a) know how to report a bug b) follow through on reporting the bug c) actually spot bugs to be reported I think all of the above are likely. A sizable chunk of Linux users are in IT, CyberSecurity, and Software Development. All of which have professional experience in support tickets / bug reports.

Hard to tell, but in addition to these 1040 bugs I have 100 issues currently filed as \"can't replicate\" and I don't think single of them I got from someone playing on Linux. That would make it roughly 10%. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]qwertyuiop924 11 points12 points13 points 2 years ago (0 children) It's also just a part of the culture. Linux users who play games run Linux at home. In the support contract-less world of using Linux at home, debugging is a communal activity, and the reporter is expected to actively participate in the process by gathering data, submitting findings, and helping to root-cause. If you come from that culture, the idea of submitting a bug along the lines of \"it crashes sometimes maybe\" is just... fundamentally anti-social. If you haven't made a best effort to at least gather data so the developer has a hope of debugging, you haven't fulfilled your end of the social contract. permalink embed save parent report reply load more comments (2 replies) [–]mrogre43@blacktabbygames 44 points45 points46 points 2 years ago (8 children) Same experience here.

I once spent four hours messing with a launcher for a game, because it didn't properly support the obscure terminal I was running it from. I could have just used xterm or one of the major terminals instead, but no. Must be my way! permalink embed save parent report reply [–]spam-hater 5 points6 points7 points 2 years ago (0 children) In my case this urge has it's roots in how I started on computers where you practically had to build your software from scratch half the time, so much of what your computer did was because you actively told it to do it. Then moving on (for a while) to locked down proprietary platforms like MacOS or Windows, it felt a bit like being chained down by your operating system, as much of the time spent on the computer was spent fighting with the operating system to convince it to allow you to do things the way that you want to do them on your computer. Then I found Linux, and suddenly I had 100% total freedom over my computer again, so now when something on Linux annoys me, I'll actively dig until I find how to fix or replace it, because I can. :) permalink embed save parent report reply load more comments (1 reply) [–]adnanclyde 10 points11 points12 points 2 years ago (0 children) A platform heavily populated by devs is sure to have the best reports.

This is what I wanted most devs on Twitter that complain about \"fragmentation\" to understand right off the bat. They should be happy they're getting bug reports at all instead of complaining, imagine leaving your game in a forever buggy state because you decided to ignore lots of useful info because of \"market share and muh fragmentation it's too costly\". Having more and more detailed bug reports doesn't mean the platform is buggy, it means your game is held to higher standards and you definitely should care about that, regardless of market share or profit. permalink embed save report reply [–]FlukyS 5 points6 points7 points 2 years ago (5 children) This is what I wanted most devs on Twitter that complain about \"fragmentation\" to understand right off the bat Well most devs who complain about fragmentation probably are pulling that from before Steam had the Steam runtime available. That is a killer feature from a compatibility standpoint and doubly so when you use their Linux namespace runtime which means you can freeze your game in time pretty much because the compat features are locked in a container. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]TheSupremistGodot Apprentice 3 points4 points5 points 2 years ago (4 children) Yes, I guess it's mainly because Valve isn't marketing the Linux runtime(s) nearly as much as Proton, if at all. I'm pretty sure if you ask any dev today they might say they know about the latter, but a lot of them might say they never heard of the former. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]FlukyS 4 points5 points6 points 2 years ago (3 children) I guess it's mainly because Valve isn't marketing the Linux runtime(s) nearly as much as Proton Well them advocating for Proton is only a new thing. The runtime they have been talking about for quite a long time. but a lot of them might say they never heard of the former But the weird thing is most Linux games today use it. Just when they are developing they don't make use of that and they don't understand you shouldn't care if they are running Ubuntu, Arch, Debian, Gentoo, Manjaro or Mint or even obscure stuff like Hanna Montana Linux. You just target the runtime and let everything else fall into place. permalink embed save parent report reply load more comments (3 replies) [–]etaipo 7 points8 points9 points 2 years ago (3 children) I wish more devs and publishers understood this.

I normally wait years to play games and wait for all bug fixes and dlcs, but I can confirm that the YouTube strategy works, especially if the game has a multiplayer component. In the last few years the only games I bought close to launch were multiplayer games that gained popularity in my circle of friends due to some twitch streamer or youtuber showcasing the game on their platform. Another tactic that you could try is to advertise your game on Reddit and give away a few game keys. A very kind indie game developer gave me one of his game keys and I really enjoyed the game, so I got all my friends to buy the game as well. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]HorseFeathers55 5 points6 points7 points 2 years ago (0 children) Thank you for the advice, it really is much appreciated :) permalink embed save parent report reply [–]WaitForItTheMongols 5 points6 points7 points 2 years ago (0 children) Post on Linux gaming subs saying \"my new game came out and it supports Linux, would love to hear what you think!\".

P.S.: I do really like you mentioning that fact about Linux community. Some people might think that Linux community is toxic as fuck when they read about Linus Torvalds.

If I encounter a game crash, as a layman, I have no idea where to find any relevant information that would be helpful for the developer. So I always assumed bug reports would have some attached logs. permalink embed save report reply [–]koderski@KoderaSoftware[S] 11 points12 points13 points 2 years ago (1 child) I can and I do, but the key thing any developer needs is a way to reproduce the problem on my machine. When I can see the bug in front of my eyes, it usually takes minutes to fix. The days before are spent on attempts to trigger it on my side. Logs are one way to help with that, as they record what was going on with the game - but logs only cover things that we anticipated. You cannot possibly log everything, because that log would grow in by gigabytes per second, and would have a tremendous performance impact. The key difference, in my experience, is that the Linux folks are trained to do so instinctively, as that's what most of the open-source software they use expect. So I get the reproduction steps and many really relevant information in addition to all the things I thought of. permalink embed save parent report reply load more comments (1 reply) [–]selflessGene 4 points5 points6 points 2 years ago (0 children) Almost everyone who uses Linux on desktop is either a software developer or a tech enthusiast. permalink embed save report reply [–][deleted] 5 points6 points7 points 2 years ago (6 children) Out of curiosity, is your game open-source?

Not that this means you will always get your issue fixed or are even guaranteed a response but IMO the experience is much better than having to dig through a help desk that only answers trivial things that any competent user can figure out on their own before being allowed to interact with a corporate support drone who can&#x27;t do anything except repeat scripted answers. The latter is just so demotivating that if you have go through it enough end up not bothering in the future even if some developers might have better systems in place.Being used to having access to developers also encourages you to make good bug reports because those will often get you a fix quickly. E.g. I have had cases where it took only a few hours from a bug report with a game trace reproducing the issue to a working graphics driver patch.Lastly, actual bug trackers - as opposed to bug black holes like support systems where you don&#x27;t see other people&#x27;s reports or bug report forums that quikcly become a mess of already resolved issues and duplicates - provide an opportunity for the users (especially powerusers) to help each other out by sharing details to narrow down the bug as well as workarounds. All of that also makes the bug reports more useful for any dev looking at fixing the issue. reply gretch 17 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not sad at all.

So a better analogy would be:Should doctors think it&#x27;s sad when you ignore some part of your body acting up, or you suddenly passing out during the day out of nowhere?

Also, I have been making software for over 30 years. There was never a time in my life when end users were more competent and understood the systems better. In fact, for baseline technical literacy, you really can&#x27;t beat Gen Z. They are by far the most technical generation of users I have seen. reply spiderice 16 hours agorootparent> for baseline technical literacy, you really can&#x27;t beat Gen ZI disagree pretty strongly with this. I think Millennials were kind of the sweet spot in technical literacy. They grew up in a time when they still needed to understand computers, and tinkered around with them a lot out of necessity (computer viruses all the time, Napster&#x2F;Limewire, etc..). They also saw the start of the internet and cell phones becoming ubiquitous, which provided a lot of forced-learning opportunities.Gen Z&#x27;ers, in my experience, have had almost no computer experience. They are great at using the apps on their phones, but phones have become so polished and easy from an end user perspective that they haven&#x27;t done any tinkering. They&#x27;ve often never downloaded an mp3 file, torrent, fixed internet issues, etc.. because things just work now. Obviously there are exceptions to this, and really technical Gen Z&#x27;ers (like with every generation). But in my experience, that isn&#x27;t the norm. reply freedomben 15 hours agorootparentExactly my experience as well. Gen Z are super good at \"finding an app for that\" or showing you how to do something on your phone, but give them a mouse and keyboard and many start to resemble Boomers. (Of course there are tons of exceptions, this is generational lumping after all).The hacker mindset just doesn&#x27;t seem to be present in Gen Z like it was for Millenials and some Gen Xers. We took crap apart as kids to see how it worked, and we could still. Now things are so integrated and miniaturized, it&#x27;s much harder to do that.Add on top of that how Gen Z is almost all iPhone users and actually looks down on Android (the platform where you can dig in if you want to), it&#x27;s no wonder the default is only an inch deep. Their tech providers and advisors have been telling them their whole lives how scary the world outside of the walled garden is and putting technical controls in their way to prevent them should they decide they want to.We absolutely could have had the Gen Z that is more technical than Millenials, but we ruined it. It&#x27;s not their fault, any generation raised like them would have been the same way.Side note: If you&#x27;re a Gen Z hacker (of which I&#x27;ve known a few and they are super impressive), I consider you a gentleperson and a scholar. reply Aerbil313 15 hours agorootparentprev> phones have become so polished and easy from an end user perspective that they haven&#x27;t done any tinkeringI don’t get the complaint, as a dev myself.

Tech-literate people like us drastically underestimate the harm scams have (and would have if tweaking was allowed) on people. I am in college, and Gen Z is scared to install anything on their Windows laptops. Except they do anyway when a scammer tricks them. They are in a hurry and they need to do this specific thing. install_more_ram.exe, bam. Pay $X to unlock your hard disk.Don’t get me wrong, it also hurts me that I need to install an app to ssh to my server on my iPhone. Or when I can’t have a long-running process in the background. Or when I can’t automate things with shell scripts. It really does hurt. But this appliance form is really how things should be, at least until the day each and every user understands their devices, a day which will never come. Because why? They are tools. They are a means to a real life end. It’s a waste of human time to make everyone “tech-literate”. Users should not have control over their devices, because social engineering and scams will always be a thing. No matter how many “DON’T ENABLE THIS UNLESS YOU ARE A SOFTWARE ENGINEER” warnings you put grandmas will continue to be scammed.Then what can let me have a native shell with root access on my iPhone, without jailbreaking?

When you interact with the internals of your operating system regularly, you get a better sense of how software in general works. Particularly when things go wrong.

Case in point, I reported a bug in the iOS ePub reader I was using (crashing on the iOS beta I was running), and the developer responded to say they were working on it.Contrast that with the little bugs I’ve reported to Apple; they’ve not been fixed, and I don’t know if they ever will be. It’s disheartening and has undermined my trust in my phone’s OS and the company behind it.What I know from years of dealing with customers is that listening to their problems and acknowledging them, even if you can’t fix anything, works wonders (1).I once talked with a man who’d been utterly let down by our phone system as he waited outside to get his groceries: we’d told him he could come in early as we had his order done, but the system didn’t know that. When I went outside he was super frustrated, and rightly so. I heard him out and acknowledged that we’d dropped the ball, then asked him if he still wanted his groceries. It’s amazing how just being willing to listen can turn a situation from one where no one is happy to one that you can laugh about together (at how stupid software can be!).1: part of listening and acknowledging is becoming the customer’s advocate and elevating as needed; this was something I did.

I just have to copy paste the interesting stuff into the bug report window with basic context clues. And if the bug is persistant, 90% of the time i can find the complete logs easily (tbf it happened once, so i&#x27;m lying about the 90% :P).When i&#x27;m on Window playing Anno (or using discord), or on MacOs jamming, i don&#x27;t think i ever submitted a real bug report, because i just don&#x27;t have the logs easily accessible, and when the bug is persistant and prevent me from doing X, since i don&#x27;t have a clue where i can find the &#x2F;var&#x2F;log equivalent, i just boot linux and do something else. reply CoastalCoder 18 hours agoprevI&#x27;m curious if this has to do with people&#x27;s day job.I&#x27;m guessing that software developers make a bigger fraction of Linux gamers than of Windows gamers. reply TheRoque 18 hours agoparentI think it has to do more about the fact that people using Linux are more educated about software, sharing knowledge, and working for fr...

The customer is always right __in matters of taste__. Users will often try to be helpful and make suggestions about how problems may be solved. This suggestion will often be bad. But remember that the system is more opaque to them so they may not see all the complexity that exists. BUT this does not mean that their issue is bad. If the user has an issue, the user has an issue and someone reporting is not just one. They&#x27;re just the one to report. You can throw away the bad suggested solution and still address the issue. Read the suggestion instead as additional context in to understand what the user really is looking for, i.e. taste. Never respond with \"rtfm\" and instead with \"here&#x27;s a link to the specific section in our documentation with an explanation.\" Far too many developers think that simply because documentation exists that it is clear and understandable. Far too many times have I made a report, referenced the documentation, and gotten back \"well you just need tojust rtfm.\" Even in instances where I&#x27;ve demonstrated a solution but am reporting unexpected behavior. Too many times I&#x27;ve gotten \"well that&#x27;s actually x&#x27;s problem, not ours\" and the cycle. If users are using your software, it&#x27;s your problem and you must communicate upstream, not the user. This is why I do not contribute as much anymore. It&#x27;s just too exhausting and I&#x27;m not alone.And let&#x27;s not rely on internal communities for reporting cough signal cough. I see these everywhere, places like Signal, Spotify, Microsoft, etc. If you got a github, leave it open and respond to it. I love Signal but the community forums are an absolute shithole of people who understand neither privacy or security. They are worse than the arch forums. Most internal communities, volunteer moderated, are destined for this unbearable quality. You&#x27;re just creating a breeding ground for toxicity, not creating a centralized location for bug tracking and community engagement. You got to go wherever your customers are. If they keep trying to report on github you accept that that&#x27;s where they come through, not send them down another channel where they must make another account.

    "originLink": "https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/23/branches-intuition-reality/",
    "originBody": "git branches: intuition & reality • git • Hello! I’ve been working on writing a zine about git so I’ve been thinking about git branches a lot. I keep hearing from people that they find the way git branches work to be counterintuitive. It got me thinking: what might an “intuitive” notion of a branch be, and how is it different from how git actually works? So in this post I want to briefly talk about an intuitive mental model I think many people have how git actually represents branches internally (“branches are a pointer to a commit” etc) how the “intuitive model” and the real way it works are actually pretty closely related some limits of the intuitive model and why it might cause problems Nothing in this post is remotely groundbreaking so I’m going to try to keep it pretty short. an intuitive model of a branch Of course, people have many different intuitions about branches. Here’s the one that I think corresponds most closely to the physical “a branch of an apple tree” metaphor. My guess is that a lot of people think about a git branch like this: the 2 commits in pink in this picture are on a “branch”. I think there are two important things about this diagram: the branch has 2 commits on it the branch has a “parent” (main) which it’s an offshoot of That seems pretty reasonable, but that’s not how git defines a branch – most importantly, git doesn’t have any concept of a branch’s “parent”. So how does git define a branch? in git, a branch is the full history In git, a branch is the full history of every previous commit, not just the “offshoot” commits. So in our picture above both branches (main and branch) have 4 commits on them. I made an example repository at https://github.com/jvns/branch-example which has its branches set up the same way as in the picture above. Let’s look at the 2 branches: main has 4 commits on it: $ git log --oneline main 70f727a d f654888 c 3997a46 b a74606f a and mybranch has 4 commits on it too. The bottom two commits are shared between both branches. $ git log --oneline mybranch 13cb960 y 9554dab x 3997a46 b a74606f a So mybranch has 4 commits on it, not just the 2 commits 13cb960 and 9554dab that are “offshoot” commits. You can get git to draw all the commits on both branches like this: $ git log --all --oneline --graph * 70f727a (HEAD -> main, origin/main) d * f654888 c* 13cb960 (origin/mybranch, mybranch) y* 9554dab x |/ * 3997a46 b * a74606f a a branch is stored as a commit ID Internally in git, branches are stored as tiny text files which have a commit ID in them. That commit is the latest commit on the branch. This is the “technically correct” definition I was talking about at the beginning. Let’s look at the text files for main and mybranch in our example repo: $ cat .git/refs/heads/main 70f727acbe9ea3e3ed3092605721d2eda8ebb3f4 $ cat .git/refs/heads/mybranch 13cb960ad86c78bfa2a85de21cd54818105692bc This makes sense: 70f727 is the latest commit on main and 13cb96 is the latest commit on mybranch. The reason this works is that every commit contains a pointer to its parent(s), so git can follow the chain of pointers to get every commit on the branch. Like I mentioned before, the thing that’s missing here is any relationship at all between these two branches. There’s no indication that mybranch is an offshoot of main. Now that we’ve talked about how the intuitive notion of a branch is “wrong”, I want to talk about how it’s also right in some very important ways. people’s intuition is usually not that wrong I think it’s pretty popular to tell people that their intuition about git is “wrong”. I find that kind of silly – in general, even if people’s intuition about a topic is technically incorrect in some ways, people usually have the intuition they do for very legitimate reasons! “Wrong” models can be super useful. So let’s talk about 3 ways the intuitive “offshoot” notion of a branch matches up very closely with how we actually use git in practice. rebases use the “intuitive” notion of a branch Now let’s go back to our original picture. When you rebase mybranch on main, it takes the commits on the “intuitive” branch (just the 2 pink commits) and replays them onto main. The result is that just the 2 (x and y) get copied. Here’s what that looks like: $ git switch mybranch $ git rebase main $ git log --oneline mybranch 952fa64 (HEAD -> mybranch) y 7d50681 x 70f727a (origin/main, main) d f654888 c 3997a46 b a74606f a Here git rebase has created two new commits (952fa64 and 7d50681) whose information comes from the previous two x and y commits. So the intuitive model isn’t THAT wrong! It tells you exactly what happens in a rebase. But because git doesn’t know that mybranch is an offshoot of main, you need to tell it explicitly where to rebase the branch. merges use the “intuitive” notion of a branch too Merges don’t copy commits, but they do need a “base” commit: the way merges work is that it looks at two sets of changes (starting from the shared base) and then merges them. Let’s undo the rebase we just did and then see what the merge base is. $ git switch mybranch $ git reset --hard 13cb960 # undo the rebase $ git merge-base main mybranch 3997a466c50d2618f10d435d36ef12d5c6f62f57 This gives us the “base” commit where our branch branched off, 3997a4. That’s exactly the commit you would think it might be based on our intuitive picture. github pull requests also use the intuitive idea If we create a pull request on GitHub to merge mybranch into main, it’ll also show us 2 commits: the commits x and y. That makes sense and also matches our intuitive notion of a branch. I assume if you make a merge request on GitLab it shows you something similar. intuition is pretty good, but it has some limits This leaves our intuitive definition of a branch looking pretty good actually! The “intuitive” idea of what a branch is matches exactly with how merges and rebases and GitHub pull requests work. You do need to explicitly specify the other branch when merging or rebasing or making a pull request (like git rebase main), because git doesn’t know what branch you think your offshoot is based on. But the intuitive notion of a branch has one fairly serious problem: the way you intuitively think about main and an offshoot branch are very different, and git doesn’t know that. So let’s talk about the different kinds of git branches. trunk and offshoot branches To a human, main and mybranch are pretty different, and you probably have pretty different intentions around how you want to use them. I think it’s pretty normal to think of some branches as being “trunk” branches, and some branches as being “offshoots”. Also you can have an offshoot of an offshoot. Of course, git itself doesn’t make any such distinctions (the term “offshoot” is one I just made up!), but what kind of a branch it is definitely affects how you treat it. For example: you might rebase mybranch onto main but you probably wouldn’t rebase main onto mybranch – that would be weird! in general people are much more careful around rewriting the history on “trunk” branches than short-lived offshoot branches git lets you do rebases “backwards” One thing I think throws people off about git is – because git doesn’t have any notion of whether a branch is an “offshoot” of another branch, it won’t give you any guidance about if/when it’s appropriate to rebase branch X on branch Y. You just have to know. for example, you can do either: $ git checkout main $ git rebase mybranch or $ git checkout mybranch $ git rebase main Git will happily let you do either one, even though in this case git rebase main is extremely normal and git rebase mybranch is pretty weird. A lot of people said they found this confusing so here’s a picture of the two kinds of rebases: Similarly, you can do merges “backwards”, though that’s much more normal than doing a backwards rebase – merging mybranch into main and main into mybranch are both useful things to do for different reasons. Here’s a diagram of the two ways you can merge: git’s lack of hierarchy between branches is a little weird I hear the statement “the main branch is not special” a lot and I’ve been puzzled about it – in most of the repositories I work in, main is pretty special! Why are people saying it’s not? I think the point is that even though branches do have relationships between them (main is often special!), git doesn’t know anything about those relationships. You have to tell git explicitly about the relationship between branches every single time you run a git command like git rebase or git merge, and if you make a mistake things can get really weird. I don’t know whether git’s design here is “right” or “wrong” (it definitely has some pros and cons, and I’m very tired of reading endless arguments about it), but I do think it’s surprising to a lot of people for good reason. git’s UI around branches is weird too Let’s say you want to look at just the “offshoot” commits on a branch, which as we’ve discussed is a completely normal thing to want. Here’s how to see just the 2 offshoot commits on our branch with git log: $ git switch mybranch $ git log main..mybranch --oneline 13cb960 (HEAD -> mybranch, origin/mybranch) y 9554dab x You can look at the combined diff for those same 2 commits with git diff like this: $ git diff main...mybranch So to see the 2 commits x and y with git log, you need to use 2 dots (..), but to look at the same commits with git diff, you need to use 3 dots (...). Personally I can never remember what .. and ... mean so I just avoid them completely even though in principle they seem useful. in GitHub, the default branch is special Also, it’s worth mentioning that GitHub does have a “special branch”: every github repo has a “default branch” (in git terms, it’s what HEAD points at), which is special in the following ways: it’s what you check out when you git clone the repository it’s the default destination for pull requests github will suggest that you protect the default branch from force pushes and probably even more that I’m not thinking of. that’s all! This all seems extremely obvious in retrospect, but it took me a long time to figure out what a more “intuitive” idea of a branch even might be because I was so used to the technical “a branch is a reference to a commit” definition. I also hadn’t really thought about how git makes you tell it about the hierarchy between your branches every time you run a git rebase or git merge command – for me it’s second nature to do that and it’s not a big deal, but now that I’m thinking about it, it’s pretty easy to see how somebody could get mixed up.

    "commentBody": "Git Branches: Intuition and RealityHacker NewspastloginGit Branches: Intuition and Reality (jvns.ca) 357 points by tambourine_man 19 hours ago| hidepastfavorite227 comments riperoni 18 hours agoWhile the explanation is right in some sense, it misses a few points.Branches are pointers to a commit and that pointer is refreshed when a new commit is created. One could say they are a wandering tag (without explaining a tag for now).The actual chain of commits that represent what we see as branch comes from the commits themselves. Those commits point back to their parent commit.And then one can see why no branch has any special meaning: It is a chain of related commits with a named entrypoint. Once you delete a branch (i.e. the named wandering pointer to a commit), you cannot identify a branch as such anymore. It is just a chain of related commits without a named label now. And nothing besides the name distinguished the branch from other commit chains before.The master&#x2F;dev&#x2F;release branches are then a convention to keep an updated commit pointer on the chain of commits containing changes of interest. reply jillesvangurp 15 hours agoparentA key point with git is that every clone is effectively its own set of branches; even if they have the same name. The mechanisms you use for synchronizing your local branches with some remote branches are exactly the same as the mechanisms you use between to your local named branches.Git was actually designed initially for email based workflows where there was no central remote at all. Basically, that works by exporting patches and then applying them to your local branch. The branch name isn&#x27;t even part of the patch.A git patch is just a textualized form of the list of commits you created locally. You can apply them to any branch you like. As long as you and whomever applies the patch has a common ancestor commit in common, the patch may merge cleanly. It&#x27;s good hygiene to ensure it does by for example rebasing&#x2F;merging&#x2F;squashing before you email somebody your patches. If that somebody is called Linus Torvalds, he&#x27;s going to be pretty strict about things like commit messages and things not being spaghetti ball of merges, reverts, forks, etc. Your mess, your problem. Linux development still works via mailing list. And forget about emailing him directly with a patch; you need to use the mailing lists like everybody else. And he works with a network of senior contributors that screen everything that comes in and that aggregate all the patches coming from upstream. So, he only gets involved at the end of the process.Of course the rest of us use network protocols to sync our repositories. But the important distinction here is that this is a two step process. First you fetch content from remote. This is simply ensuring you have all the commit objects you need in your local git database. Any branches you have are simply text files with the commit content hash they point to as the content in .git&#x2F;refs&#x2F;heads. Remote branches are the same but live in your local .git&#x2F;refs&#x2F;remotes&#x2F;. Those branches might be named something like origin&#x2F;main to make it clear that that is a local branch from the origin remote. And then you rebase&#x2F;merge between your local and \"remote\" (i.e. also local) branch as needed. Pull is just short hand for doing both steps in one go. All merges are local. Same with rebases.Most of the conventions people project on git are kind of cultural and vary between people and companies. It&#x27;s helpful to read up on the git internals in the Git book. Github is sort of an opinionated take on this that back in the day made people coming from centralized version systems like subversion feel at home by providing a central repository and allowing them to push their changes there or \"share\" branches there. Not necessarily a great idea for bigger projects and limiting write access is common on Github. reply PaulDavisThe1st 10 hours agorootparent> A git patch is just a textualized form of the list of commits you created locally. You can apply them to any branch you like.Not even branch. You can combine two unrelated repositories, and in theory you could cherry-pick commits from one of the original repositories to the other.Of course, in practice this rarely works because the files mentioned in the commit don&#x27;t exist in the other repository. But there&#x27;s nothing in git&#x27;s mechanisms that stops this: it&#x27;s just a bunch of commits, which are actually just a bunch of file contents.The whole \"diff\" or \"patch\" concept in git is just way of doing data presentation - rather than showing you the actual commit, which is generally not helpful, it shows you the difference between the contents of the commit, and the same files in the state referenced by the previous commit. reply jillesvangurp 1 hour agorootparentGit commits always have a parent. Applying git patches to a repository without the parent is not going to work. The repository must have the parent commit. You might force it to work without that but it&#x27;s going to create conflicts, complicate merging, etc.The reason is that a git patch is not merely a diff but an export of the actual commit objects and referred content (trees, blob diffs, hashes, etc.). Applying the patch recreates the exact commit objects on the other side. The end state is exactly the same as if you would have merged the commits from some branch. There is no difference.Git diff, shows you a normal diff. It&#x27;s not the same thing. You can indeed apply such diffs to your local work copy. But that&#x27;s not the same thing as a git patch.The commands you need are git format-patch (exports the patch) and git apply (applies it). reply pdonis 10 hours agorootparentprev> The branch name isn&#x27;t even part of the patch.More generally, the branch name is not stored with commits; it has to be computed by walking back from the branch tips, and commits can have multiple possible branch names based on this. In other words, git does not preserve information about which branch was actually active when you made a particular commit. (Mercurial, by contrast, stores the branch that was active when a commit was made in the commit, so that information is preserved.) The article discusses some implications of this, although it doesn&#x27;t phrase it quite the way I did above. reply loeg 16 hours agoparentprevI think this is covered adequately (if less completely) in the \"technically correct\" definition section. reply cesarb 10 hours agoparentprev> Branches are pointers to a commit and that pointer is refreshed when a new commit is created. One could say they are a wandering tag (without explaining a tag for now).A good name for these \"wandering tags\" would be \"heads\", since it&#x27;s what git calls them internally (for instance, when not packed, they&#x27;re stored at the \"refs&#x2F;heads&#x2F;\" path in the repository). This also exposes a distinction between a \"branch\" and its \"head\", and that distinction can be useful. reply lisper 10 hours agorootparentJust to make this explicit: a branch in the chain of commits. The start of the chain is pointed to by a head. When you create a new commit on a branch, the head (of that branch) changes to point to the new commit. reply lisper 3 hours agorootparentArrggh. A branch IS a chain of commits. reply galaxyLogic 8 hours agorootparentprevSo would it be correct to say that &#x27;heads&#x27; are the LEAVES of the commits-tree?Or are there such leaves which are not considered &#x27;heads&#x27;? reply Lornedon 8 hours agorootparentNo. There are leaves that aren&#x27;t heads (for example, after you delete a branch, the old commits just lie around until someone deliberately cleans them up), and there are heads that arent&#x27; leaves (for example if you branch a new feature branch from main. The feature branch brances off of main, so main is not a leaf anymore) reply zie 7 hours agoparentprevaka Git is the simplest crappiest implementation that can work. Then they tacked a terrible UX onto it and shipped it. Chaos ensued and we as devs have spent the last almost 20 years fighting over trying to understand the chaos, we would have been way better off staying with SVN or Mercurial or Fossil(or pretty much any other VCS), but that ship has sailed and now we are stuck in the chaos.Now nobody understands their VCS and nobody will ever understand it, as the explanations are either too detailed and miss the forest for the trees or too high level and skip over all the trees that kill you when you accidentally run into them.I hope someone somewhere manages to convince us all to move to something sane. reply tharkun__ 6 hours agorootparentWith all due respect, what a load of crap!SVN, branching that takes forever instead of a simple file with a commit hash in it? Are you serious?Mercurial, when I had to use it for almost 2 years? The single thing I missed the most is the fact that \"everything is just a label\" (or pointer if you will).Fossil I can&#x27;t comment on with certainty, as I never really used it.This is probably gonna get voted into oblivion, but most devs just don&#x27;t get VCS, period (yes I&#x27;m a dev, so this is an inside perspective). Git or not. They didn&#x27;t get it in CVS days, they didn&#x27;t get it in SVN days and they didn&#x27;t get various commercial ones either. Somehow most devs just don&#x27;t grok version control trees.But so far git is the single best VCS I have got to use. Everything that I actually need day to day follows from grokking the one simple rule: All those branches and tags are just labels&#x2F;pointers&#x2F;sticky notes and you can move them around at will and it&#x27;s fast.I do get that there are tricky situations with octopus merges and all that jazz and the Linux kernel and a few other open source projects are probably some of the trickier use cases to understand. For your run of the mill corporate situation? Keep `master`&#x2F;`main`&#x2F;`whateveryoucallit` history straight with one commit per feature&#x2F;change by doing rebases and squashing and you will never have a single minute of misunderstanding what is going on. IFF you grok that \"everything is just a label\" and you&#x27;ve actually \"created a branch\" by just creating a file in `.git&#x2F;refs&#x2F;heads&#x2F;` yourself!And the second rule is: before you try anything, just: commit! And never close that terminal window. You might need that commit hash to reattach a label to it after you \"destroyed\" your branch (but git has not garbage collected yet and it&#x27;s all actually still there). Or someone else still has your commits and you just get them from there and reattach a label. It&#x27;s really so simple. reply gpderetta 1 hour agorootparent> never close that terminal window. You might need that commit hash to reattach a label to it after you \"destroyed\" your branchThat&#x27;s where the reflog comes handy. reply jansan 17 hours agoparentprevThis was the most useful piece of information that I have ever read about Git.But what happens if you merge branch A into beanch B? A and B will both contain the commits of A, but in B there may be commits of B between the commits that were merged. Do the same commits of A then have different parents depending on which branch they are on? reply tharkun__ 17 hours agorootparentI keep repeating this every time someone talks about git and finds something weird or doesn&#x27;t get branches, so I&#x27;m really glad your parent mentioned it as well and I know there&#x27;s someone else out there that \"gets\" that: In git it&#x27;s all just labels&#x2F;pointersIt&#x27;s not useful at all to think about branches as the user sees them as \"things\" of their own. Branches don&#x27;t \"have\" anything. Branches in that sense are just convenient labels.Of course actual \"branches\" in the commit tree exist whether you label them or not. Until `git` does a garbage collection and gets rid of anything that doesn&#x27;t have a pointer ultimately leading to it - something that a human would understand aka branch&#x2F;tag. And that&#x27;s why we call these labels \"branches\" as well but it&#x27;s actually one word for two things here. The actual tree branch and the label that&#x27;s called branch.And a branch and a tag are basically the same exact thing underneath, just a file in the `.git` directory somewhere that contains a commit hash. All the meaning and differentiation of branch or tag is just in the human brain and how we and our tools treat them. Such as if you look at a particular commit in your tool of choice, it will tell you which branch it&#x27;s part of. To create a branch you can literally just create a thousand randomly named files in the right part of the `.git` directory containing the same commit hash and suddenly this commit \"is on all those branches\". That&#x27;s what git does and why creating a branch in git is so super fast. reply seba_dos1 17 hours agorootparentTo make things more complicated, the word \"tag\" is also overloaded. It can either be just a reference (in git lingo, a \"ref\") to a commit - just like a branch, only differing from it in how the tools treat it; but they can also be \"annotated tags\" which are pointing to a special tag object which contains some metadata and only then points to a specific commit (or other kind of object...) :) reply evntdrvn 13 hours agorootparentYou’ll also see the first type referred to as “lightweight tags”, if that helps anyone :) reply paulddraper 17 hours agorootparentprevMerging branch A into branch B does two things:1. Create a new merge commit with two parents: the commit pointed to by A and the commit pointed to by B.2. Set branch B to point at the new merge commit.This is a non-linear history; when comparing some commits there isn&#x27;t a \"before\" or \"after.\" reply emilecantin 5 hours agorootparentTo complete the answer, the only difference if you merge branch B into branch A is that A is advanced to the new commit instead. reply hackernews1134 10 hours agorootparentprevIf I checkout the merge commit and then do a ‘git log -n 5’, which parent pointer is followed to show the previous commit logs? A or B or Both &#x2F; all if it is more than a 2-way merge? reply paulddraper 7 hours agorootparentBy default it&#x27;s by commit date.Other ordering is possible, e.g. --topo-order reply baronswindle 9 hours agorootparentprevAs I recall, it shows commits from both parents in order of the committed date. reply seba_dos1 17 hours agorootparentprev> Do the same commits of A then have different parents depending on which branch they are on?Absolutely not. Commits are immutable (representing whole repo state, not a diff), and branches are just (mutable) pointers to them.As the sibling already noted, a merge commit is just a regular commit. It simply points to multiple parents, \"merging\" them. Aside of the whole machinery to resolve conflicts etc. that&#x27;s pretty much all there is to it.When your graph topology allows it, you can also merge branches without generating a new commit (so called \"fast forward\" merges) - such a merge does nothing but rewrites the branch pointer. You can also create merge commits that point to more parents than two (\"octopus\" merges). Reconciling the commits&#x27; content can get quite complicated in such cases, but from the repo graph perspective it&#x27;s nothing special. reply xorcist 11 hours agorootparent> Commits are immutable (representing whole repo state, not a diff)To make things more clear: Repo state here is the contents of all files, and some metadata including a pointer to the previous commit.So a commit hash uniquely identifies not only a set of files but the unique history leading up to it! That&#x27;s why we some people like to call git the original block chain (there&#x27;s no proof of work involved of course so it can never be used for payments or anything like that, but the merkle tree bit is similar enough). reply loeg 16 hours agorootparentprevIn short: merge commits have multiple parent commits. So your tree tracing logic bifurcates at that point. The commits in the merged history are not altered by the merge commit; they each have a single parent commit (unless they are also merge commits). reply skrebbel 17 hours agoparentprevFor years I was deeply annoyed by the terrible name “branch” for something that acts more like a bookmark (or “wandering tag” indeed!).And then I learned that git branches are branches in exactly the same way that the first element of a linked list in C “is” the linked list. Git was made by C people and they’re used to referring to entire data structures by way of some root element.I mean that doesn’t make me dislike the name any less but at least now I see where they were coming from. reply mr_mitm 16 hours agorootparentWhen the entire structure of commits is called a tree, I find the name \"branch\" fitting. The branch is identified by its head commit, so the path from head to root is uniquely defined and that&#x27;s the branch. (Disregarding merges for now.) reply TeMPOraL 16 hours agorootparent> Disregarding merges for now.Without disregarding them, it&#x27;s not a tree, but a DAG. reply dayjaby 12 hours agorootparentIt is a tree. What makes you think it&#x27;s just a DAG? Are there commits with multiple parent commits or what? reply zaphar 12 hours agorootparentThere absolutely can be. Merge commits have multiple parent commits for example. It&#x27;s definitely a graph not just a tree. reply dayjaby 11 hours agorootparentParent comment was about disregarding merge commits. reply zaphar 9 hours agorootparentYou can&#x27;t disregard merge commits. It&#x27;s part of the structure. reply imron 12 hours agorootparentprevYes. Merge commits have two parents. reply Izkata 11 hours agorootparentTwo or more. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a limit.Try not to do this (imagine a 5-way merge conflict). reply skrebbel 13 hours agorootparentprevFWIW “tree” has a specific, different meaning in Git. It’s a file tracking the contents of a directory. reply cpeterso 13 hours agorootparentprevLeaning into the tree metaphor (and following the precedent of other version control systems), git should have used the term trunk instead of master or main. reply hnarn 12 hours agorootparentWhy? That would heavily imply that master&#x2F;main is somehow technically different from all other branches (since a trunk is certainly not a branch), which to my knowledge is not true. reply Kuraj 9 hours agorootparentprevBy following this metaphor, a trunk would be the original commit, whereas branches are the tree branch tips. reply galaxyLogic 8 hours agorootparentAnd consider that because every folder can have its own .git subfolder, we can have several paralle trunks&#x2F;repositories at the same time, meaning we have a forest.I haven&#x27;t really seen specific guidelines as to when and why should anyone start a new repo. Are there some? Or is \"mono-repo\" the best solution, and when and for whom. Surely we need more than one git-repo in the whole world?! reply lmm 8 hours agorootparentprevWell yes if you disregard the thing that makes it not a tree then it is a tree. But you can&#x27;t disregard that! reply imron 12 hours agorootparentprev> Git was made by C peopleThis is why I think of branches as pointers. The file contents are literally just a pointer to a commit on the DAG. reply cpeterso 13 hours agorootparentprev> acts more like a bookmarkIn fact, Mercurial uses the term “bookmark” for its lightweight, git-like branching. Mercurial’s branches have slightly different semantics and can’t be deleted like bookmarks or git branches reply neuromanser 16 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s (most probably) where the \"head\" terminology comes from, too. reply alfredpawney 14 hours agorootparentYes you are correct. It traces back to Allen Newell reply OJFord 9 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t see the problem?Real natural tree branches grow.If you move the branch to point somewhere else, then it&#x27;s better&#x2F;more accurately said that you changed the name to refer to a different branch. We can think of branches as the chains of commits; it&#x27;s the names we give them that &#x27;wander&#x27; both as we commit and if we move them to a different branch. But merging (as it were!) the concepts of branches and names for their tips is convenient, and often equivalent&#x2F;inconsequential. reply ajross 16 hours agorootparentprev> Git was made by C people and they’re used to referring to entire data structures by way of some root element.FWIW this is actually backwards. The word \"branch\" was already in common use (to refer to the same basic idea) in SCM systems going back decades, and in almost all of those a \"branch\" was indeed a first class object with its own data that acted as a \"container\" for commits, both semantically and physically.The fact that a \"branch\" is just a pointer is in fact a git innovation on top of the former idea. reply mtnygard 18 hours agoprevI have found that git makes a lot more sense if you reverse the mental model of lineage. People think about a lineage going forward. But a more useful way to think is in terms of backward pointers.A commit points to it&#x27;s parent(s). Since a branch is just a commit ID, you can follow the parent links backwards to find the whole history of that branch.So a \"branch point\" is just where two chains of parent links converge.The special part are merge commits. Those have multiple parents, indicating that two histories fused into one. reply layer8 18 hours agoparentThe issue is that if you consider a branch to be what is really the history of the branch tip, then a branch is not just the part starting from the last join with another branch. Instead it is some directed path through the commit DAG, a path that in general can’t be reconstructed from the information Git keeps.If, for example, you have a structure likeo &#x2F; \\ o o A| B o o \\ &#x2F; o &#x2F; \\ o o C| D o o \\ &#x2F; o |then conceptually the path CA might be one branch and DB the other branch (or alternatively, CB and DA). But this is not something that is represented in Git’s model. reply Izkata 11 hours agorootparentYou can reconstruct it manually with a combination of the parent commit order and the automatic merge commit message, if you didn&#x27;t change the commit message. But yeah, that second part isn&#x27;t recorded in the structure itself. reply vifon 17 hours agorootparentprevThis missing piece of information would be essentially `git reflog`, except it&#x27;s not something Git sends between the clones. reply lifeisstillgood 13 hours agorootparentprevJust to go off on a tangent - that&#x27;s a pretty neat diagram for a throw away comment. was that just careful spacing in the HN textbox or did you use a tool - which one ? :-) reply grodriguez100 13 hours agorootparent“Text after a blank line that is indented by two or more spaces is reproduced verbatim. (This is intended for code.)”Looks like this also switches to a monospaced font, which makes it easier to draw ASCII art. This should be rendered using a monospaced font. _____ \\ &#x2F; \\ &#x2F; O reply ajross 16 hours agorootparentprev> a path that in general can’t be reconstructed from the information Git keeps.Uh... yes it can. Commits have a list of 0 or more parents. That creates a DAG. There are literal hordes of tools out there that reliably interpret this, from visualizer tools to practical mutators like git bisect.Maybe you&#x27;re trying to say that no single commit order exists that traverses the whole tree. That&#x27;s true, because branches can merge together. But it remains a completely interpretable graph nonetheless. reply layer8 16 hours agorootparentThat’s not what I was saying. I was referring to the history of branch tips. reply ajross 15 hours agorootparentBut that&#x27;s not related to the DAG at all. The branch can be changed at any moment for any reason to point to any commit with any content.But it&#x27;s true that conventionally, a new branch tip should always have the previous branch tip as an ancestor. But not always as a direct parent, and even if so it might be a merge commit that joins two different branches. There is indeed no single spanning path through a DAG.But trying to explain it as \"git doesn&#x27;t store enough information\" to construct that spanning path seems confused to me. It&#x27;s not about what git stores, it&#x27;s just math: there is no such path in the general case, period. reply layer8 15 hours agorootparentThe fact that the branch tip can be moved to unrelated commits is another issue with Git’s model, and a mismatch to the intuitive “a named lineage in the DAG” conception of branches. In other VCSs, that would be a new&#x2F;different branch, and you could still rename branches so that the same name will later refer to a different branch, but the branch history as such (including renames) would be preserved. reply ajross 13 hours agorootparent> mismatch to the intuitive “a named lineage in the DAG” conception of branchesOnce more, that conception may be intuitive but it is wrong. A branch is emphatically NOT a line through the DAG, it&#x27;s the whole DAG. There simply is no single list of patches to apply to get from one commit to another, even if both were at some point heads of the same branch, and even if one is an ancestor of the other.And the reason it&#x27;s wrong is that branches can merge together. You can have commit A descended from both the \"main\" branch and the \"topic_a\" branch, despite the fact that those two had diverged. This isn&#x27;t a bug, it&#x27;s a feature. You don&#x27;t have to use it if you don&#x27;t want to (lots of projects require linear commit histories in their main branch), but it&#x27;s part of the tool nonetheless because some projects (Linux especially) use it heavily and to great effect. reply layer8 10 hours agorootparentI don’t see what is wrong. Branches in that conception are paths through the DAG. One would like to annotate such paths with names, and have those names automatically apply by default when adding a commit to the end of such a path.This has nothing to do with lists of patches. Nevertheless, for any given path, it is always possible to compute a list of patches that would match that path. Just compute the diffs between all adjacent pairs of commits on that path. What you maybe mean is that you can’t replay just a single path and have it result in the same commit hash. That, of course, is correct, you need to replay the complete prefix DAG. However, I don’t see why you think that causes issues for the branches-as-paths conception.Yes, branches can merge together. That just means that different paths can share nodes and edges. Just like two hiking trails can partially overlap. Again, I see no problem here. reply lmm 8 hours agorootparentThe problem is that the thing that Git calls a branch does not identify a specific path. Look at OP&#x27;s example again: if you conceptualize branches as paths, then CA&#x2F;DB and CB&#x2F;DA are distinct ways to divide that graph into branches. But in Git there is no way to represent that distinction (at least, not as branches). reply ajross 8 hours agorootparentprevNo! No, they are not. This is a mistake you are making, and I&#x27;m trying (vainly, maybe) to correct it.If you have a branched structure like that, and dump each commit as a patch, and try to trace a \"path through the DAG\" by applying those patches, you will find that they don&#x27;t apply after the first merge commit. There is no single list of patches, because that&#x27;s not the structure of the history. The merge commit \"patch\" must be a different delta depending on where you came from. replymountainboy 17 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, so then which path(s) does git display when running git-log on this? reply seba_dos1 16 hours agorootparentDefine \"this\". If you git-log from the commit on the top of that ASCII graph, you get all the drawn commits listed (unless adjusted with arguments such as `--no-merges` or `--first-parent`). reply Izkata 11 hours agorootparentprevYou can get ASCII art of that structure with: git log --graph --onelineOlder versions you&#x27;ll also want --decorate to show branches and tags, but I think that&#x27;s on by default now. reply trealira 11 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s how I learned it, not having known anything about git or version control beforehand.

Yes, git has commands for specific combinations of actions, but for an occasional user it&#x27;s harder to remember every such command and which arguments and flags to pass in which order. It&#x27;s either \"look through documentation until you find graph diagrams illustrating what will happen for this order of arguments and flags\" or \"use the primitives &#x27;move branch pointer&#x27;, &#x27;commit to branch&#x27;, &#x27;hold these changes for a second&#x27; for obtaining the commit tree you actually want. Knowing that the reflog exists also makes this insane-sounding working mode pretty non-scary. And yes, some operations (e.g. cherry-pick) you just need to do the \"real\" way.(My git stash obsession is most likely just damage from years of using Perforce, which doesn&#x27;t have a modified&#x2F;staged distinction.

When you merge two regular branches, the commit message is `Merge branch &#x27;source&#x27; into destination`. But not if destination is `master` or `main` – the `into ...` part is omitted for those merge commits.But this is just for backward compatibility. Git is very conservative in changing such user facing behavior as generated merge commit messages. To get Git to treat `master` and `main` truly without special handling, set empty value to config option `merge.suppressDest` [1]: $ git config merge.suppressDest \"\"`master` is also used as the default name for the default branch in newly created repositories. See option `--initial-branch` of `git init` and config variable `init.defaultBranch` [2] to override.

I wish the tech was more approachable on its own, but perhaps this is the natural evolution of things. reply ndriscoll 16 hours agorootparentAs one of those people that thinks it&#x27;s extremely intuitive, I have to wonder where the confused people are learning about git. The documentation on the site[0] is quite clear:> A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.It has multiple diagrams explaining how commits point to their content and their parents, and branches point to commits. The Pro Git content has been there for at least 10 years (it&#x27;s what I learned from 10 years ago).Maybe the problem is just that the Internet is full of blogs that have incorrect diagrams (like those in the OP) and bad explanations, despite the main website having great documentation![0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2&#x2F;Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-N... reply chihuahua 15 hours agorootparentIf Git was \"extremely intuitive\", and the documentation was \"great\", why would so many otherwise smart people keep writing blogs about it with incorrect diagrams?What is your theory about why so many people are having difficulty creating a correct mental model about Git, and why so many people are writing incorrect blogs about it? reply ndriscoll 14 hours agorootparentLike I sort of implied, my theory is people haven&#x27;t read the docs on the official site (or the book that&#x27;s on the site), and keep regurgitating bad information that they read on some blog or howto site.

I don&#x27;t make these sites, so I don&#x27;t know what motivates people who do, especially people who don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re writing about.If you understand the basic design premise (commits are content-addressed immutable snapshots), the pointer stuff is kind of obvious. It has to work something like that for it to be able to be immutable if you want to be able to make branches&#x2F;tags after the commit is created. reply afiori 13 hours agorootparentprevIn part it is because git is hard to use, in part it is because mostly people learn git by oral tradition and often treat it like sorcery. reply codesnik 15 hours agorootparentprevbecause a) everyone&#x27;s intuition is different, b) sometimes uneducated intuition is just wrong. On a surface level things looks good, but in some specific situation intuitive ways of doing things could be not consistent or don&#x27;t have any solution at all. In this cases you just stuck with magic box of software which did something and you have no idea what and reach for backup.Git is not like that. It is very-very simple. If you learn basics of it, your intuition will align with git&#x27;s \"intuition\" too, and you can do crazy things with total peace of mind, without googling or looking into source code of git to see how they had to make something \"intuitive\" in some definition of the word. reply marcosdumay 16 hours agorootparentprevOften, people&#x27;s intuition is wrong on very important ways, and something that works like they expect is sure to create footguns or just blow up by itself.But I&#x27;m not sure git is a case of this. The DVCS that were created following people&#x27;s intuitions were known to be slow and internally complex, but I have never heard about them failing. (And the slowness is obviously of a kind that can be optimized away.)We just stuck with the worst UI ever devised in public for a VCS because of network effects. reply chihuahua 15 hours agorootparentI totally agree with it being \"the worst UI ever devised\". It&#x27;s fine to use commits with parent pointers and branches as pointers to commits and all the other stuff internally. But there should be a UI wrapped around that that maps to operations that make sense for the purpose of working on a software project.Not this:git merge [-n] [--stat] [--no-commit] [--squash] [--[no-]edit] [--no-verify] [-s ] [-X ] [-S[]] [--[no-]allow-unrelated-histories] [--[no-]rerere-autoupdate] [-m ] [-F ] [--into-name ] [… ] reply chthonicdaemon 16 hours agorootparentprevPeople writing software fall into several categories based on the problem they&#x27;re solving, the reason they&#x27;re solving it and the audience of the solution.I solve my own problems for my own reasons all the time and therefore other people&#x27;s intuitions are immaterial in the process. It would just slow me down to think \"how would other people use this\" when I&#x27;m focused on some technical personal problem.Commercial software developers solve problems with the clear purpose of selling the solution to others and where they know ahead of time roughly what their audience&#x27;s intuitions are. This is why intuitive GUI applications exist - there are whole industries devoted to finding out what people expect, what lowers cognitive load etc. iOS and Android apps give you a good idea of what is possible with modern tech when the purposes are properly aligned.The problem here is that git was expressly developed by Linus to solve his own problem in a way that made sense to him with no thought as to how other people would use it. There were no focus groups, early betas, feedback from users and so on. At best there has been slow fixes to the porcelain to fix the stuff that bothers the people who could make a PR to git. On the other hand there are also many front-end projects that attempt to align some other person&#x27;s idea of how version control is supposed to work with the Git model.Anyway - I am in the camp where I very seldom get confused about a git thing because the actual expressed model is really simple (in the way that x86 assembly is a \"simpler\" language than Java). I find most front-ends much more confusing because they don&#x27;t seem to work the way I expect. But I am never surprised when someone&#x27;s pet project is understandable only by themselves. Or indeed when a consumer product is consumer-friendly. The real surprise is when a lone programmer makes something for themselves that then goes on to have wide appeal. reply atq2119 18 hours agorootparentprevYou do have a point, but it&#x27;s not a slam dunk. Intuition isn&#x27;t some fixed thing but arises from personal experience. A lot of that is common to a culture, but there are different cultures and in any case, some truly personal aspects remain.There needs to be a balance between creating new, more powerful intuitions, and meeting people at the intuitions they already have.Case in point, Git&#x27;s branching model is pretty intuitive when you understand how Linux kernel development works. Perhaps 0% of the people you&#x27;ve worked with have looked into that. That&#x27;s fine. Different cultures...Another example that may be worth studying is mathematics and the hard sciences. Learning those is a lot about learning powerful intuitions. reply BlueTemplar 16 hours agorootparentYeah, few things are actually \"intuitive\". \"Shared familiarity\" is probably a better term. reply timacles 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is the same reasoning that SQL gets criticized with. But the answer is simple.Git (and sql) range from simple task to very complicated. Everyone likes to fantasize about making it easier but they’re only thinking about the fraction of functionality they use, rather than everything it currently does.If someone could come up with a simpler solution they would, but they can’t because git can do extremely complicated things and is internally consistent. Most people underestimate that part reply xanderlewis 18 hours agorootparentprevThat doesn’t seem like the opposite to me. It seems like the same thing. Rather than rejecting people’s intuition as ‘understandable but wrong’ why don’t we use it as the basis for a better solution? reply eviks 17 hours agorootparentprevPartially because that&#x27;s a much harder design challenge, especially for people with an unrelated skill set reply webstrand 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m still missing what part of the intuition is incorrect? It seems like the only \"incorrectness\" is that there&#x27;s no explicit hierarchy of branches. Except that&#x27;s wrong the HEAD ref points to the default branch. Any other branches are of equal significance, though. reply Sharlin 18 hours agorootparentNo, the HEAD ref points to whatever branch is \"active\", that&#x27;s how the active branch is defined. Indeed `git checkout branchname` does nothing except make HEAD point to the commit that `refs&#x2F;heads&#x2F;branchname` points to.The intuition jvns meant is the idea that a branch only constitutes the commits since the point of divergence, but every branch actually contains the full history up to the root of its tree, and `git log` of course shows that. (If you want to only show the commits specific to a branch, you can do `git log parent..branch`. Note also that two branches need not have any common history, it&#x27;s perfectly possible for a git graph to be disconnected.) reply xorcist 17 hours agorootparent> `git checkout branchname` does nothing except make HEAD point to the commitYou probably know this, but since we are being pedantic we might as well get it right: That describes \"git reset\". \"git checkout\" does that and record that we are tracking branchname. So any commits will move both HEAD and the branchname reference. reply Izkata 8 hours agorootparentWell along those same lines, making a commit doesn&#x27;t move HEAD, it&#x27;s still pointing at the same branchname as before. cat .git&#x2F;HEAD reply mgerdts 18 hours agorootparentprevIntuition would be that the branch starts at the point that it diverges from main, labeled “base” in the first diagram. In reality, the first commit in “main” and “branch” are the same commit.Intuition likely comes from how a tree (fir or oak, not binary) is structured. Generally a branch starts at the trunk or some other branch, not at the ground where the trunk gives way to roots. reply jancsika 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t agree with the author here.Intuition is travelling down main path that has branches which diverge and re-merge into the main path.That&#x27;s why people seem to intuitively get \"merging\" back into main, whereas that doesn&#x27;t generally make sense for physical trees. reply informalo 18 hours agoparentprevYup. If it works, it ain&#x27;t stupid. reply informalo 18 hours agoprev> You do need to explicitly specify the other branch when merging or rebasing or making a pull request (like git rebase main), because git doesn’t know what branch you think your offshoot is based on.I think a big issue with the presented intuition is that it&#x27;s limited to wanting to merge the base&#x2F;trunk&#x2F;main branch into your feature branch. However, sometimes you want to merge a feature branch into another feature branch. With this in mind, you can form a better intuition, imo, where it&#x27;s absolutely clear that you have to specify what branch you want to merge into another one. reply keybored 18 hours agoprevLately I’ve wanted branches (heads) to have a corresponding tail which points to the base commit that the branch sits on top of (like the commit on `main` when you created the branch).[1] Because branches get rebased all the time and eventually you have six commits out in the Æther somewhere and you have to think twice about where it even starts. And yeah you can probably think for a few seconds and recall that you have worked with John and not Jimmy on this branch so the seventh commit backwards that belongs to Jimmy must be the commit base. Or Git can tell you that the seventh commit belongs to `main` already. But why should you have to expend any effort?You can optionally include the base commit when you send out “patches” to a mailing list.[2] Because it might not have been obvious that you based your changes on:- The latest release- The main development branch- Some integration branch (probably an error)You also need to keep the “base” in mind when you use `git range-diff` because that tool takes two ranges lik `main..previous` and `main..current`. And sometimes you can rely on just using `main..` and letting Git figure it out but in my experience passing an explicit value sometimes works better.`git range-diff` is a super-cool but perhaps niche tool. But you basically have to use it on review round number 2 and higher when you are sending changes to the Git project.[1] This has been discussed before and there was a patch series that implemented it. But that was basically a POC and done in the spirit of “this is useless IMO but here’s how you could do it”... and the implementation didn’t factor in all the shenanigans that you can do with `reset` and `rebase` so it couldn’t have been merged as-is. (Although to be fair: the bar was not set to work perfectly with any kind of branch reset etc., which I suspect is impossible in any case.)[2] Patches after all are just commit messages plus the patches themselves and don’t tell you what they are based on. reply Snarwin 17 hours agoparentIt looks like this is what git merge-base --fork-point is supposed to do, although according to the docs it is not 100% reliable. reply gitanovic 16 hours agoprevI think that one way to \"easily\" understand the syntax of git is to remember that when you perform a command you \"always\" modify the current branchfor example: git merge my-branch will merge my-branch into the current onewhile git rebase my-branch will rebase current one on top of my-branch reply Vinnl 14 hours agoprevYears ago I wrote this dynamic tutorial that visualises branches as you read: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agripongit.vincenttunru.comIt&#x27;s aimed at folks who know how to use `git add` and `git commit`, and would like to spend 15 minutes to form a mental model to help them understand what&#x27;s going on.In case it&#x27;s useful to someone. reply PeterWhittaker 18 hours agoprevI just reread my take on branches and relearned some stuff I’d forgotten: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peter-whittaker.com&#x2F;obligatory-grokking-git-postWarning, all text, no diagrams.... reply Aeolun 9 hours agoprevReading this it seems to me that it should be incredibly easy to create an alternative version of the git client that stores the lineage per branch and can inform people if they’re doing things they probably shouldn’t. reply spenrose 18 hours agoprevIf you learned from this (excellent) piece, I recommend that you buy and work through https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanpub.com&#x2F;learngitthehardway .

I solved it in a grandchild comment.I had so much trouble trying to map my intuited&#x2F;mental model of git onto pygit2 that I gave up and just used the git module.I wanted to automate a fairly simple thing in Python as opposed to bash+commands. My reasoning being that I wanted to do it \"right\" and be a Big Programmer Real Boy(tm). I just wanted to create a branch remotely in Github, pull the repo, and checkout the new branch. I got stuck going in circles trying to figure out why I was always left in detached HEAD state because I didn&#x27;t understand exactly what git was doing during a checkout. # repo has already been pulled if os.path.exists(repo_path): local_repo = git.Repo(path=repo_path) self.log.debug(f\"current branch: {local_repo.active_branch.name}\") local_repo.git.checkout(branch_name)That&#x27;s super easy and is much the same as running the commands in the shell or in a bash script.Of course, I&#x27;ve lost my poor implementation using pygit2, so I&#x27;ll add that later if I find it. Thankfully there&#x27;s a good discussion surrounding the issue I encountered in this excellent \"roll your own git in Python\", which doesn&#x27;t use pygit2, but the concepts are the same: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.leshenko.net&#x2F;p&#x2F;ugit&#x2F;#checkout-switch-branches reply bloopernova 17 hours agoparentThis isn&#x27;t asking someone else to make this work, it&#x27;s more of a caution to convince folks like me to just use \"import git\" rather than pygit2:So something like this was what I expected to work, but leaves the repo in detached head state: import pygit2 def checkout_branch(path, branch_name): repo = pygit2.Repository(path) branch_ref = repo.lookup_reference(f\"refs&#x2F;remotes&#x2F;origin&#x2F;{branch_name}\") print(f\"{branch_ref.name}\") repo.checkout(branch_ref)The branch_ref.name prints \"refs&#x2F;remotes&#x2F;origin&#x2F;test\" but git status says \"HEAD detached at origin&#x2F;test\"So I&#x27;m probably feeding the wrong thing into repo.checkout, but I&#x27;m honestly not sure what else it should be.Funnily enough, git itself tries to do the right thing if pulled in a detached head state: From https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;testorg&#x2F;example * [new branch] test -> origin&#x2F;test You are not currently on a branch.

And so something that might be “obvious” to do then turns out to be so non-obvious—how to catch all file moves (intent) outside of simple identitical content cases, and how do you represent them internally?—that you realize that just using snapshots is really the best thing to do. reply chrismorgan 17 hours agorootparentIt’s completely trivial. The obvious and correct place is in the commit object just like author and date and such, since renaming is semantically part of the commit, not the tree: commit 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 parent fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba98 author Nemo1234567890 +0000 committer Nemo1234567890 +0000 rename-from path1.old rename-to path1.new rename-from path2.old rename-to path2.new Commit messageAnd you don’t detect moves (because that’s madness), but require that people record them deliberately, just like every other VCS has done. There’s even git-mv already, it just skips a step that every other VCS’s equivalent command would do. (And technically this all works out because the index is a commit, so you can record the rename normally.)Of course, all of this assumes that moving a file is a meaningful operation. Perhaps ideally (for most languages and systems) you’d track this in far smaller chunks, so that you can track changes to a function even when it alone was moved to a different file. But things like Git aren’t interested in those kinds of semantics, and work technically at the file level, more or less, so I think it should track renames because in practice straightforward renames are super common, but often also involve other changes that thwart rename detection. Years ago Linus explained why he didn’t like storing moves (someone else has linked it), but I’m largely not sold with his reasoning—the theory of the perfect has hindered the useful, and file renames are commonly meaningful in ways more than he said. reply silon42 1 hour agorootparentThe problem with that scenario is that usually it doesn&#x27;t support a real-world-scenario where you do a rename in the tool (like some IDE) and it doesn&#x27;t do the corresponding git operation.(yes, some IDE might have git integration, but personally I don&#x27;t like my IDE messing with git, except read-only (annotate, diff)) reply hyperthesis 18 hours agorootparentprevBitKeeper already did it. reply lubutu 18 hours agorootparentI think this is the one thing I feel BitKeeper does better than Git. Git can get confused about where a file came from, for moves but especially for copies, and so the version history ends, even if you ask it to try and follow along. BitKeeper, on the other hand, keeps the moves and copies as part of the history, so you can always trace it through to the origin of the file, no matter how circuitous. reply account42 17 hours agorootparentgit log has --follow but unfortunately it only works when spefying a single file and not e.g. a whole directory. reply Izkata 8 hours agoparentprevThis has resulted in a feature not in VCSs that do track renames: using matching lines, git blame can track changes across files that were combined in a commit, where others would record half the lines as being a rename from one file and the other half as new lines (if you even thought to do it like that when making the commit; more likely the whole file would be tracked as new). reply 2-718-281-828 18 hours agoparentprev> moving files isn&#x27;t stored in gitis there an intuitive and enlightening explanation as to why it is this way? reply keybored 18 hours agorootparentGit stores snapshots and that’s it.

Many things would be much easier if git recorded some more metadata in every commit: file moves, and branch moves, to start with.Having some sort of notion of \"parent branch\" would be very useful for a number of common operations, and a \"renamed file\" without having to rely on client dependent heuristics too. Empty files trip people up all the time so a \"create file\" would fit in perfectly.These concepts would also be a good basis for more user friendly clients. Other version control systems do this the surprise factor should be low. reply erik_seaberg 11 hours agorootparentPeople would get lazy and rename a file without telling Subversion they had done it, so it would write a “old file deleted, new file created from nothing” revision. Most of the merge conflict resolution machinery just couldn’t run without the missing guidance. Git infers someone probably renamed a file you edited or vice versa, which seems risky but works better in practice. reply bqmjjx0kac 17 hours agorootparentprevMan, he communicates like a dick all the time I guess. reply layer8 17 hours agorootparentprevFor the historical rationale see here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;borekb&#x2F;3a548596ffd27ad6d948854751756...In short, Linus stance is that file renaming doesn’t matter, only the contents of files matter, and the moving of contents between files. Moved&#x2F;renamed files then fall out as a special case of moving content.Personally, I think this is a case of the better being the enemy of the good, and his “clearly superior algorithm” doesn’t work as well as claimed in practice. Or maybe tooling merely still isn’t up to snuff after 18 years. reply seba_dos1 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about having a stance, it&#x27;s about git&#x27;s architecture. From the commit graph point of view, there&#x27;s no such things as moving anything at all, neither files nor content. Commits represent a whole new state of the repository, not a diff from the previous state. The only way a commit is linked to the previous state is via parent pointer, it can otherwise be completely unrelated (and you can simply change the parent pointer without changing anything else in the commit). Any diffs are calculated at runtime. The issue with renames is just a consequence of assuming such data model - you could try to plaster it over with some metadata, but ultimately you would still be fighting against the model rather than working with it.Many people develop a bad mental model with commits as diffs, because that&#x27;s what the UI makes them think commits are. It can work for a while, but inevitably leads to confusion later on. reply layer8 16 hours agorootparentAs you say, commits link to their parent(s), and those links effectively represent the edges of the commit graph. It makes perfectly sense to record moves on those edges. That’s how other VCSs do it. There is no conflict with the commit model.Viewing the commit graph in terms of nodes (commits) or edges (diffs) is equivalent, these are dual views you can easily convert between. The internal representation is independent from that. Some VCSs use a mix of diffs and full revisions internally. Even Git uses delta compression when packing objects. reply seba_dos1 16 hours agorootparentWhat I meant is that git doesn&#x27;t have any structure to represent an edge other than a simple pointer. Conceptually it wouldn&#x27;t be a big change to add some, but the consequence of that is that everything in git revolves around nodes rather than edges, and whenever the concept of an edge is needed (such as in \"cherry-pick\") it&#x27;s being calculated on fly. reply ptx 12 hours agorootparentIf you think of it not as a \"rename\" (which would belong in the edge object if it existed) but rather as a \"note: the file A in this tree was known as B in the parent tree\" it would make perfect sense to store it in the child commit. reply layer8 15 hours agorootparentprevI don’t see where this would be causing any issues. There is a canonical place where to put edge metadata, namely in the child commit. And whenever you’re interested in move information, you have to process the respective child commit anyway. replypaulddraper 17 hours agorootparentprevGit doesn&#x27;t store any individual changes: files moved, lines added, line deleted, etc.It stores a commit graph, and a tree at each of those commits.

Most of the common confusion is due to people learning from the porcelain down to the plumbing, when it should be the other way around. If you limit your mental model to the plumbing, there&#x27;s generally only one outcome that you want, but there are a dozen ways to get there from the porcelain. You can choose whichever one you prefer. But if you start from one of those dozen ways, they could each lead to a different outcome than you expected.I&#x27;m forever grateful for one of my early internships, where a guy from GitHub visited the office and gave us a one day workshop on Git. He started from the internals and explained how Git models your codebase. (He&#x27;s also the one who introduced me to the idea of plumbing vs. porcelain.) Then once we had a common language, teaching the porcelain was a matter of starting from the plumbing and working upwards, rather than the other way around.Another invaluable resource in learning Git is this interactive tutorial [0], which renders a tree diagram of start state and desired end state and makes you write the commands (for which there are often many options!) to get to that end state. This reinforces the idea that the best way of planning Git commands is to first visualize the end state you want, and then reason about how to get there.Also: RTFM! Not just once. Go back to it. You&#x27;ll learn something new every time.

I really recommend spending 15 minutes to understand it conceptually:objects: blobs, trees, commits, annotated tagsrefs: branches (local, remote-tracking), tags, HEADother: working tree, index (aka cache aka staging area), remotesThere&#x27;s lots of good guides out there: git from the bottom up, git for computer scientists, and the git parable are some that spring to mind. The Git Book is also excellent but it&#x27;s more than 15 minutes of your time.All the commands become way less mystifying when you understand what they are manipulating. You&#x27;ll never get into a state where you want to `rm -rf` the entire repo and start with a new clone. There will hopefully be no more teeth grinding or keyboard mashing.I&#x27;ve used a lot of VCSs over the years (rcs, sccs, cvs, subversion, clearcase, mercurial, git) and I swear git is the one I find least frustrating.

So I rebase locally until it is. Then when the PR happens, master gets my changes added to the top, with no extra noise from merge commits.Even if the local-rebase workflow is slightly more complicated, the payoff is a really clean history, making future reasoning about branches much easier. Not to mention merge conflicts are easier to solve when you rebase early & often. reply silon42 17 hours agorootparentIn my observation, the problem comes when there is a \"merge main to the feature branch before merging\"This step is when newbies get confused because the diffs are the wrong way, and I&#x27;ve seen people often losing merge hunks from master when there are conflicts which can be disastrous (not a git issue, I&#x27;ve seen people do the same in SVN).The proper solution IMO would be for git to have a \"merge --reintegrate\" which would do the opposite merge: take the main branch and merge the current feature branch to it... after success, you have a new feature branch.This is why I also prefer rebase and cleaner history (but a common mistake here is to squash after PR approval... that should be done before, not after). reply gumby 16 hours agorootparentprev> For me, git becomes unintelligible when there&#x27;s a crazy train-track map of branching and merging.Consider finding peace by inverting your perspective: if your organization’s development process (for whatever reason, many of them legitimate) involves a crazy train-track of features being developed in parallel, isn’t it great that you&#x27;re all at least using something that can keep track of it?For a small team that should be unnecessary.Frequent rebasing when you’re on a side branch of development is smart, but doesn’t conflict with my point.Also, really, who looks back into the depths of history? There’s a reason a lot of backup schemes rotate a set of tapes over 30 or even 14 days. For that reason I am not a fan of rewriting history for “clarity”: I consider it wasted effort.For the same reason I don’t care about branches for explorations that turned out to go nowhere — just mark the head abandoned and stop worrying about it. reply remus 17 hours agorootparentprevI think this is a pretty sensible approach.

The only thing that contains the entire history is the commit graph itself. reply tsbx 12 hours agoprevI always get back to this page when trying to understand&#x2F;show how git works under the hood: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eagain.net&#x2F;articles&#x2F;git-for-computer-scientists&#x2F;It summarizes fundamentals clearly. reply intrepidsoldier 16 hours agoprevAnything about Git reminds me of this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;EReooAZoMO0?si=sHqcYsf8v6LyWLAx reply chihuahua 15 hours agoparentGiven how many smart people are confused by Git, and how many times Git&#x27;s behavior needs to be explained in a way that often raises as many questions as it answers, it seems to indicate that Git&#x27;s model is not at all intuitive and doesn&#x27;t map well to how people generally use it to get work done.These are all people who have no problem understanding all kinds of other technologies and building complex systems from them.It&#x27;s not quite in \"a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors\" territory, but when this many smart people have difficulty understanding something, I think Git is to blame, not the people. reply jacoblambda 15 hours agorootparentI have to serious ask. Of the people who have issues with using or understanding git, how many of them have actually read the docs?Git is by no means perfect but the development community is great and there is a massive focus on improving the project and making things more approachable and intuitive.And because of that, git actually has really solid, coherent documentation with easily digestible tutorials and guides for all the things you need to do.So it always hurts me when I see people ranting and raving about how awful git is, how it can&#x27;t do x, or how it doesn&#x27;t make sense how it works but then you send them the guide or tutorial hosted on the git-scm website and suddenly it makes sense.Not to be beating the RTFM horse but RTFM guys. reply chihuahua 14 hours agorootparentWhenever I read the Git docs, after a while I start thinking \"this is all very well and good, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to what I&#x27;m trying to do to get my work done (usually fairly basic things)\"Or I have read a bunch of pages on the git-scm site, and I&#x27;m thinking \"oh yes it all makes sense now.\" Then I&#x27;m trying to do something in the real world, and I get bizarre messages and conflicts that don&#x27;t make any sense.

But when a very large number of users have consistently similar issues at some point you have to stop blaming the users and admit the tool isn&#x27;t easy to learn. reply jacoblambda 3 hours agorootparent> Git makes version control roughly 10x more complicated than it needs to be.A significant part of this is that git explicitly supports more workflows than centralised VCS like subversion, perforce, or clearcase. Other than a few fairly small differences, mercurial and fossil (two other distributed VCS projects) have the same UX issues. You can&#x27;t really reduce the complexity without just lopping off support. You can make that complexity more approachable&#x2F;digestible (which the git devs are trying to do) but this fundamentally requires a certain willingness from the user to learn the tool.For a lot of people git ends up being a sort of cargo cult where they get through the day with a set of magical incantations that make it work and solve their problems but without any real ability to troubleshoot when they do something wrong. Which is exactly the thing that prevents them from \"gitting it\".And worth noting: I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever worked with someone who has really gotten irreparably stuck with git after reading through the important parts of the user manual (not the references&#x2F;man pages but the dedicated user manual [1]) and&#x2F;or the git book [2].

    "originBody": "ValdikSS Jun 18 2019 at 00:00 Bluetooth stack modifications to improve audio quality on headphones without AAC, aptX, or LDAC codecs 7 min 58K Development for Android *Wireless technologies *Sound Before reading this article, it is recommended to read the previous one: Audio over Bluetooth: most detailed information about profiles, codecs, and devices / по-русски Some wireless headphone users note low sound quality and lack of high frequencies when using the standard Bluetooth SBC codec, which is supported by all headphones and other Bluetooth audio devices. A common recommendation to get better sound quality is to buy devices and headphones with aptX or LDAC codecs support. These codecs require licensing fees, that's why devices with them are more expensive. It turns out that the low quality of SBC is caused by artificial limitations of all current Bluetooth stacks and headphones' configuration, and this limitation can be circumvented on any existing device with software modification only. SBC codec SBC has lots of different parameters that are negotiated during the connection setup phase: Audio channel type and number: Joint Stereo, Stereo, Dual Channel, Mono; Number of frequency bands: 4 or 8; Number of audio blocks in one packet: 4, 8, 12, 16; Quantization bit allocation algorithm: Loudness, SNR; Maximum and minimum bit pool used in quantization process: usually 2-53. The decoder is required to support any combination of these parameters. Encoder may implement only a part of them. Existing Bluetooth stacks usually negotiate the following set of options which I call «profile»: Joint Stereo, 8 bands, 16 blocks, Loudness, bitpool 2..53. This profile encodes 44.1 kHz stereo audio with 328 kbps bitrate. Bitpool is a parameter that changes encoding bitrate: the higher it is, the higher the bitrate, and hence the quality. But exact bitpool value corresponds to exact bitrate only within exact profile. The bitrate is also significantly affected by other parameters: audio channel type, number of frequency bands, number of audio blocks. You can increase the bitrate indirectly by negotiating non-standard profiles, without changing the bitpool. Bitrate calculation formula For example, Dual Channel mode encodes channels separately, using individual bitpool for each channel, unlike Stereo or Joint Stereo, which use bitpool for both channels. Forcing the device to use Dual Channel instead of Joint Stereo will get us almost doubled bitrate of 617 kbps, with the same bitpool value of 53. To me it feels that bitpool should be an internal variable. I assume that it is an A2DP specification design fault that bitpool value is not bound to other codec parameters and only defined as an independent negotiated variable. Fixed bitpool and bitrate values originated from recommended profile for high quality audio. But the recommendation should not be the reason to set the limit on these parameters. A2DP specification v1.2, which was active from 2007 to 2015, requires all decoders to work correctly with bitrates up to 512 kbps: The decoder of the SNK shall support all possible bitpool values that do not result in excess of the maximum bit rate. This profile limits the available maximum bit rate to 320kb/s for mono, and 512kb/s for two-channel modes. No bitrate limit stated in the new version of the specification. It is assumed that modern headphones with EDR support released after 2015 can support bitrates up to 730 kbps. For some reason, all currently tested Bluetooth stacks (Linux (PulseAudio), Android, Blackberry and macOS) have artificial restrictions of maximum bitpool parameter, which directly affects the maximum bitrate. But this is not the biggest problem, almost all headphones also limit the maximum bitpool value to 53. As I've already seen in my tests, most devices work fine on a modified Bluetooth stack with a bitrate of 551 kbps, without interrupts and crackling. But such a bitrate will never be negotiated under normal conditions, with stock Bluetooth stacks. Bluetooth stack modification Every A2DP-compatible Bluetooth stack should support Dual Channel mode, but there's no way to force usage of this mode. Let's add a switch to the user interface! I made patches for Android 8.1 and Android 9, which add full support for Dual Channel into the stack and into developer menu, and handle Dual Channel mode as an additional «HD Audio» codec like aptX, AAC or LDAC by adding a tick to the Bluetooth device settings Here's what it looks like: Android 9 patch Android 8.1 patch This checkbox toggles Dual Channel mode which is configured to use 551 kbps for EDR 3 Mb/s devices and 452 kbps for EDR 2 Mb/s devices. This patchset has been merged into the following alternative firmwares: LineageOS 15.1 (since 31 March, 2019) and 16.0 (since May 13, 2019) Resurrection Remix (since May 14, 2019) crDroid (since May 13, 2019) Where did 551 and 452 kbps come from? Bluetooth time division technology is designed to efficiently transmit large fixed-size packets. Data transfer occurs in slots, the largest number of slots sent in one transmission is 5. There are also transfer modes using 1 or 3 slots, but not 2 or 4. You can transfer up to 679 bytes in 5 slots, at a connection speed of 2 Mbps, and up to 1021 bytes at a speed of 3 Mbps. In 3 slots maximum amount of data is 367 and 552 bytes, respectively. If we want to transfer less data than 679 or 1021 bytes but more than 367 or 552 bytes, the transfer will still take 5 slots, and the transmission will take the same amount of time, which reduces the transmission efficiency. 44100 Hz audio encoded using SBC in Dual Channel mode with bitpool = 38, 16 blocks in a frame, 8 frequency bands, produces audio frame of 164 bytes, with 452 kb/s bitrate. Audio payload should be encapsulated into L2CAP and AVDTP transmission protocols, which deduct 16 bytes of overhead from the audio payload. One 5-slot audio transmission can contain up to 4 audio frames: 679 (EDR 2 mbit/s DH5) - 4 (L2CAP) - 12 (AVDTP/RTP) - 1 (SBC header) - (164*4) = 6 A single packet transmits up to 11.7 ms of audio data, which will be transmitted in 3.75 ms, and we have 6 unused bytes left in the packet. If you slightly raise the bitpool, 4 audio frames can no longer be packed into a single transmission. You'll have to send 3 frames at a time, which reduces transmission efficiency, reduces the amount of audio transmitted in one packet, and will increase chance for audio stutter under poor radio conditions. 551 kbps bitrate for EDR 3 Mbps was selected using the same principle: with Bitpool 47, 16 blocks per frame, 8 frequency bands, the frame size is 200 bytes, with a bit rate of 551 kbps. Single transmission can bundle up to 5 frames or 14.6 ms of music. The algorithm for calculating all the SBC parameters is quite complicated, you can easily make a mistake if you try to calculate all of them manually, so I made an interactive calculator to help those who interested: btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-bitrate-calculator What is that all for? Contrary to popular belief of aptX sound quality, in some cases it can produce worse audio quality than SBC with a standard 328k bitrate. SBC dynamically allocates quantization bits for frequency bands, acting on a «bottom-to-top» basis. If the whole bitrate was used for the lower and middle frequencies, the upper frequencies are «cut off» (silenced). aptX quantizes frequency bands with the same number of bits constantly, which makes it a constant bitrate codec: 352 kbps for 44.1 kHz, 384 kbps for 48 kHz. It can't «transfer bits» to frequencies that need them most. Unlike SBC, aptX will not «cut» frequencies, but will add quantization noise to them, reducing the dynamic range of audio, and sometimes introducing crackles. SBC, on the contrary, «eats the details» — discards the quietest areas. On average, compared to SBC 328k, aptX makes less distortion in music with a wide frequency range, but on music with a narrow frequency range and a wide dynamic range SBC 328k sometimes wins. Let us consider a special case, a piano recording. Here's a spectrogram: Most energy locates in the 0-4 kHz frequencies, and lasts up to 10 kHz. The spectrogram of the file aptX file looks like this: Here is SBC 328k: It can be seen that the SBC 328k periodically completely cut off the range above 16 kHz, and used all available bitrates for the frequency ranges below this value. However, aptX introduced more distortions into the frequency spectrum audible by the human ear, which can be seen on the subtracted original audio spectrogram from the aptX spectrogram (the brighter, the more distortion): SBC 328k has introduced less distortion to the signal in the range from 0 to 10 kHz, and the rest frequences had been сut: 485k bitrate was enough for SBC to save the entire frequency range, without cutting off the bands. SBC 485k produces much better results in the range of 0-15 kHz on this sample than aptX, and a smaller but still noticeable difference at 15-22 kHz (the darker, the less distortion): Archive with original audio and SBC/aptX-encoded files. By switching to a high-bitrate SBC you will get sound which is superior to aptX most of the time, on any headphones. On headphones with EDR 3 Mb/s support, 551 kb/s SBC produces sound that is very close to aptX HD. Can we go even further? Android patchset has an additional option to increase bitrate for EDR 2 mbps devices even further. You can bump the bitrate from 452 kbps to 595 kbps, at the cost of reducing the stability of the transmission in case of congested radio conditions. Just set the persist.bluetooth.sbc_hd_higher_bitrate variable to 1: # setprop persist.bluetooth.sbc_hd_higher_bitrate 1 Extreme bit rate patch is currently merged only in LineageOS 15.1, but not in 16.0. Compatibility with the devices SBC Dual Channel is supported by almost all headphones, speakers and car head units. This is no wonder — the standard mandates its support in any decoding devices. There are a small number of devices on which this mode causes problems, but these are very rare cases. More details on compatible devices can be found at 4pda and xda-developers. Sound difference comparison I made a web service that encodes audio to SBC (as well as to aptX and aptX HD) in real time, right in the browser. You can compare the sound of different SBC profiles and other codecs without actually transmitting audio via Bluetooth using this service, on any wired headphones, speakers, and on your favorite music. You can also change the encoding parameters directly during audio playback. btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-encoder Contacting Android developers I tried to contact many Bluetooth stack developers from Google, asking them to consider including my patches to the main Android branch—AOSP, but did not receive a single answer. My patches in Gerrit code review system for Android have not received any comments from anyone involved in the development as well. I would be glad if anyone could tell Google developers about this implementation of SBC HD for Android. The gerrit patchset is already out of date (this is one of the earliest revisions), but I will update it if developers are interested in my changes (it's not easy for me to update it, I don't have Android Q compatible devices). Conclusion Users of LineageOS, Resurrection Remix and crDroid firmwares can enhance Bluetooth audio quality by ticking a checkbox in Bluetooth device settings. Linux users can also get a higher SBC bitrate by installing the patch from Pali Rohár, which among other things, adds support for the aptX, aptX HD and FastStream codecs.

Who would be doing it, the OS? It just sounds like the separation of concerns and the design of the interfaces would make it pretty unlikely. reply chenxiaolong 2 hours agorootparentYup, Bluetooth devices can report the latency via AVDTP 1.3 Delay Reporting. If I remember correctly from the last time I looked at this, the media framework in OS&#x27;s tend to expose this to applications by reporting the timestamp that a submitted audio buffer is actually played back. The video player can use these timestamps to adjust the video delay accordingly. And since it&#x27;s per buffer, it can handle the latency changing (eg. by switching from Bluetooth to a wired connection).I know at least Android and Linux + Pipewire support this. I haven&#x27;t encountered a single application on desktop Linux that doesn&#x27;t support this properly. All the standard video players and browsers work. It works for HDMI too, when the TV&#x2F;AV receiver is well designed and communicates the latency in the EDID. reply roywashere 10 hours agorootparentprevYes, this is called AVDTP 1.3 Delay Reporting feature. It allows headphones to report the delay to a sending device that actually plays the sound. reply HPsquared 10 hours agorootparentprevEmpirically: videos are perfectly synced using my Sony headphones (which use Bluetooth 5.0) on Android. But anything interactive (games, and UI sound effects) has a significant delay.I think Bluetooth 5.0 includes something where the audio latency is communicated back to the phone. reply Pxtl 4 hours agorootparentYeah, playing twitchy games with bluetooth on is janky suicide. I was trying to play a difficult platformer on my phone with a clipped-on game controller and it was miserable until I switched to wired audio.Not sure if it was the audio latency or the crowded traffic on bluetooth slowing down my BT game controller, but the difference in feel and success was night-and-day when I did that. reply explodingcamera 12 hours agorootparentprevIt is absolutely done, mostly by the media player&#x2F;library used, e.g exoplayer on Android has automatic lag compensation for that purpose. reply magicalhippo 12 hours agorootparentprevNot always. Just got some wireless headphones at work, and now I can no longer enjoy YouTube videos (mostly KEXP) because of the 100ms audio delay. It&#x27;s too disturbing even only in side view.So at least with a browser on Windows it&#x27;s not done. reply lxgr 10 hours agorootparentprevI’ve definitely noticed it on macOS. Videos in the browser will stall for a fraction of a second after pressing play to give the audio time to catch up. reply eptcyka 12 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s Bluetooth not having enough latency. reply eptcyka 10 hours agorootparentI meant to say bandwidth. reply baxuz 13 hours agoparentprevI really don&#x27;t understand why HFP is still the industry standard. Even devices within the same ecosystem, like MacBook &#x2F; iPhone &#x2F; AirPods seems to use it based on the audio quality. Or maybe it&#x27;s AVRCP. Sounds horrible either way. reply vlovich123 12 hours agorootparentAVRCP is the control protocol for BT media (e.g. when you volume up or play&#x2F;pause from your headset). I’m assuming you meant A2DP which is the protocol for receiving audio. HFP is totally separate from A2DP in that it’s a bidirectional audio stream. That bidirectionality is the difficult part - you have in theory tight time bounds for transmitting the data for latency reasons + these cheapo headsets have 1 radio which means they’re nominally limited to tx or rx. Since the assumption for the design is voice calls, you severely clip the microphone audio into the frequency band for speech & transmit mono which is why the audio quality is so bad (+ you further lossy encode it but the frequency reduction is probably the biggest dip). All of this has to fit on top of the PHY packet transport that time-divides access to the channel + has to coex with other 2.4 GHZ radios like WiFi (at least historically).Now, could these designs be revisited? Probably. Maybe radios are small and cheap enough that we should have 2 and a protocol for bidirectional audio that allows independent streams over separate bands with software synchronizing and mixing audio. It’s also possible the audio encoders&#x2F;decoders could be modernized with more modern compression techniques to improve audio quality without requiring changes to the bandwidth allocation. Bluetooth those is very ossified and the standards bodies move like molasses - most of the investment is in WiFi and radio vendors are more interested in milking what exists now (or coming up with proprietary solutions like aptx) than actually solving the problems. reply jeroenhd 12 hours agorootparentBLE Audio supports bidirectional audio up to ±1300kbps (\"2Mbps\" but with overhead subtracted) which is a LOT better than HFP, especially with LC3 as a replacement for the older codecs.I don&#x27;t think many devices support it yet, but the spec has a perfectly acceptable bitrate for modern audio calls. We just need to wait for hardware vendors to pick up on BT5.1 features. Last I read about these I think the focus for BLE audio was on hearing aids and such, but there&#x27;s no reason the spec couldn&#x27;t be used for headphones.BLE audio also allows for things like connecting your headphones to multiple sources and broadcasting audio to multiple receivers. The standard has improved significantly, but without cheap, mass produced chips, these advancements will probably be stuck in expensive purpose-built devices for a while. reply vlovich123 11 hours agorootparentYeah I was just reading that the latest standards have improved things so we’ll have to wait a few years for HW to filter out. reply lloeki 11 hours agorootparentprev> That bidirectionality is the difficult partBest hack I&#x27;ve come up with when I have to use Bluetooth headsets on calls is to use them unidirectionally by selecting my MacBook microphone as input (try option click on volume control in menu bar).(... but mostly I go wired most of the time). reply carstenhag 9 hours agorootparentYep, this is also what u do. On top of that, the MacBook mics are way better than any earbud mic. reply Pxtl 4 hours agorootparentprevJust get a wireless headset that uses a USB dongle. It&#x27;s archaic but it works. I can&#x27;t stand to be tethered to my desk when I talk. It&#x27;s annoying and silly how I have a BT headset and a USB-wireless headset on my desk at the same time and I switch depending on whether the call is coming over the phone or the PC, and theoretically I could get one device that does both with a switch (eg. my wife has a Logitech one that does that) but this approach works for me.I&#x27;ve literally gotten a compliment or two on how great the audio is when I&#x27;m doing remote presentations, but maybe that&#x27;s because I often privately grouse about people who are using awful mic setups and so somebody was watching for that. I&#x27;m not using anything fancy, I just buy upper-mid-range gaming headsets (the $150US-ish ones that are good-enough that they don&#x27;t cover them in neon plastic and LED lighting). reply MonaroVXR 9 hours agorootparentprevSo I assume Sony and Xbox are using Wi-Fi to use Audio on their controllers? reply thomasfortes 5 hours agorootparentAt least for Xbox controllers and headsets (and logitech lightspeed mouses too) they don&#x27;t use bluetooth, they use a proprietary protocol, you can connect them using bluetooth but if you really want low latency you will need a proprietary dongle.I suppose sony do something similar, and as far as I know they all use the 2.4GHz band.Good thing both Xbox and Playstation controllers have a 3.5mm jack and I don&#x27;t need to buy their overpriced shitty headsets to play without significant audio latency. reply jeroenhd 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are simply no common successors to HFP. There are a few handsets that use two A2DP streams, but that requires a lot of bandwidth and I don&#x27;t think support is anywhere close to universal.Bluetooth 5.2 adds BLE Audio which offers more flexibility. The LC3 codec is supported by Windows 11, Android 13, and Linux, and it significantly improves audio quality compared to the older codecs. I&#x27;m not so sure about hardware support in headphones, though. reply lxgr 10 hours agorootparentprevNewer HFP headphones at least have mSBC, which sounds slightly less horrible.Still, I’m also surprised that AirPods don’t use anything better within the Apple ecosystem, proprietary or otherwise. reply zwirbl 13 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s slowly entering the market as LE Audio &#x2F; Auracast.

(AX210 and newer should be capable and advertise proper isochronous channel support in their drivers.

Android runs on top of numerous Bluetooth chipsets. So when he gets a patch to seem to work on his hardware, there is no saying that it will work for a different Android phone.Furthermore, this all depends on what else the device is up to at the current moment. If you have shared BT+Wifi chipset and you are streaming a video over wifi, then streaming the audio to your headphones, the device is having to allocate resources based on wifi usage and BT. So playing audio stored locally and audio via a stream is not necessarily going to get the same CODEC parameters.There is so much nuance to this subject that the author just hasn&#x27;t considered. Please be careful what you read. reply AnggaSP 4 hours agoparentFormer custom ROM developer here who has reviewed and integrated valdikSS modification.It’s not a bug that the patchset is doing, but enables dual-channel SBC to be negotiated in the source and sink connection. This enables the higher bit-rate without exceeding the maximum bitpool both Android and BT receiver impose.There’s still negotiation occurs between the source and sink and if either one of them doesn’t support dual-channel SBc, it’ll fallback to whatever its supported. All the device that i had maintained supports it, while some cheap speaker that i test at that time doesn’t and able to negotiate joint stereo session. reply jwtorres 1 hour agorootparentRight, it’s more of a configuration that is being changed. But my point was that this is all above the HCI layer, so at the end of the day it’s related to the specific host-stack implementation and not to do with Bluetooth in general.I guess I’m basically saying the title should be changed reply ValdikSS 3 hours agoparentprev>This article is not about Bluetooth in generalHere you are https:&#x2F;&#x2F;habr.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;456182&#x2F; reply adithyassekhar 2 hours agorootparentUnrelated: Every once in a while you&#x27;d see a familiar name on this website.

It&#x27;s trialware, but cheap.I have seen the bluetooth range drop off in higher quality modes, which seems to confirm it&#x27;s actually changing the codec (or at least something) and not just a placebo.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bluetoothgoodies.com&#x2F;a2dp&#x2F; (i have no affiliation) reply Dwedit 48 minutes agoparentWhat is this \"Quality Loss\" they speak of regarding downsampling from 48KHz to 44.1KHz? When resampling is done properly, you&#x27;d only lose very high frequency content (frequencies above 22050Hz). Human hearing range is usually documented as up to 20KHz, but some young people can slightly hear higher frequencies. reply jeroenhd 13 hours agoprevPerhaps interesting to note: on Linux, you can also enable higher bitrate SBC audio (though something dubbed \"SBC XQ\"). Similarly, \"mSBC\" can be used for higher quality headset audio (still nowhere close to SBC or more APTX, of course).I hope someone over at Google merges this, or something like this, already. Better audio codec are supported by tons of headphones and such, but support is not universal and bidirectional audio improvements definitely aren&#x27;t. reply izacus 11 hours agoparentThis is a 4 year old article that predates things like LE Audio support for which has been merged into Android. reply altairprime 4 hours agorootparentIt also predates the Bluetooth headset audio spec update that came out a few weeks ago.

My last attempt led me to switch to Pipewire. reply abdullahkhalids 12 hours agorootparentprev> Or how to check what my current headset is using?`pactl list` should show you all your input and output sinks and what profiles they are using.

Obviously, if I click &#x27;pause&#x27; or change the volume, the buffer should be discarded.But the long buffer should let my phone sleep more of the time (saving power), and survive poor radio connectivity. reply solraph 12 hours agoparentUnlikely to happen. I sincerely doubt most headphones would have the memory for that buffer. Sure, it&#x27;s only a megabyte or two of ram, but your headphones would have to spend valuable battery on keeping that ram active.From my foray into audio app (quite a while ago, I admit), I imagine application support would be tricky as well. reply londons_explore 12 hours agorootparentWell they can advertise how much memory they have...RAM uses less power than keeping a radio alive, so I suspect aggressive buffering is a net energy saver. reply HPsquared 10 hours agorootparentReminds me of the old portable CD players that would advertise the capacity of their anti-skip buffers. reply RobotToaster 10 hours agorootparentprevThere are inexpensive headphones with the entire MP3 player built in, so I doubt a little RAM would make much difference. reply vlovich123 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah, memory on these devices tends to be pretty tight. The other challenge with buffering ahead so much is that if you do skip, you’ve basically used your energy budget for 0 value. You’d have to make the argument that there’s net savings, but that would only materialize with predictions that are right enough that the savings outweigh the times you lose (e.g. a simplest heuristic would be if the audio stream has been live for 5 seconds without skipping, send the available buffer at faster than realtime). reply spockz 12 hours agorootparentIIRC, Spotify applies a similar strategy also for deciding which music to already fetch from the servers when listening to a playlist to minimise the gap between pressing next song and actual playback. It seems like it should be exactly the same algorithm for sending it to the headset, with the exception of other sounds like notifications&#x2F;calls. reply jwtorres 11 hours agoparentprevWell that&#x27;s doable with enough embedded memory, but it will become an issue when you want to sync audio and video. So it really is less of a protocol thing and more of something that an individual product could design in, allowing a user to toggle the feature via an app. reply jacquesm 12 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;d love that until the phone rings and you want to pre-empt all that buffered stuff with your incoming call rather than to first listen to the next minute of Led Zeppelin. reply lstamour 12 hours agorootparentYou could use BLE to signal the incoming call or switching tracks or queuing up a new track. Likewise I’d love it if re-encoding the AAC from the player weren’t a necessary step when there isn’t additional audio. But then I suppose they would have to mix the audio on headphones which … actually sounds doable given that’s basically what noise cancelling and transparency mode requires already.Of course, the cynic in me wonders why we can’t do AirPlay 2-style functionality with simple Bluetooth and BLE speakers, but Apple wants to preserve their margin and ecosystem. Literally lossless headphone audio was mostly a thing with cords, and we’re still playing catchup to the idea.I do remember a brief period a period in the late 00’s when “MP3 headphones” were a thing, and you could add an SD card to your headphones and listen wirelessly. I’m not sure any of those supported FLAC though.My suspicion is that in the future, we will skip Bluetooth and go straight to wifi and cellular, where these tiny AirPods end up connecting to audio sources directly and basically only use BLE to sync between themselves. That way you can “leave the phone at home,” etc. They would probably have built-in storage too, for offline support. reply londons_explore 12 hours agorootparentprevWell the protocol would need support for \"something happened, drop the buffer\".PulseAudio calls it \"rewinding\" for example:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freedesktop.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Software&#x2F;PulseAudio&#x2F;Documen... reply jacquesm 12 hours agorootparentRight, true, or some kind of priority queue. reply izacus 11 hours agoparentprevThat is pretty much explicitly against what most users want from audio unfortunately. reply seba_dos1 9 hours agoprevWould be good to add (2019) to the title.

I partially solved the problem by using locks&#x2F;queues&#x2F;workers. But it got too much for me when Turtle started failing due to its current directory being deleted.In contrast, typed-process lets you spawn separate processes, and execute within a working dir (rather than needing to cd there), so it works great for big, complicated workflows.And it also has good support for OverloadedStrings, which means you can generally copy & paste what you would have typed into bash, and it just works.I also use the interpolate package (with QuasiQuotes) to make the raw strings nicer in the source code, but it&#x27;s not compatible with hlint, so I&#x27;m thinking of looking for a different package for string-handling. reply themk 10 hours agorootparentAuthor of Shh [0] here.

Rather than let you specify the build actions in the CI settings, it invokes scripts with fixed names in the `ci_scripts` directory of your repo if they exist. There just isn&#x27;t a mechanism for creating jobs which aren&#x27;t something that you can build locally and test independently of Xcode Cloud. reply Dries007 11 hours agorootparentprevI would say: stick to straight command sequences with variables, avoid if&#x2F;for&#x2F;while&#x2F;functions etc. Subshells and pipes only for trivial things.Setting something like a 30 char limit will inevitably lead to code-golfing to fit a mess into the 30 char limit.But that becomes harder to automatically check, that&#x27;s why you should still have good peer reviews based on written standards somewhere. reply Piraty 12 hours agorootparentprevso much this. it will help CI not become a holy, super-hard-to-debug, unreproducible mammoth. write scripts, call them from CI reply marcosnils 12 hours agorootparentprevHi there, Dagger contributor here. We&#x27;re solving this exact same problem by allowing you to encode your CI&#x2F;CD pipelines in your favorite programming language and run them the same way locally and&#x2F;or any CI provider (Gitlab, Github Actions, Jenkins, etc).We&#x27;re very active in our Discord server if you have any questions! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;invite&#x2F;dagger-io reply Dries007 12 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;ve been experimenting with Dagger here, as part of the alternative to writing glscpc actually, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s ready to replace Gitlab CI.Dagger has one very big downside IMO: It does not have native integration with Gitlab, so you end up having to use Docker-in-Docker and just running dagger as a job in your pipeline.This causes a number of issues:It clumps all your previously separated steps into a single step in the Gitlab pipeline. That doesn&#x27;t matter too much for console output (although it does when your different steps should run on different runners), but is very annoying if you use Gitlab CI&#x27;s built in parsing of junit&#x2F;coverage&#x2F;... files, since you now have extra layers of context to dig trough when tests fail etc. Plus not all of these allow for multiple input files, so now you have to add extra merging steps.If your job already uses Docker-in-Docker for something, you have to be careful not to end up with Docker-in-Docker-in-Docker situations, or container name conflicts if you just pass through the DOCKER_HOST variable.The one thing that would make this worth it is being able to run the pipelines locally to debug, but I&#x27;ve just written quick-and-dirty scripts to do that every time I&#x27;ve needed it.

As you can see from our website (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dagger.io&#x2F;engine), it works and integrates with all the current CI providers. Where Dagger really shines is to help you and your teams move all the artisanal scripts encoded in YAML into actual code and run them in containers through a fluent SDK which can be written in your language of choice. This unlocks a lot of benefits which are detailed in our docs (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.dagger.io&#x2F;).> Dagger has one very big downside IMO: It does not have native integration with Gitlab, so you end up having to use Docker-in-Docker and just running dagger as a job in your pipeline.Dagger doesn&#x27;t depend on Docker. We&#x27;re just conveniently using Docker (and other container runtimes) as it&#x27;s generally available pretty much everywhere by default as a way to bootstrap the Dagger Engine. You can read more about the Dagger architecture here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dagger&#x2F;dagger&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;core&#x2F;docs&#x2F;d7yxc-o...As you can see from our docs (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.dagger.io&#x2F;759201&#x2F;gitlab-google-cloud&#x2F;#step-5-cr...), we&#x27;re leveraging the *default* Gitlab CI `docker` service to bootstrap the engine. There&#x27;s no `docker-in-docker` happening there.> It clumps all your previously separated steps into a single step in the Gitlab pipeline.It&#x27;s not generally how we recommend to start, we should definitely improve our docs to reflect that. You can organize your dagger pipelines in multiple functions and call them in separate Gitlab jobs as you&#x27;re currently doing. For example, you can do the following: ```.gitlab-ci.yml build: script: # no funky untestable shellscripts here, but calls to \\*real\\* code - dagger run go run ci&#x2F;main.go build test: script: # no funky untestable shellscripts here, but calls to \\*real\\* code - dagger run go run ci&#x2F;main.go test ```This way, if your pipeline currently has a `build` and `test` job, you still keep using the same structure.> but is very annoying if you use Gitlab CI&#x27;s built in parsing of junit&#x2F;coverage&#x2F;... files, since you now have extra layers of context to dig trough when tests fail etcYou can also still keep using these. The only thing you need to be aware is to export the required test &#x2F; coverage output files from your Dagger pipelines so Gitlab can use them to do what it needs.> but I&#x27;ve just written quick-and-dirty scripts to do that every time I&#x27;ve needed it.This is what we&#x27;re trying to improve. Those quick-and-dirty generally start very simple but they become brittle and very difficult to test by other engineers. Yes, you could use docker or any container-like thing to enable portability, but you&#x27;ll probably have to write more scripts to glue all that together.Quoting one of our founders:\"Our mission is to help your teams to keep the CI configuration as light and \"dumb\" as possible, by moving as much logic as possible into portable scripts. This minimizes \"push and pray\", where any pipeline change requires committing, pushing, and waiting for the proprietary CI black box to give you a green or red light. Ideally those scripts use containers for maximum reproduceability. Our goal at Dagger is to help democratize this way of creating pipelines, and making it a standard, so that an actual software ecosystem can appear, where devops engineers can actually reuse each other&#x27;s code, the same way application developers can.\" reply iamjackg 13 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely agree. The main downside of that pattern is that it doesn&#x27;t work with jobs included from other projects in GitLab CI, since the job runs in the context of the project that imported it and therefore can&#x27;t find the script in its original repo.

I was trying to solve this from a different perspective a while ago: I wanted to add some pre-processing that would take a \"normal\" shell script and render it to the `script` part of the corresponding job at build time, the advantage being that you still have everything self-contained in the gitlab-ci job.I stopped working on it because dealing with shell shenanigans in the GitLab CI runner environment is such a miserable experience that we&#x27;re in the process of moving all our jobs to python scripts. reply Dries007 12 hours agorootparentYea, Pythonifying the scripts is also generally my preferences the moment they become somewhat complex.

    "originBody": "Write libraries instead of services, where possible A service has constant administration costs which are paid by the service provider. A library instead moves these costs to the users of the library. For any developer with limited resources, this means a library (where viable) can provide the same functionality to the user, at a lower cost to the developer than a service. By library, I mean any software that can be run by the user: shared objects, modules, servers, command line utilities, and others. By service, I mean any software which the user can't run on their own; anything which depends (usually through an API) on a service provider for its functionality. Usually, the centralization of these administration costs is cited as a benefit of services. People say, \"services are easy to write because you can upgrade them centrally, so you can avoid slow-to-upgrade users making everyone's lives worse.\" But this assumes that slow-to-upgrade users can have negative effects on everyone else. If one user can't have a negative impact on other users, then you don't care if some users are slow to upgrade; they're only hurting themselves. You can prevent users from negatively impacting other users by not sharing state or resources between users; in other words, let users run the software themselves, by writing libraries instead of services. \"Write a library\", in this sense, can still mean writing a standalone server reached through a network protocol. As long as the user runs the server themselves, you're still saving the administration costs. Both standalone servers and importable code are equally expressive, and equally cheap for you to administrate if you're not operating a service yourself. By avoiding the maintenance and upgrade costs of a service, a library can afford to contain more functionality. That's good for both the developer and the user.",

I don&#x27;t develop services, but I can imagine that before breaking the services, you have to poll with your biggest customers and you don&#x27;t break until they are ready to move to the new version. The alternative I can imagine is to keep providing the old services with a grace period (e.g. &#x2F;v1 will be available until dec next year).What am I missing? reply materielle 17 hours agorootparentThe idea is to link a thin client library into the user’s code.Then the thick client is controlled server side by the devs.If you design the thin and thick client intelligently, you can make a lot of changes to the system by merely modifying the thick client (which you control), without needing to update the thin client.Problems tends to come in a few flavors, namely that this increases complexity and that some changes will always require modifying the thin client.The biggest pitfall, though, is that you have to actually put thought into the thin client design. “Thin” is an emergent property of a well thought out client. You can’t just “touch thin_client.java” and think because you named it “thin” that it’s inherently decoupled from the service. You have to actually put thought into it.Your example is exactly right. The service can support either v1 or v2 depending on the version of the thin client.The main other technique is to have the thin client communicate in a relatively abstract and generic manner. For instead a “write()” endpoint that accepts an “options” dictionary.“write()” is so generic that it probably won’t have to change, and changes in behavior can be modified by shoving stuff into dict, perhaps with a “version” field to instruct the server how to interpret the call.When you add a new feature, you can bump the thin client to v2 and shove new options in the dict. Then the server can support v1 and v2. But also, you can modify the server to handle v1 differently. E.g the absence of a “disable_new_feature” key automatically opts v1 callers into the new feature.I think the details are are really coupled into what you are engineering and what you want to roll out. There’s no magic bullet, and this increases the complexity of your code. Good engineering in my opinion is deciding when these approaches are worth it and how they should be implemented. reply gjadi 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t quite understand what you are saying.As per the article, the advantage of a library over a service is that you don&#x27;t have the burden of maintaining the said service. How having a thin client and a server helps?I also don&#x27;t see how \"shoving new options in the dict\" can help. From my POV, if the client needs to be updated to benefit from the new features, then there is no way around it, work has to be done. From there, I much prefer having sensible name, parameters, etc. from a library that can be leveraged by static typing rather than a documentation for a JSON API (I know API-as-specs exist but I&#x27;ve never used, maybe that&#x27;s why I think that). reply chii 8 hours agorootparent> From my POV, if the client needs to be updated to benefit from the new features, then there is no way around it, work has to be done.But the point is they don&#x27;t have to update even if there&#x27;s changes.

But for a commercial software you can probably bundle your own libraries in executable or compile it statically.But I am not familiar with the difficulties of the above process so I am probably missing something. reply sokoloff 18 hours agorootparentprevMany changes are believed to be non-breaking and so you can be running only one version in prod. (Most of the changes believed to be non-breaking are non-breaking.)With a library, you end up with many different minor or point versions running without control over it. reply genman 14 hours agorootparentEmphasis on \"are believed\".

Older versions get ABI-compatible security patches because people put in the time to backport all of them to every version still supported, in many cases by distro package maintainers.

My answer would be: it&#x27;s all tradeoffs, but if your secret sauce is so valuable that it would be worth decompiling and can&#x27;t be protected with decent pricing, license terms and lawyers, run a service.There are plenty of technologies that are not worth decompiling for your average business customers. reply jampekka 14 hours agorootparentIn my experience the more they try to hide the sauce the worse it is.Quite logical though if the secret is that your secret sauce is bland and off-flavor copy of a canned soup.

It&#x27;s not that. We lack a concept that can organize storage. Let me illustrate this.So, until some years ago there was complete nonsense and anarchy in Linux networking management. That is until we got the \"ip\" program. There&#x27;s still nonsense and anarchy, because the \"ip\" program doesn&#x27;t cover everything, but it&#x27;s on the right track to organize everything Linux knows about networking under one roof. So, vendors today, like, say, Melanox (i.e. NVidia) choose to interface with \"ip\" and work with that stack rather than invent their own interfaces.When it&#x27;s extendable in predictable and convenient ways, user will extend and enrich functionality.Now, compare this to Linux storage... I want to scream and kill somebody every time I have to deal with any aspect of it because of how poorly mismanaged it is. There&#x27;s no uniformity, plenty of standards where at most one is necessary, duplication upon duplication, layers... well, forget layers. Like, say, you wanted a RAID0, well, you have MD RAIDs, you have LVM RAIDs, you have ZFS RAIDs, you have multipassing with DM (is that a RAID, well sorta&#x27; depends on what you expected...) also, well, Ceph RDB are also kind of like RAIDs, DRBD can also sort of be like a RAID...Do you maybe also want snapshots? How about encryption? -- Every solution will end up so particularly tailored to the needs of your organization that even an experienced admin in this very area your org is specializing will have no clue what&#x27;s going on with your storage.Needs can be studied, understood, catalogued, rolled into some sort of a hierarchy or some other structure amenable to management.

You found a case when it&#x27;s not possible, and decided to argue against that...No, not all services come connected with a database. Alternatively, often times a database is an artifact of tenancy and the need to manage users which would not be needed, had the functionality be exposed as a library.More importantly, whether users realize this or not, a library is more beneficial for them than a service in majority of cases. Much in the same way how it&#x27;s almost always better to own something than to rent it.Just to give some examples of the above: all the Internet of crap stuff, all sorts of \"smart\" home nonsense which requires that you subscribe to a service, install an app on your phone and send all your private data unsupervised to some shady Joe Shmo who you know nothing about. To be more specific, take something like Google Nest thermostat. There&#x27;s no reason this contraption should ever go on the Internet, nor should it require to know your street address, nor your email etc. In fact, the utility it brings is very marginal (saves you few steps you&#x27;d have to make to reach for the boiler&#x27;s controls to program it).

You could have every service add a library dependency that lets them just call `auditor.log(...)` and the library internally writes to storage.

Library API design is the lost art (almost). And the choose is not always obvious for non-technical reasons. Consider a following example: you have 3 micro-services X, Y, Z which need to interact with a platform G but this interaction requires non-trivial chunk of code. It can be done as a library or as a new adapter micro-service A which will encapsulate knowledge about platform G and will interact with X, Y, Z the way it would be easier for X, Y, Z developers to integrate. Micro-service will add network latency but will allow to make&#x2F;deploy all changes only to service A. With a library one would have to test and release a new version and then ask X, Y, Z maintainers to switch to this new version. In some organizations it will be a very slow process because X, Y, Z can put an update request (from the library team) at the bottom of the backlog.

Microservices fad-following is as bad as TDD in this industry. reply sidlls 14 hours agoprevLibraries and services both have maintenance costs and upgrade impedance from clients. The costs might differ, but in my experience work out to about the same overall. The correct way to determine whether a piece of software should be a library or service is by examining its intended purpose and its dependencies.- If the software is dependent on another service or a data store, it should be a service: this provides the owners freedom to include error handling and observability that is appropriate for the service and provides protection for its dependencies against unbounded access (via observability at minimum, or human-organized contracts, etc.). Examples: software to retrieve user data from a database, software that aggregates data from a user service and an inventory service to produce a purchase history- If the software is self-contained, e.g., it does math or \"pure business logic\" algorithms, it probably should be a library: performance can be optimized for one or a small handful of common use cases, error handling and observability become the responsibility of clients, and neither owners of the library or clients of it have to concern themselves with the impact to transitive dependencies (e.g., load added to a database). Examples: software that transforms user input into internal serialization formats; software that validates data, encrypts or decrypts data, or otherwise is \"purely functional\" reply layer8 13 hours agoparentIt’s not an either or. As argued elsethread, it should arguably always be a library (though not necessarily a published one), and optionally (if needed) also a service that wraps the library. reply sidlls 7 hours agorootparentIf the code is included in the service, it&#x27;s not a library.

I think this is what the author means when they say \"writing a standalone server reached through a network protocol\".We see a lot of folks who like the flexibility of consuming functionality as a service or library, as they see fit. We&#x27;ve even had customers who said \"we chose you because now we want you as a service, but later will want you as library\" or vice versa.Flexibility isn&#x27;t free, though.

I do have some thin services which are libraries, but above and beyond directly importing libraries is preferred. With edge functions becoming more popular, this also seems to be the preferred pattern, having \"fat\" edge functions with shared code, vs many small edge functions calling each other. reply mooreds 19 hours agoprevI think this sentiment is a partial cause of the trend towards self-hostable, downloadable software too.The customer has a cost when they operate a library instead of consume a service, no doubt.

What commitments are made? reply nijave 18 hours agorootparentprev>When you use an outside service, they might break your system at a time of their choosing.Well sure, but if this is important to you, you might consider a contract with the company that lays out cases and conditions where breakage is acceptable. reply marcosdumay 18 hours agorootparentOr you internalize the functionality with a library. reply TeMPOraL 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, SLA is a way to turn literal existence of a product into a pay-as-you-go offer on top of a service. reply fl0ki 10 hours agoprevI also tend to advise people not to write so many services -- a generation of developers has entered the workforce thinking \"cloud native microservices\" are the only way to factor software of any kind -- but I also caution people not to make everything a library either. Libraries have maintenance costs that have to pay off overall, and I consistently see people underestimate those costs when first making a library.Any library used by more than one project faces friction making almost any kind of changes, especially if the ideal form of the change breaks backwards compatibility even a little bit. Even if it&#x27;s used by only one project (an unfortunate antipattern some teams fall into), it still introduces friction to individual changes, which is worse in some languages than others because even just testing against a WIP version of the library might be a whole tangle that everyone seems to reinvent \"workspaces\" to try to mitigate even a little.I now urge people to keep closely related projects in a single repo with purely internal libraries, so you can make backwards incompatible changes because you fix them for all consumers within the same commit that made them. This is like a monorepo but only for closely related projects.It cuts out a lot of the friction of updating shared code, so it&#x27;s a good way to avoid tech debt and keep both the library and its users evolving. This was inspired by working in an actual monorepo for years, but avoiding the size of repo where you can no longer make every related change in the same commit.When an internal library&#x27;s API surface has proven to work well for several projects and for long enough to be considered stable, then it can be spun off as a standalone library, and whatever warts slowly form there are probably acceptable in return for the wider reuse. reply mpweiher 16 hours agoprevNot just instead of a service.Always write a library first.Not for any specific benefits, though these exist, but for architectural reasons.

Better to have a service IMO, you can get telemetry out of it and scale it out or replace internals without having to worry about who will get affected. reply hamandcheese 18 hours agoparentIf you can maintain a stable service API, why can&#x27;t you maintain a stable library API?I don&#x27;t see any inherent reason why it should be easier to change the behavior of a service rather than a library. reply TeMPOraL 15 hours agorootparentBecause if you ship code to users (library), you lose control. You may want to change something, but your users will just tell you to go pound sand. Conversely, if you keep the implementation on your side (service), you get to control how things work and when things change, and your users don&#x27;t have a say in this.It&#x27;s an ownership and control issue. reply bigstrat2003 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see the issue here. If I release my_fancy_lib 2.0.0, and I have users who only ever want to stay on the last 1.x release, that&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s no skin off my nose if users choose to stay on an old version forever. reply TeMPOraL 14 hours agorootparentYeah, exactly. However, if you were to make it a service, those users would have to switch to 2.0.0 or stop using it, as 1.x no longer exists. reply 15457345234 7 hours agorootparentSome people don&#x27;t think like that when they write software. They view it as a knife, not a noose.I prefer those people. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;m writing from the perspective of the user (which may be a developer using your product in their product). I don&#x27;t really care if you view software as a knife or as a noose, I don&#x27;t want to be coerced by the threat of either. replysidlls 18 hours agoparentprevMany engineering organizations have \"platform teams\"--teams that have as their sole responsibility maintaining shared libraries and \"core\" services for the entire platform. reply marcosdumay 18 hours agoparentprevAs opposed to being responsible for maintaining and doing operational support of the service...I still don&#x27;t get what advantage exactly you are expecting.Scaling it is only ever a problem for the service; you don&#x27;t even have to think about it in a library. You can get telemetry from a library just as well as from a service; your users may find that a bit invasive, but it&#x27;s still way less invasive than calling your service. And you can replace the internals of whatever, without having to worry about who will get affected, that&#x27;s what defines internals. reply Matthias247 12 hours agoprevI had the same opinion in the past. But after some more years of work experience - mostly in the managed services area - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that clear anymore:- If you offer your users a library, you are competing with tons of open source libraries which claim to offer the same thing. A lot of those will be incomplete, buggy or insecure. But most potential users will never know and try to get them work instead of looking at your offering.- If you are offering a library, debugging and user support can at times be challenging. Do you expect user to look at the internals (source code) of your library? Provide core dumps?- Having to support N different [major] versions of libraries can become challenging. It&#x27;s hard to know when all users have upgraded. With a service, you can control the update schedule. Even though changes to public APIs of the service certainly are still problematic.- Write a library - but in which language? You might prefer Rust, but your users might prefer Go, Java or Python. You could write the core in one language, and add wrappers in other languages, but some users will still be unhappy with it (e.g. because it makes compilation difficult, people don&#x27;t want \"unsafe C code\" in their high level language project, or the wrapper might slow down performance).- Libraries which are general-purpose and are not targetting a specific application&#x2F;service can over time become feature bloated since things are added \"just for the case that someone might need it\". This makes them hard to maintain. And since there&#x27;s no feedback&#x2F;telemetry, it&#x27;s also hard to say whether something can be safely removed.Note that all of this doesn&#x27;t mean \"don&#x27;t write libraries\". Even if you write applications&#x2F;services, its good to structure internal components into libraries. It&#x27;s mostly about \"what is preferrable to offer for users\". reply eikenberry 13 hours agoprev90% disagree.At an enterprise scale shop the service model will always win as it will better match the organization structure and avoids the maintenance burden of having to keep a dozen or so libraries in sync. Enterprise shops never standardize solely on a single language as they are filled with exceptions and the new hotness.Everyplace else I&#x27;d say it will vary but I agree with the general consensus that shooting for the model of a library that can be easily run as a service is your best approach. reply throwbadubadu 13 hours agoparentBut you can add the generic all problem solving run a library as a service service wrapper around it and have both and be done forever? reply slifin 18 hours agoprevI hope GraalVM&#x27;s Polygot runtime will eventually allow more companies to go with libraries over services in more situations for multi-language businesses.And Polylith for better reuse across projects generally. reply cornfeedhobo 18 hours agoparentI wish I could nuke GraalVM from the earth.

I really feel like I&#x27;m missing something here, because lots of obviously-smart-and-experienced folks repeat it. I&#x27;d really appreciate it if you could check my understanding and see what I&#x27;m missing.(To be clear, here I&#x27;m assuming that a monorepo is a single repository which contains conceptually-distinct-but-related projects - things which _could_ justifiably be their own repos, but which are kept in one repo for reasons of maintenance and managements - and wherein the build system is such that every sub-project within the repo uses the same package dependency tree, i.e. if ProjectA and ProjectB in the monorepo depend on LibraryZ, then the versions of Z that A and B depend on must be identical for any given commit&#x2F;build. If I&#x27;ve misunderstood that - if that&#x27;s just straight-up not what a monorepo is, or if it _is_ but with some extra nuance or sauce - then I guess we can short-circuit the response pretty quickly :P )Here&#x27;s how a release of a breaking change of a library would work in a polyrepo world:* I publish v2.0.0 of my library* Consumers of that library are notified that a new version exists (via automated email notification, Dependabot, whatever) \\ * Anyone who _wants_ to update can do so (independently and at their own rate) - anyone who&#x27;s comfortable staying on the old version can do so** If we really want to make things easy for consumers, we can make automated PRs against their repos (this would be the \"extremely good build&#x2F;integration tooling to deal with many repos\" you refer to, I suspect? Something like Spotify&#x27;s FleetShift[0]) to make the change - though in practice this is probably way more trouble than its worth, I&#x27;ve only seen it done for serious security vulnerabilities where a) everyone in the whole damn company has to b) upgrade RIGHT THE FUCK NOW.* Time goes by* v1.x gets deprecated* Anyone still using v1.x gets notified that they are using a deprecated version and strongly encouraged to update* A little more time goes by (not much!)* Consequences Occur for people still using the old version - this could be a visit from your friendly InfoSec enforcer, or automatically failing builds, or the removal of v1.x from the package repository (which will indirectly cause failing builds), or...Conversely, with a monorepo, the situation seems to be:* I publish v2.0.0 of my library* Every single team whose code is in the monorepo must coordinate to make the changes to consume version 2. This change, by definition, proceeds at the pace of the slowest team - if one of them is underwater on oncall, or has their only competent engineer on PTO, or has some quirk of implementation (or dependency on old feature) which means they can&#x27;t update for two months, then _the whole dang monorepo_ is staying on version 1 for two months; no ifs, ands, or buts** But, yes, if you want to a wide-ranging refactoring to change all the in-monorepo consumers to use the new method, then yeah, modern IDEs are going to have _some_ functionality built-in for that within a single repo. But - by virtue of being a breaking change, it&#x27;s pretty likely that the change-at-call-site is going to be more complex than simply changing the type or name of the method being called. Maybe the returned object needs different methods called on it. Maybe the method requires an extra parameter (which refactoring IDEs can add to the actual callsite, but cannot implement for you _fetching and providing_ that parameter). At this point, either humans are going to have to comb through the changes to finalize them (at which point, you lose the claimed advantages of being in a monorepo where changes can be done by tooling), or you&#x27;re going to have to implement some sort of code-parsing system to make correct changes throughout (which, again, is approximately equivalent to the automation work required in the polyrepo case)So: while, yes, it _would_ be a hassle to \"coordinate changes across repos\" (though _significantly_ less to coordinate across a single repo-to-repo boundary, especially if both are owned by the same team, than it would to coordinate a whole monorepo&#x27;s worth of interactions), the joy of a polyrepo situation is that _you don&#x27;t have to_. Consumers can update when they want to, at their own pace - no coordination necessary! So - yes, there will be a greater _volume_ of PRs required in a polyrepo situation, but a) each of them will be way simpler and the total volume of work will be , b) they are independent (so teams who don&#x27;t want to update do not hold back those who do).But - people keep saying \"it&#x27;s easier to make wide-ranging changes in a monorepo\", so I _must_ be missing something.

This implicitly brings along some benefits, like making the providers not cause excessive&#x2F;unnecessary version churn and ensuring easy upgrade paths, because they experience the pain rather than it being externalized onto the consumers :) Also, good tooling helps—and I think that this model also encourages investing in that. reply scubbo 12 hours agorootparentWow, that is certainly a _huge_ culture shift. It certainly explains why it&#x27;s not sitting right with me - while I do think that \"providers not caus[ing] excessive&#x2F;unnecessary version churn and ensuring easy upgrade paths\" is a good thing in isolation, it seems like it would be massively outweighed by the downsides of forcing a library provider to maintain familiarity with all their consumers&#x27; codebases and business areas. Seems to me like that would make it impractical to make any changes to a library that is consumed by more than a few other teams - which runs totally contrary to the intention of extracting _commonly_-depended-upon logic. The ideal situation would be to create a library that is _so_ popular that maintaining that level of familiarity is literally impossible.There are already incentives in place to ensure that a library provider is doing right by their consumers (building features that they want, making upgrades not too arduous), because if they make a hard-to-use library then people won&#x27;t use it which should show up in however their team&#x27;s success is judged. Seems to me that going the extra mile from \"you have to provide a good desirable library\" to \"and you must also be familiar enough with your consumers&#x27; services to do the integration&#x2F;upgrade work _for_ them\" gives no new upside but all downside - service teams _already_ know their domain area, why should someone else have to?(I recognize that you&#x27;re just reporting what you&#x27;ve heard, I&#x27;m not arguing _with you_, I&#x27;m trying to reason out the arguments in my head to get them straight)Really appreciate the insight, thank you! reply mooreds 19 hours agoprevPrevious discussion: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26398960 reply ChrisMarshallNY 18 hours agoparentI thought it sounded familiar.Thanks! reply mooreds 18 hours agorootparentHN doesn&#x27;t repeat, but it sure does rhyme. :) reply osigurdson 17 hours agoprevIf this isn’t obvious, we are lost.

By mass, there’s more titanium in the earth’s crust than carbon by a factor of nearly 30, and more titanium than copper by a factor of nearly 100. But despite its abundance, it's only recently that civilization has been able to use titanium as a metal (titanium dioxide has been in use somewhat longer as a paint pigment). Because titanium so readily bonds with oxygen and other elements, it doesn’t occur at all in metallic form in nature. One engineer described titanium as a “streetwalker,\" because it will pick up anything and everything. While copper has been used by civilization since 7000 BC, and iron since around 3000 BC, titanium wasn’t discovered until the late 1700s, and wasn’t produced in metallic form until the late 19th century. As late as 1945, there was no commercial production of titanium, and the metal only existed in tiny amounts in labs. But less than 10 years later, thousands of tons of it were being made a year. And 10 years after that, it formed the literal backbone of the most advanced aerospace technology on the planet. As a report to the National Research Council notes, “the birth of a tonnage structural metal industry is an unusual event. Only three such births have occurred in the past 100 years [now closer to 150] – aluminum, magnesium, and titanium – and no new one is in prospect.” How did titanium go from totally unused to a critical aerospace technology? What does it tell us about technological development? Let’s take a look. Origins of titanium Titanium was first discovered in 1790 by William Gregor, an English clergyman and chemist who realized he couldn’t identify a metal contained in a white oxide mixed in with the black sands of Cornwall. In 1795, Martin Klaproth, a Prussian chemist, was able to extract titanium from the mineral rutile. Because of the strong bond it formed with oxygen, Klaproth named the metal “titanium” after the Greek Titans. Because titanium bonds so readily with other elements and contaminates so easily, it's extremely difficult to obtain in a pure state, and for the next hundred years titanium was mostly regarded as a laboratory curiosity. In the 1880s, two Swedish scientists successfully produced 94% pure titanium metal, and in 1910 Matthew Hunter, a scientist at General Electric, developed a variant of their process to produce metallic titanium while searching for a material for improved lightbulb filaments. But a commercially viable process for producing titanium wasn’t developed until the 1930s. In 1930 William Kroll, a scientist from Luxembourg, began experimenting with titanium in his home lab, and developed a process to produce titanium by reacting titanium chloride (TiCl4) with magnesium under a vacuum. By 1938, he had successfully produced 50 pounds of titanium metal, and successfully formed it into wires, rods, sheets, and plating. Kroll came to the US in 1938 to attempt to sell his process, but was unsuccessful. Kroll’s samples of titanium metal in 1938, via Kroll 1955 That same year, the US Bureau of Mines began to investigate titanium, in response to promising studies of its properties performed by the Philips Corporation (which had developed its own process for producing titanium). The Bureau of Mines concluded the Kroll process had the most potential as a commercial process and began to develop it. Its work was delayed by the war, but as early as 1944 the Bureau of Mines was making 15-pound batches of titanium in a plant that could make 100 pounds of titanium a week. After the war, the Bureau’s work on titanium accelerated. By 1947 it had successfully scaled up Kroll’s process, and had produced two tons of titanium “sponge,” a porous, spongy metal created by the process, which is melted down to produce bars, sheets, wires, etc. A 1948 report on titanium’s properties commissioned by the Bureau concluded that titanium and its alloys had great potential engineering applications. Titanium was nearly as strong as stainless steel, but weighed 40% less. It was also incredibly corrosion-resistant, and maintained much more strength at elevated temperatures compared to aluminum. This made it potentially very useful for aerospace applications, where weight was at a premium and materials were often exposed to high temperatures. The military had followed the progress of the Bureau’s development work, and interest in the metal was high after samples began to be investigated by Army, Navy, and Air Force labs. Titanium began to be called a “wonder metal”: The metal gained numerous advocates within the military and industry. Early promoters visualized the use of titanium in naval vessels, armor plate, tanks, trucks, landing craft, aircraft structures, and airborne equipment. It was thought that it could possibly replace both aluminum and steel in the design of many defense applications. - Simcoe 2018 In 1948, titanium first began to be produced commercially, at a small DuPont plant that could produce 100 pounds of titanium a day. The first batches of titanium went to experimental use on military jets, such as the F-84 and the F-86. To try to kickstart the industry, the Air Force encouraged manufacturers to substitute steel with titanium, and the Army Ordnance Corporation placed an order for $1 million worth of titanium metal. F-84, via wikipedia In the press, titanium began to be called “the wonder metal,\" “the miracle metal,\" and the “Cinderella metal” (because it had been overlooked for so long). An executive for a company producing titanium noted that “Sensational magazine articles predicted that titanium would become the miracle metal-for spacecraft, ‘atomic furnaces,’ airplanes of all kinds, submarines, railroad tracks, truck bodies, portable bridges” (Rowley 1972). Between 1950 and 1952, more than two dozen companies announced plans to produce titanium. But the nascent titanium industry struggled. In 1951, the materials advisory board projected the need for 30,000 tons of titanium products, but actual shipments were just 75 tons, barely enough for research applications. Producers had assumed that the same equipment for melting, rolling, and shaping stainless steel could be used for titanium, but this turned out to be very difficult: titanium didn’t behave like steel, or like any other metal. Titanium was found “not to forge like any other material,” (DTIC 1952) and stamping it in presses damaged the stamping dies. A company that studied grinding titanium noted that “titanium grinds unlike steel. Anything you have learned concerning the effective grinding of steel does not apply in the case of titanium”. The first attempts to use titanium on commercial aircraft resulted in a sheet of metal so brittle it could be torn in half like a sheet of paper. Mills found that they often “produced more scrap than useful metal\" (Simcoe 2018). To support the budding industry, the US government stepped in. It funded the construction of several titanium sponge plants, and agreed to purchase any surplus titanium sponge production for the national stockpile. It offered rapid amortization of titanium production equipment for tax purposes, and demonstrated production techniques at the Bureau of Mines’ pilot plant. The Army funded projects to develop better alloys, including one of 6% aluminum and 4% vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V) that remains the most popular alloy of titanium today, and is credited with saving the titanium industry. When it was found that rolling titanium into sheets consistently was difficult, in 1956 the Department of Defense initiated a program to develop sheet rolling of titanium, “one of the most comprehensive technical programs ever undertaken in metallurgy” (Simcoe 2018). Production problems were overcome, and titanium was increasingly used for aerospace applications. By 1958, Pratt and Whitney had produced 5000 jet engines with titanium components, and the US industry was producing thousands of tons of titanium products a year. The A-12 A-12, via Wikipedia In the late 1950s, Lockheed won a contract to develop a high-speed, high altitude reconnaissance plane for the CIA. Because it was the 12th iteration of a design codenamed “Archangel,\" it became known as the A-12. To meet the unprecedented performance requirements (a cruising speed of Mach 3 and a cruising altitude of nearly 90,000 feet), Lockheed needed a metal that would retain its strength at the hundreds of degrees the exterior of the plane would reach. This ruled out aluminum, leaving either stainless steel or titanium. Ultimately, titanium alloy was selected for the A-12, as it would cut the gross weight of the plane nearly in half. Titanium had never been used to such an extent on an aircraft, or anywhere else. Lockheed had worked with titanium on a small scale since 1949 but prior to the A-12 titanium had mostly been used for small components on jet engines. For several years, for instance, 50% of all titanium was used in the J-57 jet engine. But on the A-12, titanium would be used for nearly every part of the airplane – 93% of the gross weight of the A-12’s structure was titanium. Building a plane out of titanium proved difficult. Initially Lockheed “had no idea how to extrude it, push it through into various shapes, or weld or rivet or drill it” (Rich 1994), and every production problem solved seemed to reveal two or three more. Titanium was found to be “totally incompatible” with chemicals like chlorine, fluorine, and cadmium. In one case, an engineer who marked a sheet of titanium using a pen with chlorine-based ink was shocked to see the ink etch away the metal like acid. Titanium bolts that were heated had their heads pop off, a problem that was eventually traced to cadmium-coated wrenches used to tighten them. Titanium welds made in the summer unexpectedly failed, due to (it was eventually realized) chlorine that the local utility added to the water during the summer to prevent algae growth. When Lockheed tried to fabricate a portion of the forward fuselage, which had to be made from a novel “beta” titanium alloy, it found that the titanium was so brittle after heat treating that it would shatter if dropped on the floor. This was eventually resolved by replacing an acid-pickling process with one identical to that of Lockheed’s supplier, but not before scrapping thousands of titanium components. Of the first 6000 pieces fabricated from the beta titanium alloy, 95% were lost. But over time, Lockheed overcame its production problems. In machining, for instance, drill bits initially needed to be replaced every ten holes, ten times as often as when drilling aluminum. In other machining operations, the rate of metal removal was just 5% of the rate when machining aluminum. To improve its machining, Lockheed developed new drill bits, cutting fluids, and cutting machinery, and learned the proper “feeds and speeds” for machining titanium (it was found, for instance, that small changes in cutting speed had a large effect on tool life). Over the course of the program, the rate of metal removal in machining was increased to “3 to 10 times the industry average” (Johnson 1970), and drill life was increased by more than a factor of 10. The A-12 “practically spawned its own industrial base” (CIA 2012), and over the course of the program thousands of machinists, mechanics, fabricators, and other personnel were trained in how to work with titanium efficiently. As Lockheed gained production experience with titanium, it issued reports to the Air Force and to its vendors on production methods, and “set up training classes for machinists, a complete research facility for developing tools and procedures, and issued research contracts to competent outside vendors to develop improved equipment\" (Johnson 1970). The A-12 first flew in 1962. 14 years later, its successor, the better-known SR-71, set an airspeed record of nearly 2200 miles per hour, which remains unbroken today. Titanium medical implants While titanium manufacturing for aerospace was ramping up, a very different use of the metal was being discovered. In 1952, Swedish medical researcher Per-Ingvar Brånemark was studying blood flow in healing bones. In one experiment studying the bone marrow of rabbits, Brånemark’s team implanted a tiny camera into rabbits legs, to watch the wound heal from the inside. When they later went to remove the camera, they found that the titanium camera casing had bonded with the bone. At the time, it was thought that the body would eventually reject any foreign object implanted in it. Dr. Brånemark’s discovery that bone would bond directly with titanium (which he dubbed “osseointegration”) was radical, and had huge potential implications for medical implants. Brånemark quickly pivoted his research to study osseointegration, eventually receiving a grant from the US National Institutes of Health. Research on his own students (where he implanted a small piece of titanium in their arms) showed that titanium could be safely implanted in the body with no ill-effects. Interestingly, during the course of this research, it was noticed that bone could conduct sound – a deaf patient was able to “hear” the ultrasonic vibrations used to check that the titanium had been implanted correctly. One of Brånemark’s students followed up on this discovery, and developed the first bone conduction implants to restore hearing in deaf people. Brånemark’s team went on to develop titanium dental implants (which were often made from surplus aircraft-grade titanium) that lasted much longer than implants of other metals. Today, the Brånemark system of dental implants is still sold, and titanium is the most popular material for dental implants, as well as being used for other medical implants such as artificial hips. Titanium comes of age You can get a sense of the development of the titanium industry by reading reports on industrial symposiums held in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. The first symposium on titanium was held in 1948, and was organized by the Navy to provide “a comprehensive review of the titanium research effort”. Several military organizations discussed their research programs, but most of the presentations were on topics such as physical properties of titanium and its various alloys, the crystal structure that resulted from different methods of fabrication, and methods of melting titanium sponge. The pages are full of pictures of laboratory setups, graphs of data on stress-strain relationships, phase diagrams, and magnified pictures of titanium microstructure. Nearly all the presentations are from either research labs or from companies trying to produce raw titanium “sponge” from ore. In 1952, another titanium symposium was held, this one sponsored by the Army’s Watertown Arsenal. By then, titanium was being manufactured in large quantities, and while the prior symposium had been focused on laboratory studies of titanium’s physical and chemical properties, the 1952 symposium was a “practical discussion of the properties, processing, machinability, and similar characteristics of titanium\". While physical characteristics of titanium still took center stage, there was a practical slant to the discussions – how wide a sheet of titanium can be produced, how large an ingot of it can be made, how can it be forged, or pressed, or welded, and so on. Presentations were by titanium fabricators, but also by metalworking companies that had been experimenting with the metal. Though by 1952 many of these companies had been working with titanium for years, there’s an air of uncertainty in many of the presentations, a distinct sense of “this is what we’ve learned so far, but there’s still much we don’t know.” A company that studied the effects of different working fluids when grinding titanium admitted that not enough was known about the chemistry at work to understand why different fluids had different effects. A company that studied surface treatments and polishing methods noted that “materials and methods for polishing titanium have not been definitively established,\" and that while “the most commonly used abrasives are not completely satisfactory,\" manufacturers were working on the problem, and “more efficient methods will no doubt be developed”. A company that studied cold-forming of titanium sheets described its own methods as “crude and undeveloped”. In 1966, another titanium symposium was held, this one sponsored by the Northrup Corporation. By this time, titanium had been used successfully for many years, and the purpose of this symposium was to “provide technical personnel of diversified disciplines with a working knowledge of titanium technology.” This time, the lion’s share of the presentations are by aerospace companies experienced in working with the metal, and the uncertain air that existed in the 1952 symposium is gone. A presenter on titanium’s corrosion resistance noted that “the corrosion resistance of titanium, unlike that of most metals, can be defined within rather simple limits.\" A presentation on forging noted that “titanium alloys are quite forgeable…The evidence which substantiates this statement is the large number of jet engine and missile components plus the growing lists of structural parts that have been produced in the last 10 years.” And a presentation on machining noted that “Fifteen years ago, titanium was considered to be very difficult to machine. Subsequent research and experience, however, have progressively improved this situation,\" the result of “gradual refinements in tool materials, machine tools, tool geometries, and cutting fluids”. Thus, by the mid-1960s, titanium had become a mature engineering material. While there was still much to learn about titanium, the practical aspects of working with it and using it to solve engineering problems were well-understood, and it increasingly found use in aerospace and other industry applications. Following the A-12, for instance, military aircraft began to make extensive use of titanium in their structural frames. From military aircraft, titanium made its way into commercial aircraft. By 1971, 46% of titanium was going towards commercial aircraft, compared to 37% to government aerospace projects. Via RAND Via RAND Lessons from titanium What can we learn from the story of titanium? For one, titanium is a government research success story. Titanium metal was essentially willed into existence by the US government, which searched for a promising production process, successfully scaled it up when it found one, and performed much of the initial research on titanium’s material properties, potential alloys, and manufacturing methods. Nearly all early demand for titanium was for government aerospace projects, and when the nascent industry struggled, the government stepped in to subsidize production. As a result, titanium achieved a level of production in 10 years that took aluminum and magnesium nearly 30. The government’s support of the early industry was successful: shortly after the program was initiated in 1951, the cost of titanium began to decline more steeply. Since then, titanium costs have fallen at an impressive 23% learning rate (ie: costs fall 23% every time cumulative production doubles), similar to the learning rate in solar PV production. When government subsidies were removed in the late 1950s, the industry struggled, but cost declines continued. And from the initial government projects in military aerospace, titanium has spread into commercial aircraft, medical implants, industrial equipment, and other uses. Titanium is thus a successful case of the government jumpstarting an industry. Via USGS data But titanium is also a story about the limits of this sort of jumpstarting. Despite its impressive learning rate, titanium remains an expensive, niche material. A 2006 report noted that titanium is five times as expensive as aluminum to refine and ten times as expensive as aluminum to turn into finished products. Despite initial expectations, titanium hasn’t widely displaced either aluminum or stainless steel, and is only used where its unique properties make its high cost worth it. The aerospace industry remains the largest user of titanium. Via RAND Via RAND It's interesting to compare progress in titanium production with progress in solar photovoltaics. In both cases, the basic phenomenon (metallic titanium and producing electricity from sunlight) had been explored in the late 1800s, but it wasn’t until mid-20th century technology breakthroughs (the Kroll process and the silicon PV cell) that they became practical. In both cases, the US government funded much of the initial development, and acted as the first customer (government satellites and government aerospace projects). Both have similar learning curve slopes, and both technologies gradually expanded outside of their initial markets as knowledge was gained and the costs of the technology fell. And in both cases, there were sky-high expectations for the “potentially world-changing technology” that neither initially lived up to. But whereas titanium remains a relatively niche, expensive technology, solar PV is increasingly widely deployed, and seems poised to become the primary method of electric power production. In learning curve terms, while both titanium and solar PV have similar learning rates, the solar PV curve has stretched much farther. Between 1975 and today, cumulative titanium production has increased by perhaps a factor of 5-10 (cumulative US consumption of titanium sponge was about 250,000 tons in 1975, and about 1.3 million tons in 2019). Cumulative solar PV production, on the other hand, has increased by a factor of more than 300,000. Though they have the same learning rate, solar PV has had many more doublings in production volume, and its costs have thus fallen much further. Data via USGS and Lafond 2018 I can see at least two potential factors here. One is that solar PV production has seen a much greater level of government support than titanium production has. In addition to early government support in the 1950s, solar PV also saw US and Japanese government investment in the 1970s, and German government support in the 1990s (via a generous feed-in tariff). Today, governments around the world support solar PV via feed in tariffs, tax credits, and renewable portfolio standards. Continued government subsidies have incentivized increased production, which has resulted in the costs of solar PV continuing to fall. Without that government support, the level of production of solar PV would have been much lower, and its march down the learning curve would have happened much more slowly. Titanium, on the other hand, has seen much less government support. After subsidies were withdrawn in the late 1950s, the titanium industry has been dependent on large government or commercial aerospace projects. If those fail to materialize (such as when Cold War strategy pivoted from bombers to missiles, or when supersonic commercial aircraft development was canceled), the industry has struggled. If government support of the industry had continued, perhaps it would be farther along on its learning curve. Via National Academies The other potential factor is technical: while there are many potential process improvements to solar PV manufacturing, there may be substantially fewer potential improvements in titanium production. In the 1950s, it was hoped/assumed that a better process for producing titanium sponge would come along to replace the Kroll process, which is a laborious and energy-intensive batch process that must be done in an inert atmosphere. But such a process has never materialized, and the Kroll process remains the primary method of refining titanium ore. Likewise, turning titanium sponge into metal is an energy and capital-intensive process, often requiring multiple rounds of melting the metal to achieve sufficient purity. This process has also changed little since the 1950s. Beyond the lack of process improvements, titanium is just fundamentally difficult and expensive to deal with. Turning titanium ingots into bars and sheets is a challenge due to titanium’s reactivity: it readily absorbs impurities, requiring “frequent surface removal and trimming to eliminate surface defects” which are “costly and involve significant yield loss.” Machining titanium is likewise fundamentally expensive. As one report notes: The hardness that makes titanium so desirable also makes it more difficult to machine than traditional aluminum. This presents a challenge akin to that of machining high-strength steel. However, the process is complicated by titanium’s high reactivity and low thermal conductivity. It is highly reactive and tends to wear tools very quickly, especially at higher temperatures. The low thermal conductivity means that high temperatures can be generated easily in the course of machining. Consequently, titanium must be machined at lower tool speeds, slowing production. If there are simply fewer potential process improvements in titanium production compared to solar PV, due to the lack of better refining processes and the various physical constraints dictated by its chemistry, there’s less room for costs to fall. With less room for costs to fall, titanium remains an expensive, niche material, which in turn keeps production volumes low. Titanium is also a story about the importance of serendipity in scientific discovery and technology advancement. Titanium’s biocompatibility, and its usefulness for medical implants, was discovered purely by chance. Studying biocompatibility led to another chance discovery, that of bone conduction of sound. Both of these discoveries led to the development of important medical technology, implants and hearing aids. Finally, titanium is also a story about the critical role that manufacturing plays in technology development. The knowledge required to turn titanium into a practical technology came from the research lab, but it also came from the factory floor. Using titanium meant understanding its chemical properties, but it also meant figuring out how to forge it, weld it, press it, turn it into fasteners, design parts effectively with it, designing tools to machine it, and a million other shop floor discoveries that came from actually building things with the metal. As one producer noted, “you cannot ship a customer a carload full of tensile properties, nor a box full of Charpy tests. You have to make something out of the material in order to use these marvelous characteristics.” (DTIC 1952). It's only after the enormous effort to build the all-titanium A-12, and the training of thousands of machinists, fabricators, engineers, and other workers to work with titanium, that we begin to see titanium being used in large amounts in military and commercial aircraft. This sort of practical knowledge – the learning that comes from actual production – is critical for technological progress. Technology consists of materials and machines and ideas, but they’re all stitched together by a collection of people that know how to do things. It’s by way of those people doing those things, and understanding them better and better, that new and better technology becomes possible.

I&#x27;ve used one, and it&#x27;s freakishly light, a 6-foot step ladder that you can walk around with balanced on one finger.I&#x27;ve always wondered what a titanium one would be like. reply petertodd 15 hours agorootparentA lot heavier actually.In an application like a stepladder, you have to work with certain minimum dimensions for the stepladder to be practical (eg rungs and sides have to fit in the hands nicely). You also have to have certain minimum thicknesses on the parts to have sufficient resistance to local deformation (eg dropping a hammer on the rungs). That forces the parts to be significantly larger and stronger than they otherwise would be. Which makes very lightweight metals like magnesium and aluminum the better choice, as you can make thick parts at the required dimensions at very little weight.Climbing gear is a great example of this. Even though there&#x27;s a segment of that market for which money is no object, the only use for titanium in climbing gear is certain specialized applications where corrosion resistance is important. Eg fixed gear mounted on sea-side cliffs. Because climbing gear has to have certain minimum dimensions to avoid damaging ropes, the very low density of aluminum wins over titanium&#x27;s higher density&#x2F;higher strength.If you made a carabiner out of titanium it&#x27;d be stronger than necessary, and a lot heavier. reply TylerE 1 hour agorootparentThis is also why aircraft use aluminum, despite the major downsides (finite fatigue life, mainly).

If your ladder was .200” wall thickness, you might in theory get away with a .070” titanium for the same weight, but you start running into mechanical stresses or assembly issues or manufacturing.Titanium is useful when you need internal volume - most recently as an example by Apple. Aluminum was fine, but had thick walls. Steel allowed thinner was but was heavier. Titanium allowed for thin walls and more internal volume, but at a higher cost.Basically, if you don’t have a size limit, aluminum is great!

(And even if it did, unless something oxidized the Cr to +6 and made it soluble, nothing that might leach out seems likely to be harmful.)The patent seems to expire fairly soon, and maybe the process will take off.

It&#x27;s a lot lighter, which makes it a wonder material in certain applications that can take advantage of it&#x27;s excellent strength-to-weight ratio. But if max hardness, or strength at a given size, is what you are after, without a weight constraint, steel wins. reply saberience 15 hours agorootparentI mean, I&#x27;m no materials scientist but one google tells me that Titanium is AS strong as steel but much less dense. I just browsed through the top 10 Google results and everyone states that titanium is roughly equal to steel in strength but with various other benefits. So your comment is definitely off-base somewhere, you make it seem like steel is much stronger, which clearly isn&#x27;t the case. reply petertodd 15 hours agorootparentRead this for starters: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thomasnet.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;metals-metal-products&#x2F;ste...\"When comparing the tensile yield strengths of titanium and steel, an interesting fact occurs; steel is by-and-large stronger than titanium.\"Many people confuse this issue, because they&#x27;re actually talking about measures of strength&#x2F;weight ratios, on which titanium does really well. But if you are size limited rather than weight limited, steel is often a better material than titanium even when cost is no object. reply saberience 14 hours agorootparentEvery source says that titanium is as strong as the most commonly used steel. Sure if you&#x27;re going for lesser used alloys of steel you may as well compare to lesser used alloys of titanium. Or just compare iron with titanium, as that&#x27;s really comparing one element with another, and is the \"fair\" comparison.And anyway, your original comment suggested someone was totally in the wrong for thinking a 4mm titanium plate was strong, which is obviously incorrect. 4mmm of titanium plate is clearly going to be really strong and resistant. They wouldn&#x27;t make plane engines from it if it wasn&#x27;t. reply petertodd 14 hours agorootparent> They wouldn&#x27;t make plane engines from it if it wasn&#x27;t....but they don&#x27;t! Jet engines can only use titanium for certain low pressure, low temperature, sections. The high temperature parts are made from nickle&#x2F;iron-based superalloys. And aluminum still gets significant usage, because for many geometries an aluminum part has a better strength&#x2F;weight ratio.Like I said, titanium is strong. But it&#x27;s not magic. Stronger than any aluminum alloy, weaker than commonly used steel alloys. Hitting a 4mm plate of titanium with a hammer just isn&#x27;t a very special experience. I&#x27;ve done it.Hitting a 4mm tool steel plate definitely can be a special experience. Because it&#x27;s so strong and hard that you could easily cause the thing to shatter, sending sharp shards in unpredictable directions... reply MeImCounting 14 hours agorootparentprevNo the parent is correct. Steel is by and large stronger than titanium of the same size. Pray tell what is this \"most commonly used alloy of steel\"? Because just fyi different steel alloys are used for different applications just like different titanium alloys are also used for different applications.Titanium has excellent strength to weight properties compared to steel. A 4mm titanium plate would absolutely be dented by common shop hammers. This doesnt mean that \"titanium isnt strong\" it just means they have different material properties. reply petertodd 14 hours agorootparentExactly.Indeed, if your design goal is strictly \"don&#x27;t get dented when hit by a hammer\", the \"strongest\" material could easily be a good synthetic rubber! reply MeImCounting 14 hours agorootparentFor most non-architectural design goals striking the right balance of toughness strength and hardness is generally what you want correct? I would imagine for building a bridge you care much more about elasticity and creep strength. reply petertodd 14 hours agorootparentAlso fatigue resistance.Bicycle design is a good example of where this matters: steel has a significant fatigue limit, and can endure cyclic stresses below that limit indefinitely. Aluminum has no fatigue limit, so any flexing is inevitably eating away at fatigue life. Thus aluminum bike frames have to be made much stronger and stiffer than otherwise necessary, to avoid bikes breaking unexpectedly due to fatigue. And that in turn means that aluminum bike frames don&#x27;t have as much of a weight advantage over steel as you&#x27;d expect. reply johnwalkr 8 hours agorootparentFor a rigid road bike aluminum can definitely be made stronger and lighter, even though what you wrote about fatigue limit is technically true. People like steel because they feel it’s more comfortable to ride. For mountain bikes, you will find almost zero steel bikes. Here the stiffness and lightness of aluminum (and carbon fiber at the high end) is almost universally preferred.One advantage that adds to the potential lightness of aluminum and carbon fiber bike frames is manufacturing method. Aluminum is cheap to machine and hydroform into efficient shapes, and carbon fiber can also be layed up into efficient shapes. reply petertodd 2 hours agorootparent> For a rigid road bike aluminum can definitely be made stronger and lighter,Absolutely. What I meant was that while an aluminum bike frame can be lighter than steel, it&#x27;s not as much lighter than steel than you&#x27;d expect. Steel bike frames tend to be only ~15% heavier than aluminum, not 50%.Personally I bought a steel road because the difference in weight vs the aluminum alternative was small enough that I decided to go with the bike that looked nicer, and would last longer. Besides, I could use to lose a lot more weight than any bike ever could... reply janc_ 11 hours agorootparentprevRight now, top quality steel bike frames at the minimum bike weight allowed by the UCI are stronger than top quality carbon fibre bike frames of the same weight. Aluminum frames of the same weight would not be considered usable probably... (Pro cyclists would still use carbon fibre bikes because they can be made more aerodynamic). reply johnwalkr 8 hours agorootparentThat’s with a minimum weight imposed. Doesn’t change the fact that aluminum and titanium alloys generally have better strength-to-weight ratios than steel. reply Gare 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd fork is made out of steel (or carbon) even on aluminium bikes reply scythe 7 hours agorootparentprevSteel has a range of strengths. The \"most commonly used steel\" is probably just mild steel and yeah Ti-6Al-4V is going to be the rough equal of mild steel on strength broadly assessed. But a high strength steel alloy will be three times that strong, and titanium can only be pushed so far. reply SV_BubbleTime 3 hours agorootparentI would use “cold roll” instead of “mild steel”.But otherwise, yea irrc… Grade5 Ti (6AL4V) is approx equal to ultimate tensile of 303 stainless (extremely common) at 50% the weight.BUT… Ti doesn’t even get close to 600 steels (like Inconel) or even common 17-4PH, etc. replyAlotOfReading 15 hours agorootparentprevSteel&#x27;s strength varies by orders of magnitude depending on the alloy and heat treatment. It&#x27;s an incredibly flexible family of materials. Some members of that family are far stronger than anything in the titanium family, e.g. 4340 steel has a nominal yield strength of >1800 MPa, compared toWe&#x27;re not talking about exotic and expensive varieties of steel though.4340 steel isn&#x27;t exotic. It&#x27;s one of the most commonly used grades of steel out there, and it&#x27;s much cheaper than titanium. There are steels out there with significant stronger yield strengths too. Meanwhile the highest yield strength of any Ti alloy is\"Titanium! It&#x27;s made out of titanium! Like the spy planes!

Because titanium so readily bonds with oxygen and other elements, it doesn’t occur at all in metallic form in nature. One engineer described titanium as a “streetwalker,\" because it will pick up anything and everything. While copper has been used by civilization since 7000 BC, and iron since around 3000 BC, titanium wasn’t discovered until the late 1700s, and wasn’t produced in metallic form until the late 19th century.As this is basically a bunch of bullet points in paragraph form, it&#x27;ll be easier to handle if we break it down:> But despite its abundance, it&#x27;s only recently that civilization has been able to use titanium as a metal (titanium dioxide has been in use somewhat longer as a paint pigment).The same also applies to aluminum, magnesium, nickel, etc.> Because titanium so readily bonds with oxygen and other elements, it doesn’t occur at all in metallic form in nature.The same also applies to aluminum, magnesium, and even iron. (I mean, there&#x27;s some meteoric iron, but it&#x27;s very rare.) Pure metals are very rare in nature. What distinguishes iron and copper from aluminum and titanium is the energy required to split the oxide into metal.> One engineer described titanium as a “streetwalker,\" because it will pick up anything and everything.Titanium is not more reactive than aluminum and it&#x27;s far less reactive than magnesium. In fact, it&#x27;s slightly less reactive than iron overall. (i.e., more chemically stable under normal conditions and in contact with common acids.)> While copper has been used by civilization since 7000 BC, and iron since around 3000 BC, titanium wasn’t discovered until the late 1700s, and wasn’t produced in metallic form until the late 19th century.This has everything to do with the temperature required to separate the metal from the oxygen atoms binding it, and nothing to do with anything else. What&#x27;s more, it applies even more strongly to aluminum, which was discovered in 1825 -- three decades after the discovery of titanium. (1791.) So there&#x27;s absolutely nothing unique about titanium in this regard.I could go on. But basically this is an \"I hecking love science\" article that barely scratches the surface of the subject -- and still manages to be subtly misleading. reply kragen 11 hours agoparent> The same also applies to aluminum, magnesium, nickel, etc.the oxides of aluminum, magnesium, and nickel were not in use as paint pigments> What distinguishes iron and copper from aluminum and titanium is the energy required to split the oxide into metal. (...) Titanium is not more reactive than aluminumthe particularly relevant issue here, as i understand it, is that titanium has a stable carbide, which prevents you from reducing it carbothermically; you end up with titanium carbide instead of titanium metal. aluminum&#x27;s carbide is unstable even in water, while iron&#x27;s carbide is mechanically strong but still easy to reduce to iron with air. copper&#x27;s carbide is poorly characterized and even more unstable, and it even occurs nativethere are other things that titanium reacts more strongly with than aluminum does. titanium tetrachloride, for example, which is mentioned in the article, isn&#x27;t a mere salt like normal chlorides; it&#x27;s a volatile fuming liquid, because titanium forms covalent bonds with the chlorine like a motherfucking nonmetal. you can argue about whether this makes it more or less reactive than aluminum in this context; the reaction produces more energy per metal atom but less energy per chlorine atomthis kind of dirty trick is why titanium wasn&#x27;t isolated until decades after the creation of metallic calcium, sodium, potassium, aluminum, and even the isolation of some of the rare earthsso i think the characterization in the article is fair reply A_D_E_P_T 11 hours agorootparent> the oxides of aluminum, magnesium, and nickel were not in use as paint pigmentsAluminum oxides were used as a pigment, predominantly in blue (cobalt aluminum oxide) but also in white.In any case, the dominant white dyes of the Early Modern period -- and prior periods -- were lead based. The presence of TiO2-based pigments is actually one good way to identify a modern forgery.> the particularly relevant issue here, as i understand it, is that titanium has a stable carbideThis turned out to be solvable via calciothermic or magnesiothermic reduction -- which is now effectively the go-to method for just about everything that can&#x27;t be reduced with carbon.

There are many environmental conditions that need to be assumed when comparing reactivity.For instance, if you have pure Titanium, pure Magnesium, pure aluminum in a vacuum at room temperature and proceed to introduce oxygen, you get the following reactions (simplified elemental chemical reactions, the Enthalpy of formation is what is important here):Ti + O2 -> TiO2 (Std. Enthalpy of formation is -945kJ&#x2F;mol)Mg + O -> MgO (Std. Enthalpy of formation is -601kJ&#x2F;mol)4Al + 3O2 -> 2 Al2O3 (Std. Enthalpy of formation is -1675kJ&#x2F;mol)As a result, aluminum is most reactive, followed by titanium, then magnesium.This is the reason why aluminum is used in solid rocket motors and various other explosive devices.Under different conditions, these numbers may change: for instance a reaction with water instead of air may yield different enthalpies. At quick glance in water, titanium is actually least reactive when compared to aluminum and magnesium. reply A_D_E_P_T 11 hours agorootparentYou can make a general benchmark assumption, e.g. in the Reactivity Series:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reactivity_seriesSo from a high enough vantage point, Ti is very slightly less reactive than Al, less reactive than Mg, and not too far from Fe.

Snow peak makes great products but leans more lightweight than durable from my experience with their dishware reply stevenwoo 10 hours agorootparentTitanium needs to be in a bigger tube with thinner walls to take advantage of the properties compared to steel - the very first titanium bicycles used the available surplus tubing from defense&#x2F;aeronautics industry that was close to steel bicycle tubing size and were notably not great until they used slightly bigger tubing and better titanium alloys. Forks have a couple of design features that make it hard to work with titanium tubing, the height from bottom of headtube to where the top of the tire is has to have extra space for clearance or a tiny object or some mud will clog up the fork pretty quickly or cause an immediate stop in front wheel rotation, and that part of the fork has to be extremely stiff. Some of of the first carbon forks had a titanium steerer tube for a minimal weight saving and to make it easier to work with the stem attachment system. Several equipment changes to this part of the bicycle have come about in the last couple of decades to accommodate carbon fiber more easily.

As a programmer i do wonder what has caused my performance in terms of learning longer, massive subjects to peak. I think as a kid I used to just storm and power through learning things, even though my technique was still flawed. I just applied shear will power to get through hard subjects I had no fucking clue about.I picked and learnt pre modern C++ to build NNets as my first CS project in 2002 and I had never coded in my life. It took me 3 months to just learn the damn MS Visual Studio c++ toolchain. But I did it anyway. I taught myself full stack development and found JS functional programming refreshing in 2006 when modern js frameworks were still young and no one around me took JS seriously(everyone was learning Enterprise java for web).Then I became more picky about what to take up because of constraints. Somewhere along the way programming became about making a living. Things changed, I found learning had slowed to a crawl.I don&#x27;t think I have peaked in my ability to learn as much as peaked in making learning sustainable. But lately that is changing.I felt renewed reading the words from Atul Gawande. Music and surgery have, it seems many similarities to software development. I have to keep upping my skill, develop patience, manage my mental health to pull off modest feats. I think coaches are important(though I could do better with seeking better career advice on choosing good problems to solve )Completely coincidentally and serendipitously I have hired or used life coaches and therapists to help me and they have no experience on programming. they have made me look at aspects of my learning process, my beliefs and what I value and that is helping me make my learning sustainable; even though they are not programmers.I think focusing on getting a good learning rhythm first was important for me to attain first in what I hope is my second wind in my programming career. reply slyall 3 hours agoprevI don&#x27;t see this on the list but \"Do things by yourself\" is one I&#x27;d add.Lots of people seem to have a thing against Going to the Movies, Eating at a restaurant or attending an event&#x2F;concert&#x2F;museum without a friend&#x2F;partner.Trust me it&#x27;s not unusual and everybody is not staring at you. reply jiggawatts 1 hour agoparentFor me the weird thing is that I couldn&#x27;t imagine myself eating alone at a restaurant (and basically never did)... until I had to travel for work. Suddenly, eating at restaurants by myself was mandatory, and it was perfectly fine and normal. Nothing to be scared of.Now I can eat by myself wherever, whenever, no issues.It&#x27;s strange how being forced to do something can make you change your perspective so completely. reply Folcon 24 minutes agorootparentNot really, I think it&#x27;s about that self-narrative, if you find a pathway to telling yourself how something is normal, well then clearly it is. You know how.Before being forced to, the narratives you probably had about someone eating by themselves were all about being loners or at least something negative. Now you know more reasons and the new reasons feel positive or socially acceptable, so you&#x27;re willing to do the activity.I suspect there&#x27;s a step in the middle of this which is rationally coming to the reason vs experiencing it which also makes a difference. IE I can do some uncomfortable activity because I believe some reason that it&#x27;s ok, but haven&#x27;t experienced it, vs I&#x27;ve experienced an activity and now know it&#x27;s fine, so now it&#x27;s comfortable or easier. reply pjerem 56 minutes agoparentprevHonestly it’s not the shame that make me avoid this but it’s more the lack of sense I feel to an experience if I don’t share it with someone.As an example, I have no issue eating alone in a restaurant if it’s needed and I can even appreciate the loneliness when it happens but I can’t see the interest to go out alone on my own.But I can acknowledge that maybe I’m missing something. reply saiya-jin 1 hour agoparentprevTravel.

I get your comment was incredulous towards an idea which isn&#x27;t want you would want for yourself and your family, but my understanding is that the author&#x27;s intent was to share their own realization that just because the things on their list are sometimes considered unusual or not normal doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re forbidden from doing them. I think the author&#x27;s point is more \"you should not needlessly exclude valid options\" as you&#x27;re finding out what you really want to do in any element of life.So your statement of incredulity is understood, sure -- you wouldn&#x27;t want this right for yourself and your family at this time.

However, having the time, energy, and drive to be able to collate this list, self-test it, and weather feedback is totally beyond me. I’m grateful that we have people like the author who are both productive people and also generous enough to gather and share their wisdom with others. reply csydas 2 hours agoparentOut of curiosity, do you interpret the list as a list of accomplishments or a goal list?My interpretation of the author&#x27;s intent is that it was more to show how much we limit ourselves needlessly due to our own perceptions (however we got them) that such things are \"not normal and shouldn&#x27;t be done.\"If I had read this article 10 years ago, it would not have resonated with me as it does today, but I was in a much different mental state 10 years ago. As I got to a better mental state I also started to eschew a lot of the limitations I placed on myself on what I can or cannot do -- don&#x27;t interpret this too drastically, as many of the limitations I would put on myself were quite strict about absolutely benign and minor things, for example (and also from the article), \"ask obvious questions\". I was so afraid of looking stupid for not knowing something and also did not handle when I got dismissive responses to my questions at work, which meant I would stress myself out trying to research something I didn&#x27;t understand well and conceptually had difficulties even starting to grasp, so even though I&#x27;d usually get it _eventually_, it was only after a lot of mental and emotional stress and lots of really dumb or bad mistakes (which garnered further dismissive statements&#x2F;comments). What changed was I stopped being embarrassed that I don&#x27;t know something completely unfamiliar to me, and instead practiced how to express:- Here&#x27;s what I understand so far- Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m not certain about and would like clarification on- Here are the questions I have that I don&#x27;t even know how to start finding the answer to- Here&#x27;s why the questions&#x2F;clarifications are important for my thought processWhen I started framing it like this, I began to realize that the dismissive response _typically_ (not always naturally) came from one of two reasons:1. The responder themselves didn&#x27;t get why I was so lost on the subject before and thought I was dumb&#x2F;lazy, but now they could see my train of logic and understand how I got to these questions&#x2F;concerns2. The responders were dismissive because they themselves did not know how to answer these questions and did not want to admit this, and instead decided to be dismissive.It really opens up your own world and is great for your mental and emotional well-being when you stop limiting yourself needlessly on very basic things in life. Even physically and financially you can improve just by not limiting yourself needlessly, for example, talking about salaries with your coworkers, making counter-offers to unsatisfactory salary offers, asking for counter offers from your current employer if you get a job offer with a better salary.This isn&#x27;t to say that you will always be successful in these items, but my experience is the successes tend to outnumber the failures, and even when there are failures, often there&#x27;s a silver lining from them. (e.g., using salary discussions again, a vitriolic reaction from a current employer I was considering leaving due to low salary&#x2F;high stress job was scary and hurtful at first, but it made the decision to leave much easier as I saw plainly that not only was it possible for me to have a better paying&#x2F;less stressful job, my request for counter-offer showed that my current employer really did not care how unhappy I was with my job -- the decision to leave became way easier)Even just think of a few \"out of the box\" things you&#x27;ve done in life that worked well for you, I bet you could make a pretty decent list also. reply zubairq 4 hours agoprevExcellent article, I definitely learnt quite a bit! reply jongjong 7 hours agoprevThis is a useful list.

Physio doesn&#x27;t do shit for the pain and mild pain killers plus \"wait and see\" is all you got for back injuries. The good part is that it does sort it out but it takes years.It&#x27;s still a good idea to do some physio for learning some exercises that help on the long run. You&#x27;ll have to do them yourself from time to time and they relate to exercising the muscles that sustain the spine. Don&#x27;t think \"hit the gym and workout the dumbbells for 30 minutes\" type of exercise, that&#x27;s out of the door forever if you value whatever spine remains you have left. Essentially just the act of walking around and doing some light workout of the muscles, don&#x27;t allow them to atrophy. Stupid muscles, they atrophy the moment you allow them two bits of rest and you can&#x27;t afford to do that because it&#x27;s them that hold everything into place.And not all physiotherapists are born the same. Some do stupid things and may damage your injury so always exercise judgement on what they put you to do. Like I had a work colleague that suffered a knee injury while skiing and had surgery then psysio. There was this machine &#x2F; apparatus that you&#x27;d strap your leg to and it would \"gently\" rotate it in a bicycle like pattern. Said colleague refused to be strapped to it and some time later at a demonstration the machine got out of control and started spinning \"the opposite of gently\" and uncontrollably. Even a regular knee would have been damaged, can&#x27;t imagine what an injured one would have endured.Generally no machines, especially when your freedom of movement is restricted and controlled by someone or worse, something else.

    "originBody": "NEWSPRIVACY Chrome pushes forward with plans to limit ad blockers in the future Posted: November 23, 2023 by Pieter Arntz Google has announced it will shut down Manifest V2 in June 2024 and move on to Manifest V3, the latest version of its Chrome extension specification that has faced criticism for putting limits on ad blockers. Roughly said, Manifest V2 and V3 are the rules that browser extension developers have to follow if they want their extensions to get accepted into the Google Play Store. Manifest V2 is the old model. The Chrome Web Store no longer accepts Manifest V2 extensions, but browsers can still use them. For now. Manifest V3 is supported generally in Chrome 88 or later and will be the standard after the transition planned to take place in June 2024. A popular type of browser extensions are ad blockers. Almost all these ad blockers work with block lists, which are long lists of domains, subdomains, and IP addresses that they filter out of your web traffic. These lists are commonly referred to as rulesets. One part of the transition will “improve” content filtering. And to be fair, Google has made some compromises when it comes to the version as it’s now in the planning, compared to what it originally planned to do. Originally, each extension could offer users a choice of 50 static rulesets, and 10 of these rulesets could be enabled simultaneously. This changes to 50 extensions simultaneously and 100 in total. Extensions could add up to 5,000 rules dynamically which encouraged using this functionality sparingly and made it easier for Google to detect abuse. Extensions can add rules dynamically to support more frequent updates and user-defined rules. But it comes with the risks of phishing or data theft because these “updates” are not checked during the Chrome Web Store review. For example, a redirect rule could be abused to inject affiliate links without consent. But Google has decided that block and allow are not that easily abused so it will allow up to 30,000 rules to be added dynamically. However, this is still far from enough to fully reach the potential of the best ad blockers we have now. And it’s not just the hard limits on filtering rulesets, there are a lot of other new limits on filtering. Items can’t be filtered based on the response headers or according to the URL in the address bar. Also, extension developers are limited in what regular expressions they can use, along with other technical limitations. Even if this is not targeted at ad blockers specifically, it’s still a major change that makes blocking requests less flexible. But the bottom line result is that it limits the API that many ad blockers use, and replace it with a less capable one. Google’s will tell you that by limiting extensions, the browser can be lighter on resources, and Google can protect your privacy from extension developers and calls it “a step in the direction of privacy, security, and performance.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) however calls Manifest V3 deceitful and threatening. “Manifest V3 is another example of the inherent conflict of interest that comes from Google controlling both the dominant web browser and one of the largest internet advertising networks.” Under the new specifications, browser extensions that monitor and filter the web traffic between the browser and the website will have greatly reduced capabilities. This includes ad blockers and privacy-protective tracker blockers. No real surprise, considering Google has trackers installed on 75% of the top one million websites. According to Firefox’s Add-on Operations Manager, most malicious extension that manage to get through the security review process, are usually interested in simply observing the conversation between your browser and whatever websites you visit. The malicious activity happens elsewhere, after the data has already been read. So in their mind, what would really help security is a more thorough review process, but that’s not something Google says it has plans for. After looking at the arguments Google used to justify this transition, ArsTechnica came to the conclusion that there’s no justification for arbitrarily limiting the list of filter rules. It says once Manifest V3 happens, Chrome users will be limited to light ad blocker functionality while users will need to switch to Firefox or some other non-limited browser to get the full extension. Nevertheless, Firefox said it will adopt Manifest V3 in the interest of cross-browser compatibility. And Chrome’s market share will certainly have influenced that decision as well. Google Chrome Enterprise users with the “ExtensionManifestV2Availability” policy turned on will get an extra year of Manifest V2 compatibility.

Will the ultimate removal of Manifest V2 support affect other Chromium-based browsers, or only Chrome itself?If the support for Manifest V2 isn&#x27;t removed upstream in Chromium, but only disabled in Chrome, then I would expect that we will end up in a world where other browsers (e.g. Edge, Brave, Opera) continue to allow the installation of Manifest V2 extensions, esp. from their own first-party verified-extension hosting platforms. So even if the Chrome Web Store also ceases to host Manifest V2 extensions, users of these other Chromium-based browsers could still get uBlock Origin from \"Edge Add-ons\" or \"Opera Addons\" etc.2. Would it be possible for some random developer to put in a PR to the upstream Chromium project, to introduce one or more Manifest V3 capabilities (new strings for the manifest.json \"permissions\" key) that, when added, would allow the extension to do all the stuff that Manifest V2 let extensions do by default, that uBO and others depend on: increased request-filter list size, async periodic network data-file updates, etc? Would such a PR have any chance of being accepted?My own guess is that such a PR wouldn&#x27;t be accepted, because I get the impression that the nominal goal of Manifest V3 is to allow V3 extensions to run under a streamlined extension \"runtime\" that has fewer hook-points into the browser runtime, and so fewer places where the browser runtime must call back to the extension runtime; where adding such capabilities would require adding all these additional hook-points and callbacks back in, which would defeat the purpose. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong!I would also guess that even if such a PR were accepted, Chrome would still disable the use of those capabilities downstream, and also reject any extension that used them from the Chrome Web Store. So at best, such a change would just mean that uBO and friends wouldn&#x27;t be stuck as \"legacy\" Manifest V2 extensions, but could instead just be \"modern\" Manifest V3 extensions with a few capabilities that Chrome and only Chrome forcibly rejects. reply antonok 15 hours agoparentI work on adblocking at Brave.1. Brave, Vivaldi, and Opera have all announced they&#x27;d maintain support for Mv2 past Google&#x27;s deprecation date [1].2. Your guess is correct - one of Google&#x27;s stated motivations is to make the extension review process easier and less error-prone; having a way to opt-out would be counterproductive in that regard. I strongly doubt they&#x27;d accept the PR upstream; there is a chance other players could maintain patches to modify Mv3 but the effort of designing and implementing a new spec around the Mv3 spec and convincing extensions to maintain yet another platform means this is unlikely to happen in practice. Keeping Mv2 around is a more reasonable approach (and one that is compatible with Firefox, as well).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;opera-brave-vivaldi-to-ignore-... reply Vinnl 14 hours agorootparentWill you be working together with Vivaldi and Opera to maintain the fork of MV2&#x27;s request interception, or will we have multiple independent implementations? reply antonok 13 hours agorootparentNothing coordinated so far, but keep in mind Mv2 code will still exist behind a policy flag in Chromium until at least June 2025; there&#x27;s still quite some time. reply sharps1 15 hours agoparentprevEdge is following chromes lead.Vivaldi and Brave are going to maintain the code so at least uBlock Origin can work.

Some employees of these companies also have @chromium.org email addresses.You&#x27;d think these other companies wouldn&#x27;t stand for Google having unilateral control over a project they&#x27;re so dependent on! But I guess, as large corporations, they can always express their true concerns through more... corporate politick-y means. reply kibwen 15 hours agorootparentAs far as Microsoft is concerned, they&#x27;re large enough to fork Chromium if they wanted to, just like how Google forked Webkit into Blink.

It&#x27;s a system where rules are added at a much faster rate than they&#x27;re removed. It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s test suites or anything to shake loose old rules, so it only ever grows.Checking 150K rules once wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but if you have to do that for 50 network requests on every single page load, that adds up. So the hope, as I understand it, is to set a ceiling to encourage developers to keep more up-to-date lists by pruning old and outdated rules. This prevents a situation where browser performance slowly degrades.I&#x27;d like to see a system where users opt-in to allow ad blockers to collect metrics on which rules are actually applying, and have them occasionally trim anything under 0.01% usage. Which sounds like a small number, but should capture the majority of dead or unused rules. Of course, that would require a new browser API in a declarative system. reply jimbob45 14 hours agorootparentprevHas Google explained why the limit is so low?I don’t think we need the adtech company to make a statement for us to know what’s going on here. reply insanitybit 14 hours agorootparentWell, I don&#x27;t see how this would impact Google at all.

I&#x27;ve spent an hour or two trying to figure this out to no avail, so I suspect many other people might be wondering the same thing I am.Examining the Manifest V3 changes more closely (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;mv3&#x2F;intro&#x2F;mv3-o...), and comparing&#x2F;contrasting to what uBlock Origin themselves say about it (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.ublock.org&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;11749958544275-...), I can understand the cause of one of uBO&#x27;s problems with V3... but not the other.The cause of \"Allow List Limits\" is clear: uBO Lite will be forced to use declarativeNetRequest; and declarativeNetRequest imposes limits on the size of the ruleset you can \"declare\".But I&#x27;m confused about uBO&#x27;s point on \"Ad Blocking Quality\". It seems that Manifest V3 only restricts 1. the use of eval(), and 2. the loading of remote-origin scripts into the DOM and&#x2F;or as service-worker modules. It doesn&#x27;t restrict the use of remote-origin-loaded data files generally; which I would presume means that uBO would still be able to use its service-worker to periodically fetch and update its filter lists.Is there some part of the way uBO uses these filter lists, that requires arbitrary remote code execution (and for which the only true substitute is burning in the lists locally?) If so: why, exactly? (Not a rhetorical question; I&#x27;m not doubting that they do need it. I just can&#x27;t figure out where the need comes from, and I&#x27;d like to know!)It might seem at first blush that the literal answer is this feature: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uBlock&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Static-filter-syntax#... ... but it actually isn&#x27;t, as you don&#x27;t write actual JS to be eval()ed in these rules, but rather just name a function that&#x27;s already burned into the extension locally as part of its \"scriptlet resource library\".Is it instead, just the way that these rules get \"baked down\" into in-page logic? Does uBO compile the lists into a bunch of Javascript source-code, and then have the page evalScript() that code?And if that is the blocking issue — and I&#x27;m still not clear that it is — then wouldn&#x27;t there be other workarounds for this?For example, sticking the generated JS code into a data: URL and then dropping it into the page as a tag. Or even, at worst, swapping out feeding the page \"JS source code\", for feeding the page a (static!) interpreter, and then having that interpreter receive instructions as regular ol&#x27; data from the uBO service-worker? (Maybe that&#x27;d violate uBO&#x27;s performance goals, I suppose? But it wouldn&#x27;t have to do it on every page; only on pages that it knows from the ruleset can&#x27;t be blocked entirely declaratively.) reply wzdd 15 hours agoparentAIUI it&#x27;s because declarativeNetRequest only allows a small number of dynamic rules (5000).

Both blocked popups and provided more user control. Both had extensions. And ad blocking quickly became a popular application of extensions. I&#x27;ve not used a browser without an ad blocker for probably close to seventeen years or so. Why would I opt in to ads?IE did not survive the competition. And Google did well with chrome. But technically it&#x27;s weird that they continue to convince people that use operating systems that come with a different browser to install Chrome. Firefox has the same challenge.It seems that Google has gotten a bit too used to that being a thing that users are eager to do. The more ads that slip through the defenses, the more market share they&#x27;ll loose to other browsers. This is a classic throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Their ad revenue (i.e. most of their revenue) is largely dependent on Chrome being something users want to use. More ads means less users. And as MS has demonstrated with IE, having a leading position is no guarantee whatsoever of keeping that. Even their position as the dominant fork of Chromium is not guaranteed. If people get annoyed enough, they might just fork and cut loose. Happened before when Google forked Apple&#x27;s webkit. Which in turn was a fork of khtml.

But Firefox got the majority, and then Chrome.It&#x27;s a bit more fluid than the OS market. A company can&#x27;t get away with just anything forever in the browser space. At least not so far. 2-5% loss is significant for one change, and denotes a chink in the armor of dominance that other players can begin to exploit; whatever dissatisfaction caused people to migrate, other players can be very good at it, which can get more people trying the other product, which if it does well in other ways, can spread. So 2-5% loss has a small chance of turning into a long, slow landslide of market share loss.=Definitely dangerous to start throwing customer experience under the bus for short to mid-term gains without paying attention to the long term picture. reply loeg 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve been using Firefox some lately because my work has a heavyhanded managed system-wide Chrome profile and one other problem is that Firefox is just buggy and slow in some noticeable ways that Chrome is not. reply DandyDev 14 hours agorootparentI often read these kinds of comments on HN and I don’t understand them.

    "originBody": "Retries An interactive study of common retry methods 10/10/23 11 Min Read Sam Rose 10/10/23 Retries An interactive study of common retry methods Sam Rose 11 Min Read Requests over the network can fail. This is something we cannot avoid, and to write robust software we need to handle these failures or else they may be presented to users as errors. One of the most common techniques for handling a failed request is to retry it. In this post we're going to visually explore different methods of retrying requests, demonstrating why some common approaches are dangerous and ultimately ending up at what the best practice is. At the end of this post you will have a solid understanding of what makes safe retry behaviour, and a vivid understanding of what doesn't. We'll be focusing on when you have control over the behaviour of the client. The advice in this post applies equally to when you're making requests to your own backend services or third-party ones. We won't be covering any server-side mitigations to the problems described in this post. Setting the stage Let's introduce the elements involved in our visualisation. We have: Requests can be thought of as HTTP requests. They can succeed or fail. Failed requests have spiked edges, successful requests stay smooth. Load balancers route requests from clients to servers. Servers accept and serve requests. Clients send requests to servers via a load balancer. After getting a response, they will wait an amount of time before sending another request. Here's how all of that that looks. We have one client sending requests periodically to one server. You could imagine this is a client periodically checking the status of some background job. The request goes through a load balancer that selects which server to send the request to. Requests either succeed or fail which you can see when they're making their return journey to the client. While the client is waiting to send its next request, it shows as a circular timer. Adjust animation speed If the animations are too fast or too slow for you, feel free to change them now. This will affect all animations on this page. Basic retry handling The simplest way to handle a failure is to do nothing. In this visualisation the server is configured to fail 100% of the time, and each client will just wait to send its next request. Not all that exciting. Requests fail and the client just waits to send another. Let's do what people tend to do when they check Sentry and notice that they're serving 503s due to a failed request to a third-party service: retry 10 times in a tight loop. You can see now that when a request fails, it is immediately retried. No waiting. We've configured a 100% failure rate to make the retries easier to see, but if the failure rate was 5% then the odds of 2 requests failing back to back is 1 in 400. 3 requests in a row is 1 in 8000. Retries allow you to trade latency for reliability. However, there's a subtle side-effect of behaving this way. Every time a client retries when it would have otherwise been waiting, an extra request is generated. This increases the overall load to our service. Now we're going to add a few more clients and introduce some buttons. The buttons control the failure rate of our servers. For now, we're just going to have 0% and 100%. When you're ready, switch from 0% to 100% and see what happens to our server. If I'm any good at tuning my simulations, you will quickly notice the server explode. Even after you set the failure rate back to 0% and the server has recovered, there's a chance it will keep exploding. What the explosion represents is a server overloading and crashing. Then it restarts a few seconds later. This can happen for all sorts of reasons in the real world, from the process running out of memory to rare segfaults that only happen under stress. Typically servers will have request queues that reject requests when the server has too much work to do, but to keep things simple we're using overload to represent any potential failure mode. Once the server has crashed once, the extra load created by the retries can make it difficult to recover. When it comes back up, it might get quickly overwhelmed and crash again. This problem gets worse as you scale. Let's add in even more clients and a few more servers to handle the new load. What you're likely to see here is that the moment you switch from a 0% failure rate to 100%, traffic begins to ramp up as clients begin to retry. Eventually, one of the servers will crash. As soon as one server goes, the remaining two will be unable to handle the new load. You'll notice that setting the failure rate back to 0% here will likely have no meaningful effect. You may eventually recover, but if you're doing retries in a tight loop and you get into this overloaded state it can be very hard to get back out. In practice, the quickest way to recover is to add more servers to absorb the load. Once stabilised, you can spin the extra servers back down. Give that a try in the next visualisation. It's tuned the same way as the previous one, but this time there's an extra toggle that lets you control the number of servers. Set the failure rate up to 100%, get into an overloaded state, then set it back down to 0% and gradually add servers until you're recovered. How many extra servers do you need in order to stabilise? Retrying with a delay So retrying in a tight loop is problematic and we've seen why. The next thing people do is to add a delay between each retry. 10 retries with a sleep(1000) between them. Let's see how that fares. You should notice the same pattern here as with no delay between retries. When you set the failure rate to 100%, the server will crash shortly after. It may take a bit longer, but it will happen. If the rate at which your clients retry is not longer than the rate at which they normally send requests, you will see an increase in overall load. To demonstrate, let's try a sleep(10000) to wait 10 seconds after a failed request. This wait is about twice as long as clients usually wait before sending their next request. This \"works\" insofar as the server is unlikely to get overloaded, and if it does it is able to recover with ease. But this will lead to a bad user experience in practice. Users don't like waiting, and the longer you sleep between retries, the more likely they are to refresh manually or go and do something else. Both bad outcomes. So what's the answer? We need a way of retrying that retries quickly in case the error is low probability, thus protecting the user experience, but recognises when things are really wrong and waits longer to prevent unrecoverable overload. We need \"exponential backoff.\" There are lots of things you can configure when calculating exponential backoff, but if you imagine we started off waiting for 1 second and waited twice as long each retry, 10 retries would look like this: 1 second 2 seconds 4 seconds 8 seconds 16 seconds 32 seconds 1 minute and 4 seconds 2 minutes and 8 seconds 4 minutes and 16 seconds 8 minutes and 32 seconds This would be an enormous amount of time to wait, so in practice exponential backoff is tuned to start lower than 1 second, and often has a lower multiplier. Google's Java HTTP Client Library, for example, starts at 0.5 seconds and has a multiplier of 1.5. This yields the following retry intervals: 0.5 seconds 0.75 seconds 1.125 seconds 1.687 seconds 2.53 seconds 3.795 seconds 5.692 seconds 8.538 seconds 12.807 seconds 19.210 seconds Enough mathematics, how does this look in practice? All of the following examples use the Google HTTP library backoff defaults (0.5 second initial delay, 1.5 multiplier). As soon as you flip over to 100% failure rate you'll notice the usual ramp up in requests, but as those requests are retried you will then notice that the backoff kicks in and things calm down. The server may crash but the clients give it space to recover. When you flip back to 0% failure rate, the server is able to return to normal service quickly. For fun, let's also see it in action at scale. I'm going to give you some more failure rates to play with, too. Go wild. You may have struggled to get any of the servers to crash in this example, even at a 100% failure rate. This is exponential backoff at work, helping your clients recognise trouble and getting them to give your servers space to recover. Jitter We've seen the power of exponential backoff at work, but there's one last thing we can do with our retries to make them truly best practice. \"Jitter\" is the process of randomising how long we wait between retries to within a specific range. To follow the Google HTTP client library example, they add 50% jitter. So a retry interval can be between 50% lower and 50% higher than the calculated figure. Here's how that affects our numbers from before: 0.5 seconds, ± 0.25 seconds 0.75 seconds, ± 0.375 seconds 1.125 seconds, ± 0.5625 seconds 1.687 seconds, ± 0.8435 seconds 2.53 seconds, ± 1.265 seconds 3.795 seconds, ± 1.8975 seconds 5.692 seconds, ± 2.846 seconds 8.538 seconds, ± 4.269 seconds 12.807 seconds, ± 6.4035 seconds 19.210 seconds, ± 9.605 seconds This jitter helps prevent clients from synchronising with each other and sending surges of requests. Putting this in to code So you've read this post and realised you're either not making use of retries, or you're doing them dangerously. Here's some example Go code that implements the retry strategy we've built up to, exponential backoff with jitter, that you can use in your own projects. package main import (\"encoding/json\"\"fmt\"\"net/http\"\"time\"\"github.com/cenkalti/backoff/v4\" ) func main() {bo := backoff.NewExponentialBackOff()bo.InitialInterval = 500 * time.Millisecondbo.Multiplier = 1.5bo.RandomizationFactor = 0.5err := backoff.Retry(func() error { resp, err := http.Get(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\") if err != nil {return err } defer resp.Body.Close() var result map[string]interface{} if err := json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&result); err != nil {return err } fmt.Printf(\"%+v\", result) return nil}, bo)if err != nil { fmt.Println(\"Request failed:\", err)} } Wrapping Up I hope that this post has helped visually cement how different retry behaviours work in practice, and given you a good, intuitive understanding of the failure modes. We can't always prevent failure, but we can set ourselves up to have the best chance of recovering when it does happen. To recap what we've learned: Retrying in a tight loop is dangerous. You risk getting into overload situations that are difficult to recover from. Retrying with a delay helps a little bit but is still dangerous. Exponential backoff is a much safer way of retrying, balancing user experience with safety. Jitter adds an extra layer of protection, preventing clients from sending synchronised surges of requests.

Retries are amazing at supporting clients in handling temporary issues, but horrible for helping them deal with consistently overloaded servers. While jitter & exponential backoff help with the timing, they don&#x27;t reduce the overall load sent to the service.The next step is usually local circuit breakers. The two easiest to implement are terminating the request if the error rate to the service over the lastis greater than x%, and terminating the request (or disabling retries) if the % of requests that are retries over the lastis greater than x%.i.e. don&#x27;t bother sending a request if 70% of requests have errored in the last minute, and don&#x27;t bother retrying if 50% of the requests we&#x27;ve sent in the last minute have already been retries.Google SRE book describes lots of other basic techniques to make retries safe. reply spockz 12 hours agoparentFinagle fixes this with Retry Budgets: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finagle.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;08&#x2F;retry-budgets&#x2F; reply samwho 19 hours agoparentprevTotally! Thanks for bringing those up. I tried to keep the scope specifically on retries and client-side mitigation. There&#x27;s a whole bunch of cool stuff to visualise on the server-side, and I&#x27;m hoping to get to it in the future. reply cowsandmilk 18 hours agorootparentYour response makes it sound like you think circuit breakers are server side and not related to retries. They are not; they are a client-side mitigation that are a critical part of a mature retry library. reply korm 17 hours agorootparentThe client can track its own error rate to the service, but it would need information from a server to get the overall health of the service, which is what the author probably means. Furthermore the load balancer can add a Retry-After header to have more control over the client&#x27;s retries. reply samwho 17 hours agorootparentI think I&#x27;ve misunderstood what circuit breakers are for years! I did indeed think they were a server-side mechanism. The original commenter&#x27;s description of them is great, you can essentially create a heuristic based on the observed behaviour of the server and decide against overwhelming it further if you think it&#x27;s unhealthy.TIL! Seems like it can have tricky emergent behaviour. I bet if you implement it wrong you can end up in very weird situations. I should visualise it. :) reply lclarkmichalek 16 hours agorootparentI mean, they can and should be both. Local decisions can be cheap, and very simple to implement. But global decisions can be smarter, and more predictable. In my experience, it&#x27;s incredibly hard to make good decisions in pathological situations locally, as you often don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re in a pathological situation with only local data. But local data is often enough to \"do less harm\" :) reply Axsuul 19 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a newsletter? reply samwho 19 hours agorootparentNot a newsletter as such but I do have an email list where I post whenever I write something new. You can find it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buttondown.email&#x2F;samwho reply tyingq 18 hours agoprevThis is one of those things that sort of exposes our industry maturity versus other engineering that&#x27;s been around longer. You would think by now that the various frameworks for remote calls would have standardized down to include the best practice retry patterns, with standard names, setting ranges, etc. But we mostly still roll our own for most languages&#x2F;frameworks. And that&#x27;s full of footguns around DNS caching, when&#x2F;how to retry on certain failures (unauthorized, for example), and so on.(Yes, there should also be the non-abstracted direct path for cases where you do want to roll your own). reply rewmie 4 minutes agoparent> You would think by now that the various frameworks for remote calls would have standardized down to include the best practice retry patterns, with standard names, setting ranges, etc.There is a school of thought that argues that the best retry pattern is no retry at all, and just get the client to fail and handle that state.One of the driving arguments is that retries are a lazy way to try to move faults from the client onto the server, and in the process cause more harm (i.e., DDoS).Sometimes complex means wrong, and all these retry strategies are getting progressively more complex at the expense of hammering servers with traffic way beyond the volume it&#x27;s designed to handle. How is that a decent tradeoff? reply sesm 17 hours agoprevSummary of the article: use exponential backoff + jitter for retry intervals.What author didn’t mention: sometimes you want to add jitter to delay the first request too, if the request happens immediately after some event from server (like server waking up). If you don’t do this, you may crash the server, and if your exponential backoff counter is not global you can even put server into cyclic restart. reply whenlambo 17 hours agoparentIf you can crash the server with an improperly timed request, then you have a much bigger problem than client-side stuff. reply samwho 17 hours agorootparentI think what they mean is something that would cause client to do something at the same time (could be all sorts, some synchronised crash, aligning timers to clock-time, etc.). If the requests aren&#x27;t user-driven then yes, you likely would want to include some jitter in the first request too.Funnily, you&#x27;ll notice that some of the visualisations have the clients staggering their first request. It&#x27;s exactly for this reason. I wanted the visualisations to be as deterministic as possible while still feeling somewhat realistic. This staggering was a bit of a compromise.Not sure what is meant by \"if your exponential backoff counter is not global\", though. Would love to know more about that. reply sroussey 12 hours agorootparentprevTrue, but you can imagine something like a websocket to all clients getting reset and everyone re-connecting, re-authenticating, and getting a new payload. reply __turbobrew__ 11 hours agorootparentprevOne example is if a datacenter loses power and then all the hosts get turned on at the same time they can all send requests at the same time and crash a server. reply andenacitelli 17 hours agorootparentprevYes. Worst that should happen is getting a 404 or something. A crash due to requesting a piece of data that has not yet been created is poor design. reply fooey 14 hours agoparentprevYup, classic Thundering Herd Problem reply fadhilkurnia 19 hours agoprevThe animations are so cool!!!In general the phenomena is known as _metastable failure_ that could be triggered when there are more things to do during failure than normal run.With retry, the client do more work within the same amount of time, compared to doing nothing or doing exponential backoff. reply christophberger 19 hours agoprevA must-read (or rather: must-see) for anyone who thinks exponential backoff is overrated. reply rewmie 19 hours agoparent> A must-read (or rather: must-see) for anyone who thinks exponential backoff is overrated.I don&#x27;t think exponential backoffs were ever accused of being overrated. Retries in general have been criticized for being counterproductive in multiple aspects, including the risk of creating self-inflicted DDOS attacks, and exponential backoffs can result in untenable performance and usability problems without adding any upside. These are known problems, but none of them is hardly classified as \"overrating\". reply joshka 14 hours agoprevFor a lot of things, retry once and only once (at the outermost layer to avoid multiplicative amplification) is more correct. At a large enough scale, failing twice is often significantly (like 90%+) correlated with the likelihood of failing a third time regardless of backoff &#x2F; jitter. This means that the second retry only serves to add more load to an already failing service. reply xer 12 hours agoparentCorrect. It&#x27;s also the case that human generated requests will lose their relevance within seconds, a quick retry is all it&#x27;s worth. As for machine generated requests a dead letter queue would make more sense, poor engineered backend services would OOM and well-engineered would load shed, if the requests are queued on the application servers they are doomed to be lost anyway. reply tomwt 13 hours agoparentprevRetrying end-to-end instead of stepwise greatly reduces the reliability of a process with a reasonable number of steps.That being said, processes should ideally be failing in ways which make it clear whether an error is retryable or not. reply samwho 20 hours agoprevThanks for sharing!I’m the author of this post, and happy to answer any questions :) reply j1elo 19 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s a subtle insight that could be added to the post if you consider worth it, and it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s actually there already, but difficult to realize: Clients in your simulation have an absolute maximum number of retries.I noticed this mid-read, when looking at one of the animations with 28 clients, that they would hammer the server but suddenly go into wait state, without apparent reason.Later in the final animation with debug mode enabled, the reason becomes apparent for those who click on the Controls button:Retry Strategy > Max Attempts = 10It makes sense, because in the worst case when everything goes wrong, a client should reach a point where it desists and just aborts with a \"service not available\" error. reply samwho 19 hours agorootparentYou know, I hadn&#x27;t actually considered mentioning it. Another commenter brought it up, too. It&#x27;s so second nature I forgot about it entirely.I&#x27;ll look about giving it a nod in the text, thank you for the feedback. :) reply fiddlerwoaroof 18 hours agorootparentExponential retries can effectively have a maximum number of requests if the gap between retries gets long enough quickly enough. In practice, the user will refresh or close the page if things look broken for too long. reply marcosdumay 17 hours agorootparentOh, please don&#x27;t do that.Unbounded exponential backoff is an horrible experience, and improves basically nothing.If it makes sense to completely fail the request, do it before the waiting becomes noticeable. If it&#x27;s something that can&#x27;t just fail, set a maximum waiting time and add jitter. reply fiddlerwoaroof 9 hours agorootparentI think decoupling retry logic from the “there’s something wrong” UI ends up being a better experience than tieing the UI state to the details of network retries. (For one thing, it gives you a chance to fix the “everything is broken” UI without any action on the user’s part. replycodebeaker 19 hours agoparentprevWhat technology did you use for the animations? I&#x27;ve a bunch of itches I&#x27;d like to scratch that would be improved by having some canvas animated explainers or UI but I never clicked with anything. D3 back in the day.A rudimentary look in the source code showed aelement but I&#x27;m not up to date enough with web standards to guess where to look for that in your JS bundle to guess at the framework! reply samwho 19 hours agorootparentIt uses PixiJS (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pixijs.com&#x2F;) for the 2D rendering and GSAP3 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gsap.com&#x2F;) for the animation. Theblocks are custom HTMl elements (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;API&#x2F;Web_compone...) which I use to encapsulate the logic.I&#x27;ve been thinking about creating a separate repo to house the source code of posts I&#x27;ve finished so people can see it. I don&#x27;t like all the bundling and minification but sadly it serves a very real purpose to the end user experience (faster load speeds on slow connections).Until then feel free to email me (you&#x27;ll find my address at the bottom of my site) and I&#x27;d be happy to share a zip of this post with you. reply samwho 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve uploaded the code for all of my visualisation posts here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samwho&#x2F;visualisations.Enjoy! :) reply codebeaker 2 hours agorootparentprevThank you so much for the detailed reply. pixijs looks amazing, and gsap looks pretty approachable! reply usrbinbash 19 hours agoprevThis is the client side of things. And I think this is a great resource that everyone who writes clients for anything, should see.But there is an additional piece of info everyone who writes clients needs to see: And that&#x27;s what people like me, who implement backend services, may do if clients ignore such wisdom.Because: I&#x27;m not gonna let bad clients break my service.What that means in practice: Clients are given a choice: They can behave, or they can HTTP 429 Too Many Requests reply rewmie 19 hours agoparent> This is the client side of things.The article is about making requests, and strategies to implement when the request fails. By definition, these are clients. Was there any ambiguity?> But there is an additional piece of info everyone who writes clients needs to see: And that&#x27;s what people like me, who implement backend services, may do if clients ignore such wisdom.I don&#x27;t think this is the obscure detail you are making it out to be. A few of the most basic and popular retry strategies are designed explicitly with a) handling throttled responses by the servers, b) mitigate the risk of causing self-inflicted DDoS attacks. This article covers a few of those, such as the exponential backoff and jitters. reply usrbinbash 18 hours agorootparent> Was there any ambiguity?Did I say there was?> I don&#x27;t think this is the obscure detail you are making it out to beWhere did I call this detail \"obscure\"?My post is meant as a light-hearted, humorous note pointing out one of the many reasons why it is in general a good idea for clients to implement the principles outlined in the article. reply samwho 18 hours agorootparentThrottling, tarpitting, and circuit-breakers are something I&#x27;d love to visualise in future, too. Throttling on its own is such a massive topic! reply whenlambo 19 hours agoprevRemember to limit the exponential backoff interval if you are not limiting the number of retries reply davidw 14 hours agoprevI have been thinking about queueing theory lately. I don&#x27;t have the math abilities to do anything deep with it, but it seems like even basic applications of certain things could prove valuable in real world situations where people are just kind of winging it with resource allocation. reply Probiotic6081 10 hours agoprevExponential backoff doesn&#x27;t apply for successful requests right? The simulation doesn&#x27;T reflect that i think. peace reply samwho 10 hours agoparentIt doesn’t apply to successful requests, that’s right.The simulation retries failed requests using various retry strategies, and then after a successful request will wait a configured amount before sending the next request. reply Probiotic6081 11 hours agoprevThe pale red failed retries should be more kiki-like, the way they are now, their pointedness is hard to see when theyre moving reply self_awareness 20 hours agoprevReally nice animations, I especially liked the demonstration of the effect that after some servers will \"explode\", any server that will be restarted will automatically be DoS&#x27;ed until we&#x27;ll throw a bunch of extra temporary servers into the system. Thanks. reply samwho 20 hours agoparentYeah! An insidious problem that’s not obvious when you’re picking a retry interval.I had fun with the details of the explosion animation. When it explodes, the number of requests that come out is the actual number of in-progress requests. reply cratermoon 14 hours agoprev [–] I worked at a company with a self-inflicted wound related to retries.At some point in the distant (internet time) past, a sales engineer, or the equivalent, had written a sample script to demonstrate basic uses of the API. As many of you quickly guessed, customers went on a copy&#x2F;paste rampage and put this sample script into production.The script went into a tight loop on failure, naively using a simple library that did not include any back-off or retry in the request. I&#x27;m not deeply familiar with how the company dealt with this situation. I am aware there was a complex load balancing system across distributed infrastructure, but also, just a lot of horsepower.Lesson for anyone offering an API product: don&#x27;t hand out example code with a self-own, because it will become someone&#x27;s production code. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
