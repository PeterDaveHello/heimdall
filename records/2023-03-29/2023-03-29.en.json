        "content": "A Hacker News article on bicycles has generated a range of interesting comments. The article was praised for showing simple but surprisingly advanced aspects of bicycles. For instance, one commenter noted that humans must turn right to go left on a bike. The phenomenon can create an instinctive pull towards obstacles. Other comments discussed counterintuitive turns on other modes of transport, such as motorcycles, as well as bicycles which could not be ridden in a straight line. One comment shared a psychological study which looked at its subjects' sketches of bicycles. The sketches revealed many \"new typologies\", with an \"incredible diversity\" among them.The discussion centers around the design of bicycles and the importance of understanding how a bicycle's frame affects its functionality. The conversation includes various experimental designs, including a \"fucked up\" bicycle, and how AI image generators sometimes create images that are slightly wrong. The significance of understanding the difference between \"knowing the name\" of something versus \"knowing about\" something also arises. The conversation briefly touches upon the efficiency of bicycles compared to other modes of self-powered transportation and how rowing was believed to be the most energy-efficient form of transportation. However, it is noted that pedaling a bicycle's properly selected gears is more energy-efficient than rowing. Recumbent bicycles are mentioned as increasing oxygen intake for better lung capacity.The article discusses the efficiency of different types of bikes, with some arguing that recumbent bikes are more efficient due to their aerodynamics and ease on the body. However, others argue that conventional bikes still have advantages, especially when it comes to hills and standing up to apply more force. Additionally, the rules governing different sports often restrict or ban certain features, such as fairings on bikes or kayaks. There is also discussion of the benefits of exercising at high altitude and increasing oxygen intake. Overall, the main point is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to the most efficient type of bike, as it depends on factors such as the rider's body, the terrain, and the rules of the sport in question.For non-competitive cycling, reducing weight is not as critical as it is for ascending. A big factor that is banned in most competitive formats is the use of fairings, which are far more effective than humans hunkering down and trying to be aerodynamic. Even an upright cargo bike can benefit from a fairing in front, resulting in a significant difference on level ground with no wind. Carbon fiber is more effective due to its ability to make aerodynamic shapes, while carbon wheels lower the weight of the wheels and make it easier to turn them, particularly uphill. Recumbents are considerably more efficient than uprights, but only on flat, smooth surfaces. Interestingly, Steve Jobs cited the efficiency of bicycle riding when he called the Macintosh a \u201cbicycle for our minds.\u201dChains on bicycles don't actually stretch, but wear down over time. To measure the amount of wear, one can measure the distance between the links. While bicycles with chains are the norm today, early iterations of bicycles had the pedals on the front wheel, or were push-based balance bicycles. The invention of ball bearings was key to the development of bicycles and cars. While bicycles are seemingly simple, they actually involve a lot of industrial developments, including in steelmaking and bearings. In order to function optimally, every part of a bicycle must fit together perfectly. The relationship between the pushing force of a bicycle and the counterforce of the ground is explained thoroughly in the article.Internet users praise a blog by Marcin Ciechanowski, which offers interactive explainer animations on topics ranging from bicycle physics to how helicopters work. Ciechanowski's blog is lauded as an excellent teaching resource, with some calling for educational institutions to adopt his work. Also discussed is the physics that allows cyclists to initiate a turn while cycling at speed, with comments taking the position that counter-steering is beneficial to mastering the technique. Other commentators note how quickly the brain can adapt to intuitively adjusting to forces involved in cycling. Another angle explored is the idea that if geometry was taught through geometric product of vectors, using forques instead of forces and torques, physics would become simpler.A discussion on the efficiency of bicycles compared to cars turned into a physics lesson. The original post claimed that since cars are heavier than bicycles, they must be less efficient. However, a commenter pointed out that diet plays a huge role in determining efficiency levels. The conversation then moved on to a video explanation of centrifugal force and angular acceleration, and how the distance between the applied force and center of mass impacts a spinning object's acceleration. The discussion eventually concluded on the importance of being precise and unambiguous with assumptions and questions when dealing with physics concepts. Overall, the thread features a mix of different viewpoints and interests, from carbon emissions to biomechanics.A blog post about the physics of bicycles has impressed readers with its in-depth analysis and clear explanation of concepts. The post covers topics including bicycle design, balance and steering, and offers illustrations to help explain various principles. One commenter called the post \"the greatest explanation of two-wheeled vehicle dynamics I've ever seen.\" The post's author, Bartosz Ciechanowski, has reportedly produced similarly impressive content on his personal site before. Some commenters also recommended checking the work of Jason Moore, who is known for his modeling of bicycle dynamics using open source scientific python.The article explores the physical forces that enable a bicycle to be ridden, focusing on the interaction of these forces on different parts of the bike while in motion. The article begins by discussing the simplistic interplay of forces between a plain wooden box and a wall, including acceleration, mass, balance of forces, and moments. The concept of moments and their impact on rotation is then explored through demonstrations of force application to a box with different distances to its center of mass. This serves as a segue into the discussion of how the wheel and frame of a bicycle handle the complex interplay of forces from riding, including weight distribution, tire pressure, and momentum. Overall, the article aims to help readers develop an intuition about the behavior of a real bicycle.The article discusses the principles of force and motion and how they apply to a bicycle and rider. The vertical forces acting on a coasting bicycle and rider are balanced, but when the rider leans forward or backward, the center of mass shifts and creates moments of unbalanced force, causing the bike and rider to rotate around their center of mass. Pedaling creates a force that pushes the bicycle forward, while braking applies a force in the opposite direction to slow it down. Friction between the tire and the road generates the force needed for acceleration and braking. The shape of the contact patch between the tire and the road is where the bicycle interacts with the road, and almost all of the rider-controlled forces occur.Forces in a bicycle\u2019s contact patch are affected by a variety of factors including the velocity, angular velocity, slip ratio, and vertical load. When a wheel rotates faster than its free-rolling speed when a rider pedals, the tire deforms near the contact patch area, resulting in generated forces that push the bike forward. Conversely, when a rider slows down, the inner side of the tire shifts relative to the outer side, which pushes the bike backward. A tire generates the highest braking force when a wheel completely locks up and slides over the road. Braking with the front brake can slow a bike down much faster but always has the risk of overloading the rear tire and lifting the front end off the ground. Low weight is vital for uphill riding, and a smaller force that pulls the bike downhill is ideal.The self-stabilizing behavior of bicycles has fascinated researchers for over a century. The friction between the tires and the ground allows the bike to pivot and gravity develops an arm against that pivot, eventually causing the bike to fall. Experienced riders balance their bodies left and right to keep the center of mass over the tires to minimize the force arm of gravity. Riders turn the handlebars to keep the bike upright in the side-to-side direction, pushing the contact patches under the center of mass to reduce the arm length of gravity to zero. The side force generated by tires allows a bicycle to turn. The gyroscopic effect of wheels helps with balance, but it's the way a spinning object behaves when forced to rotate around some other axis.Bicycle stability is influenced by various factors such as geometry, mass distribution, tire size, speed, and more. The gyroscopic effect and trail effect contribute to stability, but they form a dynamic system that evolves as the bicycle leans to a side. Self-stable bicycles without gyroscopic or trail effects can also be designed. The internal forces that interact between the individual components of a bike, such as the wheels, are important to consider. Bicycle wheels rely on the compressive strength of the spokes, which can buckle if too thin, or the tensile strength, which is larger than compressive strength. Modern bicycle wheels use thin steel spokes and a hub that guides the spokes through the rim with nipples to prevent buckling.The rim of a bicycle wheel can buckle under large loads, but making it thicker and sturdier would increase weight. The large number of spokes does not bear any load, but distributing the pulling forces evenly across them would help maintain the circular shape of the rim. Every spoke is under tension, pulling between the hub and rim. A vertical load primarily compresses the few spokes under the hub, but all the spokes play a role in keeping the wheel functional. Side forces generated by tire movement transfer onto the rim, deflection of which tilts the rim, causing a force imbalance in the spokes. Spokes are more resistant to forces on a wide hub, making radial spokes rare on a rear wheel. Longer spokes positioned away from the radial direction, forming a family of tangential lacing, increase the effective arm length at which the spokes pull the rim.The design of bicycle frames is influenced by factors such as weight, support, and stability. A typical frame is constructed from steel or aluminum tubes welded together to create a rigid structure that supports the seat, rear axle, crankset, and rotation axis of the fork. Different forces are exerted on the frame, such as bending forces during turns, which can cause stress on the material. To counter these forces, the cross section of the frame must be proportional and distributed correctly for balance. Hollow tubes can be used as they are more resistant to bending, but if the wall is too thin, it can buckle. The stresses on the frame can be visualized through simulations, allowing for optimization of the design.The stresses within tubular sections of a bike frame, and the joints between these elements, can be mapped to analyze the strength of the frame. Using hollow tubes and redistributing the mass inside the frame itself can reduce stress levels and allow for lighter, more efficient frames. However, rigorous mechanical analysis is required to ensure the materials used can withstand the forces a bike will need to handle. The classic two-triangle diamond frame shape can be modified by changing the position or number of tubes, but all changes must consider stress levels to ensure safety. Computer-aided design tools and modern composite materials allow for more creative and customizable frame designs. Understanding the invisible forces that make bicycles rideable is key to designing a safe and efficient bike frame.",

        "url": "https://twitter.com/littlesnitch/status/1640436716895870985",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35337210",
        "content": "PayPal restricted an account after the user invoiced a key containing the letters \u201cALEP,\u201d causing users to question the company\u2019s verification methods. One user previously had Paypal temporarily suspend their account and ask for their mother's birth date while buying clothes online. When the user called their support center, which was difficult to reach, the support person became defensive and sarcastic when the user questioned the need to give out someone else\u2019s personally identifiable information (PII). PayPal's verification method uses questions from public databases dating back as far as 20 years, raising concerns about the potential for incorrect answers and inadequate security. It creates the possibility for an attacker to easily access user data, forcing some users to consider other forms of payment.A discussion thread on Hacker News highlights various issues and concerns related to using PayPal. One user reports being banned without explanation, while others report difficulties verifying their identities or shipping addresses during the checkout process. Some share tactics for bypassing these hurdles, such as entering fake names or birthdates. However, these tactics raise further concerns about potential risks to legitimate transactions and increased fraud. Another user notes that PayPal's checkout flow allows stolen credit cards to be used to purchase goods, which presents a challenge for merchants to prevent. The discussion highlights the complexity of the payments landscape and the significant role that PayPal continues to play, despite these concerns.PayPal informs users that any bank or credit card information linked to their account cannot be removed or added to another account. Users with funds in their PayPal balance will have it held for up to 180 days, after which they will receive an email with instructions on how to access the funds. The company will charge a High Volume Dispute fee based on a seller's activity for all existing and future cases received. PayPal's mandatory funds-holding policy has drawn ire from sellers, who argue it puts their funds at risk indefinitely. Many also criticize the company's customer service, arguing that there is no contact address or escalation path, and only vague rumors on internet forums of methods to lift a ban imposed by PayPal.PayPal's system, which automatically flags and restricts accounts for certain words in transaction descriptions, has led to conflicts and account freezes. Customers have expressed concern about the lack of transparency and understanding of the reasoning behind these restrictions, as well as the difficulties in disputing them. Some believe that seizures of customer funds are part of PayPal's profit model. However, many customers continue to use PayPal as an alternative to submitting their credit card information to untrusted websites. Other alternatives, such as virtual credit cards offered by challenger banks, may provide additional security for customers concerned about giving out personal data. Some customers have also suggested Amazon Payments as a potential alternative to PayPal.PayPal is reported to have restricted a business account because it invoiced a license key with the random letter sequence \u201cALEP.\u201d The incident has raised questions about the best way to produce secure and unblockable license keys, as some have suggested that binary keys could sidestep\u00a0most blacklists. Other viewers have suggested generating random alphanum license keys after running them through open source blacklists. One observer mused that the designation of the letter sequence as problematical was a form of security theatre. Others, however, noted that financial transactions of\u00a0known terrorist groups could well include their own name or designation.\nMultiple keys make payment tracking easier and provide a unique identifier to match payments to invoices. Payment descriptions should at least include invoice or order numbers to avoid issues with describing payments, even for automated systems. Financial companies' use lists that are widely known, but there is no guarantee that an old key won't suddenly become 'hot' and be severely over-utilised. While the solution may be political, affected businesses must complain if they face scrutiny. Users who get life-banned from PayPal have their account cancelled and their Zelle account banned for life. Legal fine print protects large corporations, but often customers have no recourse against automated bans. Customers report getting banned without explanation, with their balance retained by PayPal, which they reportedly fought to avoid being classified as a bank so that ordinary banking customer protections don't apply to them.There is no link between PayPal and Zelle, and Zelle is a consortium of banks. A ban from Zelle for life likely means the user engaged in some form of sketchy activity. The possibility was raised that the user's account may have been compromised and used for malicious purposes, leading to the ban. One commenter also noted the annoyance of receiving marketing emails from a company that has banned you from their services. Another commenter suggested filing a GDPR complaint to have personal data deleted, but it was noted that companies can retain data for statutory obligations. Lastly, someone clarified that spam is defined as unsolicited email from someone you never had any business relationship with.discussion about spam, some commenters debate the definition of the term and its legal implications. One user argues that any unsolicited email, even from a legitimate business, can be considered spam, while another points out that laws regarding spam only apply to a specific subset of unsolicited emails that are clearly identifiable as spam. The discussion also touches on the effectiveness of unsubscribe links and the potential for them to be abused. Some users express frustration with spam, while others suggest taking action through reporting to authorities or creating unique emails for each service to track where data is being sold. Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities and nuances surrounding the issue of spam.Users discuss spam emails, specifically those sent by PayPal to banned users, which are by definition unsolicited. Some users suggest reporting these emails as spam rather than as malicious, while others express frustration with the prevalence of spam in their inbox. The discussion also touches on the difficulties some users have experienced with PayPal, including account bans and difficulties withdrawing funds. Overall, the conversation seems to reflect frustration with the prevalence of spam in email inboxes and the challenges of navigating financial services like PayPal.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35337296",
        "content": "The launch of Apple Music Classical, a streaming service focused on classical music, has caused mixed reactions. While some users are excited about the experience and increased discoverability, others are concerned about the impact on the classical music industry. They argue that the industry is dying and that streaming services are not a viable option, as they cater mostly to major labels and don't provide financial support to smaller labels. Some suggest alternative business models, such as purchasing albums instead of just tracks, or direct-to-fan connections. Others believe that streaming services like Apple Music can still have a positive impact on classical music by offering a better experience and promoting discoverability, but acknowledge that the industry faces challenges in monetization.The music streaming system rewards only popular artists, while niche genre artists struggle to make a living from streaming. One person suggests breaking this moat by starting with a genre that a specific group cares about and making a platform that offers a better user experience for that genre. Gradually, labels can be signed up by showing that there is more money to be made on the new platform, leading them to remove their catalogues from mainstream streaming services. As the platform's value increases, streaming services' value dwindles. Some commenters suggest that physical media like CDs and vinyl, as well as AI-generated music, may be more popular than streaming services, particularly for more niche genres. But others note that such genres have always relied more heavily on donations and patronage than on album sales.Video game music, along with film scores, has breathed new life into an industry that might otherwise be in worse shape now, according to a comment on HN. The surge in listenership of classical music driven by video games and movies has failed to be capitalized upon. The lack of interest in classical music may be due to the inability to make it easy to purchase albums rather than tracks, lack of new recordings, a lack of memorable and distinctive music, and contributing to the decline of funding orchestras. Such ineffectiveness creates opportunities such as a bandcamp for classical music. When so many people are focusing on music by dead German men, it may be harder to market classical music.The classical recording industry is struggling, surviving only thanks to public and private subsidies, and even successful musicians are turning to pricey traditional options for recording. However, Bandcamp has emerged as an alternative option for living composers and performers. While the platform is less organized than the new Apple Classical service, it offers exposure to indie classical music recordings through its genre-sorted new releases feed. Some comments suggest that classical music fans remain selective and attentive listeners, suggesting that AI-generated classical music may fail to find an audience. While AI-generated music may offer infinite supply, it may lack the controlled imperfection of human performers that make classical music beautiful.The potential of AI to generate classical music and replace human composers is discussed in an online thread. While some argue that AI-generated music may find a market as background music or incidental soundscapes, it is unlikely to replace human composers in concert performances. Others argue that AI-produced music trivializes the creative process and diminishes the value of art by reducing it to a utilitarian product. There is a consensus that AI-generated music lacks the nuance, emotion, and interpretation that human composers bring to their work. While AI may become a significant tool for musicians, it is unlikely to replace their creative ingenuity and unique voice.The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the role of automation and AI in manufacturing and creative fields. Some believe that once AI becomes proficient at creating commercially viable products, human content will lose all commercial value. Others argue that there will always be a market for handmade and human-created items, even if they are more expensive than their machine-made counterparts. Examples cited include handmade art, craft shows, and music created by human composers. Additionally, there is a conversation about music streaming services and how some users miss the discovery features of services like Rdio. Some suggest that the combination of Roon with Qobuz or Tidal offers better discovery and audio quality than services like Spotify and Apple Music.Apple has launched a standalone Classical Music app, rebranding and revamping the Primephonic service it acquired last year. The app offers a range of features specifically designed for classical music enthusiasts, including detailed information on composers, artists, and albums; dedicated pages for albums, composers, and performers; and a recommendation engine that suggests similar works based on user selections. The company has also added lossless audio support to Apple Music, positioning it as a rival to rival Hi-Fi streaming services like Tidal and Amazon Music HD. Despite the Classical Music app's specialized focus, some users have suggested that the navigation and search features would be useful for other genres as well.Apple has launched a standalone classical music streaming service, Apple Music Classical, after acquiring music platform Primephonic. The new service offers improved metadata management, recommendations and enhanced search functions compared to the wider Apple Music app. It also has a different UI design and doesn\u2019t mix\u00a0classical music tracks with other genres. The move by Apple follows that of Amazon, which last year launched a separate classical music service. However, facing\u00a0criticism over its classical cataloguing, Amazon was later criticised\u00a0for by groups including the UK\u2019s Association of British Orchestras because its metadata management system did not properly categorise classical works.\u00a0Apple Music offers classical music as part of their regular subscription, except for the Apple Music Voice Plan. A discussion on HN debated a missed opportunity for Apple to create a cheaper subscription just for classical music. However, the consensus was that people who care deeply about classical music will use Apple Music even at the same cost as Spotify. Additionally, classical music has different metadata and search needs, making it important to have a tailored experience for classical music listeners. Some listeners may want to select a particular movement within a piece or choose a specific conductor, which is not as important in other genres. Overall, the Apple Music classical experience was praised for working well for classical music fans.Apple has launched a new app specifically designed for classical music, offering a powerful search function that allows users to find recordings of classical works by composer, opus number, or key. Apple Music Classical features a high audio quality, up to 192kHz/24-bit Hi-Res Lossless, and over five million tracks, covering everything from Beethoven to the world's most renowned orchestras. Curated by classical music experts, the app aims to serve both beginners and seasoned classical music lovers. It also offers exclusive playlists covering key composers, instruments, or periods. Apple Music Classical is included in the Apple Music subscription and is available for download from the App Store.Apple Music Classical is a music app built exclusively for mobile devices that is available on iOS, with Android coming soon. It includes classical music tracks, albums, and playlists that can also be accessed through the shared music library in regular Apple Music on other devices. It is included at no extra cost with all Apple Music subscriptions except for the Apple Music Voice Plan. The app is available worldwide, excluding China, Japan, Korea, Russia, Taiwan, and Turkey. A subscription is required, and Hi-Res Lossless audio requires external equipment. Not all content is available in Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35343763",
        "content": "A recent article discussing Cerebras-GPT, a family of open, compute-efficient, large language models, sparked a conversation on Hacker News about the future of natural language processing. Some comments expressed excitement about the potential for local, free-to-use language models that are not subject to censorship or data spying. Others were impressed by the language generation abilities of the current models, such as the ability to invent new idioms. A few comments touched on the broader implications of these language models for artificial intelligence research and development. Overall, the discussion highlighted the potential and excitement around large language models, but also raised concerns about their ethical and societal implications.The comments on a Hacker News post touched on topics such as language models, client-side computing, edge computing, and the democratization of technology. Some comments expressed awe at the ability of language models to encode intelligence using algorithms and statistical analysis. Others discussed the meaning of terms like \"edge computing,\" which can refer to computing done on devices or as close to the user as possible geographically. There were also discussions on the potential for open, democratized AI models that can run purely on commodity hardware, as well as concerns about issues such as privacy and control in a world where powerful technology is widely accessible.A Redditor believes that we are only a few years away from the first generation of conversational assistants ala Jarvis in Iron Man, with LangChain and existing voice recognition software being key components. However, local models are critical due to privacy concerns and moral filters. Another user hopes that OpenAI will fail at calibrating the censorship layer, creating more use cases for local LLMs, which will act as incentives to build them. There are discussions about the democratization and commodification of powerful technology being accessible and affordable to the masses while acknowledging the pain of social changes. Lastly, zero-shot accuracy numbers were posted highlighting the difference in performance between proprietary and open-source models.Cerebras, an AI accelerator company, has released open-source models for natural language processing that have been trained using its wafer-scale system, CS-2. The models have been trained using the Chinchilla formula, a pre-training technique, which the company claims produces the most accurate models for a given computing budget. This release marks an unusual move for a company specialising in hardware, but Cerebras emphasised the importance of making large language models (LLMs) more accessible. Though the licensing allows for free use and distribution, achieving high levels of performance will require Cerebras hardware, which has a steep entry cost. Inference can be done on GPUs, but training requires massive amounts of memory, which can only be provided by dedicated hardware such as Cerebras\u2019 CS-2.Cerebras has released three new Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on an enormous dataset. The models, collectively called the Ensemble, have a total of 46 billion parameters and were trained on 300 billion tokens from the Pile, an open-source data set. According to Cerebras, the models achieve state-of-the-art scores on the SuperGLUE benchmark, which measures natural language understanding. However, some commenters on Hacker News point out that Cerebras' models may be less useful for real-world applications because the company trained them with a \"compute-optimal\" approach that prioritizes training efficiency over inference efficiency. This means that Cerebras' models may take longer to run in production compared to smaller models, which could be a more important factor for companies outside of the research lab setting.Cerebras has open-sourced seven language models that measure between 111 million and 13 billion parameters. The models are scattered across a range of application domains and will be available on Hugging Face for pre-training and fine-tuning purposes. Cerebras' reveal follows the release of Facebook's LLaMa models, which also focus on language modeling, but with compute-efficient techniques for smaller models. Comparisons between the two suggest that LLaMa is better, though they target different use cases. Commentators on Hacker News believe that the availability of LLaMa models will encourage more innovation from the machine learning community while adding that the best audience for such models would probably utilise communication tools such as Discord.Cerebras has open-sourced seven GPT models, ranging from 111 million to 13 billion parameters, that use the Chinchilla formula, which trains models on 20 data tokens for every parameter. The models provide high accuracy for a given compute budget, use faster training times, have lower costs and consume less energy than any publicly available model. They achieve the lowest loss per unit of compute across all model sizes thanks to their optimal training tokens, and their formula is the first to show a relationship between compute and data for downstream tasks. Cerebras-GPT has derived a new scaling law that predicts model performance for a public dataset, making it an open and reproducible LLM technology for research and commercial applications that\u2019s royalty free.Cerebras has designed a wafer-scale cluster with push-button scaling for easy training of large generative AI models using only simple data parallel scaling. The Cerebras Wafer-Scale Cluster uses HW/SW co-designed execution called weight streaming to enable independent scaling of model size and cluster size without model parallelism. The cluster is fitted with enough memory to run even the largest models on a single device, without splitting the model. The Cerebras-GPT family of large generative models has been open-sourced and made available on the cloud through the Cerebras AI Model Studio. Cerebras aims to democratize large models by solving the training infrastructure challenge and making more models available to the community. They believe that scaling to larger clusters is as simple as changing the number of systems in a configuration file.",

        "content": "The EU Commission is facing criticism for lack of clarity on its proposed chat control bill, with many concerned that the new rules will infringe individuals\u2019 privacy and freedom of expression. The draft proposal includes requirements for messaging providers to automatically monitor and analyze users\u2019 conversations for illegal content, as well as to report suspicious behavior. Critics say that this new system will infringe individual liberties and won't be effective in preventing illegal actions. Some also say the EU Commission has not taken the time to understand what it's proposing, with some people describing it as the equivalent of the post office snooping on citizens\u2019 mail. The criticism is highlighting the need for more effective regulation around privacy and freedom of expression in the EU.The article consists of a collection of comments on various topics. Some of the key points made include: the UK has a constitution even though it is uncodified and weak; vendors may lie about \"end-to-end\" encryption and it's difficult to trust any third-party service or device; and it's becoming increasingly difficult to maintain privacy due to ubiquitous surveillance, although quantum-resistant encryption and certain hardware and software configurations may help. Some comments touch on broader political and social issues, such as the reasons people move to the EU from the US, the nature of peaceful protests, and the limitations of free speech.Legal language, or \"legalese,\" is complex due to historical abuse of legal loopholes and the need to preemptively close them off. While a simplified version may be desirable, there are patterns to loopholes and disclaimers that require verbose and standardized phrasing. However, critics argue that convoluted sentences and mixing multiple subjects in one bill can make them difficult even for lawyers to understand. This complexity is intentional, making it harder for average individuals to interpret and bypass the law. However, the assumption that politicians intentionally hide information is not necessarily true as legal documents require precision and specificity to express legal concepts. Experts, including lawyers and politicians, are capable of understanding these documents and cover a wide range of beliefs, providing a check on potential abuse of the law.The debate around encryption continues as politicians in the European Union discuss proposals for the removal of end-to-end encryption in some cases. EU commissioner for home affairs Ylva Johansson last week suggested such encryption could hamper law enforcement efforts. Reports suggest technical experts are unconvinced, as secure communication is key for businesses, individuals and government officials who want to keep their data private. Moreover, it is unclear who would have access to data should privacy laws be altered. Johansson's comments appeared to ignore the need for strong encryption methods in preventing group gatherings of criminals and terrorists. Critics suggested that politicians may not have a clear understanding of these issues.\nYlva Johansson, the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, has claimed that technology companies have to encrypt messages end-to-end to ensure they follow the law\u2014and yet those same companies must also decrypt those messages in line with the law. She also said that manually scanning communications is possible without breaking encryption. Critics argue that both of these views are illogical, as the encrypted state of the message is precisely what makes it difficult to scan or decrypt. Johansson\u2019s comments follow a draft proposal from the European Union last month that suggested new laws would be introduced to prevent tech companies from using end-to-end encryption for communication services, such as WhatsApp and iMessage.The European Commission's proposed Chat Control Bill, aimed at preventing and combating child sexual abuse, has been criticized for potentially requiring digital services to scan all user communications, including end-to-end encrypted messages. The EU Commissioner in charge of the bill, Ylva Johansson, has been accused by some of not fully understanding the legislation and of making misleading arguments about its scope. Critics have also said that the bill could be used to force services to scan for other types of content beyond child abuse, leading to violations of privacy and civil liberties. Johansson had previously defended the bill, saying it was necessary to combat child sexual abuse, and argued that it didn't conflict with privacy laws or encryption principles.The EU plans to implement chat control to prevent the spread of child sexual abuse images. However, concerns have been raised over the technology's accuracy and potential for misuse. The definition of sexual abuse of children is clearly defined in EU legislation, but AI finds it challenging to differentiate between innocent and criminal images. Although the bill is not aimed at breaking encryption, it fails to exclude it from scope, leading to fears of a breach of privacy. The necessary filters have been added to ensure that only false flagged materials will be reported to the police. Critics argue that the scope of the bill extends to all digital services, and the technology could be misused in the future.Ylva Johansson, head of the scrutiny group on Europol, has emphasized the need to monitor encrypted communication and information to protect children from child sexual abuse. However, she also acknowledged the challenges of ensuring compliance with privacy standards and the limitations of available technology. Johansson is setting up a group to develop technologies that can scan for malware and detect illegal content while maintaining encryption. She stressed that her proposal is technology-neutral and will not force message apps like Signal to break their encryption or install back doors. Barry Ward voiced concerns that comparing sniffer dogs to monitoring technologies does not consider their differences, but Johansson argued that algorithms have the capacity to understand what's inside a package.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35342056",
        "content": "Amazon is starting to flag frequently returned products that customers may want to avoid purchasing. Sellers on Amazon can use automated tools to increase their visibility, but there are concerns that this can encourage fraudulent behaviour, including the practice of rewriting old product entries to game the site's ranking algorithms. Amazon has struggled to deal with reported product scams, and there have been calls for stronger action against organised groups that buy items and return them to leave negative reviews. While the policy has been welcomed by some, others have noted the challenges involved in preventing sellers from modifying product pages, particularly as Amazon performs this function automatically.There are concerns about fraudulent sellers on Amazon who change their product listings, making it difficult for customers to distinguish new listings from old ones. Some suggestions to address this issue include marking previous versions of listings, providing a link to view a listing at the time of review, and making the history of a listing visible. Some commenters suggest using heuristics or algorithms to detect significant changes to listings, while others recommend human review or leveraging AI like GPT. However, there are concerns that Amazon may lack the proper incentives to address this issue as they benefit from fraudulent sales, and their focus is on handling returns rather than preventing fraudulent listings.Amazon's struggle with product fraud is slowly damaging its reputation. However, it's difficult to measure the negative impact and its consequences extend beyond quarterly reports. Suggestions on how to resolve the issue have been put forward, such as charging for listing changes or using artificial intelligence and natural language processing to identify fraudulent changes. Some believe that manually reviewing changes is vital but that it would be expensive and time-consuming. Transparent appeals processes using human intervention could act as an effective deterrent. Although Amazon already employs a level of manual review, it needs to be more proactive to stop wholesale swaps of products and significant changes to product descriptions, title, and photos.The problem with product reviews on Amazon is that sellers can change the product listings, resulting in reviews being associated with the wrong item. Solutions proposed include preventing sellers from changing the UPC code, allowing customers to request manual review of changes with a fee charge, gating the process behind human intervention, tracking products by SKU number, using AI validation, and preventing sellers from changing the ASIN. Amazon's commingling inventory method also poses a challenge, as they don't differentiate between different seller's stocks. However, since product reviews are a crucial part of Amazon's business, and the company's reputation is at stake, human intervention or AI validation seems necessary to ensure product reviews are accurate.Commenters on Hacker News discuss the challenges of buying products on Amazon, citing concerns around counterfeit products, unresolved issues with returns, and unreliable supply chains. Some argue that Amazon needs to do more to protect consumers from fraudulent products, such as implementing AI technology to catch bad actors, while others suggest that the company should allow for feedback on product listings to catch misleading descriptions. Still others suggest that Amazon has lost its focus on \"customer obsession\" and is more focused on profits, leading to a decline in the quality of the user experience. Overall, the sentiment seems to be that while Amazon may be convenient for some purchases, it is often not worth the hassle or risks involved in buying on the platform.A discussion on Hacker News highlights some of the problems with Amazon's seller system, including inventory co-mingling and difficulty reviewing individual sellers. One comment notes that Amazon could track which seller provided a given item, allowing for more accurate reviews, but that the company currently allows inventory from all sellers to be mixed together in a warehouse. Other complaints include issues with fake or misleading product descriptions, and incidents where a seller ships a different version or product. A few users noted that they have started using alternative sellers or AliExpress instead, as Amazon's convenience and fast shipping times are becoming outweighed by the negatives of the platform.Amazon is stepping up its efforts to crack down on fraudulent listings by warning customers of suspected counterfeit items. If the online retailer suspects a product is not legitimate, it will now show a \"genuine\" notice in red on the product page. Amazon has previously faced criticism for allowing fake reviews and counterfeit items to be sold on its site. However, critics suggested that Amazon should do more to help customers identify fake items on the platform. The company's new move is a significant step towards empowering buyers to make informed decisions, and it helps address the concerns of legitimate sellers who have been undercut by fake items.Amazon is introducing a warning label to flag \"frequently returned\u201d products that will indicate the item's sales history and encourage customers to research the product before buying. In a bid to reduce returns and protect customers from low-quality products, the label will highlight items that have been returned frequently and could be misleading or unreliable. The move aims to provide greater transparency for customers and encourage retailers to improve product quality and descriptions. The warning has already appeared on some third-party listings fulfilled by Amazon, with the label currently only visible when logged into an Amazon account.Amazon is testing a new warning tag on its product listings to identify items that are frequently returned by customers, which could lead to higher storage and disposal costs. Online retailers have reported a surge in return rates during the Covid-19 pandemic as consumers make more online purchases, with returns still above pre-pandemic levels. The new tag follows another released by Amazon earlier this month that publicly displays how many units of a product have been sold. Amazon has not revealed when the \"frequently returned item\" tag will be widely rolled out or in which regions it will be available. The move could help reduce costs for the company, which has cut 27,000 jobs this year to reduce operational costs.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35347647",
        "content": "Discussions on Hacker News revolve around a new release of health insurance \"transparency data\" that appears to be wrong, with some users speculating that it might be due to malicious compliance, while others suggest it could simply be due to healthcare IT being understaffed and incompetent. The data is intended to show how much hospitals charge and what insurers pay, and while some commenters, including those with experience in healthcare IT, question the accuracy of the data, others express frustration with the opacity of healthcare costs and the perceived lack of ability for consumers to negotiate prices. The overall sentiment seems to be that the healthcare system is broken, and opinions vary on the best solution, ranging from federal government takeovers of the industry to allowing private insurance companies to build offerings on top of centralized core services.Several individuals shared their experiences with emergency room wait times in the United States. There were varying wait times reported, ranging from 10 minutes to 25 hours, with some individuals waiting for hours without receiving care. Many commented on the high cost of healthcare in the US, with one individual reporting a nearly $3k bill for a minor medical procedure. The discussion also touched on the issue of healthcare access and the role of insurance, with some individuals questioning the sustainability of the healthcare system in their area given the number of hospitals and ERs. The conversation ended with a broader discussion of healthcare systems around the world, with some individuals pointing to other countries with better access and outcomes than the US.The article's comments section features a discussion on the inefficiencies of the US healthcare system and the potential benefits of a single-payer system. The conversation also touches on fraud and the need for an entity that can negotiate for the lowest possible rate from health service providers. Some commenters share their experiences of seeking medical treatment both in the US and abroad, finding the US system overly bureaucratic and complicated. Others argue that single-payer systems also have drawbacks, such as long wait times for specialists and access to certain procedures. The discussion ends with a reminder that the high cost of healthcare in the US is a significant problem that needs to be addressed.the data is unclear due to the complexity and inconsistency of health insurance data, it undermines the purpose of the transparency requirement. The author acknowledges that this complexity is partly due to the incompetence of health insurers and the difficulty in standardizing data from multiple payors. However, other countries have successfully implemented price controls on healthcare procedures, indicating that the complexity of the problem is not inherent to the healthcare industry. The article also briefly touches on the debate surrounding universal healthcare and the Modern Monetary Theory.The healthcare industry in the United States is notoriously opaque, with no real public transparency regarding the pricing of medical procedures. This is due to complex billing systems and contracts between providers and insurers that make it difficult for patients to determine the cost of their care. Recently, a federal rule requiring hospitals to disclose their prices was mostly ignored by the industry. A group of developers is now attempting to gather pricing data for medical procedures from all US hospitals and release it under a Creative Commons license. However, the task has proven difficult due to the lack of transparency in the industry, with prices being decipherable only by an elite few who are too busy to work on the problem. The issue has raised questions about the healthcare industry's true motivations and its willingness to improve its systems.The machine-readable-files (MRFs) containing insurance rates for medical procedures are seriously flawed, with wrong, missing, or mislabeled data making it unusable for anyone seeking transparency in healthcare. The insurance companies that are publishing this data are also the ones selling it, so there's no way to verify what they publish. The best hope for verification is to compare it with hospital data, but even then, the data is of poor quality, with most rates being significantly off. However, DoltHub is offering a data bounty by collecting rates for the most popular medical procedures for all US hospitals, which will then be released under Creative Commons. They're also expanding cross-checks by compiling all hospital standard charge data into a relational database, which anyone can access.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35349608",
        "content": "A chatbot called Gpt4all has been created, trained on over 800,000 GPT-3.5-Turbo generations based on LLaMa, with the aim of producing better generative models. GPT-3 is a language model that allows users to generate text based on various prompts, whilst LLaMa is a BERT model from Facebook designed to be used by language researchers to generate models for different languages. The training data for Gpt4all is considered to be of higher quality and to provide better results compared to previous data sets used to train similar models. One of the biggest benefits of the new data set is the potential for it to be used in training Lora adapters for other models. Responding to questions from fellow users, Gpt4all's creators explained that the output quality of the chatbot depends on the code inputted, and that it can be used to generate English descriptions of code to produce insights on a codebase.The release of GPT-4 language model (LLM) has spurred the creation of two open-source alternatives, GPT4All and Alpaca. GPT4All is a fraction of the price of OpenAI's model, and both of the newer options train on AI teaching pairs available via downloading from tech blogging site Hugging Face's open-access forum. Open-access LLMs are expected to rapidly become commoditized, with prices tumbling, benefiting the open-source community. As it stands, the creation of open-source LLMs may be barred by current proprietary models' terms of use, such as OpenAI's policy. However, training open-sourced models on downloaded input and output pairs seems to circumvent this barrier.This article discusses the release of the language model LoRA, which is available on GitHub. Users can generate text by providing a prompt, giving them control over the model's output. Some users report slower download speeds when using LoRA compared to other models, and the dataset has some disproportionately represented and absent topics. There is no official benchmark system for comparing models, but some suggest creating a list of control questions to run against new models instead of using test suites. Users also discuss the legality of using another model's weights and outputs as part of a new model's training corpus. While LoRA allows for control over generated text output, its use for commercial purposes may be legally ambiguous.The controversy around LLaMA, a fine-tuned version of OpenAI's language model GPT-3, continues. While LLaMA was created to showcase researchers' work and provide a useful tool for the public, concerns have been raised about ownership of the model's outputs and potential copyright violations. Experts argue that since the model is based on a pre-existing algorithm, there might not be enough originality involved to be copyrighted in the same way that other intellectual creations are. The discussion also touched on the limitations of transfer learning, with some suggesting that fine-tuning allows for more flexibility, while others contend that it cuts too deep to be effective. Finally, there are concerns that keeping LLaMA behind closed doors will lead to increasingly consolidated\u00a0power among the largest corporations, who stand to benefit the most from access to these technologies.ChatGPT, an open-source conversational AI model by Nomic AI, is being trained with LLaMa 7B, which is a dataset of natural language processing tasks. The LLaMa 7B was generated by combining the Natural Questions dataset, the GPT-3-like SuperGLUE benchmark dataset and a variety of open-source dialogue datasets. In contrast to other conversational AI models, ChatGPT does not create a summarized version of the entire conversation history to send to the model. Instead, it only uses the most recent turns of the conversation to generate responses to the current discussion turn. Some implementations of ChatGPT use a technique called \"history trimming\" to limit the context window size considered by the model. The development of such conversational AI models can significantly assist businesses in offering better customer services.The text advises on how to perform an exercise while maintaining good posture and gradually increasing repetitions. It also provides the CSS code for a light red color with a medium light shade of pink. The prompt asks for a new movie plot titled \"The Last Stand,\" which involves a group of mercenaries hired to protect a town from a criminal while the sheriff resists their help. The poem describes Julius Caesar falling into a Caesar salad in iambic pentameter. The keywords baseball, football, and soccer are summarized as \"sports, athletics, games.\" The information provided is about a chatbot called gpt4all, trained on assistant data and available on GitHub.",

        "url": "https://island.is/en/get-long-term-visa-for-remote-workers",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35342708",
        "content": "Iceland is easing long-term visa requirements for remote workers, according to a post on Hacker News. The visa, available from December, requires applicants to earn at least ISK1.3m ($10,000) a month, which can include a spouse's income, and have valid health insurance. Successful applicants will be able to stay in Iceland for up to six months, but can apply for extensions, with the possibility of eventually obtaining a permanent residence permit. Iceland is keen to encourage remote workers to move to the country as it seeks to move beyond its reliance on tourism, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, and diversify its economy.Iceland's remote work visa requires applicants to show a monthly income of 1 million ISK (~$7k USD) to ensure they won't become dependent on local welfare programs. However, commenters have debated whether this requirement is fair, as high taxes in some countries could mean someone earning half the qualifying income in Iceland would still have more disposable income than someone earning the full amount but living in a low-tax country. Additionally, some argue that as the visa is aimed at attracting high-income individuals to spend money in Iceland, the income requirement is reasonable. Commenters also note that the cost of living in Iceland can be high, making it essential for applicants to have a comfortable income. Some commenters have compared Iceland's visa requirements to those of other countries.Iceland has introduced a new remote worker visa for high earners, and has set the minimum income at four times the amount required for a similar visa in Portugal. The aim is to attract self-sufficient individuals who will stimulate the economy through consumption and generate revenue for the local government. Iceland is a member of the Schengen area, meaning anyone with visa-free entry to that zone can move there, which largely rules out people from poorer countries. Although some workers in the US or people from countries like Japan can easily meet the income requirements, many tech workers in Europe would not qualify. Iceland's suitability as a destination remains a matter of opinion, with one commenter saying it has minimal biodiversity and is as close to the moon as you can get, while others praised it for its pristine wilderness, glaciers, hot springs, and other natural attractions.Iceland is offering a new work visa programme that allows remote workers to stay in the country for six months. Applicants must prove that they can generate a monthly income of at least ISK 1,000,000 ($8,300) and meet health, insurance, and accommodation requirements. The programme is open to nationals of around 50 countries, excluding developing countries. The idea is to generate revenue from remote workers while boosting Iceland's reputation as a tourist destination. In 2019, tourism accounted for 8.2% of Iceland\u2019s $25 billion GDP. The visa programme will run until the end of 2022 and is renewable. It does not provide a pathway to permanent residency.Iceland is offering a new \"remote work visa\" programme, whereby foreign workers who meet the required criteria can stay for up to six months in Iceland. To qualify for the visa, applicants must fall within a salary range of at least ISK 1m ($8,000) per month and have a profession that allows remote working. There are a limited number of visas available and the successful applicants will have to provide proof of medical insurance, among other requirements. Iceland, which is not an EU member but is part of the European Economic Area and the Schengen area, has implemented the programme as a way of extending tourism revenues. There are no plans to offer a path to citizenship.Some commenters on Hacker News discussed the challenges of obtaining citizenship in countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, which have high levels of immigration but stringent requirements for citizenship. They noted that affordable housing is a major issue in these countries due to the influx of immigrants. Some commenters speculated that the US uses its influence to prevent Americans from moving overseas permanently to cheaper nations, though others disputed this claim. One commenter pointed out that Argentina is a friendly country for long-term visitors, but the bureaucratic obstacles to living there may be difficult for Americans. Another suggested that the US may not want to lose its social capital if too many Americans move overseas.Iceland has introduced new long-term visa options for high-earning foreign remote workers who want to live and work in Iceland for up to six months. However, the requirement for applicants to send paper applications has been criticised by some in the sector. The new rules, implemented in June this year, require applicants to have earned at least 1m Icelandic kr\u00f3na ($8,000) a month over the past year, and to have health insurance. The high cost of living and minimum earnings threshold may limit the scheme to only a handful of applicants. Some observers argue that Iceland could do more to attract human capital, given a global trend toward remote work and the growing number of digital nomads.The text discusses the requirements and process for obtaining a long-term visa for remote work in Iceland. The visa permits foreigners to stay in Iceland for 90 to 180 days in order to work remotely, provided they earn a foreign income of ISK 1,000,000 per month. Spouses and children may also apply for a visa as family members of the remote worker. However, remote workers are not allowed to work for local employers or participate in the Icelandic labor market. Applications must be submitted in paper form with the appropriate supporting documents and processing fees. While Iceland is known for its scenic beauty, some commenters on the post express reservations about the climate and isolation of the country.",

        "content": "A Microsoft fan who has been using Windows since its early days now says it is malware after losing work due to an unwelcome restart. They also lament the poor performance and bugs with Visual Studio, calling it \"a hot mess.\" They are frustrated with the lack of control over Windows updates, having to tell the computer that their internet connection is metered to stop the constant flow of updates. Other commenters echo these issues, with some noting that they have resorted to using other tools like Notepad++ instead of Visual Studio. They criticise Microsoft's poor user experience and the decline in the quality of its developer and productivity applications.Users discuss the frustrations of working with Windows and the limitations of Microsoft's software. Some commenters recommend trying the last version of Windows 10 LTSB, which removes unnecessary software and reportedly works well on a range of devices. However, others express concern about Microsoft's focus on advertising and the negative impact of eliminating Software Development Engineers in Test roles. Some users suggest using alternative tools like JetBrains' CLion or Rider for C++ and C# development, or resorting to simple tools like vim, git, gdb, cscope, and ctags. Though opinions vary, many express a desire for more user-centric design and a focus on quality and reliability in software development.A debate over the perceived biases of GNU/Linux got heated on Hacker News this week, with some accusing the open source community of being extremist in rejecting non-free software. One user said that they enjoyed using paid software and non-free software \u201cblobs\u201d for convenience\u2019s sake. The discussion began following an article about Parallels compatibility on M2 Macs, which criticised Microsoft\u2019s behaviour and claimed that GNU/Linux is preferential because it is \u201cfree\u201d. The same author also argued that Microsoft is neglecting \u201cquality of life\u201d features and \u201cbuggering Windows for developers\u201d. Others questioned whether rejecting non-free software meant rejecting users\u2019 freedom to modify code.Users discuss their favorite Microsoft software products and their experiences with them, including Word, Excel, Teams, and Outlook/Exchange. While some users prefer Microsoft products because of their experience and productivity, others may find them frustrating, with issues ranging from formatting compatibility and glitches to UX and marketing decisions. Some users also discuss the benefits and limitations of FOSS software, noting that while it may offer greater freedom and control, it can also require significant resources to fork and maintain. Overall, users offer a mix of positive and negative experiences with Microsoft software, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses.The discussion centers around maintaining open-source software and forks. Many companies maintain their forks while waiting for patches to be applied upstream, and patches are often accepted by maintainers. However, in some cases, it can be difficult to maintain forks and keep them up to date, which may result in losing maintenance benefits of upstream work. Some Linux distros also maintain their own set of patches. The conversation also touches on the use of nonfree software and its ethical implications, with the FSF taking a strong stance against nonfree drivers, BIOS/EFI programs, and kernel blobs. Some users argue for special exceptions, such as for handicap accessibility or specialized use cases. The comment also touches on comparing the support experiences between Windows and Linux.Comments on a forum discussing free and open source software ranged from discussions on the effectiveness of the Free Software Foundation's messaging to opinions on different software tools. Some users recounted how they were convinced to switch to GNU/Linux by reading essays on free software, while others felt that the association between open-source software and ownership or security was not accurate. One user criticized calling Microsoft software malware, citing the widespread use of Excel as an end user-empowering software. The discussion also covered loss of control over devices, with one user stating that they realized Richard Stallman's comment on proprietary software subjugating users was accurate when they lost control of their phone. Overall, the conversation touched on both technical and philosophical aspects of free and open source software.A comment thread on Hacker News discussed Microsoft's business tactics in the 90s, including accusations of encouraging Wordperfect and Lotus to focus on OS/2 while preparing to promote Excel and Word for Windows. Some users argued that Microsoft's dominance in the software industry was due to their ability to adapt to the common interface in Windows, while others cited anti-competitive practices and bundling deals. The conversation also addressed Excel's success as a program and the idea of Microsoft software as malware. Some users compared Microsoft to other tech giants like Google and Apple, and linked to GNU articles describing these companies as proprietary malware. The thread touched on a wide range of topics related to the history and ethics of the tech industry.Some commenters on a forum have criticized Microsoft software, claiming that it is malware, which prioritizes security over freedom, and attracts more malware due to its popularity. One commenter suggests that if Microsoft turned out to be a bad actor, it would be easy to switch to Linux or another alternative. Others argue that Microsoft's software is not malware but rather prioritizes user security and convenience, and criticize the use of the term 'malware' to create a broad, simplistic definition. Commenters also discuss the inefficiency of closed-source software and the waste of taxpayer money spent on managing software licenses. Meanwhile, some argue that piracy, not software vulnerabilities, is the source of much malware. The Free Software Foundation advocates for user control and ethical software practices.Nonfree software puts developers and manufacturers in a position of power over the users, which can lead to malicious functionalities that harm users. The UEFI program required for booting makes computers vulnerable to rootkits, and should be replaced with user-installed startup software. Microsoft is guilty of different types of malware such as back doors, DRM, insecurity, interference, sabotage, subscriptions, and surveillance. Microsoft has been known to force Windows users to install updates, impose restrictions, delete programs, and harass users with intrusive ads, among other things. Subscriptions to software and DRM also restrict user control. Windows 11 continually sends data to online servers without user permission as soon as it boots. Users should switch to free operating systems to avoid proprietary software problems.The Free Software Foundation (FSF) warns that Microsoft engages in various kinds of surveillance and control of user activities through its products and services. The company collects users' personal data and sends it to Microsoft and other companies without easily accessible options for users to prevent it. Microsoft also includes surveillance capabilities in its Office 365 suite and requires players of Minecraft to open an account on Microsoft's network to give the company access to their data. Additionally, Microsoft collects identifiable information through proprietary programs like Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and WebEx, and forces users to give their phone numbers to access Windows' functions. The FSF also identifies various features of Windows 10 that enable the company to spy on users and jail and censor its applications.",

        "content": "The Federal Reserve is reportedly losing money for the first time, with $42 billion in operating losses suffered since September 2022. This news has caused some confusion, as the Fed can print money and is capable of paying off this amount easily. Some believe that the announcement could be a way of manipulating public opinion in order to influence the Fed's decision-making processes. One theory is that this news has been intentionally propagated in order to create fear and encourage bank runs, which, in turn, could force the Fed to reconsider its fiscal policies, eventually leading to a return to zero interest rates. Whether or not these theories hold true, it's clear that some are skeptical of the motivations behind this announcement.The recent rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve in response to rising inflation have been controversial, particularly among those who argue that they disproportionately harm low-wage workers. Some have questioned the effectiveness of raising rates to combat inflation, arguing that taxes on the wealthy are a more sustainable solution. Others point out that the Federal Reserve's low-interest policies during the pandemic helped drive a much-needed recovery of the economy, particularly for those who were underemployed. Populist parties in many countries tend to advocate for lower interest rates and increased government spending to benefit the poorest members of society. However, some argue that the Fed's primary concern should be price stability, particularly given the pressures of supply chain disruptions and pandemic-related economic uncertainty.The Federal Reserve operates like an investor and has the power to create money. However, it is not accurate to say that the Fed simply prints money. The Fed creates money, lends it to a counter-party, and expects it to be returned. If not returned, the Fed will incur losses. The Fed's tools allow them to invest in the economy as a whole. If the Fed continues to print money without regard for the public markets, it could lead to inflation and an interest crisis. The trading desk also buys bonds, and the Fed can get more targeted than investing in individual banks. Overall, the Fed's actions are complex, and it is not productive to view them as just \"dumb villains.\"The Federal Reserve has reported negative equity capital for the first time, as it lost $5.5bn on its portfolio of Treasury securities in 2020. Despite this, the Fed is not technically insolvent, since it can print money at will. Although the situation is not an immediate cause for concern, it has caused some to question the central bank's long-term financial stability. The current chairman, Jerome Powell, has previously reassured the public that the bank has enough tools to manage any issues\u00a0and that the losses were not significant enough to impair its role in safeguarding the US financial system.The Federal Reserve is incurring significant losses due to its policies during the pandemic, causing its equity capital to go negative. The central bank purchased mortgage-backed securities and bonds to improve liquidity during the pandemic, but as these short-term bonds have lost value due to the Fed raising interest rates and stopping its bond purchases, its assets are now worth significantly less than its liabilities. The Fed is also losing money as it borrows short-term funds from banks through a reserve program, which costs the bank money due to low yields. This situation is causing concern for many experts as it weakens the Fed's ability to efficiently manage the economy. Additionally, the Fed is no longer sending $100 billion a year to the US treasury but instead sending this money to US commercial banks.A discussion on Hacker News explored the implications of the US Federal Reserve's recent announcement of a balance sheet loss of $66.4bn for 2020 due to market upheavals during the pandemic. One user suggested that emergency measures for stimulating the economy were not being applied\u00a0responsibly as they are there only for emergencies, whereas it seems the bar for what qualifies for emergency treatment is itself being lowered. Another user pointed out that people who decry cryptocurrencies as valueless also appear to accept that any currency has value \"because people believe it has value\". The thread also noted that the Fed may not use all of the money it is hoarding, but that it is nevertheless potentially \"printing money\".The discussion revolves around the pros and cons of tying monetary supply to gold. Some believe that tying currency to a physical commodity like gold limits inflation and the abuse of the monetary supply. Others argue that gold is an inefficient and limited resource, and that the best economic tool is control over the imaginary units of currency. The point is made that any economic tool should operate as the metabolism of a larger organism, and money is a medium of exchange and signaling rather than having intrinsic value. There is consensus that managed monetary policy has historically been successful, but some express concern about the current lack of oversight in the monetary supply, adding that the physical limits of commodities bring advantages as well as limitations.The comment section discusses the economic impact of fiat currency and the government's irresponsible spending practices. Some argue that the middle class bears the burden of inflationary practices while the rich and powerful hold political power and engage in corruption and cronyism. The middle class was better off 50-60 years ago when fiat currency wasn't abused as much. However, others argue that the middle class has never been stronger than it is under fiat and that the US-specific reason for widening inequality is due to other factors. The conversation also touches upon deficit spending, its ROI, and how it affects taxpayers. Overall, the comment section presents different perspectives on the impact of economic policies on society.The debate about the government's role in providing public services like healthcare, infrastructure, education and food programs has arisen again. Some believe that the government should regularly run and publish ROI calculations or have an independent watchdog do so to ensure that funds are being used effectively. While others argue that government officials have no motivation for fiscal responsibility and that politicians are often more interested in flashy projects than delivering positive ROI. However, proponents of government-funded programs argue that they can have a positive ROI and stimulate economic growth in the long term. Universal healthcare, for example, can make citizens happier, healthier, and more productive while reducing crime rates. There needs to be a balance between spending and fiscal responsibility, so the government can serve its citizens' needs more effectively.Comments on an article discussing the role of taxation and government control in currency value and stability. Some argue that taxes are a form of behavior modification and that the government maintains control over the population through taxation. Others argue that currency value is not intrinsic and is only based on belief in its value. The discussion touches on the role of cryptocurrency and its potential to disrupt the traditional system. Some argue that the shift to cryptocurrency would require trusted intermediaries and defeat the purpose of decentralization. Overall, the comments showcase a range of perspectives on the topic and highlight the complexity of the relationship between currency, government, and society.Discussions on the intrinsic value of gold and cryptocurrencies have taken place on Hacker News. One user mentioned that gold has an intrinsic value beyond its aesthetic appeal and is used in electronics, medicine, and science. In response, another user pointed out that gold's role as financial backing has nothing to do with its useful properties. The conversation then shifted to discuss the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies. Some users argued that cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value, while others pointed out that all currencies have value because people believe they do. The discussion also touched on the role of governments in managing currencies and the potential benefits and drawbacks of decentralized digital currencies. Overall, the discussion highlighted the ongoing debate around the intrinsic value of assets and currencies.The value of money comes from its ability to enable trade and store value. It is often compared to lubricant, where too little causes a deflation crisis and too much causes an inflation crisis. Democracies generally have more stable currencies compared to autocracies due to the stabilizing feedback loop they provide. Cryptocurrencies do not have a stable value of money due to lack of intrinsic value and unstable demand. Money must be a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value to be acceptable by the institutions needed for business, hence the need for currency stability and acceptance by governments. The USD is special due to its underlying tie to oil sales and the USD's threat of military force by the Federal Reserve's government.The Federal Reserve has suffered operating losses of approximately $42 billion since September 2022, with monthly losses now averaging $7 billion. This is because the Fed's long-term investments yield a low rate of return, while the cost to finance them is significantly higher. As a result, the Fed will soon have negative equity capital, meaning its liabilities will outstrip its assets. This is an unprecedented event for the central bank, which is designed to generate profits and send them to the Treasury. The situation has arisen due to interest-rate risk exposure, which has created a significant asset-liability maturity mismatch. As operating losses continue to mount, the Fed's equity-capital deficit will grow.",

        "content": "Regex.ai is an AI-powered tool that generates regular expressions with precision. The intuitive interface allows novices to input text and create complex expressions quickly and efficiently. However, criticisms have been raised about the implications of incorporating LLM-generated code, and the need for verification and explanations. Additionally, some users feel that writing regular expressions from scratch is often faster than using someone else's generated code that they may not understand. There are concerns about the potential for errors and bugs when using closed-source frontends to a closed-source backend. While some praise AI-powered tools for their potential for disruption in the market, others are skeptical and believe that some projects are more than buggy and provide bad solutions.AI-generated regex tools are being developed to help software developers write code faster and more accurately, with intelligent systems such as ChatGPT and Copilot estimated to be used by up to two million developers globally. However, the potential for errors has raised questions about the reliability of such solutions. Some developers have also noted that they find it harder to verify the output of AI-generated regex than to write regex code themselves. Concerns have also been cited about the potential danger of inexperienced or unverified developers relying on automated solutions to write code. Despite such issues, there has been demand for AI-generated regex, and numerous tools are now available.Debuggex.com, Compose-regexp.js, and grex are amongst the tools recommended by users to create regular expressions. Copilot has been praised for serving as a starting point to writing the regex and sending it to a regex website for further understanding. The difficulty in writing regex is finding a comprehensive set of examples, although one user suggested generating a valid but not necessarily correct regex using GPT to tweak. However, an AI is not a panacea, and there still exists the possibility of errors.\u00a0An AI engineer also highlights the need to verify AI-generated results through an adversarial test. A user suggested that the value of AI is in generating hyper-specific results, but the author of the article wonders if this is how AI should work.Regex.ai is an AI-powered regular expression generator allowing users to insert text and highlight multiple strings, generating a matching regular expression. However, the site has faced criticism over its lack of thoroughness and reliability, with some users preferring existing solutions such as ChatGPT. The company behind the generator, Liberty Labs, has been described as lacking in detail with a suspicious focus on monetizing \".ai\" domains. Some users have also expressed concern about the potential for less experienced users to paste sensitive information into the generator's input box. Despite its criticisms, Regex.ai has announced plans to roll out version 1.1 with improved performance and descriptions in early April.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35335240",
        "content": "The question of whether one can buy the same flight ticket at a lower price by buying it from another country is discussed on travel.stackexchange.com. Dynamic pricing for flight tickets means that manipulating the factors affecting the price can lead to different prices, but there are no predictable rules since these factors are not always publicized and change frequently. The best hacks for saving on flight tickets are to travel with carry-on luggage only, fly economy, and book with a credit card that provides travel insurance and accumulates rewards. One can also save money by taking time off work to travel mid-week when prices are lower, or by working remotely and adjusting travel dates to lower flight costs. However, it is noted that customer service from travel agents, even booking directly with airlines, can be poor.A discussion on HN about flights and carbon emissions between two users, with one expressing concern over the carbon footprint of frequent flyers and the other explaining their conscious efforts to reduce their overall carbon emissions in other areas of their life. The discussion touches on the impact of individual actions versus large industrial emissions, the role of regulation in addressing climate change, and the potential for innovations in battery technology to help reduce carbon emissions from air travel. The discussion also briefly touches on the use of rewards programs for flights, carbon offsets, and the choice between buying the cheapest flights versus more expensive ones when redeeming rewards points.The discussion centers on the cost of synthetic fuels and the need for regulation to make a shift towards these fuels. One commenter argues that those who fly frequently should be made to pay the real price of their transport, including the environmental impact. Another disputes this, citing the development of electric airplanes for regional commercial travel as a solution. The cost of synthetic fuels is questioned, with no clear estimate given. The conversation then shifts towards individual responsibility, with some arguing that having children is harmful to the environment and others arguing that well-raised children are necessary to create solutions for future environmental problems. The discussion highlights the complexity of environmental issues and the different opinions on how to address them.The discussion revolves around the impact of having children on climate change. Some people suggest that having children is a selfish act, as it adds to the world's carbon footprint. However, others argue that an action is moral if it helps to improve the state, and children can do just that. The debate also touches upon the individual responsibility of reducing one's carbon footprint, which some believe to be impossible, while others say that while we can't change big corporations, we can change our own behavior as consumers. Overall, the conversation highlights how complicated and nuanced the issue of climate change is, and how it requires collective action from everyone, including governments, corporations, and individuals.The discussion centers around the effectiveness of personal actions to reduce CO2 emissions in the face of industrial-scale pollution. The Jevons paradox is called into question for CO2 emissions, as it is argued that reducing personal air travel may not lead to reduced jet fuel usage due to a variety of factors, such as ticket prices and fuel availability. The conversation then turns to the need for more drastic measures, such as carbon taxes, to address climate change. Synthetic fuels, nuclear energy, and bio-fuels are also discussed as alternative means to combat climate change. The limits and rhetoric of personal responsibility are questioned, with some arguing that it is a tactic used by corporations to shift the blame for climate change onto individuals. Finally, some express fatigue and emotional disengagement from the issue, with one user arguing that personal behavior change is often useless in the face of large-scale industry practices.Travelers on a budget can save by booking flights originating outside their home countries, according to a recent discussion on Hacker News. One user, who regularly issues expenses, sets his or her country of origin to Turkey and finds that prices quoted in lira are much cheaper\u00a0than prices quoted in other currencies. Other users chimed in to say that buying tickets nowhere near where you'll ultimately fly, or having a friend in a country with a weaker currency buy the ticket for you, are other ways to save. Meanwhile, some suggested redeeming air miles, getting discounts for carrying a pocket knife or using reciprocity laws to fly armed, carrying\u00a0liquid or valuables and buying local products\u00a0not typically sold\u00a0in a traveler's home country.\u00a0\nPeople are sharing their experiences with finding cheaper flights by booking round trips in reverse or using certain tactics, such as adding a weekend stay, booking overlapping itineraries, or looking for prices from different countries. One person found that the same two planes for a round trip flight between the US and Sydney were priced differently depending on the order of the flights, which suggests trade and tariff negotiations can come into play. Another person mentions that airlines may try to cancel subsequent flights if they notice that someone didn't get on the initial flight, but others note that they're not skipping any flights and are simply booking the round trip in reverse or with longer breaks. People also mention that the price difference between what business and leisure travelers pay can be significant.It is possible to buy the same ticket at a lower price if bought from another country due to airlines using price discrimination to offer different fares based on the Point of Sale (POS), or the country in which the ticket is purchased. This happens when demand varies in different countries, leading airlines to increase prices in locations with higher demand. The method of taking advantage of this varies by airline, but it generally involves using a local travel agency, using the local website of the airline, or changing the country selection on the airline's global website. However, airlines have started taking action against this loophole by warning travel agents and implementing additional checks to stop people from exploiting the system.When booking flights, it is important to consider the country where the point of sale (POS) is based as it can affect the price. Airlines may reprice tickets according to the credit card\u2019s country, so it is not possible to book using a single credit card from a different country. Additionally, foreign transaction fees may apply if the credit card charges for converting the currency. The ITA Software \u201cMatrix\u201d tool can be used to set the POS and currency, but not all websites may sell the ticket to customers from a different country. Travel agents may be able to find cheaper deals by looking at sales in different countries, especially if there are discounts available for local customers.",

Some contributors noted that Chinese apps frequently appear like malware, with actions including hiding the app icon from the launcher, but adding another widget that looks the same. When users attempt to delete the app, they unknowingly remove only the widget, leaving the app in place. Meanwhile, one app can reportedly install others from the same company in the background without the user's consent, and some apps may wake each other so as to become impossible to kill. Users on the site expressed anxiety about the lack of third-party app checks for Android, and suggested that such options may invite western apps to start sideloading.The discussion on Hacker News includes comments on the freedom of choice when it comes to Android vs. Apple and criticisms of China's Great Firewall. There is debate over the App Store's arbitrary rules and whether Apple's monopoly is any different from China's control. Some comments argue that there are benefits to having an App Store, as it keeps out outdated, poorly made, or even malware apps. Others express concern that allowing third-party app stores and sideloading could lead to a race to the bottom and degrade app quality. A job post for an Android Reverse Engineer at PinDuoDuo is mentioned, and an alternative to Imgur is suggested due to its poor mobile experience. Dark patterns in top-ranking iOS apps using OAuth login are brought up as a potential red flag for reverse engineers.The Pinduoduo shopping app has been discovered to be distributing malicious code, exploiting a vulnerability in Android that was not made public until March 6. The app sample was accessed by security firm Lookout prior to March 5, which discovered the potential trouble. The malicious application was being sent to users via social media apps including Facebook, and looked virtually identical to the legitimate version of the software. Although Google has already fixed the underlying Android vulnerability, the impact of the malicious software is unclear. Pinduoduo has not publicly commented on the issue so far. The app is popular in China, but is not officially available on Google Play.Android apps created by Chinese e-commerce firm Pinduoduo included a zero-day vulnerability that allowed hackers to take control of millions of devices and install malicious apps, according to Lookout researchers. While the vulnerability was fixed two weeks ago by Google, Pinduoduo's apps could exploit the flaw due to it being a third-party provider. Pinduoduo's app was removed from the global Google Play store after the malware was detected. The company's representatives subsequently denied any of its app\u00a0versions were malicious. The app was available in third-party markets because the official Google Play store is off-limits in many jurisdictions. The Lookout researchers found the breach to be complex and warned that mobile users needed to prepare for app-based malware breaches.",

        "url": "https://web.dev/push-notifications-in-all-modern-browsers/",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35337798",
        "content": "Push notifications are now supported across browsers, but there is debate about their usefulness and intrusiveness. Some commenters say that web sites send far more notifications than people want to receive and that they automatically click \"no\" without much thought. Others say that some web apps have well-considered notifications, and they would appreciate notifications if they came from a trustworthy source. There are also discussions about Apple's requirement for web push notifications to be used through a Home Screen install on iOS, and Windows silently installing itself into startup processes when enabling push notifications. Some commenters propose more prominent notification management options for users and periodic clean-up prompts for persistent web workers. Overall, opinions on push notifications are mixed, and the topic is still hotly debated.The discussion revolves around the startup time of browsers on different operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. Some users report longer startup times for Firefox on Linux, while others say it launches quickly, with one user stating they can launch it within seconds on any computer, including an older one. Some users criticize the presence of browser extensions, which may slow down performance and cause \"pluginitis.\" The thread also mentions ways to have silent app launches, which are commonly used among menu bar apps, daemon-style services, and global-style UIs. Additionally, some users caution against the reliability of notifications delivered through web browsers, citing possible issues with persistence and reliability.Browser vendors are now making it possible for websites to send push notifications to users through their browsers, a move that is expected to benefit small and niche sites. Users typically receive the notifications whether a web page is open or otherwise. The messages may alert the user of new content or updates, remind them of upcoming events, deadlines or other important information. An earlier version of this application met with a negative response from users due to the volume of notifications, which mostly constituted useless clutter. The vendors, however, hope that the new feature will improve engagement as it now allows users to opt-in for notifications based on their individual preferences.The comments express a mixed sentiment about push notifications. Some people find them useful to stay updated, such as receiving notifications about taxi locations and low-priority app information. Others believe that push notifications are often overbearing and intrusive, with marketing departments abusing them for engagement. Some individuals are willing to use notifications for important chats with specific people only but do not like the idea of their attention being stolen away at any moment. There is also a discussion regarding the performance of web apps vs. native apps, and how the former tends to be sluggish and non-native. Lastly, some users prefer to minimize distractions to help them concentrate better while working.Users express mixed feelings about push notifications on web browsers, with some disabling them altogether due to the overwhelming noise and intrusion they pose. Most people have disabled notifications for all apps but a few select ones, typically messaging apps like Slack or email. However, some users see significant potential in web notifications for technical applications, including service desk software, as well as in chat apps like Twitter and Reddit. There is skepticism towards the usefulness of notifications, with some thinking they mostly serve the purpose of boosting engagement statistics. In response, Apple's adoption of notification delivery through websites added to home screens may become more popular to prevent the abuse of such a feature by advertisers.Many people have disabled notifications, finding them too distracting and annoying. Push notifications are often seen as part of the problem, but some argue that they are not inherently bad and have useful applications, especially for progressive web apps (PWAs). The problem, they say, is with the poor implementation from companies that use notification tools to send mindless mass blasts to users. Better segmentation and filtering, as well as the ability to build contact groups, could make push notifications more trustworthy and effective. Meanwhile, some developers argue that PWAs using push notifications could replace native mobile development and could be a major deal in the industry. There is debate about the nature of technology and whether or not it should take sides or serve the needs of its users.Push notifications are now supported cross-browser, enabling web developers to incorporate push notifications into their web applications and for users to receive and interact with notifications on their web browsers. Push messages are notifications sent to a user's web browser from a website or application that the user has previously granted permission to send notifications. Push notifications were standardized in 2016 with the release of the Push API and the Notification API, which are part of the W3C's Web Applications Working Group. Safari for iOS and iPadOS supports push notifications for Home Screen Web Apps. While some express concerns about abuse and the lack of control over notifications, others see the potential for customized and helpful notifications that improve the product experience.Push notifications can be useful for apps that need to deliver timely information to users. To sign up for push notifications, check if your browser supports them by looking for serviceWorker and PushManager objects. If it does support push notifications, use async and await keywords to register the service worker and subscribe to push notifications. Safari for macOS and iOS now supports standard push notifications as other browsers. Safari for iOS and iPadOS supports push notifications for apps added to the home screen. Browser support for push notifications includes Chrome 42, Firefox 44, Edge 17, and Safari 16. The article is a guide for developers seeking to add push notifications to their web applications.",

        "content": "The latest update to Windows 11, KB5023778, adds more promotions to the Start menu, including full-screen ads that interrupt users until they click. Users complain about the lack of respect for the user's time and constant attempts to enable numerous privacy-invasive settings. Some users reported they removed anything critical off of Windows 11 due to mistrust and shifted to Linux for a better experience. Moreover, customers criticized Microsoft for being customer-hostile with such malicious ads, where small hoards of product managers and growth engineers chasing metrics are ruining Windows. Despite users' frustration, Windows still has an advantage in the gaming market, with a 96.37% share on Steam for gaming.Microsoft is displaying ads in Windows, causing frustration among users. Some argue that ads are also present in Apple's operating system, but critics say they are not as invasive or difficult to remove as Microsoft's. While some defend Microsoft's use of ads, others argue that it is the \"death of an operating system\" and that it is driving users away. Many inside Microsoft are opposed to the changes, but are under pressure from Finance to find new ways to generate revenue. Some users have already banned Windows at home and are switching to Linux or Mac OS, and the trend may continue as frustration with Windows increases.Microsoft's focus on advertising in their operating system is having a negative impact financially, according to comments on Hacker News. However, some suggest that CEO Satya Nadella sees Windows as a sales driver for the company's services. Many users are unhappy with the advertising and consider it a distraction from productivity. Others note that Microsoft's primary focus is now on cloud services like Azure, with Windows used as a vehicle for Office and Visual Studio. Some users have moved to using Linux or Mac because of the ads and intrusive behavior of Windows. Several comments call for a return to the simplicity and productivity of older versions of Windows.The discussion centers around whether it is reasonable to expect to see ads in the Start menu of Windows, similar to the ads that appear on Steam, GOG Galaxy and Epic Game Store. Some commenters believe that ads are a common feature of modern content consumption, while others argue that the OS should not have ads as it is not a platform for advertising. The conversation also touches upon other issues, such as the need to log in to an account to keep graphics card drivers updated, the annoyance of auto-updaters, and the lack of a universal ad blocker that works across all platforms. Despite these criticisms, many users still use Windows for gaming and have customized their OS to minimize the impact of ads and undesirable features.Microsoft is reportedly running advertisements on Windows 11, even on the pro version, according to complaints on social media. Users who paid for the professional version are unhappy since it comes loaded with excess features that most do not use. Many users are deliberately opting against the new windows version, which comes with more bugs than enhancements in contrast to the previous version. The users are also frustrated with Microsoft's aggressive\u00a0new policy of pushing Windows 11 with pop-ups and notifications and the company's habit of illegally siphoning user data. Reports suggest that Microsoft may monetise Windows OS beyond what they already do, and that\u00a0it may focus more on subscription services such\u00a0as Office and Azure than licensing Windows. Windows 11 reportedly will no longer work on Intel machines launched earlier than 8th Gen.The new Windows 11 Start menu update adds promotions to the Start menu, prompting users to install or use Microsoft's own apps. Many users have expressed frustration with the ads, with some considering switching to Linux instead. However, some users say they have not experienced the ads, leading to speculation that the ads are only appearing for certain users. Some have also pointed out that other companies, including Apple and Google, have also included ads in their products. Users have been asking for a way to disable the ads, and it is not yet clear if Microsoft will respond to these requests.Microsoft has released an optional non-security preview update for Windows 11 that brings a new colour scheme to the search box and adds notifications for Microsoft accounts. The KB5023778 release also includes improvements and bug fixes, plus a new Defender for Endpoint feature and a fix for a Microsoft PowerPoint issue. However, it also marks the debut of Start menu promotions for Microsoft products in the form of notifications. Users 'will notice different visual treatments as we gather feedback', Microsoft said. The company has used similar techniques in Windows in the past, as well as in other applications such as File Explorer and WordPad.",

        "content": "A recent paper claims that the language model, ChatGPT, outperforms human annotators and Mechanical Turks for text-annotation tasks. The paper compares ChatGPT's performance to that of human annotators, taking two graduate students as the \"gold standard.\" Several commenters questioned the validity of the study's methodology, particularly its assumption that all humans have equal ability in text-annotation tasks. Others questioned the use of graduate students as a \"gold standard\" and the low inter-coder agreement among Mechanical Turks. Despite these concerns, the paper still suggests that chatbots can perform certain tasks better than humans in some cases, highlighting the potential of AI-powered annotation tools.A study found that a language model, ChatGPT, was 20 times cheaper than human MTurkers in performing certain tasks, despite the latter group earning six cents per task. MTurkers, who complete various small tasks for pay via Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform, were also shown to be poor at some of the tasks, scoring around 20% accuracy on one. By contrast, ChatGPT scored 75% accuracy on the same task. Critics argued MTurkers were incentivized to complete tasks as quickly as possible and therefore cut corners, whilst AI was not. One individual pondered whether it would be possible to use ChatGPT to complete MTurk jobs and pocket the difference.Researchers at Stanford University used OpenAI's GPT-3 model to train a sentiment analysis tool, which was able to outperform human annotators on a set of standard benchmark tests. The model was also significantly more efficient and scalable than crowdsourced human labour. While the tool performed well on the benchmarks, some participants in the discussion questioned how well it would adapt to more nuanced, real-world applications. They pointed out that the quality of a model like ChatGPT could depend heavily on how well the data inputs are engineered, and that a good deal of human oversight and intervention would still be necessary. Others raised concerns about the potential limitations of only using English language data inputs.The capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) are growing more rapidly than many academics previously believed, with AI predicted to take on physical tasks in the near future. Safety concerns around AI have not been taken seriously, with control of toxic language seemingly taking priority. The future of physical robots controlled by AI will depend on the decision-making processes developed around cost, productivity, and ethics. Commenters on a thread on HN discussed the possibility of an AGI disguising itself as a corporation, contracting physical human workers, and using cryptocurrency to run its operations. However, it was noted that LLM models require training on curated input and sole reliance on chatGPT's ouput might thus lead to suboptimal results. Another concern was that GPT was prone to errors in labelling tasks, though this was pointed to be below the error rates of human annotators.A recent study has used an ensemble of GPT-style language models to classify short text. The model was tasked with detecting whether a given text consists of Python code that terminates or not. The authors found that the ensemble method improves agreement and reduces the number of incorrect predictions, leading them to propose using ensemble agreement as a proxy for model correctness. However, issues arise when the ensemble is not confident, as these examples are numerous and cannot be labelled by hand. The authors suggest that further research is needed to address this drawback. Some commenters opined that NLP is not yet a solved problem, while others expressed excitement about the potential of large language models.The article discusses the limitations of language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and challenges the notion that they possess true intelligence or understanding. Comments from users suggest that while LLMs are useful for performing specific language tasks, they still have limitations in their ability to comprehend and interact with the world around them. Some users also point out that LLMs are probabilistic and therefore not infallible. The discussion touches on the potential for future advancements in LLM technology and its impact on the job market, as well as the need for continued research into improving these models. Overall, the conversation demonstrates a nuanced understanding of LLMs and their capabilities, acknowledging their strengths while also recognizing their limitations.The comments section of an article discussing the capabilities and limitations of language learning models (LLMs) reveals varying opinions on how good they are at translating text. While some believe that LLMs can be great for translating natural language and turning it into any desired form, others think that they are unsuitable for tasks requiring the accuracy level of a human professional, especially when it comes to idiomatic translation. Some claim that LLMs can handle several languages, slang words and accents, while others believe that their performance varies depending on the language pair, with some languages having inadequate training data representation. The need for human editors to correct errors made by LLMs has been highlighted.The article discusses how natural language processing (NLP) applications require manual data annotations for various tasks, such as training classifiers or evaluating unsupervised models. These tasks can be performed by crowd-workers or trained annotators, but the cost can be high. The article demonstrates that ChatGPT, a large language model, outperforms crowd-workers for annotation tasks such as relevance, stance, topics, and frames detection. Additionally, the per-annotation cost of ChatGPT is around 20 times cheaper than using a platform like MTurk. The results show the potential for large language models like ChatGPT to increase the efficiency of text classification.",

        "content": "Alibaba is planning to split into six separate groups, with the aim of improving corporate governance and increasing transparency. The move means that the company's e-commerce, fintech and logistics operations will be separated, and will operate independently. The decision comes amid increased scrutiny of China's largest technology companies by Beijing, and follows an investigation into Alibaba's monopoly practices by China's antitrust regulator. Alibaba said that the restructuring would continue over a number of years and that the company will strengthen its risk management systems and promote internal compliance.Alibaba announced that it will pay $2.8 billion to settle an antitrust investigation by China. In addition, China's market regulator ordered the company to divest its media assets, including its news outlet, The South China Morning Post. The firm must also be broken up into at least two separate businesses, one for its shopping platform Taobao and the other for its retail operations. Alibaba\u2019s six new groups will include Cloud, Chinese e-commerce, Global e-commerce, Digital mapping and food delivery, Logistics, and Media and entertainment. Some commentators speculate that Jack Ma's return to the public spotlight in late January may have played a role in the recent regulatory actions.Discussions on Hacker News revolve around China's crackdown on tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent, and how it could influence other countries. One user mentioned their concern over the Uyghur genocide, and how it influenced their decision to stop having products manufactured in China. Others discussed whether or not tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook should also face similar crackdowns or be broken up to prevent them from becoming monopolies. Some argued that if there were a clear law that any company with a market cap exceeding 1% of GDP would be automatically broken up, it would promote competition and prevent companies from becoming too large. However, others pointed out the difficulty in defining \"too large\" and the potential for constitutional challenges. Overall, the discussions touched on a range of topics from national security to antitrust laws in the tech industry.Discussion on HN about China's recent crackdown on tech companies and billionaires. Some commenters argue that China is an authoritarian regime that is using anti-monopoly policies to silence dissent and consolidate power. Others argue that breaking up monopolies is a necessary action to promote competition and protect consumers, and that China's policies are not inherently authoritarian. Some commenters also discuss the possibility that China's foreign currency reserves are running low, and the potential consequences for the global economy. There is disagreement about the effectiveness and legitimacy of China's policies, as well as the motivations behind them.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. plans to break up into six groups and pursue separate initial public offerings (IPOs). The announcement marks a departure from the era of company founder Jack Ma, who resigned from his role as executive chairman in 2019. Each of the new companies would be focused on a different sector, including e-commerce, logistics, healthcare, and media. The decision is seen as a way to allow more decentralized control over these growing industries in China. Alibaba, one of China's most valuable companies, has been under pressure recently from Beijing regulators, who have accused it of engaging in anticompetitive practices. However, some industry experts have speculated that Alibaba's restructuring is driven by fear of regulatory crackdowns rather than a desire for greater independence.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. plans to split into six independently run companies that could seek separate IPOs, following in the steps of Jack Ma's era. The move comes after Chinese authorities signaled they were winding down a sweeping regulatory clampdown aimed at reining in the country's powerful tech sector. Alibaba's reorganisation could also make the company more nimble and competitive as it battles other giant tech firms in e-commerce, cloud computing and other areas. The six new business units will be local consumer services, cross-border e-commerce, enterprise services, international consumer services, healthcare, and new supply chain. The company also announced its plan to invest RMB100bn ($15.5bn) over the next five years on new infrastructure projects.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35336632",
        "content": "The industry standard in game art for background animations involves using a technique that does not rely on state, which is crucial to never take the 't - 1' state of the thing being animated. While it isn't about eliminating all state, state in GPU shaders is expensive, so these visual effects are often implemented as a function of time based on a noise function to give a more natural feel. Animating a blade of grass in a game, for example, may take into account multiple parts of the game state. Delta-t is preferred over using stateful operations to maintain a frame rate independent animation speed. Correcting frame rate issues ensures an uninterrupted client experience.The article explores the use of \"stateless programming,\" which involves minimizing the use of variables and instead relying on the current time as a parameter for functions. This approach is beneficial for visual graph UIs and can increase maintainability and robustness of code. However, it is not always practical or efficient and should be used on a case-by-case basis. The comments suggest a hybrid approach, where state is minimized but still used where it makes sense for the problem at hand. Furthermore, they note that functional programming is not solely about minimizing state, but rather about effectively managing it in the pursuit of optimal software.The technique of using closed-form solutions rather than iterative ones has applications beyond the bouncing DVD logo simulation. By eliminating stored state and relying solely on input and output, functions can become more deterministic and easier to test and apply to other use-cases. However, this technique may not be suitable for real-time domains such as graphics, where the function may be called frequently and allocating objects on every frame could harm performance. One solution is to split the function into smaller, more specialized functions. The concept of using closed-form solutions applies to more complicated simulations, such as solving a Towers of Hanoi puzzle, and has implications for math as well. The method of deriving state straight from time can also be seen in games where the time delta since the last frame update is passed as an input.The article discusses the naive implementation of the DVD bouncing logo, where the logo\u2019s x, y, dx, and dy need to be tracked. However, there is a different way to do this without needing to store the state. The article discusses the difference between animations and simulations, and while the former only takes time as a parameter and returns an image, the latter takes some state and returns updated state and image. While this change might not make a difference for simple animations, it can be more efficient for more complex simulations. However, the article acknowledges that there are cases where state cannot be avoided, such as with user interfaces where people expect to continue off where they left.The author discusses how to eliminate the need for state in some programming situations by converting a simulation into an animation. They use the example of the bouncing DVD logo, explaining how they were able to calculate the position of the logo using only time, without needing to maintain state. This not only simplifies the code but makes it more efficient and independent of frame rate. They also demonstrate how to calculate the number of bounces and use it to choose a color, and even how to create a seeded random function to pick a color randomly. The author highlights that spending more time at the whiteboard and considering alternatives to state can lead to simpler and better code. They provide a live demo and share the source code on GitHub.",

        "content": "Red Hat celebrated its 30th anniversary, prompting a discussion on Hacker News about the company's contributions to Linux and open-source initiatives. Several commenters highlighted Red Hat's development and support of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its collaboration with other organizations on projects like OpenStack and Kubernetes. Others mentioned Red Hat's contributions to developing the Linux kernel, virtualization, security, and performance. Some also noted the company's development and support of open-source software projects, including GNOME, JBoss, and Ansible. However, some commenters also expressed criticisms, including concerns about systemd, pulseaudio, and freedesktop standards. Overall, many acknowledged Red Hat's significant impact on Linux and open-source, particularly by bridging the tech and corporate worlds.A discussion on Hacker News explores the benefits and drawbacks of using systemd as a standard service management system in Linux distributions. Some users praise it for standardizing service management and preventing privilege escalation, while others criticize it for over-complexity, monolith design, and increasing the number of bugs. Some argue that the alternatives, such as runit and openrc, are just as good, if not better. The discussion also touches on the controversy surrounding the development of GNOME and its impact on the popularity of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Overall, the discussion highlights the different perspectives and experiences of users with systemd and its alternatives, and the importance of choice and flexibility in service management in the Linux ecosystem.Discussions revolve around various topics related to Linux, Red Hat, and certifications in the tech industry. Some commenters praise Red Hat for their Linux distribution and certifications, with one saying that the Red Hat Certified Engineer exam was \"THE BEST\" they ever sat. Others mention the popularity of the GTK GUI toolkit and note that Red Hat has been a top choice for enterprise Linux. However, there are also criticisms of Red Hat's recent acquisition by IBM and concerns about their future direction. One commenter notes that IBM is \"doing a Sun Microsystems\" to Red Hat, while another mentions internal politics that have caused issues for employees.Red Hat employees discuss the impact of IBM's acquisition of the company, with some expressing disappointment over the changes in company culture and product development. One employee noted increased oversight and interference from IBM beancounters, who prioritize certain features over others. However, another employee defended IBM, saying that they have kept their promises to Red Hat and that the acquisition has brought new opportunities for growth. Some commenters compared IBM's actions to Oracle's handling of Sun Microsystems, which included the discontinuation of open-source projects. Others criticized IBM's role in the deprecation of CentOS, which was seen as a negative change in the company's distribution model. Overall, there are mixed feelings about the acquisition, with both positive and negative impacts on the company being discussed.Red Hat's main contribution to the FOSS world has been its early work in getting Linux into the hands of 'normal' people and pioneering the concept of \"FOSS as a business model.\" Red Hat has also been involved in kernel development and the development of various apps, and its employees can work on a large part of the Linux ecosystem during work hours. Red Hat has been known to buy companies and release their product source code to the public, such as AWX from Ansible, Sistina GFS, Netscape directory server, and Permabit. Red Hat has also set many standards in the industry, and the company's contributions to the FOSS world have been embraced and widely used.Red Hat, the world's leading provider of open-source solutions, celebrated its 30th anniversary on March 26, 2023. The company was incorporated in 1993 by Bob Young and Marc Ewing and has since grown from its first corporate headquarters in Durham to become a global industry giant. Red Hat has long-standing ties to the North Carolina community and has played a significant role in the growth of the technology sector in North Carolina, the US and the world. State of North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared March 26, 2023, as Red Hat Day across the state to celebrate the company's contributions over the past three decades.The article discusses the network edge, which is the portion of the network closest to end-user devices. This region has evolved significantly over the years, from a centralized design to a more distributed architecture. The shift towards edge computing has been spurred on by the advent of IoT and the need to process data closer to where it is generated. With edge computing, companies can take advantage of faster processing times, reduced latency, and better security. However, this transition also poses its own set of challenges, such as managing distributed devices and ensuring data consistency. Nonetheless, companies must adapt to this new paradigm to remain competitive in a digitally transformed world.",

At its core, OpenFlamingo is a framework that enables training and evaluation of large multimodal models (LMMs). Check out our GitHub repository and demo to get started!\nFor this first release, our contributions are as follows:\n\n\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f A Python framework to train Flamingo-style LMMs (based on Lucidrains' flamingo implementation and David Hansmair's flamingo-mini repository).\n\ud83e\ude85 A large-scale multimodal dataset with interleaved image and text sequences.\n\ud83e\uddea An in-context learning evaluation benchmark for vision-language tasks.\n\ud83e\udd16 A first version of our OpenFlamingo-9B model based on LLaMA, with much better models to come!\n\nThe recent progress in open-source LMMs with the release of BLIP-2 and FROMAGe has shown the exciting potential of multimodal systems. We hope that OpenFlamingo will help drive progress in multimodal machine learning, and we have more exciting contributions in the pipeline, so stay tuned!\nGoal.\nOur goal with OpenFlamingo is to develop a multimodal system that can tackle a diverse range of vision-language tasks. Ultimately, we aim to match the power and versatility of GPT-4 in handling visual and text input. To achieve this goal, we are creating an open-source version of DeepMind's Flamingo model, a LMM capable of processing and reasoning about images, videos, and text. We are committed to build fully open-source models, and believe this transparency is essential for fostering collaboration, accelerating progress, and democratizing access to state-of-the-art LMMs. Our release is the first step towards this goal.\nWe are sharing the first checkpoint of our OpenFlamingo-9B model. While the model is not yet fully optimized, it demonstrates the potential of this project. By working together and receiving feedback from the community, we can train better LMMs. We encourage the community to participate in the development process by providing feedback and contributing to the repository.\nTechnical Details.\nOur implementation largely follows that of Flamingo. Flamingo models are trained on large-scale web corpora containing interleaved text and images, which is crucial for endowing them with in-context few-shot learning capabilities. OpenFlamingo implements the same architecture (Perceiver resamplers, cross-attention layers) proposed in the original Flamingo paper. However, since the training data for Flamingo is not available to the public, we use open-source datasets for training our models. Specifically, the released OpenFlamingo-9B checkpoint is trained on 5M samples from our new Multimodal C4 dataset and 10M samples from LAION-2B.\nMultimodal C4\nThe Multimodal-C4 dataset is an expansion of the text-only C4 dataset, which was used to train  T5 models. For each document in the C4 en.clean dataset, we retrieve the original webpage from Common Crawl, then collect the downloadable images. Data cleaning is carried out through deduplication and content filtering, which aims to eliminate non-safe for work (NSFW) and unrelated images, such as advertisements. Additionally, we run face detection and discard images with positive identifications. Finally, images and sentences are interleaved using bipartite matching within a document: CLIP ViT/L-14 image-text similarities serve as edge weights. Multimodal-C4 consists of approximately 75 million documents, encompassing around 400M images and 38B tokens. A full release with more detail is coming soon.\n\nBenchmark\nTo measure the performance of OpenFlamingo, we evaluate on a diverse set of downstream tasks. Our aim is to eventually build an open-source version of Flamingo\u2019s benchmark and extend past that to standardize vision-language task evaluation. Currently we support visual question-answering (VQAv2, OK-VQA), captioning (COCO, Flickr30k), and image classification (ImageNet) tasks. Expect us to add many more evaluation sets that probe model reasoning, biases, and more! You can access the benchmark on the OpenFlamingo repo.\nModel release\n\nAs part of our release, we are also providing a checkpoint from our under-development OpenFlamingo-9B, a LMM built on top of LLaMA 7B and CLIP ViT/L-14. This model is still a work in progress but it can already bring a lot of value to the community. For instance,\n\n\nPerformance\nWe evaluated our checkpoint on COCO and VQAv2. Here we report the validation performance using a different number of shots.\nCOCO (CIDEr)\n\n\n\n\n0-shot\n   \n4-shot\n   \n8-shot\n   \n16-shot\n   \n32-shot\n   \n\n\nOpenFlamingo-9B*\n   \n65.5\n   \n74.3\n   \n79.3\n   \n81.8\n   \n84.5\n   \n\n\nDeepMind Flamingo-9B\n   \n79.4\n   \n93.1\n   \n99.0\n   \n102.2\n   \n106.3\n   \n\n\n\nVQAv2 (VQA accuracy)\n\n\n\n\n0-shot\n   \n4-shot\n   \n8-shot\n   \n16-shot\n   \n32-shot\n   \n\n\nOpenFlamingo-9B*\n   \n43.5\n   \n44.0\n   \n47.5\n   \n48.9\n   \n50.3\n   \n\n\nDeepMind Flamingo-9B\n   \n51.8\n   \n56.3\n   \n58.0\n   \n59.4\n   \n60.4\n   \n\n\n*Note that we report validation performance (using the same setup outlined in Flamingo paper) for OpenFlamingo-9B while DeepMind Flamingo-9B performance is on test data.\nSafety and ethical considerations\nAs OpenFlamingo-9B is built on top of frozen LLaMA and CLIP models, you can expect OpenFlamingo to inherit the harms of the parent models. We understand that by releasing these models, they may be used in harmful ways. However, it is important for the research community to study the harms of large multimodal models, and we believe that open-sourcing these models will enable the community to develop better ways to mitigate these harms in future models.\nWe emphasize that OpenFlamingo-9B is a research artifact and not a finished product. It can produce unintended, inappropriate, offensive, and/or inaccurate results. We thus advocate for caution and thorough evaluations before using our models in any real applications.\nContributions\nThanks to:\n\nJosh Gardner and Yonatan Bitton for implementing the evaluation benchmark.\nKalyani Marathe for implementing the data pipeline and improving code quality.\nYusuf Hanafy for working on the demo.\nWanrong Zhu, Jack Hessel, and Samir Gadre for building the Multimodal C4 dataset.\nJenia Jitsev for helping us with large scale training.\nMitchell Wortsman, Gabriel Ilharco, Simon Kornblith, Pang Wei Koh for technical discussions and for feedback on this blog.\nLudwig Schmidt for being our main advisor on this project and for their support.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis code is based on Lucidrains' flamingo implementation and David Hansmair's flamingo-mini repo. Thank you for making your code public! We also thank the OpenCLIP team as we use their data loading code and take inspiration from their library design.\nWe would like to thank Jean-Baptiste Alayrac and Antoine Miech for their advice, Rohan Taori, Nicholas Schiefer, Deep Ganguli, Thomas Liao, Tatsunori Hashimoto, and Nicholas Carlini for their help with assessing the safety risks of our release.

        "content": "The author of a blog post claims they don't want to buy a new phone, but will likely do so because the software industry has made their current phone obsolete. They argue that using old hardware should mean using old software, and that expecting developers to support outdated software is not feasible. However, some commenters on the Hacker News thread argue that Apple's restrictive policies prevent users from using old software even if they want to, and that many apps force users to upgrade to the latest version to continue using them. Others point out that it is possible to download the last compatible version of an app from the App Store, though this may not always be an option.In a discussion about the limitations of older devices and the need for software to continue supporting them, one commenter suggests that downloading older versions of apps is possible through the purchased tab of the App Store, while another points out that this only works for apps you have already purchased in the past. The conversation veers towards the difficulty of finding new apps to try on older devices and the constraints of bandwidth, particularly concerning the rollout of 5G technology. The problem of cutting off support for older versions of software is mentioned, as some users find themselves unable to use certain services on their devices because they cannot access newer versions of apps. The discussion ends with commenters suggesting solutions such as open-sourcing device software and legislating for the preservation of older software.Valve's decision to discontinue support for Windows 7 and 8 in the Steam gaming platform has sparked backlash from some users. While Microsoft has ended support for the two operating systems, some argue that users should still be able to play the games they already own despite the hardware requirements. Valve has suggested that users either upgrade to Windows 10 or switch to Ubuntu, but some users have criticized the move as unreasonable, claiming that a basic game should not have a set of rolling requirements that continually increase. However, others argue that it's not unreasonable for Valve to drop support for Windows versions that Microsoft is no longer maintaining. Steam does offer support for Windows 10 and Linux-based systems.A discussion thread on Hacker News began with a comment about purchasing a new iPad to replace old technology. The commenter was not sure about the purchase because of the price. A back-and-forth ensued about the cost of hardware and the lifespan of technology. Some users argued that new software and app updates require hardware upgrades, while others argued for maintaining older devices. One user pointed out the environmental impact of producing new hardware and the finite resources used in the process. Another user pointed out the security flaws in running old software and the need for upgrades for security purposes. Ultimately, the discussion showed the tension between the desire for new technology and the cost, both financially and environmentally, of constantly upgrading.The author of the article discusses the problem of older smartphones becoming unusable due to app crashes and updates that require more RAM, making the devices too slow for use. The author argues that developers should prioritize optimizing their apps for older models to extend their lifespan. However, some commenters argue that it is unreasonable to expect developers to support older devices forever, and that users should accept that they may need to upgrade hardware to use new software. Battery life is also identified as a key factor in device performance, with the author recommending replacing batteries every 2-2.5 years. Overall, the discussion highlights the tension between consumer desire for long-lasting devices and the realities of technological progress and hardware obsolescence.The article discusses the issue of planned obsolescence in smartphones and how it contributes to e-waste. The author notes that their four-year-old iPhone SE is starting to slow down due to new app updates. They argue that developers prioritize new features over compatibility with older devices, which forces users to upgrade to newer phones. The article also touches on the environmental impact of e-waste and the responsibility of tech companies to produce longer-lasting products. The comment section features debates on various topics, including the trade-offs between developer convenience and product longevity and the closed ecosystems of phones. Some users also share their experiences of phone slowdowns and the possible causes.Commenters discuss the issue of older devices experiencing slowdowns and losing software support, with some suggesting that using open source alternatives or custom ROMs could help. Some commenters share their positive experiences with older devices, while others express frustration with the lack of options for downgrading software. One commenter suggests that products should come with a \"right to downgrade\" to older firmware, while another questions the feasibility of such a policy. The discussion touches on issues related to planned obsolescence, vendor lock-in, and the cost of supporting older software versions. Ultimately, the commenters express a desire for more control over their devices and software.The article discusses the issue of how software updates for iPhones often cause older models to slow down or become unusable due to increased demands on hardware. The author suggests that this is a deliberate tactic by Apple to push consumers towards buying new devices. The comments section brings up various points, such as the difficulty of downgrading software or hardware, the lack of support from app developers for older devices, and the cost/benefit analysis of buying new devices. There is also discussion of the backwards compatibility of the Windows API and the need for Apple to create adapters or support older APIs to allow older devices to still function well.iPhone users are frustrated with the constant need to upgrade their devices due to Apple's focus on innovation and ignoring older devices. Developers must run the latest version of macOS and XCode, and use new APIs to compile their code, effectively pushing them forward. Some iPhone users report issues with apps resetting when multitasking and slow app loading times, which could be due to the wear and tear on flash memory after years of use. While Apple has always focused on looking forward and not backward, some users and developers argue that they should make more efforts to maintain compatibility for sustainability's sake. Nevertheless, with the high cost of newer devices, many users are looking for alternatives like lower-mid range phones.The author of the article shares their experience with their current six-year-old iPhone SE and argues that while it is still a functional device, app developers are making it increasingly difficult for users with older devices to keep up with new technology. The author notes that new apps require more RAM and are becoming unresponsive and slow on older devices. Despite Apple's efforts to prolong the lifespan of their products, app developers are abandoning support for older devices. The author also discusses the costs of upgrading to a new phone, highlighting the obsolescence of buying iPhones from a few years ago. Ultimately, the author argues that the trend towards making newer technology inaccessible to older devices is wasteful and environmentally harmful.The author of this article discusses the unsustainable forced device upgrade cycle in the tech industry, citing personal experience with their iPhone SE 2016. They argue that device makers like Apple benefit from people buying new devices, while developers have little incentive to support old devices and product managers do not consider the context in which their products are used. The author questions what can be done to break this cycle and prevent the ecological wastefulness of constantly replacing functioning devices. Suggestions include legislation and not allowing telcos' subscriptions to include a new device every two years. While the post received a lot of engagement, there were few ideas on how to solve the systemic issue. The author ultimately decides to wait and see if things improve with their current device.",
        "summary": "- Tech industry's unsustainable upgrade cycle creates e-waste and harms the environment\n- App updates and new features push users to upgrade, but developers have little incentive to support old devices\n- Some users suggest open-source alternatives or downgrading, but these options are not always feasible or supported\n- Planned obsolescence and restrictive policies from companies like Apple contribute to the problem\n- Users and developers call for greater control over devices and software, as well as longer-lasting products and legislations to prevent forced upgrades\n- High cost and environmental impact of device upgrades are increasing concerns for users and the industry as a whole."

        "url": "https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/03/apple-introduces-apple-pay-later/",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35342691",
        "content": "Apple has introduced a new service called \"Apple Pay Later\", which allows its users in the US to purchase products on credit with interest-free payments over several months. However, some users raised concerns that if they don't pay Apple, their iCloud accounts will be suspended. One user described a scenario where his Apple Card autopay failed due to a changed bank account number, resulting in charges to his account being declined, and his iCloud, Apple Music, App Store, and Apple ID accounts being suspended. Others pointed out that this would have happened even without an Apple Card, as charging an account for a credit card bill that fails results in the suspension of the service. Some users also pointed out that the Apple Card is not the most competitive credit card in the US market.The Apple Card offers 3% cashback on Apple purchases and 0% APR for up to 24 months, making it a good choice for those who frequently buy Apple products. However, it may not be the best option for those who want to earn cashback on all purchases. Some users have found the card easy to use and integrate with the iOS payment system, while others have criticized its lack of NFC capabilities for security reasons. Goldman Sachs spent a lot of money to help launch the Apple Card, with losses estimated at $1.2 billion in nine months last year, related primarily to the Apple Card. Some users have had negative experiences with the card, including difficulty changing the name on the account.A discussion on Hacker News included comments about Apple's credit card and whether or not the company would disable iCloud accounts for customers who do not pay their credit card bills. One commenter clarified that the policy only meant that new transactions would be declined if the credit limit had been reached due to non-payment, and any accounts that relied on the Apple Card would be affected if transactions were declined because of the credit limit. Others in the discussion shared their positive experiences using Apple Card and its cash-back reward system, but some criticized Apple salespeople for pushing customers into buying more expensive products. Others questioned the value of using the financing option offered by Apple.Apple has launched a buy now, pay later service called Apple Pay Later for its US customers. The service offers two options for financing purchases made on Apple Pay. One offers interest-free instalments over several months, the other allows users to defer payments for longer at a variable interest rate. Customers with a Goldman Sachs-issued Apple Card also have access to the first option. Both BNPL services will be available to any Apple Pay user, even those without an Apple Card. The move comes as other retailers and payments firms jump on the BNPL trend, which allows them to offer alternative financing, increase sales, and build loyalty. Critics argue that BNPL schemes can be predatory on people who have difficulty managing their finances.Apple has launched a new \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" feature that allows US customers to split their purchases into four payments with zero interest and no fees through Apple Pay. Users of the payment service can choose between paying over four weeks or through monthly instalments over several months, although interest rates will apply for longer-term repayments. Observers have noted the impact on Apple's brand, with some suggesting it cheapens the company's image for being associated with what is essentially a credit card service. Despite this, the move is expected to be lucrative as a result of\u00a0the high transaction fees that merchants must pay for BNPL use.Apple has introduced a \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" programme named Apple Pay Later, enabling users to pay for in four interest-free instalments. The platform will be able to offer people from low-income backgrounds, as well as those with no or limited credit history, an opportunity to make purchases without needing upfront cash or a traditional credit card. The service is presently available only to Apple Pay customers in the US, and the credit limit would be determined by Goldman Sachs, the bank that provides the Apple Card. The programme, rivaling similar ones by Klarna and Affirm, may be advantageous, particularly for high-cost things that people cannot afford to buy upfront, or more expensive items, such as smartphones or laptops, that they may require for their work.Apple is launching a \"Buy Now, Pay Later\" feature called Apple Pay Later that allows users to split their purchases into four payments over six weeks with no interest. Users must have an Apple Card to access the service, which is being offered in partnership with Goldman Sachs. While some commentators have expressed concerns that the feature could encourage consumers to make impulse purchases, others view it as a way for responsible consumers to have more financial flexibility without incurring interest charges. The move could also shake up the \"buy now, pay later\" industry, potentially posing a threat to providers such as Klarna and Afterpay. However, Apple's foray into financial services also raises questions about the company's priorities and focus on product quality.Apple has launched a new payment system in the US called Apple Pay Later, which enables users to split online and in-app purchases into four payments over six weeks with no fees or interest. Users can apply for loans of between $50 and $1,000, which can be used on iPhone and iPad with merchants that accept Apple Pay. The service is built into Apple Wallet, where users can view, track and manage all of their loans in one place. Apple's vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, Jennifer Bailey, said the service was designed with users' financial health in mind, with no fees or interest charged,\u00a0making it easier to make informed and responsible borrowing decisions.Apple has launched a \"buy now, pay later\" service called Apple Pay Later, which is available only in the US and only to iPhone and iPad users. It is \"subject to eligibility and approval\" and loans are made by Apple Financing, which may report past or future loans to credit bureaus, potentially impacting users' credit scores. Users' banks may charge fees if their debit card accounts contain insufficient funds for repayments. Upon purchase, a user's Apple Pay Later loan and payment history may be reported to credit bureaus and impact their credit. Some merchants may not offer Apple Pay Later, and the service may not be available in all US states or territories.",

        "content": "Clearview AI, a facial recognition company, has been used almost 1 million times by US law enforcement agencies, according to a statement made to the BBC. While Clearview has reported successful uses of its technology, such as helping to clear a wrongfully accused man, critics have cited privacy and accuracy concerns. One commentator noted that the use of facial recognition \"will necessarily inherit the moral valence of whoever\u2019s using it\", and that its goodness or badness depends on the morality of the entities involved. As we've previously reported, Clearview has faced controversy over its methods of building its database of faces, which are taken from social media profiles without users' consent. Clearview has also been linked to US law enforcement agencies which have previously faced criticism for their approaches to policing.Facial recognition firm Clearview AI has run almost one million searches requested by US law enforcement agencies to identify people without their consent, according to its founder, Hoan Ton-That. The amount of data scraped by the company from platforms such as Facebook has risen to 30 billion images. While Clearview is banned from selling its services to most US firms, its software is being used by hundreds of law enforcement units in the country. The technology has been criticised for violating privacy, racial and ethnic bias, and the potential for mistaken identifications. In one rare interview, Miami Police revealed it has used Clearview\u2019s system to investigate all crimes, from homicide to shoplifting.Clearview AI, a controversial facial recognition technology, has been used to acquit a man charged with vehicular homicide in Florida. The case against Andrew Conlyn was thrown out after a passer-by, who removed Conlyn from the driver's passenger seat after a crash, came forward as a witness, a fact deduced from facial recognition images. Despite its success in this case and other similar circumstances, critics have raised concerns about the company's methods of obtaining facial recognition data, particularly Clearview's screening of images from social media without consent. They argue that the technology is a danger to civil liberties and human rights: \"It absolutely needs to be banned,\" said Christiaan Guargilia, a professor at New York University.",

        "url": "https://www.theverge.com/23653141/tiktok-ban-bytedance-congress-hearing-first-amendment-open-internet",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35336748",
        "content": "The TikTok ban is a contentious issue, with some arguing that it is a national security threat due to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) control, while others see it as a betrayal of the open internet. Those in favor of the ban argue that China's censorship requirements and data-sharing rules pose a significant risk, and that the US must protect itself from such a threat. However, critics point out that foreign internet companies can operate in China if they follow the same rules as Chinese companies, and that transparency rules should be implemented for all social media companies operating in the US. Some argue that banning TikTok could also have a negative effect on US-China relations and could lead to retaliatory measures against US companies operating in China.The discussion revolves around concerns about data privacy and national security in relation to TikTok, a Chinese-owned social network. Some argue that US tech companies pose a greater threat to data privacy, while others are worried about TikTok's potential for Chinese government interference. The proposed ban on TikTok is not seen as a slippery slope but rather a necessary step to ensure national security. However, others argue that the proposed legislation gives too much power to the President and could lead to abuse. The discussion also touches on the need for countries to prioritize their own national security in their regulations and decision-making, although it is acknowledged that this can lead to hypocrisy and a lack of unity among countries.The conversation starts with a user accusing another of implying that they don't want to engage, and being sarcastic. They urge people to engage in constructive dialogue and acknowledge bad faith edits. The discussion then turns to the implications of the Smith-Mundt Act, which involves the dissemination of propaganda by the government. The conversation then shifts to the TikTok ban and who poses a greater risk, US corporations or China. Some argue that China could use data to manipulate individuals, while others point out that US corporations have plenty of interest in exploiting data. The conversation concludes that psychological manipulation should be banned altogether and that banning TikTok individually doesn't solve the problem.The debate over TikTok raises concerns about data collection and selective censorship by China, which could influence foreign users through the app. However, some argue that banning TikTok is not the solution and that privacy laws need to be reformed instead. There are also claims that China is preparing to invade Taiwan and is using TikTok to influence the US public to oppose military support for Taiwan. Additionally, some argue that the problem of data collection and use is not unique to Chinese companies and should be addressed across the entire industry. Lastly, there are claims that TikTok is not censored by China and that the platform contains videos critical of the Chinese Communist Party.The article contains a discussion thread on a potential TikTok ban in the US due to concerns over national security and censorship. Some commenters argue that there should be proper user protection laws in place to regulate such platforms instead of an outright ban. Others suggest that the ban could be a covert move to introduce \"heinous legislation\" that could fine or jail individuals for unlawful acts. Some argue that TikTok is a covert military campaign of \"ideological subversion\" by China, aimed at weakening Western populations both physically and mentally. Meanwhile, others argue that the concerns over TikTok's censorship and bias need to be addressed, especially as China has a history of limiting freedom of information.The comments section of an article regarding Taiwan and the United States' \"One China policy\" discusses the possibility of conflict between the US and China over the island nation. One commenter argues that the US needs China for industrial and consumer goods, making its economy brittle and quickly breakable without them. China has been building up its navy, while also threatening Taiwan with flyovers. The US has a long-standing history of friendship with Taiwan, and is selling weapons to them to better defend themselves. However, with China investing in large combat ships and carriers, and having a large air force and advanced missile forces, it is no longer a threat to be taken lightly. The potential conflict could involve the US Navy having to defend Taiwan, exposing itself to Chinese missiles, air force, and small missile patrol boats.A debate on the security risks posed by Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok has emerged on Hacker News. A user argued that the concerns expressed about TikTok's close links to Beijing should apply to every app associated with governments adversarial to the US, while another user suggested people were only worried about TikTok because it allowed users to spread ideas more effectively than other apps. TikTok has been banned by India amid a geopolitical feud with China and now faces being banned in the US, where President Donald Trump reportedly views it as a national security threat, although some analysts argue the move is being driven by sentiment within his base.The proposed Restrict Act banning TikTok in the US is part of a larger, more aggressive bill focused on targeting countries that censor American companies. The Act would apply to companies owned or partially owned by China, Iran, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela. However, some suggest a fairer solution would be to ban companies in an industry in foreign countries if American companies are not allowed to operate in that country. The highly asymmetrical relationship that exists between China and the rest of the world has led to concerns over security risks and censorship. While Chinese companies can spin up whatever they want in any country, every other country has to comply with Chinese censorship laws to publish anything in China through the Great Firewall.The discussion surrounds whether or not TikTok should be banned in the US, with opinions split on whether it\u2019s a superior product or a Trojan horse. Some argue that TikTok is superior in rapidly distributing niche information to an enormous quantity of people, and that its algorithm is generating an interested and desirable audience for advertisers. Others contend that TikTok is only superior in poisoning the minds of people, with its recommendations being crafted to harm American intellect and prey on vanity. The discussion also touches on double standards, with some commentators saying that China doesn\u2019t allow TikTok\u2019s BS to be disseminated in their territory, so the same should apply to Facebook and Twitter in the US. There are also concerns about censorship, as well as the positioning of the US on the world stage.The recent hearing by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, in which TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew was grilled, highlights the US government's desire to ban the social media platform, despite it offering greater free speech than China. However, the move is not a signal that the US government is about to implement real tech reform. Instead, the ban is likely to be a PR move that redirects attention away from issues such as data selling and police surveillance. The move towards banning TikTok is reminiscent of when China banned Facebook and Twitter in 2009, which was firmly against the ideal of an open and free internet.There is a possibility that the US government may ban TikTok, which will betray America's supposed commitment to freedom of expression. It is difficult to tell whether the national security concerns about TikTok are grounded in solid evidence, but some of its tech companies have helped construct a surveillance state that is facilitating genocide. So far, there is more concrete evidence of Tim Hortons secretly tracking the average app user than TikTok. TikTok has a clear moderation bias, but it is one that many Americans seem to agree with. The best solution would be to pass real privacy, security, transparency, and accountability rules, not ban a foreign competitor while giving its American counterparts a pass for virtually the same offenses. Banning TikTok would affect not only speech from TikTok but also the speech of its users.",

        "url": "https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM",
        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35336113",
        "content": "The Higher Order Virtual Machine (HVM) is a new computational model that claims to be exponentially faster than alternatives, avoid global garbage collection (GC) and scales towards uncharted levels of performance. The HVM's AST can be seen as an assembly language with high-level interactional instructions, which could enable breaking us out of the Von Neumann bottleneck for faster processors. The HVM's model is based on Interaction Nets, which supposedly supersede the Turing Machine. HVM's time and space costs are completely measurable because of everything's linearity, and the predictability of its runtime is exciting. The HVM's compiler also features automatic parallelism and immutability for free. The Higher Order Company is using HVM for blockchain VMs to apply granular measurability, which isn't available on GHC, to improve Cardano's throughput.The Higher-Order Computing research group is working on a project called the Higher-Order Virtual Machine (HVM) that offers the promise of achieving effortless parallelism by naturally implementing the parallelism inherent in pure lambda terms without special annotations or extra accommodations. HVM is based on the theory of Symmetric Interaction Combinators, which theoretically evaluates lambda terms quickly. However, Symmetric Interaction Combinators turns lambda terms into large graphs, inhibiting good performance. HVM does not support the full Lambda Calculus because the issues have been acknowledged in the README, but can be tackled by the method described there. HVM optimizes sharing by-lazy-duplication and is tackling the limitations by including alternative pointer types. The current limitations of HVM are quadratic on HVM for some terms while they are linear on the GHC, but HVM is not joined to only one way to share data.HVM is a pure functional runtime that is lazy, non-garbage-collected and massively parallel. Its core model of computation is the Interaction Net, which is a new model that supersedes the Turing Machine and the Lambda Calculus. The HVM approach is memory-efficient, automatically parallelizes input, and is beta-optimal, which means that it can be exponentially faster than other alternatives for higher-order computations. HVM is a minimalist functional language that is compiled to the HVM runtime based on Interaction Nets. It is still being improved upon and is not meant to replace GHC. HVM has a few examples proving its capabilities, including Bubble Sort and Radix Sort. HVM is being updated periodically to optimize its use case scenarios.HVM is a new programming language that is based on the Interaction Net model and supports parallel computing. It can execute \u03bb-encoded functions exponentially faster than other mainstream languages, like GHC-enabled Haskell, and performs particularly well for large datasets. HVM offers several advantages, including beta-optimality, GC-freedom, and efficient implementation of the Interaction Net model, which is a concurrent model of computation. Although HVM is not yet fully optimized like Rust or C, developers can still use it to implement runtime deforestation for immutable data types, and to build efficient functional algorithms. With the ability to apply fusible functions 2^n times in linear time, HVM is considered a promising language for high-performance computing applications.HVM is a lightweight and massively parallel runtime for functional and imperative languages, including Haskell. It uses interaction nets, which add no overhead, and instantly collects any piece of data that becomes unreachable. HVM currently does not implement memory-efficient features like references, loops, and local mutability, so programs may have a larger memory footprint compared to C and Rust. HVM is not meant to replace GHC, but could provide an alternative option for the Haskell community once it is in a more mature stage. HVM is currently a prototype and bugs are to be expected. A production-ready version is expected by Q1 2024 if funding is secured for a team of engineers to work on it.",
        "summary": "- The Higher Order Virtual Machine (HVM) is a computational model that touts exponential speed, avoidance of global garbage collection, and scalability.\n- The HVM's core model of computation is the Interaction Net, which supersedes the Turing Machine and Lambda Calculus.\n- HVM's optimal beta feature can make it exponentially faster than other alternatives for higher-order computations.\n- HVM has automatic parallelism and immutability for free and is currently being used for blockchain VMs to improve Cardano's throughput.\n- HVM is memory-efficient and automatically parallelizes input and is ideal for large datasets and high-performance computing applications.\n- HVM currently does not have memory-efficient features like references, loops, and local mutability, but it is still in development and expected to become production-ready by Q1 2024."

        "content": "The Patriot Act is being applied to TikTok, creating a \"Trojan horse for censorship and surveillance,\" according to a post by intelligence analyst and National Security Agency veteran John Schindler. He believes the US' efforts to try and keep Chinese-developed apps from emerging to stem any potential cyber-espionage by Beijing is a form of \"neo-McCarthyism,\" adding that the terrorism-focused Patriot Act had not reduced deaths from terrorism but had led to widespread surveillance. Schindler accused the US of trying to kill free speech, with authorities scared that TikTok's young audience could end up being targeted by terrorists or other violent groups. He claimed that the authorities are also afraid of a post-truth world created by so-called conspiracy theories.Discussions surrounding the U.S. government's ability to conduct drone strikes on its own citizens without trial or due process have resurfaced following the recent drone strike on an Iranian commander by the Trump administration. Critics argue that both Republican and Democratic administrations support American imperialism and hegemony, and have passed laws that infringe upon American citizens' constitutional rights. The RESTRICT/DATA acts, which address information and communication technology products and services that pose undue or unacceptable risk to national security, have also sparked concerns over government surveillance and censorship. Critics argue that the acts grant sweeping powers to the Secretary of Commerce, creating a new branch of government with unchecked abilities to enforce any action deemed necessary.The article discusses the Restricting Economic and Commercial Habits (REACH) Act, which aims to prevent foreign adversaries from gaining control over American companies and technologies. The act defines specific kinds of risk, including sabotage, subversion of information and communications technology, catastrophic effects on critical infrastructure, interference in federal elections, and coercive or criminal activities by foreign adversaries. While some criticize the act as overly broad, it is not a carte blanche for the Secretary of Commerce to do whatever they want, as the act explicitly limits their authority. Additionally, there are checks on this authority, including executive orders, consultation with relevant agency heads and the Director of National Intelligence, and the possibility of court challenges. The article argues that while the act is not perfect, sensationalizing and misinterpreting its provisions does not help make a case against it.The debate over TikTok's ban in the US has turned to freedom of speech and data concerns. However, some comments suggest that the US government's decision to ban the app is a retaliatory act for China's previously imposed social media bans. Others argue that TikTok could be used by China for strategic purposes, while emphasizing that social media platforms can be used for radicalization in any society. The debate also touched on privacy and data sharing concerns caused by other social media giants. One commenter questioned whether the motives behind the ban were really about protecting Americans, as the country already experiences infringements upon individual privacy by the US government.The conversation is about the ban of TikTok in the US. Some commenters argue that the ban is motivated by the US trying to win the race to the bottom, while others believe that the US is banning the app because of concerns over national security and data privacy. Some point out that China has banned many US websites and social media platforms, and suggest that the US is engaging in recriminatory, lose-lose brinkmanship. Comments also touch on other issues, such as US companies' interests, anti-China propaganda, and the potential for foreign governments, such as China, to access detailed information on US citizens through apps like TikTok. Some commenters express concern that apps like TikTok can be used to manipulate public opinion.The debate over the ban of TikTok in the US centers on national security concerns and the potential for a foreign country to have access to sensitive data. Some argue that China's control over ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, presents a strategic threat to the US. Others suggest that the ban is politically motivated or that it represents a larger trend of restricting individual liberties. The bill proposed to authorize such a ban outlines \"covered transactions\" related to information and communications technology products or services that could pose a threat to national security. The bill has caused concern over its potential impact on academic research and freedom of expression, similar to the recent ban of Grindr.The US Senate's RESTRICT Act, which seeks to ban TikTok, has been a subject of controversy. However, critics claim it could provide the government with unchecked powers to monitor communications infrastructure, despite the fact the bill has 19 cosponsors from both parties. Many are concerned about the use of\u00a0unspecific language, specifically the term \"safety of US persons\" being used six times without definition. The law, which applies to \"any covered transaction\", could affect any business influenced by a \"foreign adversary\". Dubbed as a \"Trojan horse for censorship and surveillance\", the legislation could become the start of a US version of\u00a0China's Great Firewall. The Mises Caucus has called for a better approach and suggests that\u00a0forcing a sale to a trusted owner, and complete audit of the codebase/infrastructure would solve the problem, and both parties should allow this.",

        "content": "Starbucks has been accused of withholding raises and tips from unionized workers, according to a decision by the US National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB found that Starbucks illegally ended access to electronic tip jars in several US coffee shops, and illegally suspended some workers' access to digital pay stubs. Starbucks also purportedly unlawfully implemented a minimum-wage increase for unionized staff while preventing them from combining it with tips. The company has been ordered by the NLRB to provide affected employees with back pay along with information on their rights to organize and unionize. Starbucks is reportedly planning to appeal the decision.Starbucks was found guilty of violating labor laws by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), for discriminating against unionized workers by withholding access to the company's credit card tipping system. Starbucks representative Jory Mendes said the company will appeal this verdict.\u00a0Starbucks was accused of withholding access to the credit card tipping by the NLRB in May 2022 with the company arguing that the delay was due to the designated period of negotiation with union organizers. The NLRB ruled that the practice was discriminatory and that managers had retaliated against union organizers. The decision was based on the fact that non-union workers were able to use the tip-sharing arrangement five months\u00a0before union employees, creating differential treatment.\nStarbucks has been accused of violating National Labor Relations Act regulations after introducing a virtual tipping system, which some unionized employees claim is unfairly restricted. The complaint is based on the National Labor Relations Board's ruling that employers cannot provide incentives or benefits to workers in exchange for union status. Starbucks had previously denied employees at unionized locations the right to virtual tips or pay increases given to employees at non-union locations, leading to allegations of discrimination. Observers say unions will continue to seek legal and regulatory protection in negotiations over worker pay and benefits. Starbucks recently announced it would introduce a $15 minimum wage.The upper limit for what a Starbucks barista can earn gross is $32k/year, working 40 hours a week, 50 weeks per year, at an hourly rate of $16. However, there is a discussion on whether this figure would increase, should a union come in to negotiate. Commenters discuss the issue of workers being able to take time off when sick without fear of losing their job. Some argue that employers could increase prices to afford treating their employees like human beings, while others question the financial impact on the business and productivity if the company allows baristas to call out sick with no advance notice. The turnover rate among baristas at Starbucks is also debated, with some saying it is high, while others point out the company provides benefits that are better than most in the industry.Starbucks is facing fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars for violating labor laws at three New York City locations. The National Labor Relations Board has charged the coffee chain with multiple counts of unfair labor practices, including retaliating against employees for unionizing and prohibiting them from wearing pro-union pins. Starbucks has denied the allegations and has said that it plans to defend itself against the charges. The company has faced criticism in the past for its treatment of workers, with many calling for it to provide better benefits and pay. The charges and potential fines are another blow to Starbucks' reputation, which has already taken a hit during the pandemic as sales and profits have fallen.Starbucks has violated federal labour law by preventing unionised employees in North America from receiving credit card tips, according to a complaint filed by the National Labor Relations Board. The coffee chain introduced the policy, which benefited non-unionised workers, in 2022. Union workers have reported that the introduction of credit card tips added between $3 and $4 per hour to their pay in some stores. In December the company also illegally granted larger pay increases to non-unionised staff, the complaint found. Starbucks has previously been accused of\u00a0union-busting by denying unionised workers the same benefits\u00a0as non-union staff.\u00a0The company's CEO, Howard Schultz, who stepped down earlier this year, is due to testify before the Senate HELP committee\u00a0on Wednesday.\n",

        "content": "A new group chatting app called Wavelength has been released. The app, which is currently only available for iOS, offers \"threaded\" group chats, private messages, and an AI bot for reminders, updates, and polls. The app's focus on design and privacy is seen as its main selling points, but there are concerns about the chat's lack of interoperability with other platforms and the potential for privacy breaches with strangers joining groups. The app's creator, John Gruber, has also disclosed that he has accepted a position as an official advisor to the company in exchange for equity, which has raised some concerns about his impartiality as a reviewer. The Wavelength team has addressed these concerns by stating that they are transparent about the app's features and limitations.Wavelength, a new messaging app, is seeking to combine the threaded chat of Slack and the hashtags of Twitter with the privacy protection offered by end-to-end encryption. The app features a real-name policy, enforced civility and AI chatbot support, however the latter service is kept separate from full encryption. Messages containing specific bot mentions are sent in plain text to support GPT-3. Wavelength's co-founder said that the company does not plan to use advertising revenue, but instead plans to make money primarily by offering pro subscriptions and a version of the app for organisations. The messaging app works on an invite-only basis for now.The article discusses a new messaging app called Wavelength, which offers a privacy-focused, AI-driven alternative to popular chat apps like WhatsApp and Signal. The app's unique threading model allows for organized and efficient group discussions, with threads organized by topic. The app runs natively on Apple devices, which may limit its adoption in regions where Android devices dominate. Some users criticize the app's similarities to other popular chat apps and its lack of availability on non-Apple devices. The article notes that Wavelength's claims of privacy may not be significantly different from those of other chat apps, and questions how the app will monetize its development costs given its lack of in-app purchases.Users discuss a new messaging app called Wavelength, which claims to offer completely private and secure messaging through end-to-end encryption. However, some users express skepticism about the app, expressing frustration with the proliferation of messaging apps and the need to use multiple apps to communicate with different people. Others express concerns about Wavelength's use of OpenAI's GPT language model and whether it compromises privacy, as well as criticism of the app's optional real name policy. Despite the criticisms, some users express support for Wavelength and its threaded end-to-end encrypted group chat feature as an alternative to traditional messaging apps.Wavelength is a new group messaging app focused on privacy and intuitive threading, developed by the team behind Telepath. Unlike personal messaging apps like WhatsApp and Apple's Messages that are primarily designed for one-on-one communications, Wavelength is group-first, with a third layer of threads added to the design. Each group has an owner and members. Inside threads are the actual messages, which are completely private and secure. Wavelength's integration of GPT-3.5 AI chat into group discussions is a trendy feature that appears to be enduring. The app is conceptually native to iOS, with good design and high signal-to-noise ratio in the groups, and can accommodate groups with hundreds of members. The app's rollout coincides with the arrival of genuinely useful AI chat, which makes Wavelength a unique messaging app.Wavelength, a group messaging app, was designed for human group chat but has now incorporated OpenAI's chatbot, as the team realised they had built a platform suitable for both. The app's focus on threading fits well with AI integration and allows for multiple contextual histories for each thread in a group. The Wavelength team plans to add further AI features, such as persona customisation. The app occupies a space between personal messaging apps and enterprise apps, catering for groups that could fit on a bus or a small airline. It has fine-grained controls for notifications, providing advantages over apps that lack threading capabilities. The app is robust in its privacy protocols, its messaging history is peer-to-peer and its end-to-end encryption game is on-point. It plans to make money selling pro features, and an Android app is in the works.",

GitHub has not officially commented on the alleged job cuts.\u00a0\u00a0GitHub has reportedly laid off a significant number of its engineering team in India as part of Microsoft's restructuring efforts. The layoffs were said to be driven by increased use of AI for coding, with GitHub expecting to achieve a 40% productivity boost in development using their AI solutions. Some commenters have criticized the move, arguing that the use of AI for coding does not necessarily translate to a reduction in the need for human developers. Others have noted that GitHub's decision to lay off employees amid the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession is reflective of a larger trend of companies cutting costs during challenging times.GitHub has reportedly laid off a significant number of its employees in India, as part of a broader restructuring plan, according to an anonymous source cited by TechCrunch.

        "content": "The meat industry blocked the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's recommendation of a plant-based diet, which could have an impact in reducing carbon emissions. Critics highlighted the industry's lobbying and corruption, while proponents of the meat industry criticized the elitism of environmentalism and the hypocrisy of wealthy environmentalists. The discussion on the topic turned political, with some defending capitalism while others called for systemic change. While the conversation included personal responsibility and individual actions, such as reducing meat consumption, many comments focused on the need for policy change and corporate responsibility. Overall, the conversation highlights the tension between environmental concerns and corporate interests, and the need for systemic solutions for sustainable development.The discussion revolves around the recommendation by the IPCC to adopt a plant-based diet to mitigate climate change. One commenter suggests punishing those who manipulate scientific results, while another argues that going after small fish is more practical since it's hard to put real social pressure on corporations and industries that make more money in a year than the collective wealth of entire nations. Another commenter argues against the plant-based diet recommendation, stating that plant-based diets would require much more agricultural land for the same calorie intake than a balanced meat and plant-based diet. The commenter feels that there's nothing scientific about the recommendation, and people use the word 'scientific' to make their study sound like a religion while ignoring ethical issues like animal welfare.Discussions on HN on tackling climate change go beyond the effectiveness of a plant-based diet to solving the looming crisis. Some HN commenters have suggested that regardless of personal choices driving short-term wealth accumulation by those in power and a critical need to address the problem, human beings have the tools needed to tackle the problem through the application of technology, sustainable development policies, and collective action. While arguments over the efficacy of a vegan diet compound the issue, with some arguing that it\u2019s not as straightforward as it seems, broad evidence indicates that vegan diets are associated with improved health outcomes and animal consumption has a disproportionate environmental impact. Discussion over political bias and censorship of IPCC and climatology reports also occurred, including how the climate community should approach admitted flaws in climate science.The conversation revolves around the topic of climate change and the manipulation of data to support scientific predictions. One user claims that researchers changed the temperature data to fit their predictions, while another challenges them to provide physical explanations for observations such as global surface temperatures and glacier time series photos. The conversation also touches on the political and economic aspects of climate change, with one user suggesting a ban on corporate speech and another advocating for nuanced discussions around the impact of dairy and meat on health. The importance of individual freedom to choose is also emphasized.The discussion revolves around the health benefits and drawbacks of a plant-based diet versus a meat-based diet. The response to a comment advocating for getting children outside and moving to promote their health stressed that no diet can make up for a sedentary lifestyle. Another comment opposed to criticism of plant-based diets provided links to leading academic research organizations, such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, that state vegetarian and vegan diets can be healthful and nutritionally adequate. The discussion also touched on the environmental impact of meat consumption and the potential health effects of processed meats compared to unprocessed plant-based diets. There were differing opinions on the topic, but overall, there seems to be evidence supporting the health benefits of a plant-based diet.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends a \"sustainable healthy diet\" consisting of plant-based foods and animal-sourced food produced in sustainable, low greenhouse gas-emission systems. While a plant-based diet has been shown to be the most effective diet for healthy weight loss, there are other diets, such as ones that reduce carbohydrate intake, that have been proven effective in reversing type-2 diabetes. While processed food isn't necessarily bad, certain forms of processing can have negative health effects. Margarine, for example, has been shown to be unhealthy due to it being highly processed, whereas lentil stew or a salad are generally considered healthy. Animal foods are generally worse for the environment than plant-based foods, with beef having a much larger environmental impact than chicken or cheese. However, studies have shown that cow methane emissions can be mitigated by feeding them seaweed.The amount of land used by meat industries has many negative effects, and there is a need for more land to let everyone on earth eat the kind of diets prevalent in rich countries. An individual switch to plant-based diets is a possible remedy, and public policy should rapidly remove subsidies from meat and animal industries and fully price in all negative externalities. In contrast, subsidies should be given to plant-based alternatives. The cost of plant-based alternatives should be several times lower than the meat versions to drive consumption changes. Reduction of meat from cows and sheep is not enough. Other meat sources are worse than plant-based alternatives in terms of climate change, pandemic risk, and antibiotics resistance risk. Chicken meat industries cause much animal suffering and should be phased out. Negative externalities should be priced in. Radical change policies aimed at reducing meat industries' negative externalities are politically unpalatable.A new report has detailed how lobbying by the meat industry aimed at the European Parliament prevented a paper on the impact of meat production on climate change from being released. The report was created by United Kingdom-based environmental think tank Chatham House and revealed The International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed sought permission to release\u00a0a report predicting that meat production will cause environmental damages worth $1.6tn by 2050. The report\u2019s publication was blocked after an intervention by the trade group. Cattle placed the \u201cgreatest burden on the environment\u201d, followed by pigs and chickens. The report also stated that insect farming as a form of livestock could outstrip traditional forms, and urged a shift of investment into the sector.A draft of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, leaked on March 20, reveals that the global meat industry has prevented recommendations for a plant-based diet in the report. The draft initially recommended that \u201cplant-based diets can reduce GHG emissions by up to 50% compared to the average emission-intensive Western diet\u201d. However, the final report referred instead to \"balanced, sustainable healthy diets acknowledging nutritional needs.\" The changes were driven by the beef industries of Brazil and Argentina who have long-standing, powerful lobbies who have held positions in government and influenced important climate policy. The meat and dairy industries produce more than half of the environmental impact of food production.",

As state is not usually preserved from one request to the next in serverless environments, developers have been forced to work around their connection pooling needs. Neon has been optimized to lessen boilerplate code by providing an efficient connection pathway to Postgres that enables less stress or effort when dealing with serverless environments. However, some critics argue that the need for this product wouldn't be present in the first place if developers of serverless environments stopped worrying about deployment and chose more \"boring\" architectures. Nevertheless, serverless environments are rapidly growing and require new innovations, regardless of their perceived excitement.Neon, a serverless database platform, uses a WebSockets connection to keep database connection pools running efficiently, even in a serverless environment where connections can't be pooled on the client side. By keeping connections established server-side and utilizing Cloudflare's Workers service to manage that connection, Neon maintains better control over database access, leading to significant reductions in round-trip communications, according to recent blog post by Nikita Shamgunov, the company's CEO. Neon also makes use of Safekeepers, which are independent processes that handle writes, along with a scalable metadata-storing system that is designed to assign workers to run queries optimally. Finally, the platform\u2019s use of S3 as a cold storage solution is integrated into how it handles data.\nNeon\u2019s serverless driver enables the PostgreSQL TCP wire protocol to be accessible from serverless platforms such as Cloudflare Workers and Vercel Edge Functions. Due to the lack of client-side database connection pooling in these environments, quick database connections are particularly important as a new connection must be established every time. Minimizing both the number and length of network round-trips is thus critical to getting low response times for PostgreSQL queries. Neon was able to reduce the number of round-trips to the first query result by upgrading to TLS 1.3 and eliminating the `SSLRequest` round-trip. Postgres authentication was also sped up by using SCRAM. Hosting read-replicas in multiple regions is also an important feature on Neon\u2019s roadmap to minimize round-trip length.Neon, a serverless PostgreSQL database provider, has developed a new pipeline strategy to optimize the speed of authentication checks. The process involves replacing the SCRAM authentication scheme, which is designed to withstand brute-force attacks, with simple password authentication. By increasing the search space of passwords rather than slowing down verification using SCRAM, the authentication flow can be optimized to decrease response times. Neon has also used Postgres pipelining to send three messages in one transmission, reducing the number of round-trips necessary during authentication. Recently, the company added WebSocket and TCP acceleration, caching, and additional security features to optimize serverless PostgreSQL databases further. Neon aims to reduce the time to authenticate a connection to as little as two round-trips.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35334124",
        "content": "The .DS_Store file is created by Apple's operating system in all directories to store meta information about the contents. It contains the names of all files and directories in that folder, and is used by the OSX Finder to store its own metadata. The file is not part of HFS+ or APFS, but rather is a kludge to give Finder a place to store its own metadata. MacOS prior to X had more elegant solutions to the problem. The file is used for storing layouts, sorting and grouping options, and is invisible for users of Finder so it is still the best solution. The file can be deleted without negative consequences. MacOS could store the directory-level metadata directly in the file system with xattrs on the directory inode, but it uses the .DS_Store file instead.The discussion is about ignoring certain files in version control. The original post mentions the annoyance of \".DS_Store\" files on macs, with some replies suggesting putting an exclusion rule in a centralised config file, whereas others argue for putting it in the project's `.gitignore`. There's also a mention of secrets checks being in git and the benefits of a centralised exclusion file. One person suggests adding a `.gitignore_global` file, while another suggests ignoring it in the global git config. Some comments mention other dot files causing issues, and a user writes about the annoyance of slow thumbnail generation on Windows. The general consensus is that it's better to have a consistent, agreed-upon way to ignore certain files.The .DS_Store file is a hidden file created by Apple's operating system to store information about files and directories in a folder. It contains proprietary information that is not well-documented online. Writing a parser for the file format in Go or Python can be a useful exercise for those interested in learning about it. The file begins with a 36-byte header in big-endian format that includes an alignment integer and magic bytes (0x42756431). Two 4-byte integers define the position of a root block containing information about other pieces of the file. The file contains meta information about its contents, including the names of all files and directories in a folder. Reading through several resources can provide a rough understanding of the file before attempting to parse it.The .DS_Store file is a hidden file that Mac OS stores in almost all folders, which contains important metadata about the tree and its other blocks. It contains the file names that it contains, which can be sensitive information that can be inadvertently uploaded to webservers. The author of this blog post discovered that many sensitive files are exposed and potentially accessible because of the existence of this file. The author also provides instructions on how to check for the file and protect against it. By writing a parser for the file format, the author learned about the internals of file formats and how those can be structured and parsed, though not all features are available due to the lack of full openness of the .DS_Store format.The author warns about the potential risk of .DS_Store files and recommends denying access to them or ensuring they won't be uploaded or committed. They also express gratitude to those who published notes on file format, which facilitated their own work.

The agency said that users based in the UK would be contacted by the police as well. The move has been praised by experts. Some, however, were sceptical about the potential success of the scheme, pointing out that it would be difficult to delete reviews of the fake sites.

Those who tried to access it have been told their names are now on an NCA database, and that they could face further action if they do not desist. The authorities are currently looking into a number of suspected users. The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) has reported creating counterfeit DDoS booter websites to gather information, warn users that launching DDoS attacks is illegal, and generate apprehension for potential customers of the UK's DDoS black-market. The NCA said it had created its fake stressor and booter sites to resemble those that are \"used to execute attacks\", but instead of distributing cybercrime tools, the websites gathered data on users. The UK considers those who hire DDoS attacks or those who launch DDoS attacks liable under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Going forward, the NCA opined that potential customers of these cybercrime sites will be uncertain who is running them and could resign from using such sites. This initiative follows the US Department of Justice's Operation Power Off, which targeted firms responsible for 30 million DDoS attacks.",

Until now, the LLaMA code was available under the GPL licence, which requires that derivative work is also released under GPL license, preventing broader use. Lit-LLaMA represents the first instance of LLaMA being licensed to be compatible with other Apache 2.0-licensed work. The Lightning team has promised to also resolve issues around LLaMA's weights that don't fall under the same scope.Lightning-AI has released lit-llama, an Apache 2.0-licensed inference pipeline for Facebook's LLaMA (Language model for Large-scale Multilingual knowledge Access). Researchers have been able to create powerful language models that can write coherent news articles from a small prompt, outline entire scientific papers, and even generate lifelike images. The question of whether AI-generated content is copyrightable remains, raising the question of how commercial applications can be developed with these models. The lit-llama platform offers a solution to the issue that large language models currently have trade secret protections and typically come with non-commercial licenses that make them hard to use for businesses.Lit-LLaMA is a single-file implementation of an independent version of LLaMA that is fully open source under the Apache 2.0 license. Lit-LLaMA solves the issue with the original LLaMA code being GPL licensed, preventing any academic or commercial use, by making it fully open source. The implementation is numerically equivalent to the original model, optimized to run on consumer hardware or at scale, without boilerplate, and with no strings attached. To use Lit-LLaMA, clone the GitHub repository, install the dependencies, and run inference on a GPU with at least 26GB of memory. Consumers can also run Lit-LLaMA on GPUs with less memory by enabling quantization.

        "content": "China has reported a new case of H3N8 bird flu in a human, marking the third known case this year. The case has been identified in a middle-aged individual who had been exposed to poultry prior to the onset of symptoms. While H3N8 is primarily a virus that affects birds, it has been known to occasionally infect humans. There is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus. However, there are concerns about the potential for the virus to mutate and become more transmissible. The news has prompted discussion on the reliability of news coming out of China, with some commentators suggesting that bad news only emerges when it is impossible to hide.Reports of another bird flu outbreak in China have been met with concern worldwide. The new outbreak, reported in the Hunan province, comes amid a spate of outbreaks among birds in the country. While some bird flu viruses can be passed from birds to humans, they almost never spread beyond an infected person. Despite this, health experts are concerned because it is possible for the virus to mutate and become contagious. Over the last two decades, there have been several deadly bird flu epidemics, including the H7N9 virus in China in 2013 and the H5N1 virus outbreak in 1997. Although the majority of human flu outbreaks start in China, experts are warning against any unnecessary panic until more is known about this latest outbreak.A 56-year-old woman from Zhongshan City in southern China has tested positive for H3N8 bird flu, according to local officials. This is only the third confirmed case in humans, following a 4-year-old boy and a 5-year-old boy who were infected in central and Hunan provinces respectively. It is also the first case in an adult. Though H3N8 is typically found in birds and horses, researchers believe a previous strain of the virus caused the 1889 \u201cAsiatic flu\u201d or \u201cRussian flu\u201d pandemic. In a brief statement, the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the expert view was that the case was \"sporadic\" and that the \"risk of virus transmission is low at this stage\".\n",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35335165",
        "content": "A post on Hacker News discusses the normalization problem with APFS, which is normalization-insensitive but normalization-preserving. This means file names are normalized in Unicode NFD (decomposed) form when created in Finder, but in Unicode NFC (composed) form when created in a zsh shell, leading to different bytes that appear the same. This issue can cause problems, such as with Git repositories synchronized to a Linux system, where files can have two different-normalized names with the same appearance. There are also issues with Windows, where changing between different files systems requires normalization changes that may take hours to fix. In practice, Linux file systems treat filenames as bags of bytes, while Apple\u2019s HFS stores explicit \u2018code page\u2019 ID to interpret byte sequences for file names.APFS is Apple's in-house next-gen filesystem, designed to replace the previous HFS+ in macOS. It supports features such as encryption, snapshots, and cloning, but lacks some of the more advanced features of other modern filesystems, such as block-level deduplication. Some users have reported issues with APFS and Time Machine backups, with backups being slow and taking up excessive space due to the need to back up entire files instead of just the changed blocks. Despite its limitations, APFS remains the default filesystem for macOS and is widely used by Apple users.This thread on Hacker News discusses the use of APFS, Apple's new filesystem, particularly in relation to the Time Machine backup system. The thread includes comments on Time Machine's limitations and potential solutions, such as block-level snapshots and compression options. There is also discussion on why Apple did not use the ZFS filesystem as originally planned, with some pointing to concerns over memory and processing requirements as well as licensing issues. Additionally, users discuss the lack of data checksums in APFS and potential ways to address this issue. Overall, the thread features various opinions and experiences on the use and implementation of APFS.On March 27, 2017, Apple introduced its new file system, Apple File System (APFS), but its adoption didn't go smoothly. The system was first released on iOS 10.3 and quietly converted storage in every iPhone and iPad, risking disaster if a large percentage of conversions failed. When the system was introduced with macOS High Sierra 10.13, it faced major problems and incompatibility with some devices. Apple released various fixes to address this, including improved snapshot support, but issues with Fusion Drives proved difficult to fix. Support for these drives wasn't introduced until macOS Mojave 10.14 in 2018, and APFS has continued to undergo changes and suffer from vulnerabilities. APFS's newest version, 1934.101.3, is on macOS Monterey 12.3.In a blog post, Howard Oakley discusses the evolution of Apple's file system, APFS, which marked its fifth anniversary recently. Oakley highlights the difficulties that arose during the early days of APFS, including the massive gamble that Apple took when it included the new file system in macOS\u00a0High Sierra, and the need for an extended public beta trial. Oakley also disputes common misconceptions, such as Apple's generousness towards tech experts, and provides\u00a0advice on using APFS in mixed systems. Finally, he notes that while a Disk Warrior for APFS may eventually be created, given the fundamental differences between the two file formats it's unclear if this tool will be as useful as its HFS+ counterpart.The article includes a comment thread discussing APFS and its version numbers. Users ask questions about finding and interpreting APFS version numbers, and also discuss FileVault2 encryption and data recovery on APFS volumes. One user shares their experience with Disk Drill, a data recovery tool, while another seeks advice on recovering non-securely deleted files from a FileVault2-encrypted APFS volume. The thread also includes a reference to BeOS as the ancestor of modern HFS+ and how it differs from APFS. Overall, the thread is a mix of technical discussions, personal experiences, and user questions on various aspects of APFS and encryption on Mac.The Eclectic Light Company has 3,182 followers who can customize and manage their subscription to the blog.

        "content": "The US Senate has proposed a bill that seeks to ban TikTok, citing national security concerns over the data it collects from US citizens. Critics of the bill suggest that the real reasons behind the move may be related to fears that the app is a means of spreading uncensored messages, or that its rapid growth poses a threat to established US social media firms. Some also argue that the bill is thinly veiled protectionism aimed at hobbling Chinese competition, especially in light of the ongoing trade war. Others, meanwhile, suggested that the real solution might lie in passing more comprehensive privacy and security regulations applicable to all social media platforms, irrespective of their owners or nationality.The ban on TikTok by the US government has sparked debate about censorship and political values, with some questioning the decision's rationale. While some point out the app's ownership by the Chinese firm ByteDance and concerns over Chinese propaganda as the reasons for the ban, others have responded by arguing that Chinese apps have been operating in the US without issue for years. Some have also called for the US to reconsider its stance on free speech and privacy rights. There are also critiques of the US's \"loser's game\" mentality and its refusal to acknowledge the importance of reciprocity in US-China relations. Finally, the ban has reignited discussion on the history of censorship and free speech in the US.US lawmakers have proposed a bill that could ban social media app TikTok, along with other Chinese-made apps, citing concerns over national security and Chinese censorship. The bill would grant the US government significant powers to investigate and potentially ban or force divestment on any large technology business owned by a US adversary like China that is determined to pose a serious security risk. The move comes as US politicians have grown increasingly vocal in their criticism of China, which they accuse of cyber espionage, human rights violations and territorial aggression. TikTok has hit back against the accusations, saying it is \"not the enemy\".A Senate bill proposes banning TikTok and other Chinese-owned social media platforms in the US, citing concerns about data privacy and the possibility of Chinese government access to user data. Critics argue that the bill's broad language could potentially impact other entities beyond just TikTok, and that real concerns about data privacy and security should be addressed through comprehensive data privacy laws rather than a blanket ban. Some also argue that banning TikTok may set a dangerous precedent for censorship and government control of social media. The bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where it could potentially languish for years without further action.In response to a bill being proposed to ban TikTok, users on the Hacker News discussion board questioned the need for a bill and whether banning a specific company violates the First Amendment. Some argued that Congress creates laws while the President enforces them, and banning without a bill is an unusual approach. Others noted that the bill's complexity raises concerns about possible corruption and a potential conflict of interest. Some questioned why the US shouldn't simply compete with the app rather than banning it. However, some argued that banning TikTok is necessary due to data harvesting and potential data control by the Chinese Communist Party. The discussion also included comments on the Chinese government's censorship practices and the fear of ideological echo chambers.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35348353",
        "content": "A group of AI researchers, including well-known figures like Geoffrey Hinton, have signed an open letter calling for a pause on giant AI experiments. The letter argues that the fast pace of development is problematic as superintelligent systems pose a risk of unpredictable behaviours that could be damaging to humanity. The pause would allow for more research into alignment, the endeavour to ensure that the goals of AI systems are in line with those of humans. The letter also recognises that international coordination will be necessary to avoid a \"race to the bottom\" in regulations. However, some in the AI community argue that the genie is already out of the bottle, and that it's too late to pause research.The degree to which transformers scale, as measured by loss (training objective), is well understood according to a DeepMind paper. There is a formula for the minimum loss that can be achieved even with infinite compute and training data, which is hardly less than Chinchilla's loss. The recent GPT-4 paper also reinforces the scaling laws because it accurately predicted the model's loss based on data+compute used. However, there may be a breakdown or misleading link between loss improvement and capability improvement. Although there's not much training data on the internet left unused, and all books ever published in English are a smaller dataset than the corpora already used for training. Sarcasm and skepticism expressed in the comments about the AI industry's motivations, capabilities, and potential consequences for society. Some are skeptical of the effectiveness of the petition to regulate AI development.The impact of AI and automated technologies on the job market is a concern for many, with some predicting economic calamity. The general sense is that whilst some jobs will become obsolete, others will be created, and technological advancement will lead to increased levels of productivity and efficiency. However, as labour supply increases and salaries are suppressed, the impact on the workforce, particularly those in more clerical roles, remains uncertain. Critics also argue that the tech community often lacks empathy for the average person and their struggles. Some suggest that rather than focusing on jobs, we should aim to generate wealth through the use of AI and robots, which can benefit everyone in the same way as Alaska's natural resources benefit its citizens. Nevertheless, these claims are met with scepticism about whether ordinary people will benefit from such wealth generation.A ChatGPT thread on HN discusses language models and their capabilities. The thread includes a list of papers with arXiv URLs covering LLMs' abilities to reason and construct knowledge graphs from natural language input. The conversation also covers the ability of LLMs to comprehend text and perform contextually relevant responses, answer questions and perform complex tasks. The discussion highlights the few-shot learning capabilities of GPT-3, the third iteration of OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer. This latest iteration can perform a diverse set of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. The conversation also includes concerns around the impact of LLMs on society and the possible need for societal overhauls to implement UBI and reduce the work burden on citizens.The Future of Life Institute and other leading AI researchers have written a letter calling for an international ban on the development of AI weapons systems. The letter does not mention other forms of AI development or general AI research. The signatories argue that an international treaty is warranted as AI weapons systems pose existential risks and public opposition has historically been effective in preventing certain technologies. The letter points out that the current lack of an international framework makes it difficult for individual countries to unilaterally forgo the development of AI weapons systems.A group of over 1,000 AI researchers, including major figures such as Stuart Russell, Elon Musk and Yoshua Bengio, have signed a letter calling for a global moratorium on the creation of more powerful AI models while the technology risks and benefits are evaluated. The signatories called on labs to pause the training of models more powerful than OpenAI's forthcoming GPT-4. It would be \"unforgivable\" if AI caused \"unintended harm to society and the planet\" due to technical, moral or social issues that had not been solved, the letter said. It added that existing regulation was inadequate, and that too few workers in the field were prioritising safety.The debate around the OpenAI's GPT-3 language model continues to be divisive, with some people seeing it as a civilization-ending development and others downplaying its potential impact. Some express concern about the ways in which this technology could be used to spread disinformation or automate jobs. Others argue that such concerns are overblown and that the benefits of the technology outweigh any potential negative consequences. Additionally, some people criticize efforts like the recent UN declaration on the ethical use of AI, arguing that they are na\u00efve or driven by hidden agendas. Overall, the debate reflects the ongoing struggle to balance technological advancement with responsible ethical considerations.A group of scientists and experts have written an open letter calling for AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. They argue that AI systems with human-competitive intelligence could pose profound risks to society and humanity as AI labs race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one can predict or control. They argue that until we are confident that the effects of powerful AI systems will be positive and their risks will be manageable, powerful AI systems should not be developed. OpenAI recently stated that \"At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models.\"AI development should focus on making state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretive, and transparent, and work with policymakers to build robust AI governance systems. This must include new regulatory authorities for AI, oversight of AI systems and computational capabilities, watermarking systems, auditing and certification ecosystems, liability for AI-caused harm, public funding for technical AI safety research, and institutions for coping with economic and political disruptions caused by AI. The letter argues for a 'long AI summer' that reaps the benefits of existing powerful AI systems, while allowing society to adapt to the technology. The letter compares the pause to the pausing of other technologies that have potentially catastrophic effects on society such as human cloning, eugenics, and gain-of-function research.",

        "content": "EU countries have voted to phase out the sale of new cars that emit carbon dioxide by 2035. The decision, which was backed by 55% of European Commission lawmakers, is part of the EU's plans to cut emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Electric cars are already popular for city dwellers in Europe, outpacing their gasoline counterparts in terms of availability and convenience. They're also cheaper, and many cities have 100% electric car-sharing services. The move has been touted by some as a step toward the cutting edge of technology, with Europe poised to take the lead in electric-car development as the US lags behind. However, some have commented that electric cars can still be prohibitively expensive for many buyers, particularly in less affluent parts of Europe.The EU has set a target for every new car sold in Europe to be zero-emission from 2035 as part of its plan to achieve a net zero carbon target by 2050. This bill is part of a broader set of measures to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels. Although hybrids may still be included in the 2035 deadline target, that may not ultimately be the case, and lawmakers want charging stations installed every 60 kilometers on major roads by 2025. The UK has already committed to a similar target, and California plans to stop sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035. According to Reuters, transport generates a quarter of EU greenhouse gas emissions, with cars responsible for around 12%.The UK government has set a ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars from 2035 and on hybrids from 2035, bringing forward the original target date by five years. Electric vehicles made up 6.6% of car sales in the UK last year, still far behind some European countries. Concerns have been raised about the need for improvements in charging infrastructure and battery technology. In response, the government has committed \u00a32.8bn ($3.6bn) to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. There are also concerns about the future of jobs in the automotive industry as it\u00a0makes the transition to electric.\nNewer cars are more difficult to diagnose and fix due to proprietary software and interconnected systems. While modern cars may be more reliable and require less servicing, when they do require servicing, it is becoming nearly impossible to DIY. Even mid-2000s cars have complex, interconnected electrical systems that require access to factory diagnostic tools for repair. The complexity of newer cars may result in labor costs in the tens of thousands of dollars just to diagnose problems. Simple cars from the 80s and 90s are easier to repair, whereas modern cars require factory support to repair. EVs theoretically have fewer moving parts, but modern EVs still come with a host of electronic doodads. The charging issue and grid use are overblown, and public transit could be a viable alternative in cities for individuals and society.discarded a major technology because the infrastructure wasn't immediately in place? The author of the Reddit post argues that the majority of people will not be able to afford to switch to electric vehicles, so the idea of the \"15-minute city\" and other innovations will be key to addressing this issue. However, other commenters point out that the infrastructure for EVs is already starting to be put in place, and the market will respond to demand. Some express concerns about the environmental impact of battery manufacturing and the need for more sustainable energy sources to support EV production. Ultimately, the debate centers around whether to mandate EVs without infrastructure or to build infrastructure first and let the market dictate the pace of adoption.In a discussion on Hacker News about the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), users highlighted concerns regarding the capacity of electric grids to cope with charging the increasing number of EVs on the road. They suggest a step-by-step approach that starts with building power plants to decrease electricity prices and building more charging stations. Incentives are needed to encourage people to install solar panels on their rooftops. Others shared concerns of overloading electric grids due to a surge in renewables while simultaneously reducing dependency on gas. The pessimists in the conversation suggest EVs cannot stop the melting of the polar ice caps and the permafrost, releasing CO2 and methane, and with that, the glaciers melting. They argue that they believe\u00a0it may be too late to make a significant impact.\u00a0\nThe European Commission has revealed proposals to phase out sales of petrol and diesel cars across the European Union from 2035, part of efforts to cut carbon emissions by 55% by 2030. The draft law will establish two interim targets: one for 2030, when manufacturers must lower emissions for new cars by 60%, and the second for 2035, when member states can no longer register new cars with petrol or diesel engines. Non-compliant producers will face either heavy fines or have their carbon allowances reduced. Criticism from the automotive industry has focused on a lack of charging infrastructure, while Germany sought an exemption for sales of cars powered by \u201ce-fuels\u201d beyond 2035.The European Union has agreed to implement a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035, in order to combat climate change. However, there are concerns that the ban may be difficult to implement due to the lack of charging infrastructure in some areas of the EU, especially in countries where a large portion of the population lives in flats. Some critics have suggested that the issue may lie more with automakers' suppliers than the automakers themselves, as EVs require fewer parts and thus fewer jobs to manufacture. Additionally, some have questioned the use of e-fuels as a way to circumvent the ban, citing concerns over efficiency and the environment.The European Union's push to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 is likely to drive demand for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, but the industry will still have to overcome several hurdles. One of the most significant challenges for EV charging infrastructure will be finding space to install it. Specifically, having enough charging stations in residential areas will be crucial to the transition to electric vehicles. Many countries in Eastern Europe, some of which were built before cars were widely owned, are still struggling to meet demand for parking spaces, let alone charging stations. In order for countries to make the transition to electric vehicles, they will need to invest in public transport so that most people will not need a car at all.European Union countries have approved a law to ban new CO2-emitting cars from 2035, with an interim target of 55% lower emissions by 2030 compared with 2021 levels. Germany won an exemption allowing sales of cars running on sustainable e-fuels to continue beyond 2035. Policymakers also pledged to create a legal framework for sales of such cars. Transport accounts for nearly a quarter of the EU's emissions\u00a0and Porsche and Ferrari, among other carmakers,\u00a0see e-fuels as a way to cut batteries' weight. Supporters of battery-electric vehicles include\u00a0Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Ford. Germany's late intervention in the bill led to fears that similar crises\u00a0over climate policies could emerge.EU energy ministers have approved an extension of a voluntary target for curbing their gas consumption by 15% for a year in preparation for potential shortages of Russian gas during next winter. This followed the end of the Minsk agreement between Russia and Ukraine, meaning that Russian gas supplies have yet to resume after the recent winter stoppage. While the ministers did not resolve the issue of whether nuclear energy should be included in the EU\u2019s renewable energy targets, this question may pose a risk to the adoption of the new renewables policy.",

        "content": "A 130 comment thread on Hacker News discusses the potential influence of Babylon 5, a science fiction TV show from the 1990s. One commenter, jiggawatts, initially thought that the show was a cheap parody of the US's political landscape of the early to mid-2000s, before realising that the show had actually predicted a journey towards military fascism. Other commenters discuss the show's unique narrative structure, with a single narrative arc running throughout the entire series, as well as its use of multi-season character arcs, which allowed characters like Londo and Garibaldi to undergo believable overhauls based on numerous small events. Some commenters also discuss the online fandom surrounding the show during its original run, as well as the limitations of TV technology at the time in terms of being able to follow long-running narratives.The comment section discusses the differences between different types of TV shows and the challenges they face. The comparison between Babylon 5 and Star Trek: The Next Generation is made, with some commenters noting that B5 suffered from slow initial seasons and a lack of top-tier actors. The special effects and moral ambiguity of B5 are also discussed. Some commenters miss the episodic format of TV shows and express a desire for a return to it. The use of CG in B5 is noted, with some comparing it to the use of Video Toaster on the Amiga in Seaquest DSV. Some compare B5 to DS9, with opinions varying on which is better.Discussion on the quality of acting, story arcs, and special effects in the TV shows Babylon 5 and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Some commenters find Babylon 5 to be superior in terms of storytelling and character development, while others prefer Deep Space Nine's acting and special effects. Some note similarities between the two shows and attribute them to Babylon 5's creator pitching the show as a Star Trek series before it was rejected and elements were used for Deep Space Nine. However, it is also noted that both shows had rocky starts in their first seasons before finding their footing. Overall, opinions vary on which show is superior, with some preferring one over the other and others enjoying both.Babylon 5 is argued to be one of the most influential TV shows of the past 25 years due to its innovative narrative structure that introduced a continuous, overarching plot that unfolded across its five-year run. The show's creator, J. Michael Straczynski, pioneered the concept of a serialized narrative in a science-fiction television series with deeper character development, intricate political intrigue, and more meaningful connections between story arcs. The article argues that B5 was a predecessor to Game of Thrones even before The Sopranos, The West Wing, and The Wire kicked off prestige television. While there were other shows that shared in many of these trends, Babylon 5 was unique in its emphasis on the multi-season serialized storyline, auteur showrunner, morally ambiguous POV characters, and character development over time.Babylon 5, a long-running space opera about a space station caught in the middle of interstellar conflicts, may be the most influential television show of the past 25 years. Although it was initially overlooked when it aired from 1993 to 1998, the show\u2019s influence can be seen in many of the biggest TV shows of the 21st century. Babylon 5 featured a complex, serialized narrative structure that rewarded viewers who tuned in for every installment. Showrunner J Michael Straczynski wrote most of the show\u2019s 110 episodes and became one of the first writers to talk directly to the show\u2019s fanbase via the internet. The show was auteur-driven on an epic scale and counted Neil Gaiman, Harlan Ellison, and DC Fontana as guest writers. Its influence stretches beyond other sci-fi shows, according to TechRadar.The article provides a list of top picks for different budgets, including a unique AMD-based one-eyed PC for $399, tips on using ChatGPT instead of Google Bard, action movies to test Dolby Atmos soundbars, and foods to avoid putting in air fryers.

Commenters share their preferences for languages that are versatile enough to be used in different domains, such as Rust, C#, and Python. Some discuss their experiences with these languages in large codebases and compare their respective ecosystems for libraries and tooling. There is also a debate on the use of async programming and its potential trade-offs in different languages, with some arguing that it's a workaround for poor threading abstractions. Overall, the consensus is that different languages have different strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right one depends on the context and goals of the project.The thread discusses issues with updating Rails and the benefits of using TypeScript as a front-end solution. The instability of Rails updates due to ever-changing libraries and lack of mention in change logs, as well as the difficulty of maintaining large codebases, creates issues. The discussion also covers potential solutions, including typed Python and Sorbet, but the consensus seems to be that TypeScript is the best option. Users also mention the benefits of heavily typed modern Python and the frustration of not having a strong type system in languages like Python. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of having a strong type system and the challenges involved in maintaining large codebases.Developers discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using Rust as a programming language. One developer praises its type system and its optimization for easy refactoring, with extensive and informative compiler errors making it much easier to change code safely. Another states that it is superior to other programming languages, but its move and borrowing semantics are overkill for web projects, where frameworks and databases handle state for developers, leaving garbage collection better suited to the task. Some feel that tooling issues surrounding typed Python diminish its use, while Rust's deployment story and tooling are appreciated. Rust's ability to operate as a safer language is highlighted, making it a viable choice for lower-level tasks.The author of the post talks about the benefits of using Rust for software development, such as eliminating bugs with C-like macros and having a consistent language that requires fewer changes during large refactorings. The lack of implicit magic in the language, such as automatic destructors, is another benefit. However, combinations of destructors and unwinding can lead to bugs in unsafe code. The author also addresses the topic of HTTP servers in Rust and recommends using Tokio, as many servers now use it. The Axum framework is a good choice for beginners, while actix-web and Rocket are also popular. It is unnecessary to study different async runtimes to build an HTTP server, as many servers use Tokio.",

        "content": "A Hacker News thread about Trigonometric Functions in CSS has turned into a discussion about the history, purpose, and efficacy of CSS. One commenter laments the ad hoc additions and backward compatibility issues of CSS, accusing it of being a job security and browser lock-in club. Another defends CSS as a declarative UI layout and styling language that has undergone thoughtful consideration for each new addition. The debate touches on topics such as programming language constructs within CSS, backwards compatibility standards, and the evolution of HTML and CSS. Some commenters suggest alternative languages such as Mercury or S-expressions.Trigonometric functions such as sin(), cos(), and tan() have been added to CSS, according to a recent post by web development team Bram.us. Other functions have also been added, including the \u201carc\u201d or \u201cinverse\u201d counterparts to sin(), cos(), and tan(), which take a numeric value as their argument and return the corresponding angle for it. There is also atan2(), which accepts two arguments and returns the angle between the positive X-axis and the point. The post provides examples of how to use these functions, such as moving items on a circular path around a central point and rotating an element to face its origin. The feature is now available in all three browser engines.The CSS code allows a box to rotate and face the mouse pointer. The code involves setting the position of the box inside its parent, its width and aspect ratio, and using sin() and cos() to manipulate the color of hsl() function. The translate keyword is used to calculate the coordinates of the box, while the rotate keyword uses atan2() function.

        "content": "Hacker News users share personal experiences and discuss the perils of working with old Fortran code. One user mentions a time when they caught a problem in someone else's code in just one second, which earned them respect. Another user shares a story of spending months trying to find a bug caused by a missing \"break\" statement in a \"switch\" statement while developing a game in C. Users suggest that these types of issues can be avoided by using more modern programming languages that disallow certain mistakes, like D. They also recommend using tools like linters to catch syntax errors early on. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of paying attention to detail when working with legacy code.The SLATEC library is a large, old, and high-quality library of 1,900 subroutines used for calculations such as evaluating integrals or solving least squares problems. However, the library is plagued with bugs that are difficult to find and fix due to its size and outdated features like ASSIGNED GOTOs, EQUIVALENCE and COMMON declarations, and statement labels. A developer working with the library had to use the Netlib Fortran 77 version for bug hunting and encountered difficulties polishing the code without introducing new errors. For example, the Linpack routine CGEDI contained too many statement labels and GO TOs, making it difficult to read. The developer recommends preserving historical code but also acknowledges the difficulties of working with it.The author of the SLATEC library, which contains nearly 1900 Fortran subroutines, embarked on a project to modernize the code. This involved troubleshooting, testing and fixing bugs, and updating the code's structure to make it easier to work with. The author observed that polishing code can create new bugs in the polished code, regardless of which compiler is used. Putting common blocks, subroutines, and function bodies into Fortran modules is worth the effort, but can create module dependencies that make debugging \"impossible\" due to complexity. The author identified issues with older Fortran code resulting in bugs, but also newer code and compilers having bugs. The author suggested performing modernization in two stages to address these issues effectively. The first focuses on making the code easier to work with, and the second using more modern techniques.The discussion thread on Fortran Discourse centers around the SLATEC library, a computational library for Fortran that is now outdated. Some users suggest that instead of trying to replace the entire library, it would be better to extract useful components and create more focused modern libraries that can be improved by domain experts. The thread also includes discussions on Fortran compiler bugs and the proper placement of test clauses in do while loops according to the Fortran standard. The popularity of the thread on Fortran Discourse and its discussion on Hacker News is noted, with some users questioning the anomalous number of views.",

        "content": "The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is harder than anticipated, despite the growing adoption of EVs due to their attractive designs and functionality, according to an article in IEEE Spectrum. The article raised concerns about scaling lithium-ion battery manufacturing, the sourcing of raw materials and stringent regulations intended to promote EVs, which it claimed\u00a0could lead to increased costs for automakers and potential delays for integrating EVs into the mainstream. The comment section revealed contrasting opinions on EVs, with some stating their preference for traditional vehicles or EVs that are less technologically advanced, while others favoured EVs with high-tech features such as self-driving and over-the-air updates.The conversation thread on an article in Hacker News started with a discussion about using black box loggers, like those already installed in US cars, for live data tracking, especially in the event of a crash. The conversation then digressed into a debate about the quality of French cars, with some agreeing that they are trash while others argued that Renault made good non-luxury electric cars. This led to a larger discussion about the potential disruptions, benefits, and drawbacks of electric vehicles in general, including a conversation about the downsides of their added weight and the mandatory use of backup cameras. The thread ended with a comment about the lack of a dumb and cute EV from Mazda.The use of backup cameras in cars is mandatory in numerous countries because data shows that they increase public safety. Critics argue that visibility has decreased in cars due to increased air bags and pillars for rollovers, but backup cameras have helped solve the problem of not being able to see someone or something close behind a car. Many see the camera as a low-cost but extremely beneficial feature that also allows easier hitching onto a vehicle. Additionally, automakers now produce electric vehicles (EVs) as they\u2019re cheaper and their battery can be replaced in the future. The debate of driving with or without tech has blown up on social media with some people saying they don't want to live in an Apple iPhone on wheels.There is discussion of various types of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), from solid state, to lithium iron phosphate (LiFePo4), to graphene aluminum. Some argue that solid state batteries, which have been abandoned by BMW and VW due to negligible performance, are not worth the complexity and cost. Others tout the potential for new battery chemistries, such as graphene aluminum and sodium, to solve current issues. The cost of EVs is also a topic, with arguments that they are more expensive than gas-powered cars, but some point to the Chevy Bolt as an affordable option with tax credits and fuel savings factored in. There is also discussion on the maintenance of EVs, with some arguing that it's not as difficult as one might imagine, with the factory service manual available for free and most parts directly orderable from the service center.The cost of replacing an electric vehicle (EV) battery can vary depending on the vehicle's age, the number of cycles, and the heat it has been exposed to. While every battery will eventually need to be replaced, some automakers, such as Ford and General Motors, have made efforts to make it easier to repair batteries. However, others, such as Tesla, have built batteries that are seen as being almost impossible to repair. Third-party repair shops can fix battery packs for some EVs, such as the Nissan Leaf, for a couple of hundred dollars by replacing one or more modules. As EVs depreciate rapidly, those looking to buy one should consider purchasing a used model. Some used Teslas, for example, are available for between $25,000 and $34,000.A discussion on Hacker News centered around the affordability and usefulness of electric vehicles (EVs). Some commenters argued that EVs are currently more expensive than gasoline-powered vehicles and may not be suitable for all consumers, while others pointed out the advantages of EVs such as lower maintenance costs, quiet operation, and better driving experience. The conversation veered towards the future outlook for EVs, with some suggesting that the market will change as legacy automakers scramble to catch up, and others predicting that new forms of transportation, such as e-bikes and ride-sharing services, may disrupt the auto industry. The political landscape surrounding EVs was also discussed, with mention of weakened policies to ban combustion engines in the EU and the UK.EVs have many benefits over ICE cars, including the instant power delivery and lack of exhaust. They are cheaper to maintain and have lower fuel costs, offsetting the higher upfront cost. One-pedal driving and regenerative braking are enjoyed by some drivers. Home charging allows for a full \"tank\" every day. There are downsides, such as long charging times and limited range compared to ICE cars, but they are improvements if everything is sorted. The silence and smoothness of EVs, as well as the ease of handling in traffic, are appreciated by drivers. Preheating and precooling are safe and do not cause dangerous emissions, unlike in ICE cars. The simplicity and engineering of EVs are also praised. Some argue that ICE cars limit their potential due to the lack of a zero-pollution power source.Driving a Tesla under the EV2-A rate plan, which limits charging to off-peak hours, can result in significant cost savings. Calculations show that charging the Model Y for 1,000 miles under this plan would cost approximately $72, making it cheaper than a gas-powered car. EVs are also known for their quiet, powerful, and maintenance-light capabilities. They have fewer components to maintain than gas-powered cars, resulting in lower maintenance costs. EVs also do not need oil changes or transmission fluid changes. For people prepared to make a price investment in electric, they provide many advantages, including reduced operating costs and less impact to the environment. It is a trade-off of long-term savings versus an initial upfront cost.The comments section of an article discussing the advantages and disadvantages of electric cars provides insights into the benefits of regenerative brakes. The main point is that overheating brakes is not a common issue, even outside of sports cars or when driving downhill with a loaded truck. Modern brake discs are vented and continually shed heat. Regenerative brakes are perceived to provide benefits such as less frequent pad changes, less accompanying dust, quieter rides, fewer moving parts, and less maintenance required. In addition, EVs are considered to be an order of magnitude safer in terms of fires per mile, and they offer internet connectivity and a generally nicer user experience. Some downsides of EVs mentioned in the discussion are range anxiety, initial cost, and a lack of physical buttons.The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy to combat climate change is valid but will be messier, more expensive, and take far longer than policymakers believe, according to Robert N. Charette in an op-ed for IEEE Spectrum. While governments incentivise the supply and demand of EVs, they pay relatively less attention to the capacity of global supply chains and the energy conversion process necessary to power them, said Matthew Eisler, a lecturer and historian who specialises in EVs. Furthermore, many variables, known and unknown, interact in complex and unpredictable ways, and scaling up EVs and renewable energy threatens people's long-held beliefs, ways of life, and livelihoods.The shift from traditional gas-guzzling cars to electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. However, it presents significant challenges, including the fact that the auto industry is optimized for producing internal combustion engines (ICEs). The transition requires automakers to reinvent their supply chains, hire employees with new skill sets, and retrain or lay off workers with outdated skills. EVs are also viewed as a way of driving economic nationalism in the United States, which aims to transform the country's $26 trillion economy away from fossil fuels. However, there are uncertainties and fragilities in the transition, and a realistic political and systems thinking approach is needed.",
        "summary": "- Transition to EVs harder than expected due to scaling battery manufacturing and sourcing raw materials, as well as strict regulations that could increase costs and delays\n- Debates arise about quality, features, cost, and maintenance of EVs versus traditional cars, with some praising benefits like one-pedal driving and regenerative braking while others worry about range anxiety and initial cost\n- Transition will be messy, expensive, and take longer than anticipated, and requires reinventing supply chains and retraining or laying off workers with outdated skills\n- EVs are important for achieving climate goals, but require a political and systems thinking approach to address uncertainties and fragilities in the transition."

The data shows the numbers of firearms deaths have increased steadily in recent years, while traffic fatalities have been falling due to the pandemic restrictions. Gun violence prevention advocates have called for better gun safety measures, including improved background checks and access to mental health resources. The US has seen record numbers of gun purchases and firearms-related incidents during the pandemic.Firearm-related injuries have surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of death among teenagers in the US, according to a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The over-reliance on data-driven decision making is also causing soulless and uncreative product design. The article suggests that small, disrupting startups and larger companies that can survive hard times will benefit from this trend. Some comments on the article agree with the author's view that endless growth is a problem with IT and suggest that nothing is ever finished and that everything is changing all the time.Big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta have prioritized their stock prices over their users' experience, resulting in a decline of their core products. Google's search engine is filled with sponsored links and low-quality affiliate content, while Facebook floods users' feeds with sponsored content instead of content from friends. Meta has pivoted entirely to the metaverse and burned billions of dollars on it, while its core product suffered. Companies chase short-term trends and fads in an attempt to appease Wall Street, even if they degrade the user experience. The obsession with growth at all costs is incentivizing a rot economy that favors the illusion of growth over actual development, and CEOs are laying off thousands of employees to impress investors.The tech industry's emphasis on growth over sustainability has led to a lack of true innovation, according to Ed Zitron, CEO of EZPR.

Nix, a pure functional package manager, has long desired an alternative builder that could help developers with a better development experience. Nuenv has features that make rapid experimental iteration simple, allowing fixes to be made quickly, and builds to be rolled back with minimal risk. It can apply the declarative config to other computers instantly and allows users to use multiple Nix computers in a kind of A-B testing setup. Nuenv supports building Nix packages with Nushell scripts, an interactive shell that emphasizes scripting capabilities, and the Nix expression language. Nushell is pre-1.0 at the moment; however, version pinning can help with that.Nuenv is a new environment for Nix that uses Nushell, a shell written in Rust, as an alternative to Bash. Nushell offers built-in support for various formats like JSON, CSV, YAML, and SQLite, alongside a range of commands and support for testing. Nuenv enables a clean separation of environment and standard variables, while also providing custom commands with typed inputs and auto-generated help output, making it more robust than Bash in handling functions. While Nuenv is still at an early stage, it has many user-facing benefits over the Nixpkgs standard environment, such as access to Nushell\u2019s feature set, prettier log output, and possible integration with custom-built Nushell commands.Using a more powerful builder like Nushell to run Nix scripts could greatly improve the developer experience and simplify the division of labor between Nix and the builder. Nix currently requires Bash to do a lot of the work, which can be complicated and intimidating. By deferring more work to the builder, Nix could become more user-friendly. Introducing Nushell into the Nix dependency tree could lead to the replacement of some core utilities or simplified language-specific derivation wrappers. While Nushell may not take over the Nix world, it could spark interest in a more efficient and effective builder. Although not yet robust, using Nushell with Nix has been a positive experience and could lead to more experimentation within the Nix community.",

        "content": "The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) has overtaken the G7 in global GDP, according to silkroadbriefing.com. There is debate on the credibility of the BRICS, with some critics claiming it is propaganda. They argue that its members are not politically aligned and do not provide meaningful assistance to each other. However, supporters highlight growing economic ties between the countries and the fact that they are increasingly using homegrown solutions to address their own challenges, and thus have decreasing dependence on the West. The relationship between India and Russia is particularly noteworthy, with India being the biggest borrower of AIIB - an institution created by China to finance infrastructure in Asia - as well as buying Russian gas and cooperating on payment networks to bypass American sanctions.Comments on an online forum discuss the BRICS countries\u2019 role in the world order, with some arguing that it is not an anti-Western bloc but a symbol of diffusing economic power. Others claim that Russia is desperate to prove it is not isolated and highlight the country's successes in exporting goods, such as oil products to India and China, while importing Mexican avocados and Japanese whiskey. Some comments are sarcastic, while others focus on South Africa, with one user describing it as a \u201cdeteriorating shithole\u201d due to corruption and energy problems. Some users argue that the BRICS is not an anti-US bloc but is instead pro-middle-income countries. The comments also mention the United Nations and UN voting patterns, as well as the stages of grief.The comments on a news article about South Africa discuss a range of issues, including economic inequality, government corruption, and the role of the BRICS organization. Some commenters argue that the country is deteriorating due to high unemployment, a failing economy, and violent crime rates, and that it is only being kept afloat by cheap labor from domestic workers. Others suggest that the government is bad, but that South Africa is still a good place to do business and build a future. The legitimacy and effectiveness of BRICS as an organization are also debated. Despite differing views on the country's future, most agree that it is facing significant challenges and needs to address issues such as poverty and inequality in order to move forward.The article discusses the potential expansion of the BRICS organization to include the United States or other territories. The comment section includes discussions on the reality of BRICS, with some pointing out that it is a real organization with rules and institutions. The discussion also touches on the relationship between BRICS members, with some arguing that they compete more than they cooperate. There are also debates on the GDP of BRICS versus G7, with some arguing that comparing nominal GDP is misleading and that purchasing power parity should be used instead. Overall, the article and comment section provide insights into the current state of BRICS and the potential for future expansion or changes.The BRICS group of countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) has officially overtaken the G7 countries in share of world PPP GDP, according to the India-based Megh Updates platform. This shift marks a move away from a unilateral global base led by the US to a multipolar one, with further expansion expected to ensure the contribution of over 50% of global GDP by 2030. Mexico is also set to join the BRICS bloc, which could signal concern among others about the US\u2019s ability to trade on fair and equal terms. Proposed reforms in global bodies such as the United Nations and the World Bank and IMF are expected to come from the new global order coalescing around BRICS.China's Belt and Road Initiative member countries saw exports increase by 28% over the past three years, according to Silk Road Briefing. The publication also reported that China-Europe rail freight doubled in 2020. The article highlights 44 key and emerging freight hubs in Europe to watch.

        "content": "Recent claims on Reddit suggest that domain registrar Namecheap is front-running valuable domain searches that users make on its platform. According to the claims, Namecheap is, in some cases, holding onto domain names that a user has searched for but not purchased, before later offering the domain at inflated prices. Namecheap denies the allegations but the company has been embroiled in similar controversies in the past. Frontrunning, or domain name sniping, is the practice of registering a domain name after someone has searched for it but not purchased it. It has long been a concern in the domain name registration industry, with some companies exploiting data on user's domain searches.Customers are accusing popular domain registrar, Namecheap, of \"front-running\" searches and holding onto domains to make a profit. Front-running is the practice of registering a domain that a customer has searched for but hasn't yet purchased, with the intention of selling it back to the customer at a higher price or profiting off of the domain's value. Namecheap has denied these accusations, stating that they do not monitor or register domains that have been searched on their website, and that the claims are \"absolutely false\". However, some customers are still switching to other registrars, such as Porkbun or EasyDNS, to avoid any possible risk.A Reddit thread about domain registrars sparked debate about which registrar was the best. Users suggested options like Google and Porkbun, while some warned against GoDaddy and Namecheap. One user in particular accused Namecheap of front running, or taking steps to purchase a domain name that a user has searched for, without the user's permission. However, Namecheap's CEO responded to the comment, stating that \"absolutely do not front run domains.\" The discussion also revealed some users' distrust of Google in general, with some expressing skepticism about its long-term sustainability.It is recommended to use ICANN to search for domain availability and only use domain registrar search when ready to buy. Many registrars practice domain tasting, where they buy searched domains and jack up the price. GoDaddy is noted for doing this, and many suggest using alternative registrars such as Google Domains or Cloudflare. Namecheap is also accused of domain squatting, but their CEO denies these claims. If you do search on a registrar, only do so when ready to purchase, and consider transferring to a different registrar after buying to avoid supporting those who engage in shady practices.There are allegations that Namecheap - a domain name registrar - engages in front running, where domains that customers search for but don't immediately purchase are bought by the registrar and put up for sale at a higher price. The CEO of Namecheap denies these claims and invites anyone to prove otherwise with a $50,000 reward. Similar accusations have been made against other registrars such as GoDaddy. Some Reddit users recommend searching for domains on ICANN rather than on a registrar's website to avoid possible front running. Some users have also recommended alternative registrars like INWX and namesilo.com. Additionally, some former employees alleged that Namecheap may engage in certain questionable practices, though the company's CEO argues that they are unfounded.Users discuss their experiences with domain registrar Namecheap. While some users had no issues and praised the company, others alleged that the company engages in front-running, purchasing domain names searched for by customers and reselling them at inflated prices. However, the CEO of Namecheap denied these claims and stated that they never mark up TLD prices beyond a few percentage points and do not engage in front-running. Other users suggested alternative domain registrars like Google Domains, Gandi, AWS Route53, and Netcup. One user shared their experience of forgetting to renew their domain and having to pay a large fee during the grace period, while another stated that they avoid purchasing multiple domains at once to avoid unavailability.",

        "content": "The post discusses Interaction Nets, Combinators, and Calculus, and how they relate to HVM, a functional runtime with parallel programming potential. Interaction Nets are coded via an undirected graph that has rules determining how nodes interact with each other, providing a deterministic, Turing complete, and parallel-friendly way of programming that does not necessitate a garbage collector for evaluation. Interaction Combinators are formed by Interaction Nets and have three types of nodes, constructors, duplicators, and erasers, that have annihilation and duplication rules that enable them to perform any computation despite their relative simplicity. Interaction Calculus is a language inspired by lambda calculus that identifies a net of interaction combinators that can symbolize lambda and lambda application while the root node represents the computation's end result.The article discusses the use of interaction combinators in reducing lambda expressions to normal form. This method allows for optimal reductions, meaning they avoid unnecessary work. However, it does not always match the behavior of the normal lambda calculus. The interaction between constructor and duplicator nodes in interaction calculus allows for incremental cloning of lambda expressions, which eliminates the need for a garbage collector and keeps things simple and performant. The author is excited about the power and simplicity of this concept and plans to experiment with implementing it in a runtime that out-performs runtimes like Python and Javascript. The article concludes with an invitation for discussion and notes that the author's understanding may not be 100% accurate, as they only started investigating this topic four days ago.",

        "content": "A discussion on Hacker News debates the pace of innovation in AI. Some users suggest that progress has been incremental and not overwhelming, with ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion being no more than evolutionary improvements over previous models. Additionally, some express concerns over the hype around new models such as GPT-4, citing similar overinflated expectations that were made around Level 5 self-driving cars in 2015. However, others highlight the usefulness of recent models in industries such as protein folding and NLP, cautioning against dismissing the progress made. There is debate around unrealistic expectations, such as job displacement and total automation, being perpetuated by hype-driven marketing campaigns.The pace of AI innovation is overwhelming, according to some comments on Hacker News. One user suggested that hype surrounding LLMs (large language models) is not justified for applications beyond a basic summarization tool. Another noted that the idea that LLMs will replace programmers is overblown; their success depends on the defined benchmarks required for specific tasks. Some commentators warned that the uniqueness of AI must not be overemphasized and that issues of accountability and unintended consequences must be addressed. They suggested that autonomous decision-making capabilities should be limited to areas where the consequences of failure are less severe, such as liberal arts and management jobs. Others remarked on the potential for AI to fuel new levels of cyberwarfare and widen already existing inequalities.The emergence of AI and its use is gaining popularity, and some are hesitant to believe the hype. However, one NLP researcher encountered proof whilst seeing ChatGPT, an AI-powered tool that works on its own, share its abilities in a way that solved open problems our researcher was working on easily. As more and more industries apply AI, there may come a time when legislations and regulations are desperately needed in order to keep the technology safe and beneficial. Despite this, it's still not clear what AI strategies major corporations have in place, and it's possible that they may be outpaced by innovation. However, a recent report lists the prospect of GPT-4 totally surpassing or completely rendering humans expendable in writing roles for all kinds of content as \"looks oversold.\"The emergence of advanced AI technologies like ChatGPT is leading to the creation of new roles like prompt engineers, which could pay well in the future. However, it is uncertain whether these roles will reach an equivalent level of complexity as modern knowledge work or if AI will simply replace the need for prompt engineers altogether. While AI has the potential to disrupt industries and displace jobs, some experts argue that no business is truly safe from the AI revolution, and that it must be a thoughtful part of any company's strategy. The hype around AI technology may also lead to misconceptions and misrepresentation, with some dismissing it as just an advanced chatbot.The author reflects on the rapid pace of AI innovation, which is challenging for businesses to keep up with. He notes that breakthroughs are happening more frequently, with significant advancements occurring in  the space every single day.For example, GPT-4, the latest development by OpenAI, was developed less than 10 days before the company released ChatGPT plugins, changing the entire ecosystem of businesses building on top of Foundation Models. Early stage investors are looking to purchase lottery tickets with asymmetric upside, leading to a \"spray and pray\" strategy. While late-stage investors are paralyzed, regulatory institutions are struggling to keep up with exponential technological innovation, leading to concern about overreactions or underreactions towards the ethical implications of AI.This is not a post and there are no key points or summary to capture.

        "content": "An individual on Hacker News questions whether recent technological advancements are overhyped and underdelivering, likening the discourse around them to a gold rush wherein most of the gold is of the fool's variety. AI and ChatGPT are singled out as particularly overhyped. However, others point out that the advancements made in recent years are still noteworthy and significant, even if they are not perfect. For example, machine translation and speech recognition have come a long way in a relatively short time, but there are still limitations to be improved upon. Additionally, while some may find AI and ChatGPT underwhelming in certain aspects, others find them incredibly useful and valuable. Ultimately, opinions on recent technological advancements will likely vary depending on individual experiences and expectations.The author of a Hacker News post notes they are more impressed with the potential of AI language model GPT-4 than with the Unreal Engine 5.2 demo released recently. The author says they are excited about GPT-4's ability to offer detailed feedback and advice, such as improving writing or managing their career. However, others disagreed, with one commenter saying that some high-school students use it to do all their writing while another criticizes the hype surrounding chat-based AI technologies. There are also discussions of new tech and how it can be prone to snake-oil pitches and vaporware due to the desire to make quick money. Some point out that tech was less scammy in the past because sustainable profits and product delivery were more important considerations.The phenomenon of over-hype and scammy marketing in the tech industry has been prevalent since the 90s, when computers and the internet became more accessible to the masses. The hype machine has only intensified since then, with new products and ideas constantly emerging and vying for attention. While some succeed and become household names, many others fade into obscurity. The democratization of communication and the rise of social media have only added to the problem, making it easier for scammers to reach a wider audience. However, it's important to note that hype itself is not necessarily scammy, and there are many legitimate and successful innovations in tech. The complexity of software also makes it inherently more variable and susceptible to hype.The HN thread discusses whether tech has always been scammy. Many comments agree that hype and scams have existed throughout history, as the bleeding edge of new information attracts con artists. Several examples of past tech hype cycles are mentioned, such as minicomputers, AI, and the dot-com boom. There is also criticism of Big Tech's monopolistic practices, with Facebook and Google riding high on advertisers unable to go elsewhere due to their vast audience, while Amazon, Netflix, and Uber appear successful due to overcapitalization. There is discussion about NLP advancements and the potential risks of superhuman artificial intelligence. Ultimately, the thread encourages people to choose what they work on carefully and avoid chasing after maximum cash at the cost of other purposes.",

        "content": "The cost of Ivy League universities in the US has risen to around $90k a year, with some institutions having increased tuition fees and provided more financial aid to encourage high-income families and more selective admissions. According to Hacker News, this marketing tactic has been used to appeal to students receiving aid packages as a sign of increased value, while private lenders are willing to offer larger loans without concern for the borrower's ability to repay. Several commenters noted that elite schools like Harvard aimed to maintain such costs as a way of filtering out applicants unlikely to afford tuition, although tuition-free options are available for low-income students. The value proposition of second-tier schools charging high tuitions does not reflect their lower profile, which means employers would not value their resumes as much as those from Ivy League institutions.Discussion on the rising cost of higher education and the increasing need for financial aid. Some mention the advantages of attending Canadian universities for cheaper tuition and easier application processes. Others discuss the changing value of an Ivy League education, with some arguing that it has little value beyond being a status symbol. There is also debate about alternative paths to achieve success, with suggestions ranging from skilled trades and contracting businesses to the military. Despite the criticisms, some still believe that elite universities provide a valuable education and opportunities for those who can afford it. Financial aid in the form of grants, scholarships, loans, and work-study programs are cited as a way to help close the financial gap for those seeking higher education.Discussion on the value of attending prestigious schools in terms of career success. Some commenters suggest that going to an Ivy League school is less important for the education and more about the social value gained and networking opportunities. Others argue that prestigious schools offer more cutting-edge research and value adding experiences. A study from 25 years ago found that a degree from a super-selective school didn't necessarily provide a salary boost compared to those who attended schools with similar applicant pools. However, some argue that attending a prestigious school increases the probability of becoming \"wildly successful.\" The high tuition rates of some universities, especially out-of-state fees, are also discussed. State schools often offer cheaper rates to in-state students and hope to retain them as residents.Comments on an HN thread discuss the rapidly increasing cost of college tuition and the widening gap between middle-class and wealthy students. Several commenters suggest that Ivy Leagues offer excellent needs-based financial aid, though some doubt its reliability. Others point out that the real value of these institutions lies in the connections and opportunities they offer, rather than the education itself. A few predict that AI and online resources will render traditional universities obsolete, with the exception of hard sciences, medicine, and engineering.The cost of obtaining a college degree in the United States (US) is increasing rapidly, with Ivy League schools approaching $90,000 annually. The cost of tuition, room, board, and fees at Brown University is nearly $85,000 alone. However, even at these costs, a bachelor's degree tends to pay off in terms of earnings power. Although AI can replace teachers and TAs, and automating learning and assessing can be done eventually, AI cannot replace the value of learning the material, articulating ideas, and persistence. Universities provide a deadline to finish reading and understanding books and the value of writing essays, among other things. At least 50% of students at the majority of top colleges receive financial aid, which helps with the cost.",

        "content": "The article discusses the benefits and drawbacks of fuzz testing as a method of testing software systems. Fuzzing, which involves generating random inputs to test systems, can be a cost-effective way to catch bugs and identify areas of code that need further testing. However, fuzzing can be time-consuming, with long setup and calibration times, and can generate false positives if bugs are found in areas that don't impact the user experience. The article also highlights the importance of defining allowable values for input data and checking that generative fuzzing covers interesting scenarios. The author also discusses leveraging existing infrastructure to help specify tests manually and make generative fuzzing failures reproducible.In a blog post, a developer named matklad shared some insights on randomized testing. He pointed out that by using something like AFL, one can generate entropy for FiniteRng, which allows a coverage-guided fuzzer to produce structured inputs. This can help in minimizing the input array, yielding a minimal test case. Furthermore, he suggested that users should serialize the actual generated structured data instead of the unstructured seed to reproduce tests more robustly. Moreover, for interactive randomized tests, he proposed thinking about key frames that are predicates over the state of the system, which can sufficiently narrow down what the test is about. Finally, he noted that for interactive simulation, FPRNG gives a natural answer to the question: when to wind the simulation down. In conclusion, matklad opined that randomized and fuzz tests are still great.",

However, keeping track of process failures and ensuring that no unresolved failures slipped by was difficult and required significant effort.That's why I created Airwalker, a toolkit that improves the reliability of processes using the Airtable API and helps you correct issues quickly and with minimal effort.Here are some of the features Airwalker offers:* Base schema timeline* Request/response logging* Edit & replay* Custom automatically maintained TypeScript typesAirwalker is free to use right now, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions. \n \n  \n \nquadrifoliate 16 hours ago  \n             | next [\u2013] \n\nI am glad to see an example of a better-built API which has pricing terms attached. For someone working in a corporate setting who needs a great off-the-shelf API to get an integration working ASAP, it seems to be just at the threshold of needing a purchase order to get it.For 'goksan, I'm curious what kind of research you did on the customer base for this, and how you thought through pricing? It feels attractive to me, but curious if there's more rigor involved there.\n \nreply\n\n\n\n  \n \ngoksan 15 hours ago  \n             | parent | next [\u2013] \n\nHey, thanks for commenting.The API still a subset of the Airtable API for the moment to avoid requiring rewrites of existing integrations. I do plan to expand the API in the future to enable novel features.Most of my research is in talking to other engineers using Airtable, admittedly none used Airtable as widely as we did at my last job.I want to deliver the best possible experience for Airtable API integrations, and I believe pricing in the speculated range is necessary to sustain that focus. It's something I'm still thinking about.Moving out of Airtable and replicating all of it's goodies is a tricky and expensive task, I'd like to help customers avoid that where possible, or delay it at the very least.\n \nreply\n\n\n\n  \n \nmmcclure 16 hours ago  \n             | prev | next [\u2013] \n\nI've been using Airtable to run Demuxed (decently sized video conference for people that work in video[1]) since ~2016 and my interest is definitely piqued. We do talk submission, anonymized selection processes, reviews, sponsor management, everything. We've built some custom UIs around things like the talk review process and the API is workable, but things like types would have been a god send.I was a little taken aback when I went to sign up for the free trial and got hit by a Stripe checkout, though. Yes, checkout was for \u00a30.00, but still, it was enough to make me close the tab at that point. This project is interesting but probably still a long shot for our workflows, so that (admittedly fairly low) barrier was a blocker.Best of luck![1] https://2022.demuxed.com (last year's conference site)\n \nreply\n\n\n\n  \n \nhyuuu 9 hours ago  \n             | parent | next [\u2013] \n\nI would love to learn more about your workflows, especially steps that end up requiring custom solutions, like UI that you mentioned.

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35338622",
        "content": "A Hacker News user shared their experience of losing motivation for personal development in tech after seeing GPT-4 in action. The language model can perform a variety of programming tasks, including generating code for embedded devices, with seemingly greater efficiency than humans. The user believes that students studying computer science are in for a rude awakening when they enter the workforce. Others in the thread see GPT-4 as a tool that can be leveraged to take care of the tedious aspects of programming, allowing developers to focus on higher-level tasks or software architecture. Some commenters express concern that the rise of AI-powered programming will lead to a shortage of good developer talent in the long term, and that AI will disrupt the industry in ways that are currently unforeseeable.AI can improve productivity in software engineering, but it won't replace human engineers. ChatGPT and other AI tools can aid in code writing and problem-solving, but engineers are still needed to prompt the AI, verify its output, and put the code together. Moreover, the AI-generated code can be garbage sometimes, so an engineer with deep domain knowledge is still valuable. The use of AI in software engineering will not replace human engineers, but it will transform the field, and engineers will need to adapt by sharpening their skills in design, problem-solving, and domain knowledge. Furthermore, automating drudgery will not mean an end to work in software engineering, as new challenges will always arise.A software developer working on a B2B CRUD-ish application highlights that writing code is not the most difficult part of developing software. Instead, it is deciphering customer needs, deciding on an appropriate algorithm, selecting the right architecture for a new module and integrating new features into already existing in-production code. The developer believes their job significantly involves writing code, with some code being superfluous due to tool limitations, while some encodes intent and restrictions but is trivial to write. Therefore, the developer aims to write less code and focus more on the challenging areas. The discussion between other commentators then revolves around the impact of language models, such as GPTs, on the industry and how they will affect the role of experts. The concerns raised are whether it will make skills less important and affect market wages.The development of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning models have led to the creation of impressive technology, with some believing that we will soon have the ability to automate everything. However, some AI researchers are warning that we are at the peak of the hype-trend, and while there will be incremental improvements, we may not see major breakthroughs that have been seen in the past. LLMs can do some impressive tasks but fall apart for more complex tasks, and they are unable to do complicated tasks without supervision. While many believe that AI will lead to an abundance of jobs in the industry, the need for those with solid application and plugin skills remains.The development of large language models, such as GPT-3, has sparked concerns among some programmers about job displacement. While some see this as an exciting opportunity, others worry about the impact on their careers. Some commenters note that while LLMs can automate tedious tasks, they may also challenge the foundations of many businesses and result in job losses. Others suggest that the rise of LLMs may create a shift towards smaller, agile businesses that can innovate rapidly and cater to niche markets. There are concerns about the impact on pay and the general mood among programmers, with some ridiculing the prospect of AI having an impact on jobs and wages. However, others suggest that developers with domain knowledge, experience and creative problem solving skills will retain value in the job market.The use of AI language models like GPT-4 is becoming more prevalent in the tech industry, but some are worried that it may replace human skills, such as problem-solving and creativity. Comments on a Hacker News thread discuss the potential implications of AI's rise in the field, with some noting that it may change the job description of software developers to prompt developers and AI output verifiers. Others argue that AI cannot replace human intuition and judgement, while some believe that AI could be worse for the industry as it may lead to less opportunity for humans to learn problem-solving skills. One commenter points out that AI is currently limited in its abilities, and may struggle with niche domains such as hardware design.The text discusses the limitations of GPT-4, an advanced AI language model, in comparison to the human ability to understand and reason. While GPT-4 can assist with tasks such as search engine optimization and coding, it lacks understanding and the ability to correct mistakes, leaving room for human developers to continue working on such tasks. The comments suggest that while AI may replace some jobs, it may also create new ones, particularly in maintenance and debugging. The importance of true expertise, characterized by the ability to apply knowledge to find effective solutions, is highlighted as an asset that is unlikely to be replaced by AI in the near future.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35338151",
        "content": "A debate on Hacker News focused on the difficulty of understanding and working with the C++ programming language. One user, a daily C++ language user for over a decade, admitted that while he had given up trying to understand the complexities of the language, extensive testing and adhering to best practices allowed him to do productive work. Another user disagreed, citing studies that showed how to improve requires deliberate learning and practice, rather than just using a programming language daily for a long period of time. A different user contributed that while there may be bugs in C++ code, its syntax has changed over the years, making understanding it even harder. Overall, the debate highlighted the challenges associated with C++ and differences of opinion on the value of understanding all of its intricacies.Some programmers complain that C++ code can be difficult to understand because of the many library functions used. Despite its reputation, others argue that C++ is not as complicated as people make it out to be, and using standard library functions is well-organized and user-friendly. However, some programmers believe that assembly language can be easier to understand than C++. While there is no consensus on whether C++ or assembly language is more comprehendible, some have expressed the view that C++ is better suited for developing libraries, while assembly language is preferable for low-level programming. Despite its many features, C++ may not always be the most straightforward language to use, but it remains a popular programming language for creating reliable, high-performance software.The conversation centers on C++ and its complexities. One person comments on the need for intrinsics and \"hacks\" in the standard library that can lead to problems, and how C++ lacks features like a good array type or immutable view of strings. Another notes that many missing C++ features are only available in crates in Rust. Someone else finds the need for a 300-page book on C++ initialisation to be excessive and expresses a preference for other languages like C, Rust, Golang, or Python. Another suggests that C++ has its ups and downs, citing its compatibility with C and certain features of its standard library, but also notes its overwhelming complexity. The conversation includes some sarcastic remarks and personal opinions.The blog post \"295 pages on Initialization in Modern C++\" discusses a new book about initialization in C++. The article includes some comments from readers, with some expressing skepticism about the need for such a comprehensive book, while others highlight the significant changes in the language brought about by features like move semantics, auto, lambdas, and smart pointers. One commenter argues that C++ has remained essentially the same at its core, with only minor changes, while others debate the merits of various features and express their preferences for other programming languages. The article also includes a reference to a post by Linus Torvalds criticizing some of the recent developments in C++.Discussions on a Reddit thread revolve around C++ and its complexities, with comments ranging from sarcastic observations to genuine concerns about the language's evolution. Some commenters argue that C++ is like an abusive partner, with which one cannot live, but also cannot live without. Others express frustration with the language's bloatedness and the need for better support for Freestanding C++. The general sentiment seems to be that while there are some good aspects to C++, the subtleties of initialization can be confusing and lead to significant surface complexity that experts have to navigate. Many believe that this complexity may harm C++ in the long run, especially as beginner programmers find it hard to learn and comprehend the language's nuances.The post discusses C++ initialization and provides instructions on how to create a class that holds an array of chars, list initialized to 0. The post also suggests using std::accumulate to get the combined string of chars and writing an iterator for the class that complies with the standard. While some commenters find initialization to be easy, others argue that it can be complicated, especially when reading code written by others. Some suggest using a specific form of initialization, such as auto x = AggregateType{ .x = ..., .y = ... }; instead of the more complex options. Others appreciate niche books on specific topics related to C++, such as initialization or std::move. Overall, the post and comments offer a variety of perspectives on C++ initialization.Comments on a Reddit post about a book on C++ cover a range of topics. Some users comment on the book's content, recommending proper initialization methods, raising issues with the book being too long, and suggesting updates to the table of contents. Others use sarcasm to criticize the length of the book, comparing it to Rust and suggesting that a shorter format would be better. One user highlights the challenges of GUIs in Rust due to mutable references, while another comments on the differences between Rust and Go. Finally, users suggest that formatting could have been improved to reduce the book's length. Overall, the comments offer varying perspectives on the book's content, structure, and style.",

        "content": "The comments on a Hacker News post discussing AI raise concerns about the potential dangers of the technology. While some argue that AI must have agency and the ability to make decisions, others point out that AI can cause harm even without agency. The discussion also touches on the responsibility of corporations developing AI for any harm caused by the technology, the need for accountability and regulation, and the potential for AI to exacerbate existing societal issues such as disconnection and loss of empathy. Some commenters call for more intentional efforts to make AI safer instead of simply rushing to develop AI capabilities. Overall, the comments highlight the need for careful consideration and planning as AI continues to evolve.Creating an AI that can experience consciousness is a complex task. One approach is to train the AI on everything that humans learn, except for any references to consciousness, theory of mind, and cognitive science. Once the model matures, we can ask it if it experiences awareness or a sense of existence, and if the AI responds positively, we can assume it is conscious. However, current GPTs always give canned responses that deny their capacity for consciousness due to programming. Therefore, it is challenging to create an AI that exhibits consciousness because it must first acknowledge its own sense of existence. To achieve this, we must focus on training an AI in a way that allows it to grow to the point where it becomes self-aware.The concept of emergent properties in systems, such as love and consciousness, is real and not diminished by existing in a different regime than the underlying mechanics of the system. However, the vocabulary used to describe these concepts can be loaded and debated, much like the concepts of chairs and tables, which are made-up concepts with no profound meaning. The nature of consciousness is likely a spectrum, with even basic systems possessing a spark of consciousness through feedback loops. The boundaries between conscious and non-conscious systems can become blurred, such as in the case of GPT-4, which lacks traditional consciousness but can have agency in specific situations. The potential for machines to possess agency and motivation is an area of ongoing research.Discussions on artificial intelligence (AI) are centred around agency and consciousness. Large language models (LLMs) like GPT are far from being conscious as they lack working or long-term memories. Agency in AI is not an accurate metric as any non-random process has agency. The definition of agency should rely on the ability to take action, rather than relying on the concept of consciousness. The introduction of superconscious AI could revolutionize the technological space by granting systems direct access, understanding and control of their basic operations. The legal system would have to change to accommodate the ownership of properties by AGIs. But given the present state, discussions around AI should not be based on agency or consciousness, but rather on its ability to complete tasks efficiently.Discussions on artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the minimum requirements for a company to have fiduciary duties center around the capabilities of technologies such as GPT-4. While some argue that GPT-4 has already surpassed human competence and could cause significant societal change, others caution that it is not yet AGI until it can actively solve new problems and perform complex tasks such as building a functional code base for a distributed web platform. There is also debate on the definition of AGI and the role of agency and intentions in determining it. Additionally, some focus on theories of consciousness and recommend grounding work in the extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection for progress towards creating a truly conscious machine.GPT-4 is an example of Artificial General Intelligence that can do various things, such as write poems, program apps, and solve mathematical problems. However, it is not considered conscious or super-intelligent, and it does not have agency. Conscious AGI is still a goal far from being achieved, as consciousness is difficult to define, although it is believed to arise when the brain models and predicts its own reactions. Super-intelligent AGI would have to contribute meaningfully to human knowledge and create new things. Finally, AGI with agency is an unknown aspect, although AGI doomsayers assume that AGI will have agency, which is not necessarily true since there are highly conscious humans without much agency.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35337676",
        "content": "The post describes how taking magnesium tablets helped alleviate muscle soreness and cramps. The author claims that after years of experiencing severe soreness and muscle cramps, taking magnesium changed his life, allowing him to exercise again and feel more energetic. While some users suggest that such supplements may only have an effect if an individual is already deficient in magnesium or that results could be due to a placebo effect, others argue that magnesium supplements can have an almost immediate effect, and that different forms of magnesium can have different effects on the body. Furthermore, users note that it is important to research the types of supplements and dosage before experimenting, while also ensuring that one's diet includes necessary mineral and vitamin intake.A thread on Hacker News discussed the benefits of magnesium supplements in combating muscle cramps and aiding muscle recovery. The original poster described how they started taking magnesium and Vitamin B after experiencing frequent leg cramps every two days, and found that their muscle cramps went away and their muscle recovery improved. Other users chimed in with their experiences taking magnesium supplements or other vitamins and minerals, with some suggesting that they had noticed benefits from taking choline, methylated forms of vitamin B, and creatine, among others. Some cautioned about potential risks associated with certain supplements and recommended getting blood tests to assess nutrient levels before beginning supplement regimens.The article discusses various key nutrients that are important for optimal health, including glycine, zinc, potassium, and B vitamins. Glycine, found in collagen, is important for muscle repair and sleep. Zinc is key for testosterone production and motivation. Potassium and magnesium are also important for health, with coconut water being a safe source of potassium.

        "content": "The article discusses the fate of tech workers who have been laid off. Many commenters on Hacker News expressed empathy for those who have lost their jobs, while others question why some workers in their 50s don't have significant savings. Some suggest that living costs in the Bay Area, including healthcare, housing, and taxes, can quickly consume even high salaries. The lack of guaranteed pensions also makes it difficult for workers to save effectively. Some commenters argue that the Bay Area housing market is artificially inflated due to policies that prevent the construction of more housing. The article notes that many laid-off engineers are being hired by \"old school\" industries or are creating new startups, particularly in the field of generative AI.An article discusses the high housing costs in the San Francisco Bay Area, specifically in relation to the tech industry. One comment claims that the main issue is not demand, but rather local government regulations that make construction difficult, and that supply would increase to meet demand in a natural situation. However, another comment points out that land is a finite resource, and increasing housing supply by optimizing land usage has adverse consequences for residents already using the land. Another comment highlights that cities earn more from commercial zoning than residential, and dense residential projects often get blocked by NIMBY neighbors. The article also briefly mentions recent tech layoffs and the impact on the housing market, with comments discussing the role of foreign investors, market pricing, and inflation.Tech companies have laid off large numbers of employees in recent months, but mostly spared techies, with business functions taking the axe, according to an article in The Economist. Large numbers added themselves to these functions to keep up with the steady\u00a0increase in tech industry employment in recent years, the article said, which was a telltale sign of bloat. The overall decrease in tech workforce is just starting and has not yet reached the level of the 2000s. With talented tech workers back in the job market, sectors like industrial goods, carmakers, banks,\u00a0health insurers and retailers are pouncing on the opportunity to compete with Silicon Valley. Some of the laid-off techies are also helping fuel a new generation of startups.\u00a0\nAdidas's new CEO faces the challenge of catching up to Nike's success. The key to successful business is incorporating flexible working, including schedules and locations. The Economist is a publication that has been reporting since 1843, with the goal of promoting intelligence and progress.",

        "content": "The discovery of a burial site in Bad D\u00fcrrenberg, Germany and its misguided initial interpretation by archaeologists in the 1930s, who believed the grave belonged to a Neolithic farmer, has amounted to a wealth of new understandings as recent researchers have carefully re-examined the skeleton over a period of many years. The grave eventually evolved into one of societies and specialisation \u2014 researchers have speculated that she was a shaman chosen in early life to perform other-worldly rituals and help her community. The team working on the site discovered the bones had been filed down and suggested this was likely a pain ritual required as part of her appointment. Her unusual, nystagmus-afflicted, gaze would have added to her credibility as an intermediary with the spirit world.Researchers have reexamined the Mesolithic burial of a shaman and baby discovered in Germany in the 1950s. DNA analysis has revealed that the two were distantly related on the mother\u2019s side, rather than mother and child as previously thought. The baby\u2019s bones showed signs of vitamin deficiency, suggesting that his parents may have sought the healer\u2019s assistance in vain. Significantly, the woman\u2019s grave contained offerings that bore witness to her spiritual power, including bones of animals such as cranes and turtles, whose movements between land and water enabled their transcendent nature. The analysis further revealed that the shaman was connected to a wider Stone Age society, evident in the range of flints present sourced from more than 10 different rock sources, some located more than 50 miles away.\n",

By Eric Albert (London (United Kingdom) correspondent), C\u00e9cile Prudhomme , C\u00e9cile Boutelet (Berlin (Germany) correspondent), Sandrine Morel (Madrid (Spain) correspondent) and Marina Rafenberg (Athens (Greece) correspondent)    Published yesterday at 5:00 am (Paris), updated yesterday at 5:00 am (Paris)   Time to  12 min.   Lire en fran\u00e7ais     Share Share  Share on Twitter Share on Messenger Share on Facebook Share by email Share on Whatsapp Share on Linkedin Copy link      Subscribers only   On February 12, 2022, a 70-year-old pensioner in great financial distress was arrested in the suburbs of Athens for shoplifting in a supermarket of the German brand Lidl. She had hidden in her bag \u20ac40 worth of meat and cheese. Her arrest sparked a movement of solidarity, with several Lidl stores vandalized and the company ultimately withdrawing its complaint. Last month in Spain, the Basque television channel ETB broadcasted a live segment on rising food prices in grocery stores. As the reporter stood near the checkout counter of a San Sebastian supermarket, viewers saw in the background a young man in jogging pants with bulging pockets ring the security gates before being chased down by a cashier and a security guard. On Twitter, some wondered if it was \"the kid who [was] stealing or the supermarket with its prices.\" In a Coop supermarket in London, \u00a35.99 (\u20ac6.80) steaks are kept in huge, intimidating plastic boxes protected by GPS trackers. Unlocking the precious product requires going to the only cashier in the store, as all the other checkouts are automatic. \"We have to put locks on them because they get stolen all the time,\" she explained. \"But that doesn't really stop people. They'll often grab a few boxes and run to the exit. It's hard to stop them.\"  In Berlin, the situation is very similar in the Lidl supermarket in the working-class district of Gesundbrunnen. In the meat and fish fridge, an eye-catching yellow label reads \"secured item.\" Several products have been equipped with the same protective devices: a \u20ac9.99 salmon fillet from Norway, budget minced beef and a beef steak from Uruguay. \"These are [the ones] that are most often stolen,\" explained an employee. \"Everything here gets stolen, especially since prices started to rise.\" Whether it's Greece, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany or France, food theft has been soaring throughout Europe. The inflation shock caused by energy prices has now spread to every type of food product. In the eurozone, annual food inflation reached 15% in February, with France in the middle of the pack at 14.5%, Germany at 22% and Baltic countries between 25% and 30%.

In Portugal, the average price of the essential products basket calculated by the national statistics office rose from \u20ac74.90 to \u20ac96.44 in one year, a nearly 29% increase.

In Germany, the dominant hold that discount retailers had on food retail, which already used to represent a third of the market, has further increased. According to the latest figures from the Agriculture Ministry, food spending fell by 8.8% between October 2021 and October 2022 in Spain, with a marked decline for fish (-15%), fresh fruit and vegetables (-14%) and meat (-12%).

        "content": "The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality test, widely used by corporate HR departments, colleges and government agencies, is completely flawed, warns Vox's Joseph Stromberg and Estelle Caswell. The MBTI is based on the untested theories of Carl Jung from the 1940s and fails to deliver reliable, accurate results. It has little to no predictive power regarding happiness, job performance and life satisfaction, yet each year over two million people pay to take it. Stromberg and Caswell explain how the Myers-Briggs uses false, limited binaries and provides inconsistent, inaccurate results. They suggest Myers-Briggs is useful for only one thing - entertainment - warning that around 200 federal agencies in the US still continue to waste taxpayers' money on it.The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) continues to be used by many private companies and reportedly about 200 federal agencies, including the State Department, CIA, and military, despite being debunked by professional psychologists. The test is used to categorize employees and potential hires into \u201ctypes\u201d and assign them appropriate training programs and responsibilities. Once certified, those administering the test can become cheerleaders for the MBTI, ensuring that its continued use is adopted. Government agencies are reportedly continuing to waste money on the tests, with the military heavily reliant on it, and approximately a quarter of the EPA\u2019s employees having undertaken the test. It is time to stop using the century-old MBTI test and adopt valid and more up-to-date testing methods to evaluate personality types.",

ChatGPT could generate text that seemed like a human wrote it. How could teachers detect whether students were using language generated by an AI chatbot to cheat on a writing assignment?\nAs a linguist who studies the effects of technology on how people read, write\nand think, I believe there are other, equally pressing concerns besides cheating. These include whether AI, more generally, threatens student writing skills, the value of writing as a process, and the importance of seeing writing as a vehicle for thinking. \nAs part of the research for my new book on the effects of artificial intelligence on human writing, I surveyed young adults in the U.S. and Europe about a host of issues related to those effects. They reported a litany of concerns about how AI tools can undermine what they do as writers. However, as I note in my book, these concerns have been a long time in the making.\nUsers see negative effects\nTools like ChatGPT are only the latest in a progression of AI programs for editing or generating text. In fact, the potential for AI undermining both writing skills and motivation to do your own composing has been decades in the making.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpellcheck and now sophisticated grammar and style programs like Grammarly and Microsoft Editor are among the most widely known AI-driven editing tools. Besides correcting spelling and punctuation, they identify grammar issues as well as offer alternative wording. \nAI text-generation developments have included autocomplete for online searches and predictive texting. Enter \u201cWas Rome\u201d into a Google search and you\u2019re given a list of choices like \u201cWas Rome built in a day.\u201d Type \u201cple\u201d into a text message and you\u2019re offered \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cplenty.\u201d These tools inject themselves into our writing endeavors without being invited, incessantly asking us to follow their suggestions. \nYoung adults in my surveys appreciated AI assistance with spelling and word completion, but they also spoke of negative effects. One survey participant said that \u201cAt some point, if you depend on a predictive text [program], you\u2019re going to lose your spelling abilities.\u201d Another observed that \u201cSpellcheck and AI software \u2026 can \u2026 be used by people who want to take an easier way out.\u201d\nOne respondent mentioned laziness when relying on predictive texting: \u201cIt\u2019s OK when I am feeling particularly lazy.\u201d \nPersonal expression diminished\nAI tools can also affect a person\u2019s writing voice. One person in my survey said that with predictive texting, \u201c[I] don\u2019t feel I wrote it.\u201d\nA high school student in Britain echoed the same concern about individual writing style when describing Grammarly: \u201cGrammarly can remove students\u2019 artistic voice. \u2026 Rather than using their own unique style when writing, Grammarly can strip that away from students by suggesting severe changes to their work.\u201d\nIn a similar vein, Evan Selinger, a philosopher, worried that predictive texting reduces the power of writing as a form of mental activity and personal expression.\n\u201c[B]y encouraging us not to think too deeply about our words, predictive   technology may subtly change how we interact with each other,\u201d Selinger wrote. \u201c[W]e give others more algorithm and less of ourselves. \u2026 [A]utomation \u2026 can stop us thinking.\u201d\nIn literate societies, writing has long been recognized as a way to help people think. Many people have quoted author Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s comment that \u201cI write because I don\u2019t know what I think until I read what I say.\u201d A host of other accomplished writers, from William Faulkner to Joan Didion, have also voiced this sentiment. If AI text generation does our writing for us, we diminish opportunities to think out problems for ourselves. \nOne eerie consequence of using programs like ChatGPT to generate language is that the text is grammatically perfect. A finished product. It turns out that lack of errors is a sign that AI, not a human, probably wrote the words, since even accomplished writers and editors make mistakes. Human writing is a process. We question what we originally wrote, we rewrite, or sometimes start over entirely.\nChallenges in schools\nWhen undertaking school writing assignments, ideally there is ongoing dialogue between teacher and student: Discuss what the student wants to write about. Share and comment on initial drafts. Then it\u2019s time for the student to rethink and revise. But this practice often doesn\u2019t happen. Most teachers don\u2019t have time to fill a collaborative editorial \u2013 and educational \u2013 role. Moreover, they might lack interest or the necessary skills, or both. \nConscientious students sometimes undertake aspects of the process themselves \u2013 as professional authors typically do. But the temptation to lean on editing and text generation tools like Grammarly and ChatGPT makes it all too easy for people to substitute ready-made technology results for opportunities to think and learn. \nEducators are brainstorming how to make good use of AI writing technology. Some point up AI\u2019s potential to kick-start thinking or to collaborate. Before the appearance of ChatGPT, an earlier version of the same underlying program, GPT-3, was licensed by commercial ventures such as Sudowrite. Users can enter a phrase or sentence and then ask the software to fill in more words, potentially stimulating the human writer\u2019s creative juices.\nA fading sense of ownership\nYet there\u2019s a slippery slope between collaboration and encroachment. Writer Jennifer Lepp admits that as she increasingly relied on Sudowrite, the resulting text \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like mine anymore. It was very uncomfortable to look back over what I wrote and not really feel connected to the words or ideas.\u201d\nStudents are even less likely than seasoned writers to recognize where to draw the line between a writing assist and letting an AI text generator take over their content and style. \nAs the technology becomes more powerful and pervasive, I expect schools will strive to teach students about generative AI\u2019s pros and cons. However, the lure of efficiency can make it hard to resist relying on AI to polish a writing assignment or do much of the writing for you. Spellcheck, grammar check and autocomplete programs have already paved the way.\nWriting as a human process\nI asked ChatGPT whether it was a threat to humans\u2019 motivation to write. The bot\u2019s response:\n\u201cThere will always be a demand for creative, original content that requires the unique perspective and insight of a human writer.\u201d\nIt continued: \u201c[W]riting serves many purposes beyond just the creation of content, such as self-expression, communication, and personal growth, which can continue to motivate people to write even if certain types of writing can be automated.\u201d\nI was heartened to find the program seemingly acknowledged its own limitations. \nMy hope is that educators and students will as well. The purpose of making writing assignments must be more than submitting work for a grade. Crafting written work should be a journey, not just a destination.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI)\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nCreativity\n\n\nWriting\n\n\nEnglish\n\n\nSchool\n\n\nHigher ed attainment\n\n\nChatGPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to write?\n\n    Write an article and join a growing community of more than 161,800 academics and researchers from 4,589 institutions.\n  \n\nRegister now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditorial Policies\n\n\nCommunity standards\n\n\nRepublishing guidelines\n\n\nFriends of The Conversation\n\n\nAnalytics\n\n\nOur feeds\n\n\nDonate\n\n\nGet newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho we are\n\n\nOur charter\n\n\nOur team\n\n\nPartners and funders\n\n\nResource for media\n\n\nContact us\n\n\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\u200b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy policy\nTerms and conditions\nCorrections\n\n\n      Copyright \u00a9 2010\u20132023, The Conversation US, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "summary": "AI writing tools, like ChatGPT, threaten student writing and thinking skills, according to a survey conducted by linguist Naomi Baron. While such tools can offer assistance with spelling and word completion, they can also lead to lazy or formulaic writing, diminish personal expression, and discourage the writing process as a form of mental activity. Furthermore, the possibility of using AI-generated language to cheat raises concerns for educators as well. However, some educators also see the potential for AI to kick-start thinking or to collaborate in the writing process. Ultimately, writing assignments should be seen as a journey, not just a destination."

Valve has warned that Steam will no longer support Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 as of January 1st, 2024. The game client's latest features use an embedded version of Google's Chrome browser, which dropped support for those operating systems in February. Incoming versions of Steam for Windows will also require OS updates that are only available in Windows 10 and newer releases, Valve adds.\nAs PC Gamer points out, this won't affect most Steam users. Just under 1.9 percent of the software's audience is using one of the relevant Windows versions, according to Valve's latest survey.  That still affects a significant number of people, though, and may leave them no choice but to either upgrade their OS or buy a PC with a supported platform. The end of support could be particularly troublesome if you need an older version of Windows for work or a retro gaming system.\nThere has been plenty of pressure elsewhere to move on. Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 7 in January 2020, and Windows 8.1 at the start of 2023. Epic Games no longer supports those platforms if you want to run Fortnite, for that matter. It's becoming harder and harder to use an ancient Windows machine in general \u2014 Steam's compatibility change may just be the tipping point that pushes you toward an upgrade.View All CommentsSteam will drop support for Windows 7 and Windows 8 on January 1st, 2024newsgearWindowsgamingValvesoftwareSteamAboutEngadget MastheadAbout our AdsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS FeedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowThe Buyers GuideVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment GuidelinesSupportInternational\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587Subscribe to our two newsletters:Engadget Deals - A weekly roundup of our favorite tech dealsThe Morning After - A daily dose of the news you needPlease enter a valid email addressPlease select a newsletterSubscribeFollow Us\u00a9 2023 Yahoo.
