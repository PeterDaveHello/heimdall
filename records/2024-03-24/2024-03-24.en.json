Here is a list of \"crisis tools\" I recommend installing on your Linux servers by default (if they aren't already), along with the (Ubuntu) package names that they come from: Package Provides Notes procps ps(1), vmstat(8), uptime(1), top(1) basic stats util-linux dmesg(1), lsblk(1), lscpu(1) system log, device info sysstat iostat(1), mpstat(1), pidstat(1), sar(1) device stats iproute2 ip(8), ss(8), nstat(8), tc(8) preferred net tools numactl numastat(8) NUMA stats tcpdump tcpdump(8) Network sniffer linux-tools-common linux-tools-$(uname -r) perf(1), turbostat(8) profiler and PMU stats bpfcc-tools (bcc) opensnoop(8), execsnoop(8), runqlat(8), softirqs(8), hardirqs(8), ext4slower(8), ext4dist(8), biotop(8), biosnoop(8), biolatency(8), tcptop(8), tcplife(8), trace(8), argdist(8), funccount(8), profile(8), etc. canned eBPF tools[1] bpftrace bpftrace, basic versions of opensnoop(8), execsnoop(8), runqlat(8), biosnoop(8), etc. eBPF scripting[1] trace-cmd trace-cmd(1) Ftrace CLI nicstat nicstat(1) net device stats ethtool ethtool(8) net device info tiptop tiptop(1) PMU/PMC top cpuid cpuid(1) CPU details msr-tools rdmsr(8), wrmsr(8) CPU digging (This is based on Table 4.1 \"Linux Crisis Tools\" in SysPerf 2.) Some longer notes: [1] bcc and bpftrace have many overlapping tools: the bcc ones are more capable (e.g., CLI options), and the bpftrace ones can be edited on the fly. But that's not to say that one is better or faster than the other: They emit the same BPF bytecode and are equally fast once running. Also note that bcc is evolving and migrating tools from Python to libbpf C (with CO-RE and BTF) but we haven't reworked the package yet. In the future \"bpfcc-tools\" should get replaced with a much smaller \"libbpf-tools\" package that's just tool binaries. This list is a minimum. Some servers have accelerators and you'll want their analysis tools installed as well: e.g., on Intel GPU servers, the intel-gpu-tools package; on NVIDIA, nvidia-smi. Debugging tools, like gdb(1), can also be pre-installed for immediate use in a crisis. Essential analysis tools like these don't change that often, so this list may only need updating every few years. If you think I missed a package that is important today, please let me know (e.g., in the comments). The main downside of adding these packages is their on-disk size. On cloud instances, adding Mbytes to the base server image can add seconds, or fractions of a second, to instance deployment time. Fortunately the packages I've listed are mostly quite small (and bcc will get smaller) and should cost little size and time. I have seen this size concern prevent debuginfo (totaling around 1 Gbyte) from being included by default. Can't I just install them later when needed? Many problems can occur when trying to install software during a production crisis. I'll step through a made-up example that combines some of the things I've learned the hard way: 4:00pm: Alert! Your company's site goes down. No, some people say it's still up. Is it up? It's up but too slow to be usable. 4:01pm: You look at your monitoring dashboards and a group of backend servers are abnormal. Is that high disk I/O? What's causing that? 4:02pm: You SSH to one server to dig deeper, but SSH takes forever to login. 4:03pm: You get a login prompt and type \"iostat -xz 1\" for basic disk stats to begin with. There is a long pause, and finally \"Command 'iostat' not found...Try: sudo apt install sysstat\". Ugh. Given how slow the system is, installing this package could take several minutes. You run the install command. 4:07pm: The package install has failed as it can't resolve the repositories. Something is wrong with the /etc/apt configuration. Since the server owners are now in the SRE chatroom to help with the outage, you ask: \"how do you install system packages?\" They respond \"We never do. We only update our app.\" Ugh. You find a different server and copy its working /etc/apt config over. 4:10pm: You need to run \"apt-get update\" first with the fixed config, but it's miserably slow. 4:12pm: ...should it really be taking this long?? 4:13pm: apt returned \"failed: Connection timed out.\" Maybe this system is too slow with the performance issue? Or can't it connect to the repos? You begin network debugging and ask the server team: \"Do you use a firewall?\" They say they don't know, ask the network security team. 4:17pm: The network security team have responded: Yes, they have blocked any unexpected traffic, including HTTP/HTTPS/FTP outbound apt requests. Gah. \"Can you edit the rules right now?\" \"It's not that easy.\" \"What about turning off the firewall completely?\" \"Uh, in an emergency, sure.\" 4:20pm: The firewall is disabled. You run apt-get update again. It's slow, but works! Then apt-get install, and...permission errors. What!? I'm root, this makes no sense. You share your error in the SRE chatroom and someone points out: Didn't the platform security team make the system immutable? 4:24pm: The platform security team are now in the SRE chatroom explaining that some parts of the file system can be written to, but others, especially for executable binaries, are blocked. Gah! \"How do we disable this?\" \"You can't, that's the point. You'd have to create new server images with it disabled.\" 4:27pm: By now the SRE team has announced a major outage and informed the executive team, who want regular status updates and an ETA for when it will be fixed. Status: Haven't done much yet. 4:30pm: You start running \"cat /proc/diskstats\" as a rudimentary iostat(1), but have to spend time reading the Linux source (admin-guide/iostats.rst) to make sense of it. It just confirms the disks are busy which you knew anyway from the monitoring dashboard. You really need the disk and file system tracing tools, like biosnoop(8), but you can't install them either. Unless you can hack up rudimentary tracing tools as well...You \"cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing\" and start looking for the FTrace docs. 4:55pm: New server images finally launch with all writable file systems. You login – gee it's fast – and \"apt-get install sysstat\". Before you can even run iostat there are messages in the chatroom: \"Website's back up! Thanks! What did you do?\" \"We restarted the servers but we haven't fixed anything yet.\" You have the feeling that the outage will return exactly 10 minutes after you've fallen asleep tonight. 12:50am: Ping! I knew this would happen. You get out of bed and open your work laptop. The site is down – it's been hacked – someone disabled the firewall and file system security. I've fortunately not experienced the 12:50am event, but the others are based on real world experiences. In my prior job this sequence can often take a different turn: a \"traffic team\" may initiate a cloud region failover by about the 15 minute mark, so I'd eventually get iostat installed but then these systems would be idle. Default install The above scenario explains why you ideally want to pre-install crisis tools so you can start debugging a production issue quickly during an outage. Some companies already do this, and have OS teams that create custom server images with everything included. But there are many sites still running default versions of Linux that learn this the hard way. I'd recommend Linux distros add these crisis tools to their enterprise Linux variants, so that companies large and small can hit the ground running when performance outages occur.

Physical media may be on life-support, but rumors of its demise are overstated. Its heyday as a significant slice of film industry revenue may be over, but there’s good reason to believe the movie-disc will live on as a healthy niche that struggling film industry can’t afford to ignore into the foreseeable future. There may even be some optimism that physical media has already seen its rock-bottom and can only go one direction from here. Those of us who stopped paying cable bills anytime through the 2000s lived through it. We cheered-on streaming video or the “Subscription Video on Demand” (SVoD) market as it threw a hand grenade into the cable TV industrial complex. But we may not have expected physical media would be collateral damage. A 2023 report from the Digital Entertainment Group says, after over a decade of declines, movie-disc media (DVD/BD/UHD) revenue dropped an additional 28% through 2023. I wish I had more firm good news for movie-disc media, but I’m remaining optimistic that as the SVoD market matures and passes from its experimental disruptive technology phase, more of us will return to the value in owning the disc again. Peak Streaming TV When streaming came along, video on Demand (VoD) was not a new concept. Cable and satellite services experimented with VoD services as far back as the 90s. But the real innovation with on-demand TV and movies would arrive in the high-speed Internet-era, and it was called Netflix. Honestly, what’s not to love about an ad-free, all-you-can-watch video buffet that can be consumed on any connected screen? Brief Rise of Streaming Timeline: Netflix, an obscure mail-in DVD rental service announced web-based video on demand in Jan. 2007, just days after Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone 2010 Netflix goes international, starting with Canada before conquering the world 2013 First net-reduction in total US cable/satellite TV subscribers numbered a quarter-million as “cord cutting” enters the American lexicon 2019/20 Disney+ & HBO Max (Warner), major studios enter the SVoD market 2023 Cord-cut US households outnumber cable TV 2023 Physical movie-disc media sees its sixteenth straight year of sales decline By the 2010s households across America were replacing monthly cable bills that averaged between $80-$200 with a broadband Internet connection and an inexpensive ad-free, unlimited streaming video service called Netflix. When the first major SVoD service was the only game in town it built an audience on licensed TV programming and movies from nearly any network or film studio. Early adopters may remember when a Netflix subscription was only $8/mo and paired with a free, ad-supported Hulu subscription you had a popular one-two punch for movies, legacy and current TV with no cable bill. Unsustainable Streaming Flood Did anyone really think the economics of an $8/mo centralized streaming service could last? The cord cutting trend took a lot of potential revenue out of the entertainment industry. Meanwhile, movie theater attendance had been in steep decline since long before the virus struck in 2020. Cable TV may have simultaneously been among America’s most profitable and hated businesses, but it had it all! From outrageous bills to network advertising, cable providers and the networks it carried had such large, often captive markets that it could afford to fund what we call the “golden age of TV” in the late 90s & 2000s. This may be an unpopular opinion, but early streaming adopters were taking part in an experiment with the Netflix library in its $8/mo-era. We got away with it while we could, but what we were viewing was provided at losses, covered mostly by borrowing and investors to provide us with a preview of a home entertainment future. It was the proverbial free sample of crack to get us hooked. One way or another, the real cost was coming to our homes to roost. In 2023, big-tech unlocked the “Disrupt Home Entertainment” achievement trophy when cord cutters outnumbered cable subscribers. The big media companies were already working on getting that revenue back when they began to imitate Netflix. The media conglomerates started tech-companies to launch their own streaming services while Netflix built its own legitimate media production company—what could possibly go wrong? Anonymous TV Industry InsidersVulture, June 2023: “Everything became big tech — the Amazon model of ‘We don’t actually have to make money; we just have to show shareholder growth.’ Everyone said, ‘Great. That seems like the thing to do.’ Which essentially was like, ‘Let’s all commit ritual suicide. Let’s take one of the truly successful money-printing inventions in the history of the modern world — which was the carriage system with cable television — and let’s just end it and reinvent ourselves as tech companies, where we pour billions down the drain in pursuit of a return that is completely speculative, still, this many years into it.’” “I think we may be in the world’s biggest Ponzi scheme.” Peak Streaming Now that we’re years into competitive streaming we’ve started to see the cracks. According to one media analyst, as the seemingly unlimited growth of the SVoD market has begun to taper off, only Netflix has proved profitable as a standalone streaming business. For some companies, losing money in streaming may be seen as an investment in a retention or marketing strategy for other profitable services. Amazon and Apple may use streaming to promote their services or ecosystem. Disney may have even pitched streaming to its board as marketing for its theme parks and theatrical releases, but that doesn't seem to be working. For film studios sinking in losses at the movies, starting a streaming service has been like throwing it an anchor. Behind-the-Scenes Hollywood Legend Talks Streaming Rob Long is a Hollywood writer/executive and podcaster that shares his often humorous takes on the entertainment industry as co-host of the Glop Culture podcast. The natural humor he brings to his writing and podcasting is a gift he’s employed since he started in the business writing for the comedy TV show Cheers. Long has had a lot to say about the sorry state of entertainment production in the age of streaming. He seems to imply that production companies building streaming services and tech companies (Netflix, Apple & Amazon) creating studio productions is just bad business. But he says they’ve been able to get away with reckless spending due to a period of low-interest rates and relatively free-flowing investment capital. On the Unspeakable podcast with Meghan Daum Rob Long said: ”Netflix grew on borrowed money… [while production studios] spent on building these stupid companies [streaming services]. There is no reason on Earth why the world needs, or where the economically rational choice would be to build “Paramount Plus”. It’s so lazy, they spent so much money and didn’t even think… they just named everything “Plus”! There’s even an MGM Plus!… When money was essentially free, they made poor decisions… ” Long has told stories about one important job of a movie producer, working the phone to acquire investment into movies. The business has always worked this way and Long says that throughout film history, the most successful business-sectors in any given era will reliably invest in Hollywood despite its risks. Fortunately for these producers, big companies and the powerful people behind them are charmed by the glamor and prestige of being part of Hollywood while wanting their brands associated with it. In earlier eras of entertainment this may have resulted in Mutual of Omaha putting its name on a wildlife documentary series. But the consumer electronics industry took its relationships with Hollywood to the next level in the 1980s by acquiring them, and giving us preview of what was to come. GE acquired RCA which included NBC. Sony bought Columbia pictures to create Sony Pictures. Comcast bought NBC-Universal from GE in 2011. But these days, the most successful business sector is big-tech, which is simultaneously investing in the industry, while gravely disrupting it. The two business-worlds seem to be merging after a catastrophic collision with Netflix that turned the tech-startup culture of investment spending over to Hollywood. Drunk with Growth Potential The COVID restrictions of 2020-2021 arrived just as Disney+ and a revamped unified HBO Max (HBO/Warner/Discovery) began. The SVoD market was already ripe for growth, but the COVID-era may have seduced streamers into exaggerated impressions of demand. According to a Deloitte Digital Media Trends study soon after the start of widespread COVID restrictions, the percentage of Americans that subscribed to one or more streaming services jumped by about 11%, while the average American household increased the number of streaming services from 3 to 4 while subscriber churn only declined slightly. That’s a little smaller growth than I would have guessed but according to Neilson, the real growth during the high-pandemic months was in viewing time. From Neilson Insights: “During the height of countrywide shelter-in-place orders across the U.S. amid the COVID-19 pandemic, weekly time spent watching connected TVs grew along with overall media use, rising by more than 1 billion hours as the weeks passed.” - Nielsen Insights Two streaming market Statista charts revenue Vs. growth by year, show us a market that has found its ceiling. SVoD Market: Global Revenue by Year (Statista) SVoD Market: Global Revenue Year-Over-Year Growth (Statista) 2023-2024 - Streaming’s Real Cost Passed to Consumers By now we’ve all seen a parade of streaming service price hikes accompanied by lost revenue. Worst of all, we’ve seen movies and shows pulled from the services that produced them. Much of streaming’s new lost media were only produced over the last few years and are now locked away by its intellectual property owner, potentially never to be seen again. That the cost of streaming specific titles is higher than the rewards of its presence on the service speaks to an industry that drank a bit too much of its own Kool-Aid. The money being saved could be hosting cost, per-stream residuals and maybe the service gets a tax write-off. But for some of the freshly pulled Disney+ plus content, it could be a form of reputation management or damage control to keep subscribers from accidentally watching that Willow remake.

My guess is that media conglomerates with ties to communications companies will form a team-up. Comcast (NBCUniversal) and AT&T (Warner) may partner with Disney to take the lead on at least one unified streaming service in a sort-of Hulu 2.0 enterprise that will compete with or absorb Netflix. They’ll find clever ways to sneak more advertising throughout user-interfaces and content, even on more expensive premium “ad-free” subscriptions. Soon, we’ll forget about “cord cutting” and a not-so-new term will re-enter the American entertainment lexicon: “Bundles”. Perhaps a new generation of bundles will be tied to your ISP or wireless network fees and they may even involve contracts to lock you in. It will be just like cable TV, but in the cloud. Streaming can't continue operating at losses for much longer, eventually its true cost will be passed on to consumers. I'm hopeful this may present opportunity for physical media. Gene summarizes the state of streaming video! Back to Physical Media I’m not here to tell you that you can stick it to the man through consumption. But by collecting movies on optical-disc in any form, you will at least support a more reliable and egalitarian method of media consumption. You’ll achieve the only real ownership of your movies in the true constitutional sense that exercises your right to private property. If James Madison permitted himself such frivolities, he would almost certainly keep a collection of his favorite movies on disc. If you care about sound and video quality, the new generations of optical disc is your best bet this side of Kaliedescape. After over a decade of decline, there’s still a robust, if niche market for physical movie-disc media—but it needs your support! It may be too soon to provide any solid sales data to support it, but I believe the market for DVD, Blu-ray & 4K Ultra discs may be on the rise. There were plenty of anecdotes from the collector market of individuals unable to obtain Oppenheimer on 4K Ultra HD the week after release due to demand and that’s a good sign. If physical media can achieve broader market acceptance again, it will have a much better chance of surviving streaming. Streaming affords the studios absolute control of its intellectual property's distribution. But a formidable revenue stream is a fair incentive to include a physical media release into a new movie's life-cycle. But I can only wonder if a niche collector's market will be enough to entice physical media releases far into the future. Conan the Barbarian (1982) The movie that got me back into physical media recently was Conan the Barbarian (1982). It has long been one of my favorites. I grew-up reading the old DeCamp edits of the books by Robert E. Howard and the comic adaptations by Roy Thomas. While the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie can be criticized by Howard purists for not giving the character the same backstory as the books, the screen-writing duo of Oliver Stone and John Milius succeeded in capturing the true spirit of the character. I will be grateful if the character never receives a new film adaptation that updates Conan’s Hyborian Age for modern audiences. But I have finally been treated to the definitive Blu-ray version of the classic I've been waiting for. Arrow's 2024 Release of Conan the Barbarian (1982) Unboxed! Arrow Video is a boutique video-disc company that curates classic movies and performs high-quality audio/video transfers for DVD, Blu-ray and 4K UHD. I heard the company had released a limited, definitive remaster of Conan the Barbarian (1982) in UHD with a new Dolby Atmos soundtrack and video lovingly transferred from the original film's negatives. I was hooked because it also includes the classic Milius/Schwarzenegger commentary that I've only heard on an old DVD release, no subsequent Blu-ray until now included it or the ambitious restoration that Arrow performed. The commentary is a must hear for any fan of Milius, Schwarzenegger or the 1982 movie, it's comedy gold hearing Milius philosophize over each scene through his distinct \"survival of the fittest\" outlook while Schwarzenegger only really speaks up about his injuries while filming or about his female co-stars. I couldn’t find the disc anywhere in stock soon after its Jan 30th 2024 release date. It must have been in high demand if the Sold Out label on every retail web-page was any indication. Stock of the disc eventually returned to one online supplier the next month and I finally got it into my hands. When I finally got it home, opening the small box that includes a booklet, silly two-sided poster and hard cardboard slip-cover accompanied by that distinct smell of new media brought back a flood of fond memories of collecting great movies. At no time did I make a conscious decision to abandon physical movie-media, it just sort-of faded out. The fade can be dated across my modest collection at around 2015 when it ground to a halt. But for movie viewing at home, I for one will be subscribing less and the halt on my physical media collecting ends now!

    "commentBody": "A Return to Blu-ray as Streaming Value Evaporates (audioholics.com)262 points by speckx 17 hours agohidepastfavorite292 comments tombert 16 hours agoI have a pretty extensive blu-ray collection (almost 500 movies now, about 40 complete series). I almost never watch blu-rays directly, because I don't want to muck with physical discs. Immediately after buying a movie, I remove the DRM with MakeMKV, and put it onto a Jellyfin server. I know it's (probably) not strictly legal for me to break the DRM of my movies, but I think I'm ethically in the clear; I'm not distributing the movies on ThePirateBay or anything, I just watch them within my home network...I think it would be pretty hard for anyone to demonstrate any damages from my habits. Streaming is absolutely more convenient than physical discs, but it's also objectively horrible for a company to be able to arbitrarily remove my media. With my discs, I always have a physical copy, so it's more failure-proof. That said, maintaining a server is a huge pain in the ass, and it's something that really is limited to geeky people. Sure, as a software engineer I know enough to install NixOS and Jellyfin and I even get some kind of masochistic enjoyment from fixing things when they inevitably break, but I cannot imagine my mom going through anything like this, so for her the media landscape has gotten only worse. Blu-rays really aren't being produced anymore, so I suspect that the only sustainable preservation effort will end up being piracy, and this has been an issue long enough that the large media companies cannot pretend to not understand that. reply rakoo 9 hours agoparent> I cannot imagine my mom going through anything like this, That's why we have to post individualistically and learn that everything is social, that solutions are societal. Your mom might never be able to self-host, and you might never be able to make the wine that you drink. That's fine, and that's why we share responsibilities as a group.

I just ripped their dvds because they were destroying them every few months and I probably bought Madagascar three times before ripping it. The UX is better than any streaming service.

I get that this is not what the media companies would want, but purchasing media/books and not using them more than once just feels wrong. reply tombert 15 hours agorootparentMy rule of thumb has generally been \"if there's any chance I'll want to watch the movie more than once, I'll buy the blu-ray.\" Until about two years ago, I was happy enough to pay for two streaming services (HBO Max and Hulu), along with Amazon Prime, and I treated that like my \"rental store\". The first viewing would be to see if I like the movie, and if I did then I would immediately order the blu-ray. Now I've canceled all my streaming services because I don't want to pay for a million of them. Just a note, I will very frequently put a movie or TV series on in the background while I work on other things, probably even more frequently than I turn on music.

Given that there is already caselaw in favor of format shifting (e.g. RIAA v. Diamond) it's highly unlikely a court is going to say format shifting is wrong if DRM is involved. None of that matters because nobody is going to try and litigate against individual disc rippers, they are going to litigate against the people who actually wrote the ripping software, and DMCA 1201 is far more harsh to them. There is basically no exception to the prohibition on DRM-breaking tools - I'm not even 100% sure that, say, verifying each individual's usecase before letting them break DRM is enough to escape DMCA 1201's ire. reply cmgbhm 8 hours agorootparentprevIANAL but things are still like they were with DeCSS.

Yup the tax is about paying for a copy of something you already own. You can rip anything all you want from a source medium you own. But you can't fetch it from another source even if you do own an original medium and the resulting data is 1:1 identical down to the last literal bit.

Breaking DRM to format shift in France is illegal and has been for many years. reply saurik 8 hours agorootparentOh, thanks. I somehow remember considering it was obsolete but then had some apparently very wrong reason why that wasn't the case. This matches my understanding better. reply lloeki 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's quite a lot more involved than such a blanket statement. This has been ruled in court. See the \"Mullholand Drive\" case, where a consumer (backed by UFC Que Choisir) sued producer/distributor/whatever for the inability to rip their DVD. Case was tortuous with back and forths, ultimately Cour de Cassation 28 février 2006 ruled that the use of DRM was legal in consideration of international agreements and so that the case was moot. Then Cour d'Appel Paris 4 avril 2007 ruled that copie privée is not a right but an exception and that as such it meant that a consumer cannot sue on limitations caused by DRM, but that they can use the exception as a defense should they be accused of copyright infrigement. DADVSI is more annoying, as it regulates the making, distribution, import, possession in view of selling, lending or renting, of DRM breaking tools, as well as (defined separately) working around DRM is made illegal, irrespective of exceptions. BUT this only applies to DRM schemes that are deemed effective, which DVD's CSS is not (I seem to recall this has been ruled somewhere), making libdvdcss legal to use and distribute. It is in fact OOTB packaged in VLC, hosted in France, and if it were illegal Videolan would have been sued to oblivion. Arguably MakeMKV decodes BluRays with actual keys, so is arguably not an DRM breaking tool (like libdvdcss is) but merely a decryption tool using a legit process and legit keys, no different than a BluRay player. One could argue that rendering the file immediately to a screen or to a file is fundamentally different, but these laws take all sorts of considerations like copies in buffers and whatnot (and yes in the debate at some point majors wanted you to pay for the in-memory buffer copies that happens when decoding MP3 which is astoundingly ridiculous). So the decoding process is not DRM breaking and the storage of the decrypted result is not that different from these buffers, except it's a bit longer lived. But there's one more thing: in addition, the same DADVSI defines that DRM must not prevent interoperability as long as author rights are respected, as well as cannot oppose free usage of the work or protected item in accordance with author rights. Well, Conseil d'Etat 16 juillet 2008 ruled that usage of FOSS software to work around DRM for interoperability purposes is legal. The pain point is MakeMKV is only partially FOSS but DADVSI says nothing about things being FOSS and I don't think anyone is going to ever get sued for making private copies of their legally owned BuRays for their sole usage in order to play content on a variety of devices and OSes they use and would otherwise be unable to play without being decrypted. https://www.droit-technologie.org/actualites/le-regime-de-le... https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libdvdcss#En_France reply tombert 15 hours agorootparentprevI believe in the states, it's technically illegal to break DRM most of the time, though I think there's a million possible exceptions, and I don't know how much it has actually been tested in court. I figure, though, that if I'm buying a legit copy of the blu-ray, and I'm not distributing copies to people, I'm probably not very high up on Disney's \"sue them\" list, even if I am technically breaking a rule. reply sp332 14 hours agorootparentRipping your own media is a civil violation, small stakes for a blu-ray collection. Where people really get in trouble is distribution. Private sharing like a Plex server among friends could get you in more trouble, but public sharing like bittorrent, or anything commercial like charging for access to your Plex, is where it really starts to attract attention from the lawyers. reply tombert 14 hours agorootparentYeah, more or less what I figured. Right now at least, I don't even have the port opened on my network, so the only way to watch it is to be logged in via my network, or do some kind of VPN/proxy into the network. I really doubt that it would be worth it for a company to sue me for it. To be honest, I think that it's a pretty stupid law; obviously distributing the media makes sense to be illegal, but I think it's idiotic to make breaking DRM illegal. reply thfuran 15 hours agorootparentprevIn the US, you're legally entitled to create a backup copy, but breaking the encryption on the disc to actually do so is illegal. reply Bluestrike2 8 hours agoparentprev> ... I cannot imagine my mom going through anything like this, so for her the media landscape has gotten only worse. I setup a Jellyfin server for my parents.

You can expect some phone calls and/or stacks of discs that were \"forgotten\" when you're around :). Even then, it's still a more pleasant experience for them than the fragmented mess streaming has become, where added friction and annoyance are the glue that hold streaming apps together.

As far as I can tell, that doesn't exist. Your server will break at some point, for no apparent reason, and you're going to have to fix it.

After all, it is slow - I think it's safe to assume it takes at least 1:1 to rip a blu ray. And it will take you a long time to watch your collection even once. There are two difficulties. First, the fact that people might never own, or stop owning the blu-rays they've ripped. This is in part mitigated by the fact that such a device would be expensive, and as such its a luxury item not a piracy item. Second, you'll have the stray ornery hacker who'll want to do something more with the device, and dammit I paid for it so its mine! They'll insist on seeding torrents with it or cloning the hard drives and selling them or something and honestly I don't think this is mitigable. reply Solvency 9 hours agorootparentprevSo why not a machine with everything but the ripping part (being pre-installed)?

I play with LLM models sometimes, and I also have a Kafka server with tons of stock-trading info being written to nearly all the time taking a lot of space. That said, I have 24x16TB hard drives in ZFS RAID. It's three separate RAIDZ2's, so the amount of space on there is 18x16TB, so about 288TB. It's a fairly expensive amount of waste, but it's nice to be able to lose up to six disks at a time without having to worry. I could fairly easily get another 8 drives in there if I really needed it, but thus far my total consumption is only about 50TB in total, and I delete actually stuff when I'm done with it. reply BLKNSLVR 12 hours agorootparentOk, now I need a description of the setup. Specifically: - What hardware caters to 32x disks (24+8)? (I'm picturing enterprise gear) - What software are you using to coordinate it? TrueNAS? reply davidzweig 11 hours agorootparentYou can fit a SAS card (like LSI 9207-8e) and hook up external disk shelves (like ds4246). This gear is on ebay and is mostly plug and play on linux. reply tombert 10 hours agorootparentprevSo bear with me and hear me out on this. It's a fairly typical 1U HP Proliant server, which counts as \"enterprise gear\". I don't remember the model but it's somewhat unremarkable. It only has like six bays in the front, and I use one for a NixOS install, and two of them with SSDs for read and write cache. It has an old 10 gigabit ethernet card for connectivity. The server I bought used for around $150, the ethernet card I got for about $35 used on ebay. The actual disks live in 8 bay external chassis, and connected via USB3.0. This may sound horrifying, but USB3 is rated for like 5 gigabits, way more than you can easily get from a home RAID with spinning disks. I have a PCIe 3.0 x16 USB3 card in there, with four plugs, each with a dedicated controller, meaning that in theory each port could get 5 gigabits. The reason I could fairly easily get eight more in there is that I'm only using three of the four ports, so without much effort I could buy 8 more drives (of any size I suppose), put them into another 8 bay chassis, and just add vdev to my RAID. This particular PCIe USB card was $41 on eBay. I use ZFS for a software RAID. This sort of happened accidentally; I didn't used to have a rack mount server, I was using a bunch of Nvidia Jetson Nanos, and as such there wasn't a real way directly plug hard drives in, so I ended up having to use the external chassis. Eventually I bought three of those cases, had all the drives in there, and when I decided to buy a \"real\" server it was substantially easier and cheaper to just add proper USB support to a server than it was to find a decent 24-bay server at a decent price, particularly since I already had the cases. In hindsight I probably should have got chassis that have eSATA support, but they've been getting decent speed and it's an extremely convenient system. It's also come in handy once when I accidentally broke my server, and I needed to get files off the RAID; all I had to do was plug them into my laptop and mount the ZFS RAID there. ETA: Forgot to answer what I use to manage it. I installed NixOS on my server with a pretty vanilla ZFS on Linux install and an NFS mount. I do the tmpfs-on-root trick, so the root partition gets nuked on every reboot. https://elis.nu/blog/2020/05/nixos-tmpfs-as-root/ I don't use any fancy GUI tools or anything; NixOS does a good enough automating away the un-fun parts of maintaining a server, and if I break my server I can very easily roll back to a previous state, and if I really have to, reinstalling it from scratch takes like 20 minutes since I can just copy over my configuration file (which I back up on Gitlab) and have everything automatically set up again. NixOS is pretty cool. ETAA: According to `dmidecode` and `lscpu`, server model is `ProLiant DL380 G7`, 24 cores, 128GB of RAM. I think it's actually 12 cores, and it says 24 because of hyperthreading. It's pretty unremarkable. I like it a lot, but it's a fairly typical and bog-standard used server. reply Handy-Man 7 hours agorootparent`Kafka server with tons of stock-trading info` Can you talk more about this? I personally have a Dell R720 and about 90TB available for use, and use 40TB of it for my media server. I'm wondering if that's some use case I want to look into. reply tombert 7 hours agorootparentDISCLAIMER: I don't really know what I'm doing. My knowledge of trading basically amounts like a few Coursera classes. I wanted to play with paper trading strategies. I listen on websocket streams of cryptocurrency and stock ticker stuff [1], and the service listening on that socket just plops it into Kafka, with the partition key being the ticker name. The reason I bother adding Kafka largely comes down to the ability to use the Kafka Streams API. Kafka Streams allows me to do time windows of different trades, or lets me do a sql-style join across two different streams, or lets me filter out data that I don't think is relevant. Kafka Streams gives you most of the fun of a map-reduce framework, but without having to administer a map-reduce server; it's even smart enough to handle internal state by creating intermediate topics and/or creating local RocksDB instances. It's pretty cool. There's also has the advantage of allowing me to set retention, so I don't have to worry about doing any kind of manual cleanup; I only have to worry about having N days of stuff on the server, and it's trivial to change that. Also, I have a number of topics, each with 32 partitions, meaning that if I do find any kind of strategy that works, I can very easily scale it up without changing any code. I'm basically using Kafka as a streaming-only database. I think it's neat but I haven't actually found any strategies that make or lose money. It's just been a fun way to play around with different bits of server stuff. [1] https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/real-time-stock-pricing-dat... reply Handy-Man 3 hours agorootparentAwesome!

One advantage, though, is that when you have a \"nearly-unlimited\" place to dump data, it kind of changes how you think about problems. If I want to do some experiment with video encoding, there's really nothing stopping me from encoding a video into 100 different configurations so I can directly compare stuff.

I got a Synology. It has 5 drives, and the ones I have are fairly quiet so the thing goes under the TV counter. However, if you want to rip 4K blurays, you've got to flash the firmware on your bluray drive and then run MakeMkV + handbrake (or much harder CLI stuff) to process a disc into a useable media file which can THEN go into Plex. All of that takes time and effort, and usually some trial and error. I also keep a bluray player next to the NAS. Simply because it's too much of a pain to deal with ripping sometimes. I still have to get through my 30-disc Ingmar Bergman Criterion Boxset that I bought 2 years ago. Much easier to pop a disc in the player! reply tombert 14 hours agorootparentYeah, I actually have one of the drives that's ostensibly flashable to be 4k compatible, but I haven't been able to get it working. Honestly, I've been happy enough with 1080p. I think 1080p blu-rays still hold up pretty well visually. My biggest TV is 70\", and I watch it from like 15 feet away, so I don't think I'd benefit much from the increased resolution. I know that there's other variables that are enhanced with a 4k blu-ray, but they haven't been significant enough for me to bother collecting/ripping them. When I buy a 4k blu-ray, I've just been ripping the regular 1080p blu-ray that always comes with it. reply sroussey 14 hours agorootparentprevDetails of the flash firmware? reply aspenmayer 13 hours agorootparentProbably LibreDrive for use with MakeMKV. https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=18856 reply bombcar 8 hours agorootparentThis plus a reencode with handbrake is what I use.

I’ve heard that some setups struggle with higher resolutions and bitrates, which is compounded on 4K (HDR also with its own quirks for downsampling in post processing for playback on unsupported devices) versus 1080p. These factors are exasperated when direct play isn’t possible due to incompatible files, unsupported container formats and/or codecs, or insufficient bandwidth, especially when remote mounts, caching, and transcoding come into play. reply crispyambulance 9 hours agorootparentprevYep, that's it. It seems to be the only way to rip a 4K. No drives (that I know of) allow ripping 4K \"out of the box\"! reply compsciphd 15 hours agorootparentpreva single 1080p bluray movie (not including extras on the disc) is generally going to be in the low to mid 20GBs to 40GB range. Lets take 40GB for a fairly conservative measure. a single 8TB drive can therefore fit 200 (or possibly more) movies (or double for 16GB drives). i.e. one doesn't need \"crazy\" (i.e. more than a handful of consumer hard drives) amount of storage to store a lot of bluray movies and tv shows and keep them online available to you. reply vondur 15 hours agorootparentI compress mine using Handbrake. It gets them down to the 2.5->8GB per movie range. reply tombert 15 hours agorootparentI used to compress them and generally that's fine, but honestly storage has gotten cheap enough to where I don't bother. Every now and then the compression would introduce artifacts, even at a relatively low CRF level in ffmpeg, and just for peace of mind I decided to keep the raw movies. That said, since I have an elaborate tape backup system now, I've debated keeping the \"masters\" as archives on the tapes, and keeping compressed versions for streaming, but laziness has kind of won out on that. reply extragood 12 hours agorootparentAgreed on your points about cheap storage and compression artifacts. I've entertained setting up a tape drive local backup for my NAS (4x 14 TB) for a few years. Is it worthwhile from your experience? reply tombert 9 hours agorootparentYes, the tape drive is something I am very happy that I ended up doing. I have two LTO-6 tape drives. They only connect via SAS, which is a little annoying, but I bought a 2-port used SAS card on ebay for $20. I ended up buying a pack of like 100 LTO-6 tapes on eBay two years ago for a steal, like $150 in total. Each tape is 2.5TB, so I can pretty easily back up my movies. Each movies is written to two separate tapes. I keep a spreadsheet of which tape every movie lives, in case I need to restore a specific backup. I would really like to get an LTO-7 or LTO-8 drive with Thunderbolt, but they cost an arm and a leg even used on eBay right now. If you get lucky, an external SAS LTO-6 drive can be had for about $200-$300. It's a slightly expensive up-front cost I'll admit, however, it came after I was using Google archive storage, and when I did a restore of 21TB of movies, the next day I had a bill for like $700! It's saved my ass one time thus far; I accidentally broke my ZFS RAID and lost everything, but fortunately I was able to restore all my blu-ray rips from tape, and it was pretty easy, and more importantly, didn't cost me anything extra. If you decide to go down this road, I do recommend getting one that has support for LTFS; otherwise you're going to be stuck using tar commands I think. reply vundercind 10 hours agorootparentprev4.5-10GB in h.265, depending on the movie (length, how many low-contrast scenes, how much quick movement) and how well-tuned the encoder was, is indistinguishable from the 1080p blu ray on my 10’ diagonal screen at 6-10’ viewing distance. 4k, something like 25GB-45GB, depending, but I have several in the teens of GB that I wouldn’t guess weren’t full quality.

The money per stream is still changing hands, Be it from my hands or an advertisers to the streamer and then the content producer. Because of modern profiling you could make the argument that the no sign up services are tracking who watches what at a household level (shadow subscriptions). But that does not change the fact that in a pure ad based model If I dont watch no one gets paid... Regardless of who is paying for the view, myself to streaming service, an andversiser or sponsor, me to a theater... if the product isnt quality no money changes hands.

If you're afraid of the DVDs breaking, it's not necessarily a bad idea to just keeping a digital backup somewhere. Of course, if you're not careful you end up like me having spent multiple thousands on disks and servers and data tape backups, so be less dumb than me. reply circusfly 16 hours agoparentprev> Sure DVDs won't last forever \"No termination date.

It’s stupidly user hostile and yet there’s no alternative other than physical media (with all its negatives) or piracy. reply crysin 16 hours agoparentIt's getting even dumber because these studio curated streaming services don't even have their entire library available on their dedicated service.

Super frustrating as a customer. reply izacus 15 hours agoparentprevThe fact that we never legislated to force providers to allow any client connect to their streaming API (keeping software like Winamp, VLC, relevant for new world) and instead doubled down to allow complete control of content providers over our culture is one of big societal mistakes of last decades.

When Netflix had just about everything, piracy took a big hit. We need a return to Blockbuster-like selection, but streaming. A streaming service should purchases however many copies they are streaming, and replace them on a schedule as the copy “wears out”, like Blockbuster. reply cdchn 16 hours agorootparentWhat they could even do is buy physical Blu-Ray and mail the out to people who would return them after a few days, for a subscription fee. reply dylan604 16 hours agorootparentIf that was profitable, the service you describe would not have shuttered. reply cogman10 14 hours agorootparentIt may actually be profitable again. The entire reason media rentals ended up dying is because of Netflix coming out with just about every bit of media available for streaming. Now that everything has fractured into a million pieces, media rental once again seems like it may make sense. Redbox is still around still lending out blurays. It wouldn't shock me if that model made a resurgence. reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentredbox isn't nearly as convenient as having it delivered to your house. however, it does make me wonder if owning/operating/maintaining all of the boxes is more or less expensive than paying the USPS to deliver and collect on behalf of your service. reply bombcar 7 hours agorootparentRedbox is about as convenient as the library (or more so, with a cost) and it has all the latest.

Also I don’t think suggesting a giant task like starting a business is anything but a bad faith rhetorical tactic. I’m not going to pitch a DVD mailing company to investors for reasons that have nothing to do with whether or not it is viable (I’m a programmer, not a businessman, and I don’t care to run a business, for one thing). reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentOf course I wouldn't expect some person as a programmer become a CEO of a physical media shipping company.

Netflix, of course, started with mailing dvds and recently ended it. As far as I know, it was always profitable. Unfortunately being profitable is not the same as \"worth investing\", investors are chasing the highest returns and won't invest in something with a low return on investment. You are kind moving the goal posts with your first statement \"If that was profitable, the service you describe would not have shuttered.\" and this one. reply andsoitis 14 hours agorootparentThe trend has been clear for a long time. The future is a streaming, not physical media. Profitability is necessary but not sufficient to be a successful business over the long term, you also need to grow and change according to market dynamics, otherwise you will find yourself dead. reply cfmcdonald 10 hours agorootparentThis article is all about how streaming is a big money loser for almost everyone. So it has growth without profitability. I'd rather have profitability without growth. reply dylan604 14 hours agorootparentprevNo, I'm not missing the point. Yes, I said profitable. But let's all agree that profitable doesn't just mean making one dollar more than all of your expenses. By definition, that's making money which is technically profitable, but that's not what anyone would consider a profitable business. So while technically right might be the best right, it's technically useless in this conversation and does nothing to actually move the conversation in a positive direction. Saying that a company is profitable but not worth the investment is not going to solve the streaming is our only option. We are looking for a solution other than streaming that is still legal so that people do not have to resort to pirating. If you are suggesting that a service providing shiny round discs through the mail or any other brick&mortar Blockbuster or mom&pop video rental solution is going to be profitable to the point of sustaining a business, then there's a bit of realism that needs to be brought back into the conversation.

Last weekend I grabbed The Goodfellas and The Dark Night and will put them back when I’m done. I think it would be really cool if there were ways for people to share their physical media because I don’t have the room to maintain a big media library, and also don’t have the energy to rip and store locally. I also want to add that I’ve changed my streaming behavior- I will subscribe and immediately cancel the subscription so that it expires after a month so that I don’t end up with a bunch of active subscriptions that I’m not actively using. When I do subscribe I always pay for the more expensive ad-free versions but recently I couldn’t get anything to play on Paramounts streaming service. After some trial and error I found that their “ad-free” service won’t run with my blocker running on my router and I needed to allowlist some ad services for it work.

All of the diffuse streaming services without sharing agreements have, in their greed to not share the pie, put themselves into competition with grocery stores. Being able to afford two streaming services — or one, based on Netflix’s hostility to account sharing! — is a luxury that fewer can afford each year. They can scrabble all they want for the shrinking pie of available money to spend on entertainment, but unless they stop siloing and start accepting cross-membership across the board, they’ll all go bankrupt once someone realizes that the Blockbuster store model with its $2 rentals and the collapse of commercial real estate is about to become viable again. reply BryantD 14 hours agoprevThe boutique Blu-ray market has become fairly well served in the last five years. I suspect this may partially be because of the pandemic, but it seems to be sustaining. Most people have heard of Criterion and of course they’re still going strong. But there are easily a dozen labels of various sizes dedicated to physical media these days. Arrow is one. Vinegar Syndrome tends to focus on more exploitative titles plus they act as distributor for many smaller labels. Severin does a lot of horror. The UK’s Radiance Video is carving out an interesting niche in more obscure genre offerings. Kino Lorber has a lot of classics. And so on, and so on. I don’t know the financials behind this but a lot of the print runs seem to be around 3K copies and many of these labels have sustained for a few years now. Radiance and Vinegar Syndrome both have subscription programs which probably help with predictability. Some people buy these for the movies, some because they’re collectors, and some for both reasons. https://www.indiewire.com/features/craft/blu-ray-labels-film... is a decent article on all of this. reply atum47 15 hours agoprevI've been using my raspberry pi 4 as a server for my local network.

With a download license, you can do anything you can do with streaming, and much more. And it allows the author to get a decent royalty instead of some \"microcents\". It can sometimes take an effort to explain to an outsider why we don't do streaming and don't want to. It's like we are swimming opposite to the flow. But I see streaming as something geared towards casual listeners, while downloads are for professionals and enthusiasts. reply zamadatix 13 hours agoparentThis makes perfect sense for DJs but I'm not sure it makes sense for the streaming market in general.

Rights holders saw how much Netflix was making off their content and realized they could get way more if they cut out the middle man.

Generally when ripping a CD it does the metadata scraping in the program ripping the CD which then gets stored in the resulting files (MP3, flac etc). Media servers match based on the directory/filename then store the metadata in their own way (files stored with the video, their own database, etc).

    "originBody": "New Aztec Codices Discovered: The Codices of San Andrés Tetepilco Posted on March 21, 2024March 22, 2024 by Alonso Zamora Yesterday, a team of specialists of the National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico, led by the historians Baltazar Brito Guadarrama and María Castañeda de la Paz, the philologist Michel Oudijk, and the Nahuatl specialist Rafael Tena, presented to the public the discovery of three new Aztec codices, collectively known as the Codices of San Andrés Tetepilco, formerly a part of the Culhuacan polity of Central Mexico, and nowadays located within the Iztapalapa borough in Mexico City. This is one of the most exciting and spectacular discoveries regarding codical sources in recent years, and is no doubt closely related to the topic of this blog. The discovery has been already covered by the Mexican press and explained in detail in yesterday’s presentation at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, which can be seen in Youtube. However, an English summary will be presented for the readers of this blog. The newly discovered corpus was acquired by the Mexican government from a local family that wants to remain anonymous, but which were not collectors but rather traditional stewards of the cultural legacy of Culhuacan and Iztapalapa, and it is now stored at the library of the National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico. It comprises three codices. The first is called Map of the Founding of Tetepilco, and is a pictographic map which contains information regarding the foundation of San Andrés Tetepilco, as well as lists of toponyms to be found within Culhuacan, Tetepilco, Tepanohuayan, Cohuatlinchan, Xaltocan and Azcapotzalco. The second, the Inventory of the Church of San Andrés Tetepilco, is unique, as Oudijk remarks, since it is a pictographic inventory of the church of San Andrés Tetepilco, comprising two pages. Sadly, it is very damaged. Finally, the third document, now baptised as the Tira of San Andrés Tetepilco, is a pictographic history in the vein of the Boturini and the Aubin codices, comprising historical information regarding the Tenochtitlan polity from its foundation to the year 1603. It seems to belong to the same family as the Boturini, the Aubin, the Ms. 40 and the Ms. 85 of Paris, that is to say, some of the main codices dealing with Aztec imperial history, and Brito considers it as a sort of bridge between the Boturini and the Aubin, since its pictographic style is considerably close to the early colonial one of the former, rather than the late colonial one of the latter. It comprises 20 rectangular pages of amate paper, and contains new and striking iconography, including a spectacular depiction of Hernán Cortés as a Roman soldier. In the Aztec side of things, new iconography of Moctezuma Ilhuicamina during his conquest of Tetepilco is presented (Figure 1). Figure 1. Codices of San Andrés Tetepilco: a) Map of the Founding of San Andrés Tetepilco; b) Inventory of the Church of San Andrés Tetepilco; c) Tira of San Andrés Tetepilco Of course, new and very interesting examples of Aztec writing are contained throughout all these documents, including old and new toponyms, spellings of Western and Aztec names, and even some information that confirms that some glyphs formerly considered as hapax, as the chi syllabogram in the spelling of the name Motelchiuhtzin in Codex Telleriano-Remensis 43r, discussed in another post of this blog, were not anomalous but possibly conventional. Besides logosyllabic spellings, the presence of pictographs with alphabetic glosses in Nahuatl will be of great help to ascertain the functioning of this still controversial part of the Aztec communication system. In any case, the author of this blog remains expectant of the future digital and physical publication of the Codices by Baltazar Brito’s team of experts, promised yesterday, and congratulate them for their breakthrough discovery. Cheers for Aztec writing and its everlasting cultural legacy! Share this: Twitter Facebook Like Loading...

Generally, everything that they didn't know would be useful or important. These are written on parchment, which has great durability over time, but sadly this means that very little of all the material that was written on parchment survives. This is because parchment is both very expensive and easy to recycle, which means that for most of history the second someone no longer values the material written on their parchment, they are going to wash that off and use it for something else. reply galaxyLogic 3 hours agorootparentEtch-a-Sketch reply dzdt 9 hours agorootparentprevMy impression is so far investigations are extremely preliminary, not much more than was necessary to validate the authenticity of the documents.

Why were the first two books about Spanish topics but written in the local language? If Spanish people writing, wouldn't they write in Spanish? If Aztecs were writing, why would they care to record these things? I suppose the latter is plausible if they were absorbed into Spanish society. reply dragonwriter 1 hour agoparent> San Andrés Tetepilco must have been Spanish, of course. It is not. I mean, yes, the “San Andrés” part of the modern name of the settlement (from a church there built not long after the conquest) is, but its one of Itzapalapan settlements that was later conquered by the Aztecs, so an Aztec codex about its founding is Aztecs writing about pre-Aztec history. > “The second, the Inventory of the Church of San Andrés Tetepilco …”: Churches would be Spanish. Yeah, unlike the colonization of the United States, the native peoples were still present in and often the bulk of communities after the conquest of Mexico, they weren’t simply displaced for the Europeans (not to say the Spanish were better, but the pattern of colonization was very different.) So, while the Church was built under the direction of the Spanish, it would have been built and attended largely by locals, who would record things for the same people anyone would record things about the community they live in. reply yorwba 3 hours agoparentprevThe Aztec Empire fell in 1521, but of course its people didn't disappear. If the codices date after 1603, that's plenty of time for the Spanish to influence their lives, even without full absorption. That San Andrés Tetepilco has a partly-Spanish name now doesn't necessarily imply that Spaniards had a role in its founding or lived there in significant numbers at the time the codices were written. The church might have been founded by a Spanish missionary, but it might also have been an Aztec convert instead. The history apparently also covers events that happened under Spanish rule, so it's not entirely about a non-Spanish topic either. reply jmopp 1 hour agoparentprevFun fact: the descendants of Moctezuma still live today as Spanish nobility https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Moctezuma_de_Tultengo reply acheron 7 hours agoprevVery nice.

Abstract Objective This study aimed to explore the global burden of early-onset cancer based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study for 29 cancers worldwid. Methods and analysis Incidence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and risk factors for 29 early-onset cancer groups were obtained from GBD. Results Global incidence of early-onset cancer increased by 79.1% and the number of early-onset cancer deaths increased by 27.7% between 1990 and 2019. Early-onset breast, tracheal, bronchus and lung, stomach and colorectal cancers showed the highest mortality and DALYs in 2019. Globally, the incidence rates of early-onset nasopharyngeal and prostate cancer showed the fastest increasing trend, whereas early-onset liver cancer showed the sharpest decrease. Early-onset colorectal cancers had high DALYs within the top five ranking for both men and women. High-middle and middle Sociodemographic Index (SDI) regions had the highest burden of early-onset cancer. The morbidity of early-onset cancer increased with the SDI, and the mortality rate decreased considerably when SDI increased from 0.7 to 1. The projections indicated that the global number of incidence and deaths of early-onset cancer would increase by 31% and 21% in 2030, respectively. Dietary risk factors (diet high in red meat, low in fruits, high in sodium and low in milk, etc), alcohol consumption and tobacco use are the main risk factors underlying early-onset cancers. Conclusion Early-onset cancer morbidity continues to increase worldwide with notable variances in mortality and DALYs between areas, countries, sex and cancer types. Encouraging a healthy lifestyle could reduce early-onset cancer disease burden. Epidemiology Mortality Neoplasms Data availability statement Data are available in a public, open access repository.

Epidemiology Mortality Neoplasms WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC Previous studies have suggested that the incidence of cancers of various organs diagnosed in adults0.7), there was a reduction in both early-onset cancer ASDR and DALYs rate as the SDI increased. The high of ASDR and DALYs rate concentrated on middle and middle-high SDI regions. Despite the fact that the ASIR remained elevated in high SDI regions, advancements in medical technology and treatments had substantially alleviated the mortality and overall impact of early-onset cancer. Conversely, it appeared that the middle SDI region was afflicted by the issue of early-onset cancer with high deaths and DALYs. Meanwhile, our findings indicated that the relationship between the HDI and the EAPC of incidence and death rates for early-onset breast cancer, TBL cancer, CRC and stomach cancer follows an inverted U-shaped curve, and the highest EAPC was observed in regions with low-middle and middle HDI, ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. Therefore, it could be concluded that in countries with a low-middle and middle HDI, burdensome early-onset cancers were displaying the most rapid increase in incidence, mortality and DALYs rates. As a result, enhancing the monitoring and prevention of early-onset cancers in these regions is crucial. Genetic screening has become an indispensable tool due to its emphasis on the prevention of early-stage cancer. For example, current research indicated that breast and ovarian cancer were associated with variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.47 Besides, approximately 10% of CRC cases have been found to be associated with pathogenic variants according to research studies.20 Research studies have revealed that these pathogenic variants were detected in 15%–33% of individuals who were diagnosed with CRC before the age of 50, regardless of their family history of the disease.20 More importantly, next-generation sequencing has led to improvements in the accessibility and affordability of genetic testing for cancer susceptibility genes. Therefore, genetic screening is expected to have a significant impact on the identification and anticipation of early-onset cancers in the near future. However, the study still has several limitations due to GBD 2019’s intrinsic drawbacks. First, the accuracy of GBD data was compromised by the quality of cancer registry data in different countries. Thus, the under-reporting and under-diagnosis in undeveloped countries may result in underestimation of the incidences and deaths of early-onset cancer. Second, the increasing trend of early-onset cancer burden is still unclear, which may be related to early screening intervention and early-life exposures. Third, the estimation of risk factor exposure was conducted on data with sparse investigation time nodes and different sources, which may affect influence accuracy and introduce potential measurement bias. Fourth, it is inevitable that implementing a dichotomy at 50 years of age has drawbacks because pathological, molecular and biological characteristics are unlikely to change considerably at that age. Conclusions Our study showed that the global morbidity of early-onset cancer increased from 1990 to 2019, while mortality and DALYs slightly decreased. The rate of incidence, mortality and DALY varied widely across regions, countries and cancer types. The highest-burden regions and cancer types were high-middle and middle SDI regions and early-onset breast cancer, TBL cancer, CRC and stomach cancer, respectively. Dietary risk factors, alcohol use and tobacco consumption were the main risk factors for top early-onset cancers in 2019. Additionally, it is necessary to conduct prospective life-course cohort studies to explore the aetiologies of early-onset cancers. Encouraging a healthy lifestyle, including a healthy diet, the restriction of tobacco and alcohol consumption and appropriate outdoor activity, could reduce the burden of early-onset cancer. It is worth exploring whether early screening and prevention programmes for early-onset cancer should be expanded to include individuals aged 40–44 and 45–49, but further systematic studies and randomised trials are necessary to make a definitive determination.

Rainwater…[1] I get it PFAs might not cause cancer but we’re pushing things to some pretty crazy extreme when it comes to pollution. Microplastics in the clouds ? I really hope these things aren’t related because it’s going to fucking suck if they are. Can’t just put microplastics away. I’m personally in the camp that thinks we should just be doing everything we can to minimise all types of pollution because we just cannot really predict what the effects will be. Even if we think something is benign. I might be an extremist but I’m even worried about tyre dust. And even those blue plastic tarps people love to let rot in the sun and dissolve everywhere. What we’re doing isn’t good, I just think we struggle to admit to ourselves because it’s quite horrific. [1] https://phys.org/news/2022-08-rainwater-unsafe-due-chemicals... reply resonious 8 minutes agoparentWhile plastic and car tires might have some measurably bad effects on humans, we still live on average way longer than our ancestors. You could draw a weird but valid correlation between poison rain water and living longer. You're right though that we ought to be careful and try to reduce bad stuff. I suspect that will be key to increasing our life expectancy even further. reply airstrike 7 hours agoparentprev> I’m personally in the camp that thinks we should just be doing everything we can to minimise all types of pollution because we just cannot really predict what the effects will be. Even if we think something is benign. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle reply nextos 7 hours agorootparentYes, the chemical industry has not stuck to the precautionary principle. Besides, lots of excellent drugs are used in a trigger-happy way. Take for instance antibiotics, which are one of the greatest achievements of modern science. Lots of children are prescribed antibiotics for mild infections, i.e. when they don't need them, ignoring side-effects. Thankfully, doctors are starting to be a bit more cautious. This is one of the reasons autoimmunity has skyrocketed during the last 50 years, and quite a few friendly commensal bacteria are nearly extinct. Persistent gut inflammation, below what is considered autoimmunity, is responsible for lots of colon cancer cases in adults. It is all tied. reply parentheses 6 hours agorootparentBlind trust in doctors is such a societal problem. reply autoexec 6 hours agorootparentIt doesn't help that the systems we have in place to keep them in check are failing us. In the US doctors can tell their patients that their illnesses are caused by demon sperm and that alien DNA is used to make medical treatments and they will still keep their medical license. reply bamboozled 7 hours agorootparentprevThanks for sharing. What worries me is this is always going to be about a quick buck vs long term risk. We do not have the collective wisdom to stop. reply throwaway743950 5 hours agorootparentEven if we have the collective wisdom, that doesn't mean it will outweigh the incentives, especially if that decision-making power is unchecked. reply rewgs 3 hours agorootparentprevYup. The shitty thing about the prisoner's dilemma is that we nearly always lose it. reply dinkleberg 6 hours agorootparentprevI know it’s true, you even see it here all the time, but it is really disappointing to see people see this approach as unscientific. Progress at all costs should not be the goal! We should be working towards the betterment of humanity and if new innovations have a significant chance of working against that via side effects, we should absolutely be cautious. reply bamboozled 5 hours agorootparentI think it's more relaxing and enjoyable for us as a species to slow down a bit. There is no need to keep rushing into problems. We had / still have a pretty good environment, even if all technological progress stopped tomorrow, thousands of generations would still have beautiful lives. Everything from here is a bonus IMO. reply KennyBlanken 7 hours agorootparentprevIt's not \"unscientific.\" We have something like a century and a half worth of evidence that the hazards to environment and human health from man-made substances is very often missed, understated, or outright suppressed by the industry that is profiting off it. How many more decades do we need? Given we are seeing plunging birth rates and species unprecedented rate (a dozen to hundreds of species a day), I'd say shifting to a \"you have to prove it's not harmful\" is a good policy. reply hn_throwaway_99 6 hours agoparentprevI think everyone agrees that it's much better to clean up pollution, but the problem is not really so much that we are bombarded with more pollution (in many places, especially in the West, most measures of environmental pollution are much lower than in the past), the problem is you are just constantly bombarded with more information. Some of it is valid, but nearly all of it is designed to scare you. Just consider this study, which is simply bad reporting. Check out some of the other comments in this thread, but all of these numbers can simply be explained by the growth in the global population during the study period. Actual per-capita cancer deaths among young people are way down during this timeframe. reply taf2 7 hours agoparentprevI agree with most of this but I think we do recognize and every year we get smarter about how we handle it… I think it’s just very hard to see how we improve over a few years time scale… I remember in 1986 or 1987 my dad took us to his office I think it was cricket software in Pennsylvania and in the front of the very shiny new office was an extremely polluted stream. It was a bright red/orange color. I recall my dad telling us to avoid playing in the water and explaining that it was not supposed to be that color… years later and while much of the area that was farm land in PA is now homes and neighborhoods- I don’t believe such a stream exists…. That said plastic is still very hard thing to reduce in our environment already we see many more bio degradable examples of packaging being used and a lot of research into which plastics are harmful and ways to help reduce or mitigate the impacts… back in the 80s if it was known it was not talked about… progress is slow but if you care very deeply about it you should IMO go into research or engineering to do something positive about it. Understand why we use it and find good alternatives reply Spooky23 6 hours agorootparentA lot of sites like that still exist but are unknown or look pretty. Basically, don’t buy a home in a area where there were historically military facilities, especially Air Force, or defense contractors without careful review. reply srvmshr 6 hours agorootparentprevThose streams and rivers exist. Look up industrial pollution in China, India or Vietnam. The manufacturing base which got pollution to that point is just geographically shifted. When running industries, there is unfortunately no free lunch -- someone's paying the consequences. If not you, someone upstream who made the raw materials or any priors. reply bamboozled 7 hours agorootparentprevI think this is because we have offshored manufacturing and even farming. Could you imagine what rivers in China and India look like ? I do agree we have improved in some areas for sure. But we don’t get clouds contaminated with plastic for no reason. reply maxglute 6 hours agorootparentHalf of adult men also smoke in China... who consumes ~50% of world total cigarettes, on the 1/3 of land that's not sand or plateau. 2.5 trillion cigarettes per a year smoked on 3m sqkm, or 2% of terrestial land. I don't know if that means anything, but if it does, it's not good. reply apwell23 7 hours agoparentprevIts still a disease of old age not of environmental factors reply bamboozled 6 hours agorootparentIf you lived next to a coal fire power plant it might tell a different story ? reply Waterluvian 6 hours agoparentprevI feel like “microplastics are in our clouds” sounds like science hysteria, so I think tomorrow the scientist and geographer in me needs to figure out if I can see them through my own eyes at home or my university’s hydrology lab or something. reply autoexec 6 hours agorootparent> I feel like “microplastics are in our clouds” sounds like science hysteria We don't know yet just how much harm microplastics are causing us, but the fact that they are everywhere (including in your blood and organs) isn't helping. I don't think there's anything hysterical about all of earth's water being unsafe to drink unless it's filtered. (https://www.su.se/english/news/it-s-raining-pfas-even-in-ant...). The world has never been poisoned at this scale before. Your body is already polluted, and our children's bodies will be polluted from the moment they are born. reply bamboozled 6 hours agorootparentprevhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/09/micropla... reply twothreeone 8 hours agoprevFigure 3 shows incident rate changes in percent by country, it seems there are stark increases in South American and African countries and mainly declining incident rates in western countries. Intuitively, I would associate increases in those regions with increased access to medical care there - so, overall a good thing? reply safety1st 6 hours agoparentYeah, that map looks a lot like developed world vs. developing world. So two major factors here almost certainly are: 1) Fewer people in developing countries are dying from other things than they were 30 years ago, for example malnutrition and maternal or infant mortality. 2) Better diagnostics and screening. Screening is a big deal, in a sufficiently immature medical system you'll have people who die of cancer that never even get diagnosed. Start doing better screening and you will find and treat these cases earlier. The fact that one of the biggest increases was in prostate cancer supports this idea (at least to my layman's eye). Prostate cancer tends to remain benign for a long time so you won't catch it without screening. If you look at the right-hand column you will notice, compared to the West, there's barely any cancer in Africa! (Incidence rate is very low) Of course that isn't because no one gets cancer in Africa, it's because much of the population has limited access to screening/diagnoses. I don't think we need to leap to the conclusion that microplastics are causing cancer to skyrocket. In the developed world it is almost all good news. Incidence rates are flat to down over the last 30 years. Death rates are flat to dramatically down due to improved treatment. Here is a direct link https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/bmjonc/2/1/e000049/F3.la... reply nytesky 8 hours agoparentprevCould it because of decreased mortality from other factors like infectious disease or malnutrition, which would allow for cancer to rise to the top for cause of death? reply loeg 7 hours agorootparentYeah. If more people are living long enough to have cancer, you'll see more cancer. reply moralestapia 7 hours agorootparentFWIW, age expectancy has been above 50 y/o for a while, even in developing countries. reply bobthepanda 5 hours agorootparentThere is also the effect of improved health systems being able to diagnose more. You’re not going to get a cancer diagnosis if you don’t have access to a hospital. reply theGnuMe 7 hours agorootparentprevnot 80% more. reply sdenton4 7 hours agoparentprevWhen I was living in Kenya around 2013, open pit burning was the main way of dealing with trash... And included a lot of plastics, batteries, you name it. reply wyclif 3 hours agorootparentSame in a lot of developing countries. I'm in the Philippines right now and I've seen this not only here, but in other SE Asian countries. Of course, when I do, I seek to get as far away from it as possible as quickly as possible. It doesn't seem like the local governments do anything about it even when it's reported. reply deaddodo 7 hours agorootparentprevWhen I was in Armenia last year, this was the modus operandi for removing large amounts of trash also. Just throw it on the side of the road and burn it in heaps. reply jjeaff 6 hours agorootparentprevthat's how most of rural America still gets rid of trash. reply wyclif 3 hours agorootparentIt used to be 50 years ago. But the state where I'm from banned burning trash decades ago. I'm not saying people don't ever do it, but if you get caught you can be fined. reply dghughes 6 hours agorootparentprevPeople in rural areas here in Canada do that now in 2024. reply parentheses 6 hours agoparentprevThe quality of postmortems has probably improved globally but most in those places. One could imagine a cancer death in youth being treated like any death since the family/country is unable to afford autopsies for all suspicious deaths. reply raincole 8 hours agoparentprevIntuitively I thought it was about the developing countries are getting more industrialized and polluted. But perhaps both. reply abtinf 7 hours agorootparentYou think the undeveloped world has cleaner water and food than the industrialized world? reply margalabargala 7 hours agorootparentWater, no. Food, probably. A lot of the undeveloped world eats only locally produced food, minimally processed. Highly processed foods don't necessarily make it out there. As they start developing, they are able to import things with high levels of preservatives etc. reply deaddodo 7 hours agorootparentAs someone who's traveled the undeveloped world pretty heavily, you would be surprised at how bad the \"raw\" food quality is; especially if poverty is very high. Undeveloped doesn't mean \"without access to industrialized goods\", it just means industrial infrastructure of their own is lacking. You seem to be mixing undeveloped (Port au Prince, Khartoum, Dhaka, etc) up with \"tribal\". They still have access to pesticides, heavy metals, low-quality/toxic feeds, gasoline, etc; in addition to having generally very lax/non-existent regulations. reply bobthepanda 5 hours agorootparentprevTraditional foods or methods of cooking are not necessarily healthy. If eaten in excess cassava is high glycemic index like other Western starches, and stuff like cooking in animal fats is very unhealthy. A lot of obesity in developing economies comes from people who have experienced food scarcity overcompensating and overfeeding themselves and their children. reply wyclif 3 hours agorootparent>A lot of obesity in developing economies comes from people who have experienced food scarcity overcompensating and overfeeding themselves and their children. This is true and easily observable everywhere, even in advertising. I'm in the Philippines at the moment, and there's a trope in Filipino television advertising that includes the \"cute, chubby/fat kid.\" Having a chubby kid signifies to other Filipinos that you are middle class and have enough money and resources to overfeed your child. reply sva_ 7 hours agorootparentprevI'd prefer preservatives over contaminants like heavy metals. reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentprevThey use massive amounts of pesticides and have huge pollution issues due to burning trash and trash disposal problems, including out in fields. If you spend any time in India, for example? Holy moly. reply seanmcdirmid 8 hours agorootparentprevMore doctors to know that people aren’t just dropping dead from mysterious reasons. And more industrialization to have more cancer. I would bet more on the former than the latter. reply BirAdam 7 hours agorootparentprevEven with that, cancers metabolize sugars. The more sugars you put into your body, the faster and larger cancer cells can get. Add to this that sugars are inflammatory, and this heightens cancer risks. Add to both of those factors and increase in pollution and it’s just a perfect storm. reply nradov 7 hours agorootparentYou are probably referring to the Warburg effect. While there is a clear link between obesity and cancer, cutting sugar intake doesn't appear to be an effective cancer treatment. (It's still generally a good idea for other reasons, though.) https://www.mskcc.org/news/no-sugar-no-cancer-look-evidence reply aledalgrande 8 hours agoparentprevMy thinking is that they switched to a more westernized diet full of sugars, instead of their local food. But then again it could be a thousand factors together. reply AA-BA-94-2A-56 8 hours agorootparentI think a SAD puts upward pressure on this number, and modern healthcare puts downward pressure on it. reply aledalgrande 8 hours agorootparentAgreed! SAD = Standard American Diet for who doesn't know reply nytesky 7 hours agorootparentA truer acronym has never been coined. reply nytesky 7 hours agorootparentprevDow the rabbit hole I go, is it pronounced as S.A.D or “sad”. If it’s each letter (like CIA or FBI) it’s an initialism not an acronym; the latter should be pronounced as a word. Which befuddles my industry joke of TLA (three letter acronyms) since it is pronounced as T.L.A. Not “tella” reply AA-BA-94-2A-56 7 hours agorootparentI spend 0 time worrying about stuff like this. reply nradov 7 hours agorootparentprevModern healthcare is somewhat effective at detecting and treating cancer but does very little for prevention. The only really effective preventative intervention seems to be removing polyps during a colonoscopy before they have a chance to turn cancerous. reply bamboozled 7 hours agorootparentVaccines to prevent cervical cancer? reply nradov 6 hours agorootparentYes, good point. That one seems to be having a significant effect in the last few years. https://www.gardasil9.com/ reply lazyasciiart 7 hours agorootparentprevAlso hepatitis B vaccinations and screening for early enough detection to treat surgically. reply croemer 7 hours agoprevGarbage, read the responses, here's one: > Zhao et al report 79% increase in actual number of cases from 1990 to 2019, but this figure can be misleading, as it does not take account of population growth. The authors therefore also report estimated annual percent change (EAPC) of the incidence rates of various cancers. However, it is unfortunate that the press has largely focused on the overall number rather than the per capita risk of cancer, giving the impression that we are facing an epidemic of cancer in young individuals. https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049.responses The headline figure of 79% does not account at all for population increase. This is bad science (communication). > In 2019, the incidence number of early-onset cancer was 3.26 million, a 79.1% increase from 1990 (figure 1A,B). Incidence number simply counts cancers. Of course there are more cancers given world population increase. This should never be in a study headline. reply hn_throwaway_99 6 hours agoparentThank you very much - was skeptical of the headline, looking through the comments to find an explanation, so thank you for delivering. Another important quote from your source: > However, focusing on absolute case numbers does not take into account that the global population in the age group 15-49 increased by 45% and in the age group 40-49 (where most incident cases have occurred) by 86% during the study period (see Table S2). Both, age specific and age standardized rates show no increase in incidence in incidence and mortality for the period 1995 to 2020 (Figure 5). Age standardized mortality declined substantially during the study period. reply parentheses 6 hours agoparentprevThis was my immediate first question. The title and front matter would mention if. this is growth adjusted. I also think there are many forces at play. We've started: - consuming more packaged goods - selling unhealthy things as healthy - doing less physical labor - having more mental health problems at a young age I feel a study like this does nothing to tell us what the cause is, just noting the sensationalized effect. reply paulpauper 6 hours agoparentprevAlso, better detection of early cancers. Also in the past, cancer deaths may have been misattributed as something else. reply Gnarl 1 hour agoprevAs usual, no mention of pulse-modulated RF as a ubiquitous and ever increasing biological stressor. Its been shown and replicated how RF can potentiate effects of chemical carcinogens (Tillmann 2010, Lerchl 2015). Just an FYI. Refs: https://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09553001003734... https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S00062... reply atleastoptimal 8 hours agoprevAccording to this graph in the article, while age-adjusted incidence rate of cancers increased marginally from 1990 to 2019, age-adjusted death rate for both genders decreased dramatically https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/bmjonc/2/1/e000049/F5.la... reply SoylentOrange 6 hours agoparentLikely due to better treatments available over the past 30 years. reply loeg 7 hours agoprevPreviously: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37086982 , https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37125047 reply chiefalchemist 9 hours agoprevHow much of this is from actual increase in the disease, and how much is from earlier and more sensitive detection? reply iknowstuff 9 hours agoparentIt compares mortality so reply bsder 9 hours agorootparentUm, mortality ... basically didn't change? This diagram: https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/bmjonc/2/1/e000049/F1.la... Shows about 800K deaths in 1990 vs 1M deaths in 2019. That's 25% at best--or less when adjusted for population growth. And the proportions stayed roughly the same. That would strongly suggest that the increase is mostly detection. reply lumost 9 hours agorootparentAlso points towards frustratingly limited progress in cancer treatment efficacy. reply bsder 6 hours agorootparentSadly. However, I think that is about to change. Rapidly. I see biomed as broken into 3 eras much like any technical field--alchemy, science, and then engineering. The invention of PCR in 1984 is when biomed changed from being alchemy to being an actual science. The application of mRNA heralds the start of the era where biomed is switching to having progress from engineering rather than just science and some serendipitous luck. And once something switches to being engineering, it can be accelerated by education and money. reply potatoman22 8 hours agorootparentprevThe authors seem to think that cancer is less deadly now, but they also note that increased screening likely increases the prevalence of cancer: Introduction: \"Currently, it was reported that the promotion of cancer screening strategies and the exposure to risk factors in early life or young adulthood may increase incidence of early-onset cancer... Furthermore, changes in diet, lifestyle and environment since the turn of the 20th century, resulting in increased rates of obesity, physical inactivity, westernised diets and environmental pollution, may have affected the incidence of early-onset cancer. Additionally, alcohol, smoking and detrimental pregnancy exposures may have also affected the incidence of early-onset cancer\" Conclusion: \"Our study showed that the global morbidity of early-onset cancer increased from 1990 to 2019, while mortality and DALYs slightly decreased.\" reply chiefalchemist 7 hours agorootparentWell earlier detection and improved treatment is going to lower mortality rates. But that still doesn't prove cancer has increased. Note: I personally believe it probably has but such an opinion is not science. reply Solvency 9 hours agoparentprevOh not this refrain again... Yes, turns out PFAs, plastic, carcinogens, pollutants, roundup, radiation coverups, dumping barrels of chemicals into the oceans, inhaling brake dust, and all these other modern marvels we've created aren't good for us. reply streblo 9 hours agorootparentCitation needed. The paper specifically says: > Dietary risk factors (diet high in red meat, low in fruits, high in sodium and low in milk, etc), alcohol consumption and tobacco use are the main risk factors underlying early-onset cancers. reply tempsy 8 hours agorootparentThe red meat scare is ridiculous at this point. Are women under 50 who are now getting breast cancer really getting it because women are eating more red meat now than 1990? I don't buy it. Breast cancer is generally thought to be caused by excessively high estrogen levels. There are other environmental and dietary factors that contribute to increasing estrogen levels..eating a burger is not one of them. reply smt88 8 hours agorootparentRed meat is implicated in colon cancer, not breast cancer. reply tempsy 8 hours agorootparentThis specific paper pointed out breast cancer in women as one of the cancer types that has seen the highest increase in cases. reply wizzwizz4 8 hours agorootparentprev> Breast cancer is generally thought to be caused by excessively high estrogen levels. If by \"excessively high\", you mean the normal range for pre-menopausal adult women, then yes. Otherwise, citation needed. Afaik, breast cancer is thought to be caused primarily by having breast tissue, and secondarily by the response of breast tissue to normal levels of estrogen. (People with higher estrogen levels than average tend to have more breast tissue, but that's more because they tend to have breasts than because of any impact estrogen has on the rest of the body – unlike people with lower estrogen levels than average, who tend to be men.) And yes, estrogen blockers / SERMs are a good treatment for some breast cancers, but they don't eliminate breast cancer risk. Even cis men who have relatively low estrogen levels and hardly any breast tissue can get breast cancer. reply tempsy 8 hours agorootparent\"Estrogen a more powerful breast cancer culprit than we realized\" https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/05/estrogen-a-mo... reply wizzwizz4 7 hours agorootparentThis article buries the lede, but boy is that lede fascinating. > Estrogen receptors are known to bind to certain regions of the genome when a cell is stimulated by estrogen. The researchers found that these estrogen-binding sites were frequently next to the zones where the early DNA breaks took place. Estrogens are important for other things, so (what's effectively) menopause would be a rather impractical preventative measure for most people – but knowledge is still power.

A “toxin” is a naturally occuring poison, such as snake venom. The word you're looking for is the umbrella term “toxicant”.

For better or worse and as much as lots of people wanted to push back against it, you're just going to have to accept that \"toxin\" has become a general term now no longer tied to just naturally occurring poisons. Words evolve, they change with use. It's like the people dying on that pedantry hill over \"literally\" being now used in slang to just mean \"a lot / really significantly\" rather than \"how something appears in literature\".

The “western” medicine still neglects TCM and its learnings, primarily focusing on doctrine and enforced lessons of medicine (if we may call it so), but more appropriately post-medicine which is or can be more or less effective after the disease has developed to a visible to sensory state. It will take some time (or more given the current condition in which the westerns are more concerned in shipping and producing the weapons than raising the vibration of their planetary bodies) to understand that post-condition-medicione is negligible against preventive medicine and if they will want to preserve health in their human bodies, something radical will need to be changed (which will be a challenge for their established trajectory of thought but the appropriate holistic approach to health and medicine of the future). reply primax 7 hours agoparentIf anything in TCM worked and wasn't risky, what would stop big pharma putting it in a pill or lotion? Alternative medicine that works becomes medicine. reply mav3ri3k 8 hours agoprev [–] I read through the article. Let me share a small story. I recently completed course for Global Warming in College. I would say my instructor was a quite good. He gave the vibe more of a person in industry who taught than a teacher who published papers. Naturally in course of Global Warming we had figures about how much the globe is warming. We have already raised average temperature by few degree. Current goal of global climate organization is to limit any further increase to 1.5 C and at max, at most dire 2 C. Changes to climate are already somewhat irreversible. So this figure of 1.5 is very sensitive and important. Now this is all good but who decides these numbers ? Who is going to take initiative to meet goals ? Who's fault it was to reach these numbers ? Moral: These are very loaded figures. Enough to make small naive children make protests and the world to notice. The numbers are very diluted based on agenda. Cancer patients might have increased, seems very plausible. But did the study account population increase or simply number of people reporting ? I don't think so. We all want to make world a better place but take these numbers with a grain of salt. reply Wolfenstein98k 8 hours agoparentIf your claim is as it appears - \"this study may not have adjusted for population growth\" - you could just click the link and check, rather than spread doubt and uncertainty. As it stands, the population has not grown 80% in the timespan given so even if they didn't control for population - which would be the most elementary mistake ever and no one would get published having made it - it still doesn't account for the effect size. Reflexive scepticism, without any effort to verify, isn't any more useful than reflexive belief. reply friend_and_foe 6 hours agorootparentInterestingly, if you do click the article, you'll find that they did not control for population. The 80% figure is in absolute nominal terms. It's more than the most elementary mistake, it's downright deceptive. reply lazyasciiart 6 hours agoparentprevYou just took a course on Global Warming and you don’t know where the IPCCC target figures come from? Hopefully that’s because you slept through most of the course, because if it wasn’t even covered that is a pretty fundamental set of information to ignore. Here you go: http://www.climate.gov/news-features/features/whats-number-m... reply evrydayhustling 8 hours agoparentprevWait - your first paragraph has nothing to do with your moral. What's \"diluted\"? It seems like you want to say \"be skeptical about numbers.\". Fine. But what does that have to do with the course? reply mav3ri3k 6 hours agorootparentMy entire post very was poorly structured. Properly conveying experiences is hard in text, my bad. Just be cautious when you see big scary numbers. reply Wolfenstein98k 8 hours agorootparentprevThe course taught them just how much they should be sceptical of numbers reply greenthrow 8 hours agoparentprev [–] Of course the study is looking at cases per N people.

However, has anyone been using something like this with Google: \" site:blogpost.com OR site:github.io OR site:wordpress.com OR site:medium.com OR site:substack.com\"? And occasionally throwing in reddit.com and news.ycombinator.com as well. Google seems to be slightly biased towards github.io and medium.com, but I've quite recently found that it is a great way to browse the web. The above search command is similar to what these niche search engines are doing but gets much more diverse results. Sure, it is likely to miss certain niche blogs. However, this is where adding site:news.ycombinator.com comes to the rescue - good niche blog posts are highly likely to eventually appear here. It is far from a panacea, but I have found the experience to be quite decent. I have this command lying around in my shell and notes, so I just copy-paste it and add on to it. reply robrenaud 19 hours agoprevWhat kind of queries do you handle well?

For instance, if you try to select the footer element, to block it, instead of the site showing you \"#footer\" (or something legible), it shows you something like \".lg\\:px-8.sm\\:px-6.px-4.max-w-7xl.mx-auto > .py-16\". As well as it adding a \"?ref=feedle.world\" in all links you click by default. Also it would be nice an option that automatically loads more when you scroll down. Oh, and that \"Welcome to feedle!\" popup seems like dark pattern to me. reply SamWhited 19 hours agoparentI would have said the same thing about infinite scrolling; that always feels like a dark pattern to me because it makes it hard to find specific results again, hard (or impossible) to get to any links in the page footer, etc. I always just want a single page that I can link back to later :) reply hexage1814 18 hours agorootparentTo me, I think it depends on what is the goal when you are searching something and what is that data in particular. Infinite scroll and pagination offer different user experience proposes, and make different assumptions about the user. To give a blatant example where I don't see a pagination system making that much sense, pagination on a personalized news feed of some social media. That information is changing constantly. It's a never-ending information stream. Even in the case here, if you are searching for a blog or podcast, you could just link that blog article rather than the page search where you found that article. Especially in a situation where you don't have any interaction with that content aside clicking on it. Especially when the search engine doesn't seem to have millions of results, which seems to be the case here, it seems to be a relatively small list of blogs submitted to this site. Infinite scroll on the other hand have some problems especially in situations where you are expect to interact with that content one way or the other (such as a commentary section). In fact, when dealing with really large amounts of data, it essentially buries that data. Think about a commentary section with 60.000 commentaries. Essentially 98% of them are hidden way because the browser will crash before loading them. So if you decide to go down infinite scroll route, I think the very least you could do would be offer another way to search for stuff, such as search option inside the commentary section (although nobody does that). But I think a pagination system would be better in that situation. Anyway, just some food for thoughts. reply ktosobcy 18 hours agorootparentActually because of the infinite scroll and basically mental way that social media works I gave it up... No, it's not constantly changing. There was a publication at rhw certain time and it can be shown at that time (ideally you can have inbox with unread entries). Right no it's impossible to follow anything in any sane manner... to that end I use only RSS and from social perspective I added a couple of reddit sub feeds there and that's all... reply quest88 18 hours agorootparentprevIMO pagination makes sense with feeds when a feed can be sorted in some ordering. I'd rather jump to page 6 instead of scrolling and scrolling and scrolling to get back. reply Starlevel004 18 hours agoparentprevThis is the end result of the tailwindification of the internet. reply l5870uoo9y 18 hours agoparentprevIts TailwindCSS.

I do think the article makes him a bit overly sympathetic and glosses over some of his eccentricities. Like the fact that he seems to really think he can build a nuclear fusion reactor from an old MRI machine and I guess all of the Nem saga: https://whoispontifier.wordpress.com/2018/05/14/the-journey-... I still haven’t decided if all this is or isn’t some sort of elaborate performance art, but I appreciate the effort in any case. And even though I think he’s probably a few cards short of a deck, you do kind of root for him in the end. reply mikea1 10 hours agoparent> you do kind of root for him in the end I'm rooting for him too. He doesn't have all the qualities of a classic protagonist, yet I find myself hoping that he succeeds in his madcap endeavors. I admire his grit: I would have not had his fortitude in the face of violent threats nor withstand the constant frustration. reply pard68 8 hours agoparentprevI'm not anywhere near knowledgeable enough to chime in on the feasibility of creating a nuclear reactor from a MRI machine, but there is this guy in Floyd, Virginia who has created a nuclear reactor from some old medical equipment, so maybe it's possible with a MRI machine too? reply ThrustVectoring 7 hours agorootparentNuclear fission is relatively straightforward so long as you either don't know or don't care about the health risks of radiation. It's just a pile of spicy rocks at the end of the day. Fusion, on the other hand, requires you to get center-of-sun temperatures and pressures going on to work properly. That usually requires either extremely difficult engineering processes or a fission bomb (and more precise engineering calculations but they're actually reasonably solvable). reply jmopp 56 minutes agorootparentI always thought fusion was easier than fission, since all* you really need is water and electricity — the problem being that it's currently impossible to get more energy than what you put in * I am eliding over the fact that building a Farnsworth fusor is still a challenge, but less of a challenge than sourcing, purifying, and enriching uranium certainly. reply alright2565 4 hours agorootparentprevI don't know exactly what he's doing, but fusion is pretty easy to do: https://www.instructables.com/Build-A-Fusion-Reactor/ reply whatshisface 2 hours agorootparentI don't know about easy, but hundreds of people have accomplished this as a hobby project using the Farnsworth design, including a handful of very disciplined teenagers. reply adastra22 1 hour agorootparentprevNuclear reactors are easy. Nuclear fusion is not. At least not a useful fusion reactor. reply ashleyn 12 hours agoprevReading this was difficult. * What exactly was his plan for the building? I don't see anything coherent. One moment it's a makerspace, another it's a music warehouse, then it's a science museum. Was there a coherent plan? $281k is a lot of money to spend with no real plan. * The city allegedly giving him grief. I'm still not sure if this was preventable or not considering the bit about how he failed to submit building plans. If your plan is to own a significant chunk of this city, you're going to have to play better politics than repeatedly being asked to leave at public functions. Palm-greasing would be a far better strategy than righteous anger. Maybe a fraction of that $900k could've opened a nice park they always wanted. Maybe the PD needs a new bearcat. Something. * Living in a tent on the lot instead of hiring security. This bit was straight out of some episode of a sitcom. This is a depressed flyover country town. If you couldn't afford security then you couldn't afford the building. Again, a good chunk of that $900k would cover round-the-clock security for at least a year. Righteous indignation over the crime isn't an actual cost-cutting measure. * The land is cheap for a reason. The way a town gets revitalised is external value flows in. How would the makerspace-warehouse-museum thing bring that value into the city? Even if all this did pan out, I'd predict an entirely new problem he'd have, which is no willing customers outside of a 200 mile radius. I don't get why people make cockeyed \"investments\" like these when the S&P 500 is sitting right there at a nice 8% a year. No bums, no politics, no thinking it through at all really. Just buy it and don't touch it. If your idea can't do better than that intersection of earnings and effort, don't bother with it. reply resolutebat 11 hours agoparentHe was living in a tent and subsisting off ramen until he landed the $900k windfall, which he proceeded to squander on unrelated properties. But yeah, the total lack of security is astonishing, you'd think he could afford to hire a security guard: the main theft happened after he got the windfall and could easily have paid for it. reply thepasswordis 9 hours agorootparent>which he proceeded to squander on unrelated properties. He bought 74 parcels of land in the town, including a house which he moved into, for around $140k. reply resolutebat 9 hours agorootparentBuying a house for himself makes sense, but it's still not related to the business, and the other 73 are just dead weight. reply whatshisface 2 hours agorootparentI don't see why everyone's trying to prove that they're smarter than this guy. If the town turns around it'll have been a great real estate gamble. May we all live long enough to see the outcome. reply bbarnett 2 hours agorootparentPlus, the 74 houses were all part of the same auction! That's what I gathered at least. And there are benefits to those houses. He could, for example, pick nicer ones and hire people for security and give them free rent in a house as part of their job. With what he paid, he could even give them a \"rent to own\" mortgage! He could include the house, and even just minimum wage. Minimum wage is a livable wage in a very, very economically depressed area (look at what housing costs here!), but at the same time, minimum wage + free housing or rent to own housing is a great wage. He could start a hacker hostel. Those houses give loads of opportunity. He just needs to stabilize things a bit. But security would do that. Especially if security = 20 people. He just needs a real business plan, or at least to move towards something. Another way to look at it is, imagine if he used the house to hire security, maintenance people, groundskeepers, cleaning personelle/janitors, and on and on. Now, he's a major employer in the area.

Step back man, people can do what they want, they make mistakes, they have grand plans that sometimes fail. > “The Overconfident Optimist and His Ill-Advised DIY Project.” This is what I mean. The article just started and he's defining his conclusion for all readers. Then, he compares Fenley to a \"Child-destroying slackline\" (which apparently never actually hurt anyone?). Fenley bought some property and tried to artistic type stuff. It is really slimy to compare him to such a horrible thing as hurting a child. That linked tweet is another \"we know better\" type of guy who's telling someone else how wrong they are. Yeah, doing risky stuff is risky, and I definitely don't think kids should (or would) be allowed to ride that thing, but I think they'd figure it out real quick (possibly after the creator died testing it). This is really a cultural thing - puritan types freaking HATE how unplanned, disorganized, and free/careless other cultural groups are in the US (i.e. appalachian/borderer people). So reading this as straight up cultural mockery/status management/ridicule makes it clear. Its basically equivalent to a 19th century \"lets go to other countries and laugh at people's behavior\" type of travelogue by northeast USA \"know better than you\" types criticizing other cultural groups for the behavior they don't like (monster trucks, bbq, hotdog eating competitions, basically anything that's just not done in the uptight north-east USA) Also: author, did you personally ever make 900k from a patent?

    "originBody": "Lapdev Self-hosted remote development enviroment management with ease Lapdev is a self hosted application that spins up remote development environments on your own servers or clouds. It scales from a single machine in the corner to a global fleet of servers. It uses Devcontainer open specification for defining your development environment as code. If you’re interested in a deep dive into how Lapdev works, you can read about its architecture here. Features Self hosted with ease: Lapdev is designed to be self hosted with minimum efforts for installation and maintenance. The application is designed to just work, sparing you from digging too deep into the internals for troubleshooting. Horizontal scalability: With a simple yet powerful architecture, Lapdev can scale from a single machine to a fleet of servers, so that you can have a development environment management system that can grow with your developer teams. Development Environment as Code: Using the Devcontainer open specification, Lapdev allows you to define your development environment as code. This empowers you to standardize development environments that can be replicated across different developers, avoiding environment related issues and ensuring a consistent setup for everyone. Save Onboarding Time: Onboarding developers to new projects don't need hours or days to prepare the environment on their machines. They can start to code instantly. Planned Features More workspace types: Currently Lapdev only supports container based workspaces, which has its own limitations for example when you want to run a k8s cluster in your development flow. It's planned to have support for more than containers. VMs and bare metal machine support are on the roadmap. And more OS support is planned as well, e.g. when you are developing a cross platform desktop application for Windows, Linux and macOS, Lapdev can spin up development environments on all of them and you can develop and debug from the same local machine without the need to switch machines. Installation You can see the installation steps here. Build from source Contributing",

Being able to use devcontainers on local server hardware without monthly fees (and/or hetzner servers) sounds great. Up until now we’d been making do with docker-compose and JetBrains’s remote SSH dev; this should be significantly better. reply theK 15 hours agoparentI spent more than a year living with the numerous downsides of high level CDE (containerized development environment) tools. I must admit that I am very skeptical about all options available right now and that I have rolled back to using plain, old school, docker compose based CDE. Both .devcontainers and .devfile managed to create more effort than they took away. Some key points: - long lived containers - abstracting away the fact that you run stuff inside containers in the IDE and abstracting away the container life cycle - cryptic error states and error messages, especially when setting up new projects from scratch. This often boiled down to bad plugins (even Microsoft's own VSCode plugins wet the bed often) - only superficial support for podman - bad support for arm based HW (and arch translation issues, like a tool requesting arm containers but the host running docker is x64) At this point I consult teams to try out a plain compose.yml as a CDE and skip the \"enterprise\" stuff. reply WhatIsDukkha 15 hours agorootparentThis seems to be podman focused from what I see. reply theK 13 hours agorootparentNo, not really.

The alternative is what Coder does -- write some arbitrary terraform to bring up or down a workspace. I think this is better because I tend to need other things to go in a workspace (like an IAM role to access dev databases, associated Kubernetes resources, etc). With terraform I can configure whatever infrastructure I want to go along with workspaces. The main downside I can see is that users have to write their workspaces for a particular deployment target. This would be a problem for e.x. open source projects trying to check in a workspace definition file of some kind. We standardize on Kubernetes across clouds and bare metal so it's not an issue for us, but it makes sense that it would be an issue for other use cases. reply krm01 10 hours agoprevNice!

It's installed on a remote server so it provides remote environments. If you use VSCode remote, then you can \"open\" it through VSCode remote ssh.

Can I just ask, what value does this spec provide that a simple docker image containing the necessary tools does not already provide? Why do we need another layer on top? What am I missing? reply owyn 15 hours agoparentWell, developers seem to love writing \"configuration\" rather than \"code\" these days. But basically a container + the necessary tools IS a devcontainer. It's just a way of automating the \"putting in the necessary tools\" part especially if you need things that might need to be added to a base container, or services that need to be configured differently based on the external environment that you don't want to bake in for some reason. If you've ever had to cut and paste a 50 line docker run command snippet but you forgot that one volume mount or port or ENV var that someone added a dependency on last week then you pretty quickly realize just doing complex docker things by hand is a pain. Another example, if you have a script that you want to run to fetch the latest authentication token from a vault after the container launches because you don't want to store it inside the container. Sure, you could write a bash script to run all these steps inside the container after you launch it but it's nice to have a config file to share with another dev and just say: use this. And the secondary benefit is that having a config file for the editor (like VSCode) so that plugins can manage all of that stuff better. Generally a dev container runs the VSCode Server, and they know how to talk to each other which can make remote development easier. For example, now I can launch the same dev environment locally or on the 56 core xeon 1TB ram server at the office and it's exactly the same as far as the editor is concerned. It looks like this project is an alternative to the VSCode Server. My team generally uses docker-compose for this since not everyone uses VSCode. reply salamander014 14 hours agorootparentFor the first bit, all I can think is a compose file. Also podman can run k8s configs locally, which I personally hope all of that eventually washes into the same thing. It feels like we already have the tools to make this a \"solved\" problem, is what I'm trying to say. I just include an additional .env that the compose file pulls in so it's not committed to git. For the second point, ok this makes a little bit more sense, I've heard of Codespaces or OpenShift Dev Spaces but I guess I still question the value of additional complexity on top of the container (a simple dockerfile in my mind) your vscode instance's terminal is running in. Thanks for the info. reply bitwize 15 hours agoparentprevIt makes it easy to point the tool at a Git repo, have it automagically create a containerized environment for that repo with all its dependencies, and open Visual Studio Code on the codebase inside that remote containerized environment.

A native of rural Henan, Zhang and his family had only known hard times. The area was always on the verge of famine, and that made many people interested in the Chinese Communist Party’s appeal to social justice and economic development. In Zhang’s case, the Party was also an ersatz family. His mother had died when he was seven and, in his telling, his stepmother had treated him cruelly. At 13, he ran away from home, never to return. He worked as an apprentice car mechanic and then joined the People’s Liberation Army in 1948 as a 16-year-old. When China entered the Korean War in 1950, he volunteered and was wounded when his convoy was strafed by US fighter planes. His neck was permanently damaged and in 1954 he was discharged. He took advantage of policies favoring veterans and entered Lanzhou University’s history department. That began his disillusionment with how the Communists were running China. He thought a university would have a magnificent library but found that most books were under lock and key. Lanzhou University didn’t even possess a complete set of the Confucian classics — the basic texts used over the centuries by all literate people — let alone cutting-edge journals. Teaching was worse, with one lecturer for 100 students. Zhang Chunyuan in 1956 When the Hundred Flowers Campaign began in 1956, in which the Party encouraged citizens to voice their opinions, Zhang criticized the lack of books and poor teaching. For that, he was accused of trying to overthrow the university and in May 1958, as part of the Anti-Rightist Campaign, he was exiled with a group of forty other students and faculty to Tianshui, a city in the southeast of Gansu province at the boundary of the Loess Plateau and the Qinling Mountains. In Tianshui, traditional society was being torn apart. Mao’s violent revolution had left temples dedicated to folk deities empty and desecrated. Farms were still divided into small plots for farmers to grow their traditional crop of wheat and sorghum, but every square inch of land in the People’s Republic actually belonged to the state. And for the sharp-eyed, new buildings hinted at the state’s unbridled power. One housed the local Communist Party offices, where Beijing’s orders were disseminated to villagers. Another was a new garage, which held a tractor — the first promise of the Party’s pledge to modernize rural life. The village had just one of the machines, and the farmers shared it. In the past, life centered around communal religious life; now it was to revolve around a new god, science, and its guardian: the Communist Party. Zhang took up his job at the tractor station with gusto, fixing and driving the valuable piece of equipment. At night he even wrote a film script, “Children of China and North Korea,” which talked about the ties binding the two socialist countries. He used a pseudonym to send it to a movie studio that was sponsoring a competition, and won a prize worth 700 yuan, a small fortune back in the 1950s. The script was set to be produced until the studio delved deeper into the mysterious author and realized that it had been written by a convicted Rightist. Zhang, though, was irrepressible. As a boy he was given the nickname “Screw” for being unbreakable when his mind was set on something. That made him cut out to lead the other students, because he had the toughness to do more than just talk — he could get things done. But his uncompromising attitude also led him to take huge risks. In Tianshui, he once heard that a classmate was being detained by railway police several hundred miles south for having illegally ridden the rails to escape the Great Famine of 1959. Zhang forged an identity card as a Public Security officer and traveled down to straighten out the situation. He bluffed his way past railway guards and local police to get the young man released, returning in triumph, convinced that he could achieve anything. Pictures of Tan Chanxue (together with other members of Spark magazine on the right, in 1959) The group of exiled students often met at Zhang’s tractor station. It was conveniently located on the main road, and Zhang was an amiable and thoughtful host. Broad and strong, with thick eyebrows and a square face, he had sensitive eyes and loved to read. His knowledge complemented his war experiences, which made him more mature than the bookish students. But he didn’t lecture or talk down to them, instead engaging them in long conversations about their country’s future. One point he returned to time and again was how they, even though just exiled students, were duty-bound to help their country. “He really opposed those who only thought of themselves,” Tan Chanxue, one of the students, recalled in her memoirs. “He never thought that his own liberty counted for much.” Famine was taking hold, and the students saw the gruesome effects firsthand. They were able to withstand the lack of food, but they saw the elderly, the weak, and the very young slowly die In more densely populated areas farther east, the students probably would never have been able to meet at a place like Zhang’s tractor shed. Tianshui, however, was remote and poor, and local officials were eager to promote literacy. So they set up an open university, appointing the students as faculty. That gave the young people an excuse to meet and travel around the region. These face-to-face meetings, they realized, were crucial. Working alone resulted in nothing. A pebble can’t break a rock, Tan said, but perhaps many pebbles tied tightly together could smash it. Everyone in the group became good friends, but Tan and Zhang were particularly close, later declaring themselves to be husband and wife. A slender 24-year-old with thin, arching eyebrows, Tan came from southern China’s Guangdong province near the Hong Kong border. While Zhang was bullheaded and brusque, she was gentle, with calm eyes and a reasonable demeanor. There were many obstacles to a love in a famine-ridden land run by a totalitarian dictatorship, but their feelings blossomed. Soon, they would risk their lives to prove their love. By May 1959, the group was debating issues such as how to rid China of the Communist Party, or at least the current leadership that had caused the famine. Zhang said there were two options: a top-down coup or a bottom-up revolution. The latter seemed impossible and so they hoped that Mao’s peers would act. And in fact, something along these lines is what some people in Beijing were planning. Over the summer, one of China’s most-decorated military leaders, Peng Dehuai, challenged Mao for causing the famine, but Mao held a pivotal meeting in the mountain-top retreat of Lushan. Peng was crushed and Mao redoubled his economic policies, causing the famine to deepen, eventually taking up to 45 million lives. When Peng’s downfall was made public, the students felt certain that they had to act: if even a general at the top could be persecuted for expressing loyal dissent, then the only hope was to foment something at the grass roots. They thought that their best bet was to publish material on the famine in hopes of sharing ideas and opening up officials’ eyes to what was going on in the countryside. They began to think of publishing a journal. The idea remained vague until they came across a remarkable poem. It was written by a student at Peking University, Lin Zhao, who had been studying in Beijing until she was labeled a Rightist for defending friends who were being persecuted. Lin’s poems galvanized the students, showing them the power of the written word. Lin Zhao (undated) Like Zhang, Lin was more experienced than many of the younger students. Born in 1932, she had worked as a propagandist for the Communists shortly after their takeover in 1949. At the time, she went along with their violent policies and participated in the land reform campaigns that saw hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of property owners murdered — a genocide aimed at eliminating the elite that had run China before the revolution. But with time she began to see that the Communists were not building a utopia but a tightly controlled authoritarian state. As a young girl in pre-Communist China, she had attended a Methodist girl’s school. Now she returned to her faith and experimented with art to express her independence from the party. When her friends were arrested, she wrote a poem declaring: The power of truth never lies in the arrogant air of the guardians of truth. Lin later wrote a 240-line poem called “Seagull” and circulated it among friends. One friend was the sister of a member of the group of Tianshui students. The woman mailed a handwritten copy of the poem to the exiled students, who were thrilled by Lin’s bold imagery and overtly political message. The poem tells the story of a ship carrying chained prisoners. Their crime: they seek freedom. Freedom, I cry out inside me, freedom! The thought of you has filled my heart with yearning, like a choking man gasping for air, like one dying of thirst lurching toward a spring. Zhang decided that he had to meet the author. After being arrested in Beijing, Lin was released after her chronic tuberculosis worsened, and she began spitting up blood. She moved back to her hometown of Suzhou on China’s east coast. She was immediately put under close surveillance. But Zhang once again took another huge risk, using his forged identity papers to travel days by train and then arranging to meet her. Lin urged Zhang not to print her poem, seeing it a risk to the group and to anyone who read it. But then Zhang read Lin’s second poem, a 368-line work called “A Day in Prometheus’s Passion.” It used Christ-like motifs that reflected Lin’s renewed Christian faith. The poem tells of an encounter between Zeus and Prometheus, who is chained to a rock for giving humans fire. Zeus explains that his punishment is necessary because humans must never have such an important tool: But you ought to know, Prometheus, for the mortals, we do not want to leave even a spark. Fire is for the gods, for incense and sacrifice, how can the plebeians have it for heating or lighting in the dark? Zhang convinced Lin to let them publish the poem and decided to put it in the first issue of their new journal. Students from Beijing also passed him materials about how Yugoslavian Communists were trying a hybrid form of socialism that allowed for capitalist-style incentives (something the Communist Party would embrace twenty years later). Zhang decided to add that material, too, to the inaugural issue, as well as essays by himself and others in the group. The journal needed a name. They quickly settled on Spark (星火), based on the idiomatic expression xinghuo liaoyuan, or “a single spark can start a prairie fire.” Mao had also used it in one of his essays, making it widely known. A pebble can’t break a rock, Zhang’s partner Tan Chanxue said, but perhaps many pebbles tied tightly together could smash it Two members of the group, physics student Miao Qingjiu and chemistry student Xiang Chengjian, were entrusted with printing the first issue. They had been assigned to work at a sulfuric acid plant in the nearby town of Wushan. The plant had an old mimeograph machine, which they could occasionally access. Their jobs also required them to cultivate bacteria used to make fertilizer, a process that required a sealed-off space. This allowed them to bar themselves in the room with the mimeograph machine, claiming that they were making the bacteria. The cover page of Spark’s first issue The two spent eight nights in January 1960 carving the plates by hand — there was no typesetting or other equipment available. The process, though, was too slow. Miao and Xiang would eventually have to open their office, which would endanger the enterprise. As always, Zhang came up with the solution. Inside his tractor shed was an old motor. He gave it to Miao and Xiang, who sold it to their factory cheaply. They used the proceeds to buy a used mimeograph machine. The group kept that at the home of Gu Yan, a graduate student in physics, who lived near Zhang. He also carved essays on that machine’s drums, and drew the magazine’s logo, a torch with a flame leaping upward. They ran off thirty copies. Spark was born. At just eight pages, handwritten, and with no photos or graphics, Spark was primitive. But it was filled with articles that got to the heart of China’s conundrum — then and now. The lead article on the first page by Gu Yan set the tone. Called “Give Up Your Fantasies and Prepare to Fight!” it asked questions that Chinese people have posed time and again over the decades: Why did the once progressive Communist Party become so corrupt and reactionary less than ten years after coming to power, with complaints and rebellions at home, and falling into an embarrassing situation abroad? This is because the people’s world is regarded as its private property, and all matters are managed by party members. One key problem was due to “idol worship” — alluding to the personality cult surrounding Mao Zedong. But it also pointed to broader problems, such as the state’s unlimited powers: “political oligarchs being arrogant, and perverted. If such a dictatorship insists on calling it socialism, it should be a kind of National Socialism monopolized by a political oligopoly. It is of the same type as Nazi National Socialism and has nothing in common with real socialism.” Writing about the famine, Zhang Chunyuan penned an essay simply titled “Food Matters.” He blamed the Chinese Communist Party for exploiting the farmers: “Today’s ruler, like any ruler in history, used the peasant revolution to climb Tiananmen Square and ascended to the throne.” After that, China’s new rulers trampled on the farmers, leaving them no better than serfs. In another essay, he pointed to the lack of land ownership as a key problem facing farmers. A few months later, the students met again and decided to make Spark a regular publication. The goal was to mail it to high-level officials in five major cities — Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi’an — where the students had contacts. They began writing more essays, including Zhang Chunyuan’s “On People’s Communes,” which dissected how farmers lost their property, and Xiang Chengjian’s “Letter to the People,” a takedown of top leaders: When millions, tens of millions of farmers starve to death on their beds, on trains, by railroads, at the bottom of a ditch, when hundreds of millions (400 million) people are dying of starvation, when the other 200 million are half-starved. When they are full, those animals who “wholeheartedly” serve the people and are “people’s servants” can buy any snacks, biscuits, candies. … They feasted and walked away (who would dare to ask them for food stamps), and as soon as they arrived, the meal was served. Xiang continued in this vein by pointing out the moral relativism of China’s top leaders. Decades before Mao’s private doctor shocked the world with his tales of Mao’s sex with young women, Xiang pointed out the hypocrisy of the older men who led China. While appealing to steadfastness and loyalty, they had taken up with younger women, casting aside their wives who had suffered with them while they were fighting for the revolution. Even worse, information had come to light during the Anti-Rightist Campaign showing that many officials freely took the daughters and wives of persecuted families. Lin Zhao’s poem “Seagull” was also slotted into this issue. It was engraved onto cylinders in addition to Zhang’s “On People’s Communes.” While they were figuring out the logistics of engraving and then distributing their new issue, they ran off 300 copies of Zhang’s article because of its importance in analyzing the root causes of the famine. The idea was to mail out that article first and follow it up with the full issue. As the second issue neared publication, the group began to debate what to do next. They decided they needed some sort of organization and ways to spread their appeal beyond the narrow group of exiled students. They also felt that someone had to escape from China and find help, or at least get more information about the situation in other socialist countries, such as Yugoslavia. Maybe this would help their country find a way forward. The journal’s name was based on the idiomatic expression “a single spark can start a prairie fire,” used by Mao in one of his essays Tan Chanxue decided to try to seek help in Hong Kong. She was from Guangzhou, the metropolis not far from the British colony, and she figured she could make her way across the border. The students were some twelve hundred miles away, but China was in such chaos that it wouldn’t appear odd if a university student traveled back to her hometown to find food. So she made her way south by train and stayed with an aunt. The two women decided to flee together to Hong Kong and hired a human smuggler to spirit them across the border. They dressed as peasant women and walked to a village near the border. The smuggler, however, was inexperienced and led the women straight into the hands of the local militia, who detained them in Shenzhen — back then still a village, and not today’s city of nearly 20 million. They tried to play the role of peasants, hoping to be let off with a warning for having strayed too close to the border. So when they were allowed out to do manual labor by collecting firewood, the two did so barefoot, although their soft feet were quickly cut by the rough terrain. Still, no one seemed aware of her true identity until Tan made a fatal mistake. One day, a guard told Tan that if she wanted to post a letter, he would carry it out and post it. She was supposed to be illiterate but decided to use the chance to warn the group around Spark that she had been detained. A few weeks later, she realized her error. She was taken in for interrogation and asked if she knew a man named Gao Chengqing. This was Zhang Chunyuan’s pen name. How did they know about him? The letter itself wasn’t a trap. It had been delivered, and Zhang had quickly heard that his sweetheart had been detained. He decided to rescue her, just as he had helped out his friend a year earlier. He used the same forged identity card, which gave his identity as his pen name, Gao Chengqing, and traveled south. But the women were being held in a reform-through-labor facility, which was much stricter than the railway police he had fooled before. The prison’s officials immediately saw through his ruse and put him under arrest. Because they didn’t know his real identity, they booked him by his pen name. Feigning illness, Zhang met a female doctor who was also a prisoner. Feeling he could trust her, he told her that he and Tan were husband and wife and asked her to pass Tan notes. He wrote several, many of them professing his love and hope for a life after imprisonment. He used an intimate form of address, using only the last character of her given name, xue, which means “snow.” Snow! It must be a match made in heaven that we can go to jail together. Our feelings will transcend all time and space. May we go out and in, life and death together! The days to come will be long. Take care! But the doctor wasn’t willing to risk her future for a man she didn’t know. She could gain by informing on him and, anyway, he himself might be a trick to test her. All of Zhang’s love letters ended up in the authorities’ hands. The authorities sent a political prisoner to live with Zhang in his cell as a spy. The man befriended Zhang, who again fell for the ploy. Zhang confessed everything, not only their hopes to escape but the existence of Spark. Soon, Zhang and Tan were on a train back to Lanzhou for trial. By September 1960, the magazine was shut down and the case was cracked. In what became the fourth largest “counter-revolutionary” incident in the country, 43 people were arrested in connection with Spark, including 12 university students, two professors, two graduate students, and 25 farmers. Revenge was swift. The Party convened a “Ten-Thousand-Person Sentencing Conference” in Lanzhou to hand down the sentences to those who were still in Tianshui. Zhang Chunyuan got life in prison. The students who carved the drums, Miao Qingjiu and Xiang Chengjian, got 20 and 18 years. Others got between 15 and five years. Tan Chanxue spent 14 years in prison for membership in a “Rightist counterrevolutionary clique.” After that, she was forced to take a factory job in Jiuquan, the city near the Jiabiangou labor camp and the satellite launch facility. It was only after her rehabilitation in 1980 that she could leave the factory. She later joined the Dunhuang Research Academy before retiring to Shanghai in 1998. During a trip back to Tianshui in the 1990s, she met people who still knew her case. Once, a woman grasped her hands and said, “You have suffered so!” Tan could only burst into tears. She was lucky compared to many of the others. The security apparatus quickly picked up those who had fled Gansu. In Shanghai, the physics student Gu Yan, who had come up with the magazine’s name and logo, received a 17-year sentence. The prison term for Lin Zhao, the poet whose work inspired Zhang to launch the journal, was 20. Many fought their fate, especially Zhang. In July 1961, he feigned illness and was admitted to hospital. During the midday siesta, while everyone was overcome by the summer heat, he changed into street clothes and walked out of the hospital. He hitched a ride to a nearby town, then walked 19 kilometers to a logging camp where a friend worked. He lived in his friend’s logging hut, regained his strength, and then set off to Shanghai to see what had become of his friends. He found that Gu Yan had already been arrested. Then he went to the neighboring city of Suzhou to learn that Lin Zhao had also been arrested. He wrote her a postcard, signing it with her mother’s name but figuring that she would recognize his handwriting: “Our life is so rich in materials that we could write a novel that hasn’t been seen in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad. I hope you can read this book, this book that cost us so dearly.” Zhang then moved on to the nearby city of Hangzhou, feeling guilty that he was free while his friends were in prison. It’s a measure of the turmoil in China brought on by the famine and political instability that he stayed free for so long. But then the inevitable happened. As the famine was brought under control, the government reasserted itself. Zhang was picked up in a street sweep of homeless people. He was identified and sent back to prison in Lanzhou. While Zhang was bullheaded and brusque, Tan was gentle, with calm eyes and a reasonable demeanor. They risked their lives to prove their feelings A few years later, the Communist Party’s next convulsion, the Cultural Revolution, proved deadly for some of those in jail. After a brief period of chaos at the start of the Cultural Revolution, the Party promulgated new rules to “strengthen public security work.” That resulted in harsh crackdowns across the country. Young people were once again sent to remote areas to work. Prisons carried out mass executions of convicts. Zhang Chunyuan in jail (undated) In 1970, local authorities in Tianshui decided that the new rules meant that Zhang should be executed on the grounds of being in an “active” counterrevolutionary cell — a capital offense. For a few months before his execution, Zhang and Tan were housed in the same prison. Tan wanted Zhang to know, before his death, that she still loved him. She asked someone who delivered him his meals to tell him that “he will always live in my heart.” Zhang was sent to the Lanzhou Detention Center to be executed. The prison was nicknamed the “kiln,” a castle-like complex with walls 10 meters high and topped with barbed wire. When he entered his final cell, number 12, he was wearing a black cotton prison shirt and trousers, a black cotton cap, and black cotton shoes without laces. Heavy shackles weighing about fifteen kilograms were attached to his ankles, which were wrapped in cotton to prevent bleeding. His hands were cuffed tight behind his back. He could only clutch his sole belongings, a chipped enamel bowl and cup stuffed with a rolled-up white cotton towel. He could drop his trousers to urinate or defecate but inmates had to help him pull them back up. The dozen or so prisoners in the room roused themselves to look at the condemned man. He apologized for bothering them and waited politely for someone to make space for him to sit down. The men were dumbfounded and soon made space. The prisoner in charge of the room was a man named Wang Zhongyi. He had been rounded up in a sweep of young people and charged with hooliganism. Now he was under orders to make sure that Zhang didn’t commit suicide. Over the next three days the men became close and Zhang entrusted Wang with telling Tan how much he loved her. One of the young men asked Zhang if he was scared. His case was serious, wasn’t it? Zhang replied: “Yes, it’s serious: active counterrevolutionary activity.” Zhang told the men his life story. Then, on March 22 he was led out to the Qilihe Stadium for a mass sentencing. Before he left, he made Wang promise that somehow, someday, he would find Tan and tell her two sentences: “First, I have a clear conscience toward the Party, the country, and the people, and I’m sorry because I can’t accompany her to finish the road of life. Second, she must live well; the future is bright and boundless!” Zhang was condemned to death and then taken to Willow Gulley in Donggang Township, where he was shot. After his death, a notice was put up in various prisons around the district. One was Tan’s women’s prison. Tan saw it. Within a month her hair had gone white. ∎ Postscript Buy the book The magazine Spark lasted only a year before it was extinguished. It never circulated nationally. It resulted in no protests or any sort of threat to the government. Over the Chinese Communist Party’s three-quarters of a century in power it is one of countless small acts of outrage against its unchecked powers. And yet, due to case files released in the late 1970s and 1980s, including the love letters between Tan Chanxue and Zhang Chunyuan, the story was preserved. In the 2000s, the underground filmmaker Hu Jie interviewed most of the survivors and in 2013 released online one of his best-known films, Spark. Over the past two decades, this story has become a touchstone in Chinese people’s efforts to counter the Party’s efforts to whitewash the past.

I've lived in China and surprised that I've never heard of this before. For those unaware, not a whole lot has changed since that time unfortunately. China has had certain periods where they had opened up somewhat, but those days are long gone to my knowledge. If anything the repression may be even greater these days in some ways, though at least there isn't any kind of mass starvation going on as far as I'm aware. The current system also seems to be more of a riff on the old imperial system rather than something fundamentally new.

The focus on corruption (not among political allies, of course), which the imperial system saw as its eventual downfall - IIRC Chinese history at least traditionally taught there were three repeating phases to a dynastic cycle: ascendency, corruption, chaos, then ascendency again .... The perspective on other countries as inevitably inferior. The attempt, post-Opium Wars, to hold onto power by adopting Western technology without adopting Western culture, such as political, intellectual, and economic freedom (it never went well, as you might expect).

This really does require constant growth for positive (or even near zero negative) interest rates. Although there are a lot of monetary controls, there are really only trade-offs not fixes, if loans are made for which the asset does not cover a loss. You have to pick winners and losers. That said monetary controls are much stronger than you'd see in an open market country, and one could force a digital currency with negative interest rates. reply Tevo 10 hours agoparentprev\"If a revolution destroys a systematic government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves in the succeeding government.\" - Robert Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance Though I don't know enough about Chinese politics to tell how much the quote actually fits. reply taikobo 4 hours agorootparentBorn and raised and stuck here, I can tell you that it absolutely fits.

Many are only preserved through family oral traditions and many of those will die out with the population decline. I've heard it expressed that modern day China has a lot of spirit (energetic vigor), but is still seeking its soul (embodied contemplative wonderment and compassion for all around ourselves, as opposed to dogmatic spirituality per se), and was struck by how apt that was to political leadership in all nations, and to an equal or lesser extent their peoples, depending upon the nation. reply woooooo 17 hours agoparentWhat I've heard is that the great leap forward and associated famine are acknowledged in official accounts, but the cultural revolution is increasingly downplayed.

Members of the five bad elements were brought up to the podium and forced to kneel down facing the crowd. There was a middle-aged woman among the bad elements. The high-level cadre from the prefecture signaled a poor peasant to come and asked him at close earshot: 'Is that a \"landlord's wife\" (dizhupo)?' The poor peasant answered: 'Yes, cadre,' went up to that woman, and pressed her head down to the floor throughout the struggle session. At the end of the meeting the high-level cadre asked this poor peasant, 'Why did you force that woman's head down for so long?

With every year that passes, the optimization gradient from government to people re-enforces the complicity. The differences in written and oral language make clandestine operations difficult. How many of the 2600 Politburo members are intelligence assets? Likely few to none. The situation is clearly suboptimal from a human perspective: oppressive power is categorically bad, we take this truth to be self-evident. In terms of catalytic change, what are some out of the box ideas that would rise to the challenge? 1. New forms of biotechnology minorly resemblant of targeted mind control. For example, any nanotechnology-based vector sufficiently power to trigger behaviors like a voluntary mass resignation of party members. Alternatively, a controlled pandemic that somehow interfaces with compromised electronics to temporarily modulate behavior. But this ask is too high, and such technology would surely be deployed towards even geopolitical goals first. 2. Incredibly high velocity targeted counterpropaganda that is also historically truthful. Some of the earliest StarCraft bots that defeated humans were simply very good at controlling mass mutalisk swarm. A rapid and unexpected infiltration with truth bombs, ideally physical or written rather than electronic to make censorship challenges, could cause a (probably uncontrolled chain reaction). 3. Inducement of a Taiwan takeover, and subsequent loss. Very high collateral damage and seems widely destructive rather than more “peaceful.” 4. Weird deus ex machinas. In the Three Body Problem, theoretical physicist start hallucinating a countdown timer. A covert leap in physics or technologies to induce “mystic breaks” in relevant sub populations, particularly those in power, could lead to mostly voluntary abdications of power. 5. Something more insidious or pernicious related to improved clandestine operation. 6. Straightforward domination, such as through a deployment of a sovereign but appropriately aligned or controlled AI fleet that maintains the balance of a covert takeover / disassembly of the power structure but phase transitions organically to redistribute power to the wider populace before halting or terminating itself.

What looks like a monolith is in fact multiple tribes seeking a position closer to the throne. The most brutal few that make it to the top have to spend much of their energy to get there or defend their position. That is not saying they don't have any ideologies, but leadership in these systems rewards obedience and tribute paying first of all. So you get a system that optimizes optics for a hierarchy of overlords. Contrast that with the chaotic looking processes that happens within free democratic societies. Leadership has a much broader accountability, faces scrutiny from all sides, has to tolerate opposition, are bound to laws and have term limits. This system, with all buts and ifs, allows societies to innovate, learn, adapt and prosper. Chinese leadership should thank the late Kissinger for the enormous transfer of wealth, intellectual properties, and highly favorable trading conditions from the West.

    "title": "Vintage Rotary Phones Revive MoMA Exhibit Through Interactive Experience",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/mnutt/rotary",
    "originBody": "Rotary Phone Project This is an account of a project we recently did. The files aren't intended to constitute a cohesive runnable project, they're just a loose collection of scripts. It's mostly here to remind me how it works, but hopefully it's useful to others. Background Recently we went to the MoMA with my 4 year old son. Some modern art is hard to appreciate as a kid, but the exhibit he loved was one where they had a bunch of rotary phones and you could dial a number and it would read you a poem. I wanted to replicate something like this at home. Features Some things I wanted it to be able to do: Dial out to a short list of family contacts. It's not something I think about much, but when I was a kid there was a phone on the wall and once I could reach it, I could use it. Now, if you're not old enough to have a cell phone, you also can't call anyone at all. Allow incoming calls from that same list of family contacts. Requires an actual phone number. On a different extension, hear a random joke. Hear a random k-pop song. This was an easy thing to start with, but not actually that fun. The audio quality is pretty terrible for music. Get NYC MTA train status. My son loves the subway, and is already pretty proficient at using a unix terminal to query the status of different trains, but it would be fun to hear an announcement too. Equipment 60 years ago, every household in America had one or more rotary phones, so they're not exactly hard to find. I bought one off of Ebay for ~$25. Not all of them are guaranteed to be in working order, but these things are pretty solid so if the outside looks undamaged, it's likely alright. Worst case you might have to spend another $25 and try again. I got a Western Electric Bell 500. If we lived in 1960 (or even 2000) I could plug it into the wall and the project would be mostly done. But if I want to do anything interesting, I need to adapt it to VoIP. My initial thought was to hack up the inside of the phone and use a Raspberry Pi or ESP32 or something, but between driving 48V DC or replacing most of the internals it seemed a bit out of reach. Instead, I used the phone unmodified and connected it to a Grandstream GS-HT802 which lists rotary support in the specs. This currently goes for ~$50 on Amazon. To accomplish the other features, I wanted to use Asterisk, an open source PBX. Using Asterisk to make a phone that tells you jokes is a bit like using Kubernetes to host your blog, but I had a little bit of experience with it from ~20 years ago and it seemed to do everything I wanted. Ideally I would have been able to attach the Grandstream adapter directly to the machine running the Asterisk server. But for the equipment I had, I ended up attaching the Grandstream to the Raspberry Pi in my son's room, and having it bridge wifi to an old server under my desk running Asterisk. This hasn't flaked out yet but seems like it could be brittle. At some point I'd like to consolidate these into a more powerful Raspberry Pi 5 that runs Asterisk and is directly connected to the GrandStream. Rotary Phone Setup Pretty much just plug the RJ11 port of the phone into port 1 on the GrandStream. This should mostly Just Work, but there are some potential caveats depending on the rotary phone you receive. I'd try it first, but if you have trouble with it ringing later in the process you can try: It's possible that your phone has been wired for a \"party line\" instead of regular service. This would require unscrewing the cover (make sure it's unplugged from the Grandstream) and a small amount of rewiring which differs based on your phone model. The one I received wasn't wired for a party line, but was effectively muted. I had to take the cover off and unhook part of the ringer. I haven't seen discussion of this online anywhere. Opening it up: After everything else checked out, I realized the ringer had been locked, and moved it to this position to fix: Asterisk setup I installed Asterisk via dpkg on Ubuntu 22. Setup was made a little more complicated by the RPi wifi bridge, which meant that the Grandstream was techically behind NAT from the perspective of Asterisk. Asterisk is trying to move from legacy sip module to pjsip, but I was only able to get sip to work so I stuck with that. The /etc/asterisk/sip.conf relevant parts: [rotary] type=friend nat=force_rport,comedia secret=s3cr3t host=dynamic context=rotary-context qualify=yes The nat and host=dynamic aspects wouldn't be necessary if the Grandstream was on the same network as Asterisk. Connecting the phone to Asterisk Plugging the Grandstream device in, it automatically obtained an IP via DHCP and I was able to log into its web interface using default credentials. Setup was pleasantly straightforward, I just configured fx-1's sip server to point to the Asterisk server's address. Relevant settings from fxs-1: Active: Yes Primary SIP Server: [asterisk ip] NAT Traversal: Keep-Alive * SIP User ID: rotary SIP Authenticate ID: rotary SIP Registration: Yes Enable SIP OPTIONS/Notify Keep-Alive: OPTIONS * Enable Pulse Dialing: Yes Enable Hook Flash: Yes Enable High Ring Power: Yes ** * - only required because of the RPi wifi bridge ** - maybe not necessary, but makes ringer more likely to work At this point, you should be able to pick up the phone's handset and get a dialtone. If you don't, there are some different debugging avenues: Asterisk side You can run sudo asterisk -rvvvvv to start the asterisk repl. Then: sip show peers should list rotary/rotary with the right Host and hopefully a Status of \"OK\" sip set debug on will give loads of SIP debug data, after enabling that you can unplug and replug the grandstream and hopefully see it trying to connect Grandstream side If you're not seeing any peers or any sip logs from asterisk, you can also use the Grandstream web UI and enable sip logging to hopefully see what is going on. Building Stuff in Asterisk At this point the phone is connecting to Asterisk and the real fun can begin. :) Play a K-Pop song The easiest one first. Asterisk can play back an audio file, but is relatively limited in the types of files it can play. You'll likely need to convert your file to 8KHz wav. Then put something like this in /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf: [rotary-context] exten => 1234,1,Answer() same => n,Playback(/path/to/file.wav) same => n,Hangup() You can reload Asterisk config with (among others) sudo systemctl reload asterisk. This will let you dial 1,2,3,4 on the phone, answer, play the audio, and hang up on you. Play MTA Subway Status Speech Synthesis For this one, we need some sort of text-to-speech synthesis. TTS has come a long way since Asterisk was initially created back in the early 2000s, so I opted for hooking in a third party TTS engine. I chose piper which sounds pretty good and notably is fast--it can run on a Raspberry Pi. Piper can pipe to stdout, or a file or whatever. I was hoping I could shell out to piper with my text and stream the result back to asterisk via stdout, but it was not meant to be. I went so far as to try to write a c Asterisk module that would accept raw audio over stdout, and eventually discovered that a) audio formats are hard, and b) I lack any sort of intuition about debugging when all I can get back are silence and a few popping noises. Instead I wound up writing an extension subroutine that calls out to piper, has it write to a tempfile, plays the tempfile, then deletes the tempfile. This means the entire speech generation has to complete before it can begin playing, but so far that has not taken longer than ~250ms on my Asterisk server. (a decade+ old core i7) The speak.sh bash script: #!/bin/bash /path/to/piper/piper \\ --length_scale=5 --sentence_silence=0.5 \\ --model /path/to/piper/voices/en_US-amy-medium.onnx \\ --output-raw -f -\\ sox -v 0.7 -t raw -e signed -r 22050 -b 16 - -r 8000 -b 16 -c 1 -t wav - This uses the \"Amy\" medium-fidelity model to generate some speech, then sox to translate it to one of the few audio formats that Asterisk can play. Then we create the subroutine in extensions.conf: [speak] exten => s,1,NoOp(Text to speech) same => n,Set(filename=\"speech-${RAND()}${RAND()}\") same => n,System(echo \"${ARG1}\"/path/to/speak.sh > /tmp/${filename}.wav) same => n,Playback(/tmp/${filename}) same => n,System(rm -f /tmp/${filename}.wav) same => n,Return() Then I can call it like this from a regular extension: exten => 888,1,Answer() ; Say something same => n,GoSub(speak,s,1(\"Hello world\")) This works pretty well, but a very common pattern is that I want to play some audio for the dialer while at the same time accepting input from them. How maddening is it when you're trying to cancel Comcast and they're making you listen to all of the menu options because they might have changed? If we play audio, then accept input, Asterisk blocks and we're no better than Comcast. Instead of Playback() we can use Read(), which accepts some audio and waits at the same time. We can make a separate subroutine for that: [speak-get-digits] exten => s,1,NoOp(Text to speech requesting digits) same => n,Set(filename=\"speech-${RAND()}${RAND()}\") same => n,Set(digitcount=${IF($[\"${ARG2}\"=\"\"]?1:${ARG2})}) same => n,System(echo \"${ARG1}\"/path/to/rotary/speak.sh > /tmp/${filename}.wav) same => n,Read(digits,/tmp/${filename},${digitcount}) same => n,System(rm -f /tmp/${filename}.wav) same => n,Return(${digits}) Asterisk has a long lineage and unfortunately has some serious warts, one of them being return values. In order to call this you need to do: same => n,GoSub(speak-get-digits,s,1(\"Dial a number to hear the status of a numbered train or dial 9 for a letter train.\",1)) same => n,Set(digit=${GOSUB_RETVAL}) ${GOSUB_RETVAL} is a sort of environment variable set upon completion of your subroutine. I'd recommend immediately setting it to a different name like I've done above. The 1 we pass in as a second argument tells asterisk to only wait for one digit before proceeding. Talking to the MTA This part came from the pieces of the aforementioned unix terminal mta status project. It's a command line script that takes the number or letter of a train, fetches from the HTTP API the MTA website runs on, and returns the status in text form. What I discovered was that the response from the MTA was pretty good for viewing on a screen, but not quite suitable for text-to-speech. I had to modify the app to do a replacement pass, to change abbreviations where appropriate: Sq to Square, St to Street (but also St George to Saint George), etc. Then a secondary pass to correct mispronunciations. (Houston -> Howston, Coney Island -> Coaney Island etc) The last part probably varies a lot from one TTS engine to the next. Putting it together The numbered trains (1-7) were a piece of cake. Read a digit, phone user dials it on the rotary, pass it to the mta script, generate audio. Letters were quite a bit harder: While there are only 9 numbers, you can achieve the letters by doing a proto-T9 implementation where the user dials \"2\" for \"A\", \"22\" for \"B\", etc. But rotary phones and the subway share an interesting mid-century oddity that they just skip various letters. Unfortunately these aren't the same letters. While the subway skips \"I\", \"O\", \"P\", etc, rotary phones skip \"Q\", and \"Z\". These are both actual subway lines so need to be mapped to something else. The subway has 3 shuttle lines (Grand central, Franklin, Rockaways) and the Staten Island Railway; I just made \"S\" its own sub-menu with 4 options. Dial \"33\" to start the subway status tree: exten => 33,1(start),Answer() same => n,GoSub(speak-get-digits,s,1(\"Dial a number to hear the status of a numbered train or dial 9 for a letter train.\",1)) same => n,Set(digit=${GOSUB_RETVAL}) same => n,GotoIf($[\"${digit}\" = \"9\"]?lettertrains) same => n,System(/path/to/rotary/mta.sh ${digit} > /tmp/piper.wav) same => n,Playback(/tmp/piper) same => n,Goto(start) same => n(lettertrains),NoOp(Status for letter trains) same => n,GoSub(speak-get-digits,s,1(\"Dial the letter for your train\",4)) same => n,Set(letters=${GOSUB_RETVAL}) same => n,Gotoif($[\"${letters}\" = \"777\"]?shuttle) same => n,System(/path/to/rotary/mta.sh letter:${letters} > /tmp/piper.wav) same => n,Playback(/tmp/piper) same => n,Goto(start) same => n(shuttle),NoOp(Status for shuttles) same => n,GoSub(speak-get-digits,s,1(\"Dial 1 for grand central shuttle, dial 2 for franklin avenue, dial 3 for far rockaway shuttle, dial 4 for staten island railway\", 1)) same => n,Set(digit=${GOSUB_RETVAL}) same => n,System(/path/to/rotary/mta.sh shuttle:${digit} > /tmp/piper.wav) same => n,Playback(/tmp/piper) same => n,Goto(start) Phone Calls At this point many hours in, we're almost to the part you could have achieved 30 years ago by buying a phone and plugging it in to any house in America. In order for someone to use the phone to talk to another person with a regular phone, we need to connect to the phone network. Long ago it was apparently possible to use Google Voice, but from everything I've read it's no longer possible. I signed up for Twilio: not the cheapest, but it's reputable and developer-focused so pretty easy to work with. Buying a number will cost a few dollars a month. I let my son pick his own phone number. It has a lot of sevens in it. Twilio offers two different services that seem like they could be relevant: I started out exploring \"Twilio Elastic Sip Trunking\" which \"enables you to make & receive telephone calls from your IP communications infrastructure around the globe over a public or private connection\" and sounds like exactly what I need. This is probably the \"correct\" way to bridge Asterisk into Twilio, especially if you're doing something real. But this approach assumes your Asterisk server has a public IP and mine sits behind my home router. Using this approach I was able to have Asterisk dial out, but Twilio could not make calls into Asterisk. NAT strikes again! Instead, I went the route of creating a Programmable SIP Domain in Twilio and having Asterisk just act like another SIP client. This let Asterisk register with Twilio and punch through NAT using the usual OPTIONS keepalive trick. The steps are: Create a SIP Domain Create a Credential List. This is how Asterisk will authenticate with Twilio. Set up Voice Authentication with the Credential List. Enable SIP Registration. On the Asterisk side, we'll need something like this in our /etc/asterisk/sip.conf: [twilio-trunk](!) type=peer context=from-twilio ; Which dialplan to use for incoming calls dtmfmode=rfc4733 canreinivite=no insecure=port,invite [twilio](twilio-trunk) host=replace-with-your-sip-name.sip.us1.twilio.com defaultuser=michael ; username remotesecret=totallysecure ; password defaultexpiry=605 minexpiry=605 qualify=yes Replace the host with the host from the SIP Domain you created in Twilio. And replace defaultuser and remotesecret values with the username and password from the Credentials List you created. qualify=yes will cause Asterisk to keep the NAT hole alive by periodically sending OPTIONS requests. defaultexpiry and minexpiry keep us from sending so many pings that Twilio rate-limits us. context=from-twilio means that incoming calls will wind up in the from-twilio context in extensions.conf, where you can route them to your rotary phone: After you reload Asterisk, you can run sudo asterisk -rvvvvv and show sip peers and see both your rotary phone as well as Twilio: CLI> sip show peers Name/username HostDyn Forcerport Comedia ACL Port Status Description rotary/rotary 192.168.1.33 D Yes Yes 5060 OK (22 ms) twilio/michael 54.172.60.0Yes No 5060 OK (18 ms) Dialing out With the connection established, we need to tell Asterisk how to route a call to Twilio, and need to tell Twilio what to do when it gets it. Asterisk config, in extensions.conf: exten => 81,1,Answer() ; Call Dad same => n,GoSub(speak,s,1(\"Calling dad\\!\\!\")) same => n,Set(CALLERID(all)=\"Rotary\") same => n,Dial(SIP/twilio/+12565121024) In this case you'd replace 19787777777 with the Twilio phone number you purchased, and 12565121024 with the number you're calling. I'm not entirely sure the caller ID part is necessary, but it seems like it. Back in Twilio, we want our SIP domain to receive a call and pass it right on through via our purchased phone number. To do this we can create a TwiML bin: {{#e164}}{{To}}{{/e164}}Give it a name like \"OutboundCall\", then go back to the SIP Domain configuration: Set Call Control Configuration to configure with \"Webhooks, TwiML Bins, Functions, Studio, Proxy\" A call comes in: set to \"TwiML Bin\" then select your bin name The rest of the fields don't matter Make sure SIP routing is Active. Now try dialing \"81\" from your rotary phone. It should route to your recipient. I went back and forth a bit on setting up emergency service. (911, in the US) If you do this, you'll absolutely want to make sure your home address in Twilio is accurate. I haven't set up emergency dialing yet because while I can impress on my son the serious nature of calling 911, his friends might treat it more like a toy. Still, something worth considering. Receiving calls With our outbound setup, Asterisk could technically dial any number but we limit which numbers can actually be dialed by only explicitly dialing them in extensions.conf. For receiving calls, we want to make sure we also limit it to specific callers. We could easily achieve \"pass any call through\" with the same TwiML Bin approach, but \"limit to phone numbers x,y,z\" is a bit too much for TwiML so I opted for a Twilio Function. In Twilio, create a Service to make a new function. I named mine incoming-call, with this logic: const allowed = ['+12565121024', '+13435555555', ...]; exports.handler = function(context, event, callback) { console.log(\"Receiving call\", event.From); let twiml = new Twilio.twiml.VoiceResponse(); if(allowed.includes(event.From)) { // Ensure the number is in E.164 format console.log(\"Matched, dialing...\"); const dial = twiml.dial({answerOnBridge: true}).sip(\"rotary@replace-with-your-sip-name.sip.twilio.com\"); } else { console.log(\"Call was rejected\"); twiml.reject(); // Rejects the call if the number does not match } callback(null, twiml); }; Make sure you save and click \"Deploy all\" to actually deploy it. Then go to Phone Numbers -> Manage -> Active Phone Numbers and select the number you purchased to configure it. Choose \"Webhooks, TwiML Bin, Function, Studio Flow, Proxy Service\", then choose \"Function\" and the one you named incoming-call and choose the Environment and Function Path. (there should be only one option for each) At this point, you can go back to the Function editor, enable Live Logs, and actually try to call your Twilio number and see it route the call. It'll send it on to Asterisk, who will probably immediately dump it since you haven't configured anywhere for it to go. We can do that in extensions.conf: [from-twilio] exten => s,1,NoOp(Incoming Call) same => n,Dial(SIP/rotary) same => n,Hangup() This is where you could put other fancy logic, for instance if you wanted to let other people call you and hear MTA announcements or something. At this point you should be able to dial your Twilio number from your cell phone and, with a great deal of luck, your rotary phone will ring. Tell a Joke This one needs the most future work. Conceptually it's mostly a simpler version of the MTA script: put list of jokes in an array, then choose one. This works okay, but somehow there is absolutely no way to get piper to pause, which destroys the comedic timing. While I need to figure out how to get piper to just wait a bit, I also want to add support for knock-knock jokes, where it waits for the caller to actually say \"who's there?\". I don't think this needs to go nearly as far as actual speech-to-text, and could instead detect any kind of sound and probably be good enough. You also don't want a random joke: unless you have a really long list, you'll eventually end up with it telling the same joke twice in a row. This may be funny the first time, but gets old fast. Instead we need some way to tell a new joke each time. Conclusion The physical aspects of the project held my son's attention the best, especially taking the phone cover off. (make sure it's unplugged!) Debugging SIP connections was by far the most tedious part of the project and I did most of that at night. But building out the phone menu was also a fun activity where I let him dictate what the numbers did and we drew out how it would work. By far the best part of the project is that he'll randomly call up his grandparents to talk. As an adult I talk to loved ones on the phone, but calls tend to be scheduled and coordinated in advance via text. An unexpected call triggers annoyance or concern. Four year olds have none of that, and are happy just to chat.",

I used to call that bedtime story phone line from an an old 1970's era rotary Snoopy telephone from British Telecom which I still own. I ever so carefully updated the phone with a new RJ-30 jack (the original was bare wires), so that in a custom built base that the phone sits on is an Nvidia Jetson running an LLM and trained on Charlie Brown's voice and a voice recognition model. Dialing 1 will answer questions about Snoopy and Peanuts history and Charles Schultz in Charlie Brown's voice. You can just talk to it. Dial 2 and a very nice lady with a British accent will read you a bedtime story, interactively, like a choose your own adventure of sorts, from a large database of stories. Dial 3 and Lucy will pick up, announce that the therapist is in, and talk with you about what's troubling you, again, voice recognition and an LLM. Dial 4 and you get Woodstock. Any other number gets you an \"adult\" from the Peanuts cartoon that is impossible to understand, again, voice recognition to understand what you're asking, but the response is unintelligible. reply mnutt 13 hours agoparentThat's amazing!

I was really struck by this comment: > Dial out to a short list of family contacts. It's not something I think about much, but when I was a kid there was a phone on the wall and once I could reach it, I could use it. Now, if you're not old enough to have a cell phone, you also can't call anyone at all. That's not something I've ever thought about, but is a really huge change in what kids can do. I was always allowed to call over to a friend's house and see if they could play. reply SamBam 13 hours agoparentAnother (weird) advantage of a landline: you didn't always know who was going to answer, sometimes you were just calling \"the house,\" and it allowed for more serendipitous conversation. The main example is probably just calling up your parents, whether as a kid or even as an adult calling up their elderly parents. Sometimes you just want to speak to \"your parents.\" You didn't have to decide whether to call mom's cellphone or dad's cellphone. And you didn't have to worry about who you called last. Heck, with caller ID, mom or dad could even decide who wanted to chat with you. My mother-in-law actually complains about this going the other way. Sometimes she just wants to call our house, because she'd love it if I randomly picked up and she could chat with me in passing. She'd find it awkward to call my phone, because we don't quite have that \"chat about nothing on the phone\" relationship, but it used to be that you could get two minutes of catching up with someone before you said \"ok, now pass me to the person I was really calling for.\" reply macintux 8 hours agorootparentMakes me wonder whether people lamented the end of party lines.

Or you could probably connect the Grandstream directly to Twilio or another low-cost VoIP provider for cheaper than a land line and keep the ability to limit which phone numbers can be used. The project was delayed for a day for lack of a phone cable. (of all of the weird old cables I have somehow rj-11 is no longer one of them...) I considered buying one off Amazon but it felt incredibly wasteful, so instead I asked our IT department at work. Almost any office will have piles of these things sitting around collecting dust. reply throwaway81523 14 hours agoprevNice, and the Grandstream adapter is good to know about. There is a gadget now called cell2jack that lets you use your old land phone as a mobile handset but going to VoIP is also interesting. Quite a while ago, Sparkfin sold a rotary phone that had been modified to have a mobile phone board inside, but it is now long obsolete: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/287 I still have an old rotary phone around, with the carbon granule mic those things had. It sounds awful. Idk whether that's due to its age, or because those mics just sounded bad compared with modern condenser mics. I have been thinking of getting a cell2jack to have a pseudo-landline at mom's, since there are people there who get confused by smart phones. This board also looks promising: https://www.keyestudio.com/products/keyestudio-raspberry-pi-... Unfortunately GSM modules in that style no longer work because the 2g and 3g networks are now shut down around here. reply Crunchified 13 hours agoparentTake that carbon mic element and tap it repeatedly on a hard surface to loosen up the granules of carbon that need to be able to move round in there when you speak into it. You may find that it improves the fidelity noticeably. reply mnutt 14 hours agoparentprevThat's great, I didn't know about those.

I uploaded all the messages to an sd card and put the little computer in the phone and wired it up to the rotary dialer and wrote some python code which listened to the rotary dialer and played an mp3 on specific numbers. Dialling a number played back a message from a friend/family member. I later did the same thing for another family member but this time in an old radio and you could tune to different messages.

    "title": "The Intel 8088: Unpacking Instruction Prefetch Circuitry",
    "originLink": "https://www.righto.com/2024/03/8088-prefetch-circuitry.html",
    "originBody": "Ken Shirriff's blog Computer history, restoring vintage computers, IC reverse engineering, and whatever The Intel 8088 processor's instruction prefetch circuitry: a look inside In 1979, Intel introduced the 8088 microprocessor, a variant of the 16-bit 8086 processor. IBM's decision to use the 8088 processor in the IBM PC (1981) was a critical point in computer history, leading to the dominance of the x86 architecture that continues to the present.1 One way that the 8086 and 8088 increased performance was by prefetching: the processor fetches instructions from memory before they are needed, so the processor can execute them without waiting on the relatively slow memory. I've been reverse-engineering the 8088 from die photos and this blog post discusses what I've uncovered about the prefetch circuitry. The die photo below shows the 8088 microprocessor under a microscope. The metal layer on top of the chip is visible, with the silicon and polysilicon mostly hidden underneath. Around the edges of the die, bond wires connect pads to the chip's 40 external pins. I've labeled the key functional blocks; this article focuses on the prefetch queue components highlighted in red. The components in purple also play a role, and will be discussed below. Architecturally, the chip is partitioned into a Bus Interface Unit (BIU) at the top and an Execution Unit (EU) below. The BIU handles memory accesses, while the Execution Unit (EU) executes instructions. In particular, the BIU fetches instructions, which are transferred from the prefetch queue to the Execution Unit via the queue bus. The 8088 die under a microscope, with main functional blocks labeled. This photo shows the chip's single metal layer; the polysilicon and silicon are underneath. Click on this image (or any other) for a larger version. The 8086 and 8088 processors present the same 16-bit architecture to the programmer. The key difference is that the 8088 has an 8-bit data bus for communication with memory and I/O, rather than the 16-bit bus of the 8086. The 8088's narrower bus reduced performance, since the processor only transfers one byte at a time rather than two. However, the 8-bit bus enabled cheaper computer hardware. The 8-bit bus was also a better match for hardware based on the older but popular 8-bit Intel 8080 and 8085 processors, allowing the reuse of 8-bit I/O circuitry for instance. Much of the IBM PC was based on the little-known IBM DataMaster, a computer built around the Intel 8085. Thus, selecting the 8088 processor was a natural choice for the IBM PC. For the most part, the 8086 and 8088 are very similar internally, apart from trivial but numerous layout changes on the die. The biggest differences are in the Bus Interface Unit, the circuitry that communicates with memory and I/O devices, since this circuitry handles 16 bits in the 8086 versus 8 bits in the 8088. There are a few microcode differences between the two chips. One interesting change is that for performance reasons the 8088 has a smaller prefetch queue than the 8086 (four bytes instead of six). (I wrote about the 8086's prefetch circuity earlier.) Prefetching and the architecture of the 8086 and 8088 The 8086 and 8088 were introduced at an interesting point in microprocessor history, when memory was becoming slower than the CPU. For the first microprocessors, the speed of the CPU and the speed of memory were comparable.2 However, as processors became faster, the speed of memory failed to keep up. The 8086 was probably the first microprocessor to prefetch instructions to improve performance. While modern microprocessors have megabytes of fast cache3 to act as a buffer between the CPU and much slower main memory, the 8088 has just 4 bytes of prefetch queue. However, this was enough to substantially increase performance. Prefetching had a major impact on the design of the 8086 and thus the 8088. Earlier processors such as the 6502, 8080, or Z80 were deterministic: the processor fetched an instruction, executed the instruction, and so forth. Memory accesses corresponded directly to instruction fetching and execution and instructions took a predictable number of clock cycles. This all changed with the introduction of the prefetch queue. Memory operations became unlinked from instruction execution since prefetches happen as needed and when the memory bus is available. To handle memory operations and instruction execution independently, the implementors of the 8086 and 8088 divided the processors into two processing units: the Bus Interface Unit (BIU) that handles memory accesses, and the Execution Unit (EU) that executes instructions. The Bus Interface Unit contains the instruction prefetch queue; it supplies instructions to the Execution Unit via the Q (queue) bus. The BIU also contains an adder (Σ) for address calculation, adding the segment register base to an address offset, among other things. The Execution Unit is what comes to mind when you think of a processor: it has most of the registers, the arithmetic/logic unit (ALU), and the microcode that implements instructions. The segment registers (CS, DS, SS, ES) and the Instruction Pointer (IP) are in the Bus Interface Unit since they are directly involved in memory accesses, while the general-purpose registers are in the Execution Unit. Block diagram of the 8088 processor. This diagram differs from most 8088 block diagrams because it shows the actual physical implementation, rather than the programmer's view of the processor. The \"Internal Communication Registers\" consist of the Indirect Register (IND) and the Operand Register (OPR). These hold a memory address and memory data value respectively. From The 8086 Family User's Manual page 243. It may seem inefficient for the Bus Interface Unit to have its own adder instead of using the ALU, but there are reasons for the separate adder. First, every memory access uses the adder at least once to add the segment base and offset. The adder is also used to increment the PC or index registers. Since these operations are so frequent, they would create a bottleneck if they used the ALU. Second, since the Execution Unit and the Bus Interface Unit run asynchronously with respect to each other, it would be complicated to share the ALU without conflicts. Prefetching had another major but little-known effect on the 8086 architecture: the designers were considering making the 8086 a two-chip microprocessor. Prefetching, however, required a one-chip design because the number of control signals required to synchronize prefetching across two chips exceeded the package pins available. This became a compelling argument for the one-chip design that was used for the 8086.4 (The unsuccessful Intel iAPX 432, which was under development at the same time, ended up being a two-chip processor: one to fetch and decode instructions, and one to execute them.) Implementing the queue The 8088's instruction prefetch queue is implemented with four 8-bit queue registers along with two hardware \"pointers\" into the queue. One two-bit counter keeps track of the current read position from 0 to 3, i.e. the queue register that will provide the next instruction byte. The second counter keeps track of the current write position, i.e. the queue register that will receive the next instruction from memory.5 As bytes are fetched from the queue, the read pointer advances. As bytes are added to the queue, the write pointer advances. The diagram below shows an example queue configuration with two prefetched bytes. The middle two queue registers (Q1 and Q2) hold data. The read pointer indicates that the Execution Unit will get its next byte from Q1. The write pointer indicates that the next prefetched byte will go into Q3. A queue configuration with two bytes in the prefetch queue. Bytes in blue hold prefetched data. The diagram below shows how the queue pointers can wrap around. In this configuration, two more bytes have been written to the queue (Q3 and Q0), so the queue is full. The write pointer now points to Q1, the same as the read pointer. A queue configuration with four bytes in the prefetch queue. There is an important ambiguity, however. Suppose that four bytes are read from the queue, so the read pointer advances four positions, wrapping around back to Q1. The queue is now empty, as shown below, but the pointers have the same position as the full case above. Thus, if the read pointer and the write pointer both point to the same position, the queue may be empty or full. To distinguish these cases, a flip-flop is set if the queue enters the empty state. This flip-flop generates a signal that Intel called MT (empty). A queue configuration with the queue empty. To determine how many bytes are in the queue, the queue circuitry uses a two-bit queue length value, along with the MT flip-flop value to distinguish the empty state. Conceptually, the queue length is generated by subtracting the read position from the write position. However, the implementation does not use a standard subtraction circuit, but instead uses hardcoded logic to determine the two bits of the length, as shown below. The circuitry to determine the queue length. The low bit of the length is the XOR of the two positions. In NMOS logic (used by the 8088), an AND-NOR gate is easy to implement, while an XOR gate is difficult. Thus, XOR is implemented as shown in the top circuit. (You can verify that if one input is 1 and the other is 0, the output is 1.) The high-order bit of the length is also based on an AND-NOR gate, one with six inputs. Each input is a combination of read and write positions that yields an output bit 1; each input is computed by a NOR gate, which I haven't drawn.6 As a result, the amount of logic circuitry to compute the length is fairly large. The diagram below zooms in on the queue control circuitry on the die, with the main flip-flops and circuitry labeled. The circuitry in the middle computes the queue length with the 6-input NOR gate stretched across the whole region. The flip-flops for the read and write positions are in the lower region. Despite the relative simplicity of the queue circuits, they take up a substantial part of the die. Compared to modern chips, the density of the 8088 is very low; you can almost see the flip-flops with the naked eye. But this isn't all the circuitry as prefetching also required queue registers and memory cycle control circuitry. Thus, prefetching was a moderately expensive feature for the 8088, as far as die area. The queue and prefetch circuitry on the die. The metal layer has been removed for the closeup to show the silicon of the underlying transistors. The loader To decode and execute an instruction, the Execution Unit must get instruction bytes from the Bus Interface Unit, but this is not entirely straightforward. The main problem is that the queue can be empty, in which case instruction decoding must block until a byte is available from the queue. The second problem is that instruction decoding is relatively slow so it is pipelined. For maximum performance, the decoder needs a new byte before the current instruction is finished. A circuit called the \"loader\" solves these problems by providing synchronization between the prefetch queue and the instruction decoder. The loader uses a small state machine to efficiently fetch bytes from the queue at the right time and to provide timing signals to the decoder and microcode engine. In more detail, as the loader requests the first two instruction bytes from the prefetch queue, it generates two timing signals that control the microcode execution. The FC (First Clock) indicates that the first instruction byte is available, while the SC (Second Clock) indicates the second instruction byte. Note that the First Clock and Second Clock are not necessarily consecutive clock cycles because the prefetch queue could be empty or contain just one byte, in which case the First Clock and/or Second Clock would be delayed. The instruction decoding circuitry and the microcode engine are controlled by the First Clock and Second Clock signals, so they remain synchronized with the bytes supplied by the prefetch queue. At the end of a microcode sequence, the Run Next Instruction (RNI) micro-operation causes the loader to fetch the next machine instruction. However, fetching and decoding the next instruction is a bit slow so microcode execution would be blocked for a cycle. In many cases, this slowdown can be avoided: if the microcode knows that it is one micro-instruction away from finishing, it issues a Next-to-last (NXT) micro-operation so the loader can start loading the next instruction. This achieves a degree of pipelining in most cases; fetching the next instruction is overlapped with finishing the execution of the previous instruction. The state machine for the 8086/8088 \"loader\" circuit. The 1BL signal indicates a 1-byte instruction implemented in logic rather than microcode. From patent US4449184. The diagram above shows the state machine for the loader. I won't explain it in detail, but essentially it keeps track of whether it is waiting for a First Clock byte or a Second Clock byte, and if it is performing a fetch in advance (NXT) or at the end of an instruction (RNI). The state machine is implemented with two flip-flops to support its four states. Microcode and the prefetch queue The loader takes care of fetching an instruction that consists of an opcode byte and a Mod R/M (addressing mode) byte. However, many instructions have additional bytes or don't follow this format For example, an opcode such as \"ADD AX\" can be followed by an 8- or 16-bit immediate value, adding that value to the AX register. Or a \"move memory to AX\" instruction can be followed by a 16-bit memory address The microcode uses a separate mechanism for fetching these instruction bytes from the queue. Specifically, each micro-instruction contains a source register and a destination register that specify a data move. By specifying \"Q\" (the queue) as the source, a byte is fetched from the prefetch queue. If the queue is empty, microcode execution blocks until the Bus Interface Unit loads a byte into the prefetch queue. Thus, the complexity of instruction fetching and the prefetch queue is invisible to the microcode.7 A jump, subroutine call, or other control flow change causes the prefetch queue to be flushed since the queue contents are no longer useful. This is accomplished in microcode with the FLUSH micro-instruction, which resets the queue read and write pointers and sets the MT (empty) flip-flop. Note that the queue is flushed even if the target address is in the queue, for example if you jump one byte ahead. One complication due to the prefetch queue is that the processor's Instruction Pointer points to the next instruction to be fetched, not the next instruction to be executed. This becomes a problem for a subroutine call, which needs to push the return address. It is also a problem for a relative jump, which is computed from the current instruction. The solution is the CORR micro-instruction, which corrects the Instruction Pointer by subtracting the queue length to determine the current execution position. This is implemented by the Bus Interface Unit, which holds correction constants in the Constant ROM, and subtracts them using the address adder (not the ALU).8 The queue registers The 8086 and 8088 partition the registers into upper registers (in the Bus Interface Unit) and lower registers (in the Execution Unit). The upper registers are the registers associated with memory accesses (e.g. Instruction Pointer, segment registers) while the lower registers are more general purpose (e.g. AX, BX, SI, SP). The upper registers are connected to two 16-bit internal buses: the B bus and the C bus. The queue registers are physically part of the upper registers, but are wired into the buses slightly differently, as shown below. In particular, the 8088's queue registers are written 8 bits at a time from the C bus. (In contrast, the 8086's queue registers can be written 16 bits at a time to support two-byte prefetches.) When accessing the queue, the queue registers are read 16 bits at a time, but only one byte is transferred to the Q bus for instruction processing.9 The queue registers in the 8088. The diagram below shows how the queue registers appear on the die, comparing the six-byte prefetch queue in the 8086 (top) to the four-byte 8088 queue (bottom). The 8086 prefetch registers are structured as three rows of 16-bit registers, while the 8088 prefetch registers are structured as four rows of 8-bit registers. In both cases, each bit is stored in a cross-coupled pair of inverters. The bit lines (not present) are vertical, while the control lines to select a register are horizontal. The layout is different between the processors to support 16-bit versus 8-bit writes. Note the empty space at the bottom of the 8088 registers. Because the rest of the chips are mostly the same, the 8088 couldn't be \"compacted\" to avoid this wasted space. The prefetch registers in the 8086 (top) and 8088 (bottom). For the 8086, the metal and polysilicon layers were removed, exposing the underlying silicon. For the 8088, the polysilicon and silicon are visible. Intel used simulations to determine the best queue sizes for the 8086 and 8088, balancing the performance cost of prefetching against the benefit. (The cost is that prefetching makes the bus unavailable for other memory or I/O operations.) The prefetch queue is discarded on a jump instruction or other change of control flow, causing the prefetched bytes to be wasted. Thus, as the queue gets longer, the chance of discarding a prefetched byte becomes larger, so the potential benefit of prefetching becomes smaller. Since the 8088 prefetches one byte at a time, compared to two bytes at a time on the 8086, prefetching on the 8088 costs twice as much as on the 8086 in terms of bus cycles used per byte. This changes the tradeoffs in favor of a shorter queue. Because of the difference in queue lengths, the queue control circuitry is different between the 8086 and 8088. In particular, the 8086 needs three-bit counters for the read and write positions, while the 8088 uses two-bit counters. Because of this, the length computation circuitry is also different between the processors. I plan to continue reverse-engineering the 8088 die so follow me on Twitter @kenshirriff or RSS for updates. I've also started experimenting with Mastodon recently as @oldbytes.space@kenshirriff. If you're interested in the 8086, I wrote about the 8086 die, its die shrink process and the 8086 registers earlier. Notes and references Whenever I mention x86's domination of the computing market, people bring up ARM, but ARM has a lot more market share in people's minds than in actual numbers. One research firm says that ARM has 15% of the laptop market share in 2023, expected to increase to 25% by 2027. (Surprisingly, Apple only has 90% of the ARM laptop market.) In the server market, just an estimated 8% of CPU shipments in 2023 were ARM. See Arm-based PCs to Nearly Double Market Share by 2027 and Digitimes. (Of course, mobile phones are almost entirely ARM.) ↩ Steve Furber, co-creator of the ARM chip, mentions that \"The first integrated CPUs were coincidentally quite well matched to semiconductor memory speeds, and were therefore built without caches. This can now be seen as a temporary aberration.\" See VLSI Risc Architecture and Organization p77. To make this concrete, the Apple II (1977) used a MOS 6502 processor running at about 1 megahertz while its 4116 DRAM chips could perform an access in 250 nanoseconds (4 times the clock speed). The 8088 processor ran at 5-10 MHz which meant that 250 ns DRAM chips were slower than the clock speed. Nowadays, processors run at 4 GHz but DRAM access speed is about 50 nanoseconds (1/200 the clock speed). ↩ Modern processors use caches to improve memory performance. Accessing data from a cache is faster than accessing it from main memory, but the tradeoff is that caches are much smaller than main memory. The prefetch queues in the 8086 and 8088 are similar to a cache in some ways, but there are some key differences. First, the prefetch queue is strictly sequential. If you jump ahead two bytes, even if the prefetch queue has those instruction bytes, the processor can't use them. Second, the prefetch queue can't reuse bytes. If you have a 6-byte loop, even though all the code fits in the prefetch queue, it will be reloaded every time. Third, the prefetch queue doesn't provide any consistency. If you modify an instruction in memory a couple of bytes ahead of the PC, the 8086 or 8088 will run the old instruction if it's in the queue. ↩ The design decisions for the 8086 prefetch cache (and many other aspects of the chip) are described in: J. McKevitt and J. Bayliss, \"New options from big chips,\" in IEEE Spectrum, vol. 16, no. 3, pp. 28-34, March 1979, doi: 10.1109/MSPEC.1979.6367944. Prefetch provided a 50% performance benefit to the 8086. ↩ The queue read process doesn't use an explicit read operation. Instead, the selected queue register continuously puts its value onto the queue bus. When the Execution Unit uses this byte, it sends an increment signal to the queue to advance the read pointer. If the queue empty (MT) flip-flop is set, the Execution Unit will wait until a byte is ready. ↩ The NOR gates are used as AND gates, following DeMorgan's laws. For example to produce a 1 output for write position 00 and read position 01, the logic is: NOR(write bit 1', write bit 0', read bit 1', read bit 0). Note that the bits into the NOR gate are all inverted from the \"desired\" values; if they are all 0, the NOR output is 1. Thus, there are also some inverters on the inputs. ↩ Arbitrary memory reads and writes are performed directly on memory, bypassing the prefetch queue. The 8086/8088 do not provide consistency; if you modify an instruction byte in memory and the byte is in the queue, the processor will execute the old byte. (This type of self-modifying code can be used to determine the queue length, distinguishing the 8086 from the 8088 in software.) ↩ The Constant ROM is used for more than just address correction. For example, it is also used to increment the Instruction Pointer after a prefetch. Other constants are used for the 8088's string operations, which act on a block of memory. The index registers are incremented or decremented by 1 for bytes or 2 for words. When popping a value from the stack, the stack pointer is decremented using the Constant ROM. ↩ Are the 8088's queue registers 16 bits wide or 8 bits wide? It's ambiguous, since the registers are written 8 bits at a time, but read 16 bits at a time. This implementation was probably selected to support the 8088's 8-bit bus while reusing as much of the 8086 design as possible. In particular, the 8088 can only prefetch one byte at a time, so writes need to happen a byte at a time. Thus, there are four control lines selecting which queue byte is written. (The 8088 could write to half of a 16-bit register but that would require moving the prefetched byte to the correct half of a 16-bit bus.) On the read side, it would make sense to have four read lines, selecting one byte from the 8088's queue. However, since the 8086 already had a multiplexer to select one byte from two, the 8088 designers probably felt it was easier to keep that circuit. And with the smaller queue on the 8088, there was no need to try to save space by removing the circuit. Thus, the queue has two read-select lines and a multiplexer control line. All these lines are controlled by the write position and read position flip-flops. ↩ Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: 8086, 8088, intel, reverse-engineering 2 comments: Zack said... Self-modifying code was relatively common in the early days of the IBM PC, and sometimes it would rely on the fact that a jump would discard the prefetch queue, to ensure that the CPU executed a modified instruction. Because of this, current versions of the x86 still guarantee that self-modified code will be visible to the CPU's execution pipeline immediately after any branch -- see section 8.1.3 of volume 3A of the \"Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual\".

The Acorn people called this a 2 MHz memory. You could have shorter cycle times in \"column mode\" where you pulsed the /CAS signal only to access words in the same row and the Acorn designers made good use of that for the Electron (reading 8 bits from a 4 bit wide memory) and the ARM based Archimedes (fetching instructions other than jump, load or store as well as loading the video and audio FIFOs). From one DRAM generation to the next the cycle time might be different for chips with the same access time. This allowed me to make the 512KB Macintosh faster than the 128KB one (http://www.merlintec.com/lsi/mac512.html). reply tom_ 8 hours agoparentYou could also have shorter cycles times by just doing it and assuming it'll be fine. Acorn's Master Turbo uses 4864-2 DRAMs, which have a 150 ns access time/270 ns cycle time, for, I think, a max throughput of 1e9/270=3,703,703 bytes/sec - but the Master Turbo's 65c02 CPU runs at 4 MHz, and therefore requires 4,000,000 bytes/sec.

Both sides were tested and the factory ended up with a huge pile of floppies that passed both sides and a small pile that failed one side (and some that failed both sides and were discarded). The market wanted more single sided disks so they simply moved a number of floppies from the first pile to the second. That meant that you mostly likely got a double sided product when you paid for a single sided one. But it was a risk.

Some years ago I’ve tried to write a precisely timed bitbanging loop on a STM8 microcontroller (a 650x/680x-alike with an allegedly 3-stage pipeline and a small prefetch buffer; cents per chip pre-Covid), and the instruction prefetch completely screwed me up. (At least I think it was the instruction prefetch? The thing depended on branch target alignment, whatever it was.) The one relevant question on Stack Overflow that hasn’t received any answers in years; the manufacturer documentation mentions its instruction timings are “simplified”, aka a lie, and gives a more elaborate model of the pipeline that it admits is also a lie and can’t reproduce the timings I’m seeing. Many things are immeasurably easier than what I remember as a middle-schooler with an utterly anachronistic 286 in post-Soviet early 2000s Moscow, so that’s nice.

Today’s me could work the motherboard design of the 286 by looking at it, even without the manuals; my current laptop’s manufacturer’s refusal to release the schematics annoys me enough that I’ve half a mind to ask some physicists if they have a CT machine they could run the board through.) reply vardump 11 hours agorootparentCompared to now, back then it was a lot more you had to figure out on your own. I remember coding a game on C64 in the eighties. Just to figure out how to print the players score so that it is sufficiently fast was a challenge.

Nevertheless, there have been some late variants of 486 that have been introduced after the first Pentium, in 1994 or later, and which had CPUID, e.g. the Intel 486DX4 (100 MHz). AMD had 2 generations of 486DX4 (and of 486DX2), the first did not have CPUID (and it had a write-through cache memory), while the second had CPUID (and it had a write-back cache memory). Some Cyrix CPUs with properties intermediate between 486 and Pentium had CPUID, but it was disabled by default and it could be enabled in the BIOS. Measuring the length of the prefetch queue was the standard method to identify 8088 vs. 8086 and this was available in several commercial CPU detection utilities that were available for MS-DOS, e.g. in Norton Utilities or the like.

I wonder if that can be expanded on. An old (now departed) friend once said to me that this was a mirage, because the only thing that the narrower bus really bought them was that it made the 16kB configuration possible, which no-one actually bought (the minimum for using floppies was 32kB!). He claimed that the narrower bus didn't actually make the configurations with more RAM cheaper because it made them require more support chips. Is there any truth to this? reply adrian_b 1 hour agorootparentThe cost saving was more a marketing trick. Most of the savings were not from memory but from the reuse of the existing 8-bit peripherals without additional hardware and without software changes. On a 16-bit bus, you could connect an 8-bit peripheral to one of its halves, but then the internal registers that previously were at consecutive addresses now were spread at multiples of 2. When doing only 8-bit transfers, you could rewrite the software drivers to use the modified addresses. However you could not do 16-bit transfers, because the bytes were no longer in the same word. This could be fixed with additional buffers, decoders and registers, to convert 16-bit transfers into pairs of 8-bit transfers on the same bus half (like 8088 did internally), but that would increase the cost. Even if these compatibility problems were not too difficult to solve, most preferred to avoid them, in the quest for minimum cost. reply kens 8 hours agorootparentprevAccording to Dave Bradley, one of the creators of the IBM PC, \"We chose the 8088 [over the 8086] because of its 8-bit data bus. The smaller bus saved money in the areas of RAM, ROM, and logic for the simple system.\" Another thing is that even if almost nobody bought the minimal RAM configuration, having a low-cost configuration can be very important from a marketing standpoint. (By the way, it's kind of amazing that the base RAM for an IBM PC was just 16 kilobytes, and now 16 gigabytes is a base RAM configuration.) https://www.tech-insider.org/personal-computers/research/199... reply gary_0 9 hours agorootparentprevIt's mentioned at the bottom of this article[0] that Intel had an obsession with using the smallest packaging and pin count possible, while competitors did not see any need to be that conservative. I wonder if that has something to do with it. [0] https://www.righto.com/2023/07/8086-pins.html reply phire 8 hours agorootparentThe 8088 and 8086 actually have the same number of pins and almost identical pinouts, despite the the difference in data bus width. This is because the data and address are multiplexed onto the same pins, because of intel's obsession with lowest pincount (each pin does add quite a bit of cost to packaging). On the 8086, the bottom 16 address pins (of 20) are multiplexed with data, on the 8088, only the bottom 8 address pins are multiplexed. So you had to demultiplex the bus no matter which chip you chose. I think the cost savings mostly come from being able to configure systems with only 8 DRAM chips per bank (instead of 16 DRAM chips per bank with the 8086). A 16 bit bus also requires that your ROM chips are in pairs, and it probably increases the motherboard routing complexity. And a small bit of extra decoding logic. A 16 bit bus would have also required IBM to skip straight over the 8 bit ISA standard with it's smaller sockets and forced up the complexity of all PC expansion cards (which would also require double the ROM chips, double the RAM chips and extra logic) Edit: And now that I think about it, the fact that the upper bit of the address bus aren't multiplexed might actually allow you to simplify the DRAM row/column addressing logic... But only if you put the column into the upper bits of the address. reply kinj28 9 hours agoprev [–] I wonder if queue length is already maintained by queue counter then is there really a need for MT flag? Let’s say even if it is possible to do it, would the resulting saving of real estate and power would be worth the effort? reply phire 8 hours agoparent [–] Two reasons: 1. The queue is 4 bytes long, which fits neatly in a two bit counter. You would have to switch to a three bit counter to store the 5th state, which increases the area and power usage by ~50% 2. The MT signal is explictly needed to stall the execution unit when the prefetch queue is empty. If you replaced the flag register with a 5th state of the queue counter, then you would still need combination logic to generate the MT signal (queue[0] != 1 || queue[1] != 1 || queue[2] != 1) I'm guessing this two bit counter + MT flag scheme is actually optimal from a transistor count perspective. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
