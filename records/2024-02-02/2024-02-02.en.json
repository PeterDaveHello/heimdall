    "originBody": "My favourite Git commit Aug 30, 2019 I like Git commit messages. Used well, I think they’re one of the most powerful tools available to document a codebase over its lifetime. I’d like to illustrate that by showing you my favourite ever Git commit. This commit is from my time at the Government Digital Service, working on GOV.UK. It’s from a developer by the name of Dan Carley, and it has the rather unassuming name of “Convert template to US-ASCII to fix error”. A quick aside: one of the benefits of coding in the open, as practised at GDS, is that it’s possible to share examples like this outside the organisation that produced them. I’m not sure who first introduced that idea to GDS – it was well-established by the time I joined – but I’m forever grateful to them. Why I like this commit I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve shared this as an example of what commit messages can do. It’s fun because of the ratio of commit message to code change, but that’s not why I think it’s worth sharing. In a different organisation, from a different developer, this entire commit message might have been change whitespace, or fix bug, or (depending on the team’s culture) some less than flattering opinions about the inventor of the non-breaking space. Instead, Dan took the time to craft a really useful commit message for the benefit of those around him. I’d like to step through a few of the ways I think this is a really good example. It explains the reason for the change The best commit messages I’ve seen don’t just explain what they’ve changed: they explain why. In this instance: I introduced some tests in a feature branch to match the contents of `/etc/nginx/router_routes.conf`. They worked fine when run with `bundle exec rake spec` or `bundle exec rspec modules/router/spec`. But when run as `bundle exec rake` each should block failed with: ArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII Without this level of detail, we could hazard a guess that this commit fixed some kind of parsing error in some tool or other. Thanks to the commit message, we know exactly which tool it was. This kind of information can be really valuable to document, and is all too easy to lose as people forget the original context behind their work, move on to other teams, and eventually leave the organisation. It’s searchable One of the first things in this commit message is the error message that inspired the change: ArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII Anyone else who comes across this error can search through the codebase, either by running git log --grep \"invalid byte sequence\" or by using GitHub’s commit search. In fact, from the looks of the search results, multiple people did so, and found out who had found this problem before, when they came across it, and what they did about it. It tells a story This commit message goes into a lot of detail about what the problem looked like, what the process of investigating it looked like, and what the process of fixing it looked like. For example: I eventually found that removing the `.with_content(//)` matchers made the errors go away. That there weren't any weird characters in the spec file. And that it could be reproduced by requiring Puppet in the same interpreter This is one of the areas commit messages can really shine, because they’re documenting the change itself, rather than documenting a particular file, or function, or line of code. This makes them a great place to document this kind of extra information about the journey the codebase has taken. It makes everyone a little smarter One thing Dan did here that I really appreciate was to document the commands he ran at each stage. This can be a great lightweight way to spread knowledge around a team. By reading this commit message, someone can learn quite a few useful tips about the Unix toolset: they can pass an -exec argument into find to run a command against each file found that adding a \\+ onto the end of this command does something interesting (it passes many filenames into a single file command, rather than running the command once per file) file --mime can tell them the MIME type of a file iconv exists The person who reviews this change can learn these things. Anyone who finds this commit later can learn these things. Over enough time and enough commits, this can become a really powerful multiplier for a team. It builds compassion and trust Now the tests work! One hour of my life I won't get back.. This last paragraph adds an extra bit of human context. Reading these words, it’s hard not to feel just a little bit of Dan’s frustration at having to spend an hour tracking down a sneaky bug, and satisfaction at fixing it. Now imagine a similar message attached to a short-term hack, or a piece of prototype code that made its way into production and set down roots (as pieces of prototype code love to do). A commit message like this makes it much easier to remember that every change has a human on the other end of it, making the best decision they could given the information they had at the time. Good commits matter I’ll admit this is an extreme example, and I wouldn’t expect all commits (especially ones of this size) to have this level of detail. Still, I think it’s an excellent example of explaining the context behind a change, of helping others to learn, and of contributing to the team’s collective mental model of the codebase. If you’re interested in learning a bit more about the benefits of good commit messages, and some of the tools that make it easier to structure your changes around them, I can recommend: Telling stories through your commits by Joel Chippindale A branch in time by Tekin Süleyman",

    "commentBody": "My favourite Git commit (2019) (dhwthompson.com)610 points by karagenit 18 hours agohidepastfavorite352 comments schacon 16 hours agoFor better or worse, my experience as a GitHub cofounder and author of several Git books (Pro Git, etc) is that the Git commit message is a unique vector for code documentation that is highly sub-optimal. The main issue is that most of the tooling (in Git or GitHub or whatever) generally only shows the first line. So in the case of this commit example would be the very simple message of a generic \"US-ASCII error\" problem. Everything they talk about in this article is what is great about the _rest_ of the commit message, which, given modern tools, is _almost never_ seen by anyone. The main problem is that Git was built so that the commit message is the _email body_, meant to be read by everyone in the project. But for better or worse, that is not generally the role of this text today. Almost nobody ever sees it. Unless it's discussed in a bunch of patch series over a mailing list, nobody reads anything other than the first 50 chars of the headline. It's actively difficult to do, by nearly every tool built around the Git ecosystem. Even if you're _very good_ at Git, finding the correct invocation of \"git blame\" (is it \"-w -C -C -C\"? Or just _two_ dash C's?) to even find the right messages that are relevant to the code blocks you care about is not widely known and even if you find them, still only show the first line. Then you need to \"git show\" the identified commit SHA to get this long form message. There is just no good way to find this information, even if it's well written. This is one of my biggest complaints with Git (or, indeed, any VCS before it), and I think why people just don't care much about good commit messages. It's just not easy to get this data back once it's written. If you want an example of this, search through the Git project's history. Run a blame on any file. It's _so hard_ to figure out a story of any function implementation in any file, but the commit messages are _pristine_. Paragraphs and paragraphs of high quality explanation for almost every single commit. Look at any single commit that Jeff King has done for the last decade. Hundreds of hours of amazing documentation from a true genius that almost nobody will ever appreciate. It's horrifying. I don't know exactly what the answer is, but the sad truth of Git is that writing amazing documentation via commit message, for most communities, is almost entirely a waste of time. It's just too difficult to find them. reply js2 16 hours agoparentAs someone who has contributed to Git since before GitHub existed and who maintains legacy code, I simply cannot disagree more. I use `git blame`, `git log`, and `git show` in the terminal all the time. It's trivial to follow the history of a file. It takes me seconds to use `git log -G` to find when something was added or removed. Nothing pains me more than to track down the commit and then find a commit message that's of the form \"bleh\" or \"add a thing\" when the developer could have spent 60 second to write down why they did it. Nothing gives me more joy than to find a commit message (often my own) that explains in detail why something was done. A single good commit message can save me hours or days of work. Let me also just say, and this is a bit of shot: GitHub contributes to the problem of bad commit messages. If I'm lucky, folks have put some amount of detail in the PR description, but sadly that's not close at hand to the commit log. It's another tool I have to open. Usually though, the PR is just a link to Jira, so that's another degree of indirection I need to follow. Then the Jira is a link to a Slack conversation. And the Slack conversation probably links to a Google doc. As an industry, we're _terrible_ at documentation. But folks like Jeff King are fighting the good fight. At the end of the day, I don't think the problem is with the technology. I think it's a people problem. Folks perceive writing documentation as extra work, so they don't. There's no immediate value to it. The payoff comes days, weeks, or months later. Please, write good commit messages. Just spend a minute saying why you did something so that every commit isn't a damn Chesteron's fence exercise. Put it in the commit message where I can easily find it. Your future self and I thank you. Edit to add: I didn't address your argument, that commit messages are too hard to find. First, I don't find this to be true. I rarely have trouble following the history of a line of code, a function, or a file. Second, commit messages have value at the time they are written even if they are never seen again. I find that writing a good commit message helps ensure that I've written in code what I've intended to (I often view the diff while writing the commit message) and they have value to the people reviewing my code. reply neilkk 14 hours agorootparentThe thing is that writing a good commit message for future people doing `git blame` is only worth it if it's a line of code which someone in the future will look at and need to know why it was changed from its previous form to the current form. If you simply want to comment the current state of the code, you should add a comment in the code. No one will ever need to know in the future why that particular space character is an ascii space, so the whole commit message is just a blog entry in the wrong place. It would have made sense to just put a comment at the top of the file saying \"make sure encoding is whatever\". reply atq2119 6 hours agorootparentThen don't write commit messages for the future, write them for reviewers. Seriously, as somebody who reviews a lot of code, well-written commit messages are a godsend. It's an awful shame that GitHub doesn't allow commenting on commit messages. It's as if GitHub is being run by people who just don't know how Git is meant to be used. reply erhaetherth 5 hours agorootparentI write commit messages for future-me. Sooner or later I'm going to encounter the same problem again and wonder how I solved it last time. If I have a vague inkling that I dealt with this before, all I have to do is searching through my commit history and I can find it again. I can search my author (me), I can search by date, I can search by what files I touched. It's lovely. reply u801e 5 hours agorootparentprev> It's an awful shame that GitHub doesn't allow commenting on commit messages. You actually can comment on a commit itself. I'm in the habit on middle-clicking on the sha1 link of commits in a PR and looking at the commit itself. You can comment on lines in the commit, and there's a text area at the bottom where you can comment on the entire commit itself. I'll then follow up with making a comment on the PR linking the commit (pasting the sha1 link) and saying I made a few comments here. > It's as if GitHub is being run by people who just don't know how Git is meant to be used. Github wasn't really designed with code review in mind. A lot of the features they added over the years for review appear to be hacked on rather than fixing fundamental design issues (like being able to comment on commit messages without having to jump through a bunch of hoops). Review systems like gerrit, phabricator, review board, or even email, do a much better job at exposing individual commits and their associated metadata like the commit message. reply sverhagen 49 minutes agorootparentI don't think they were suggesting to review the individual commits, rather the (individual) commit messages. Commit messages are text, so you could have a similar line by line click-and-comment review interface as you already have for the code changes. reply js2 11 hours agorootparentprevSometimes a comment is appropriate. Sometimes a commit message is appropriate. Sometimes I need both. Often when dealing with legacy code I find neither. I'd be happy with either. A commit message lets me tell a short story about a change that touches multiple locations in the code base. Maybe no one part of the change is all that tricky. A commit message also allows me to explain why I'm making the change, whereas a comment may explain why the code is the way it is. Commit messages and comments have overlapping use cases, but the Venn diagram is not a circle. $0.02. reply sverhagen 48 minutes agorootparent>Sometimes a comment is appropriate. Sometimes a commit message is appropriate. Sometimes I need both. And often your get neither... reply tehnub 12 hours agorootparentprevThe thing is that writing a good commit message for future people doing `git blame` is only worth it if it's a line of code which someone in the future will look at and need to know why it was changed from its previous form to the current form. Well what about this example: I removed a few lines of code and explained in the commit message why I thought it was correct to do that. If somebody (possibly me) comes looking for that code and realizes it's not there, they'll be much happier to see some sort of explanation rather than a \"removed lines\" message. Regarding commenting in the code vs. in the commit message, sometimes I copy-paste my explanatory comment if there is one into my commit message. reply neilkk 12 hours agorootparentRight. You've given an example of exactly what I said was the only reasonable use case for detailed info in the commit message: someone in the future will need to know the history of that particular piece of code. It seems like the point of your specific example is to say 'in some cases you might want to know the history of a gap'. Fine. That seems like a nitpick to me. No one in the future will need to know the history of a particular ascii encoded blank space (among a whole file of ASCII encoded blank spaces). Anyone who needs the general info that the file needs to be ascii will be helped by it being somewhere else, as opposed to in a random commit message. reply thfuran 10 hours agorootparentBut virtually every diff is one that someone in the future might want more information on. You can't know that they won't until you get to the end of the future and haven't needed it. reply Izkata 5 hours agorootparentprev> If you simply want to comment the current state of the code, you should add a comment in the code. I think you mean \"past state of the code\"... These comments rarely get updated. My favorite recent one was several sentences describing a data structure and how it mapped out statuses, written about a decade ago. Barely a year after that comment and its code was written, the entire thing was re-written with completely different structure - and the comment left unchanged. Left a co-worker completely baffled due to inexperience with perl, we figured out what happened because of svn blame. reply JetSetIlly 2 hours agorootparentThe drifting of code from comments is a problem I would love to see solved. I've seen tools that can compare the git commit dates of code with nearby comments and that's a good start. However, there are potential problems with that, such as code and the comments that discuss the code not being near each other; or the code being updated and there being no need to update the comment I think literal programming might help here, but that's an entirely different topic really. Looking for more advanced tools that that and I suppose we're into the world of AI - asking the tool to understand both the code and the comment and to compare the underlying meaning. Code review is an option but outside of an organisation that's difficult to do and besides, I think the problem would be best solved by something that is repeatable and part of the build process. And I'd love to be able to have a git commit hook that can say, \"hold on! you've updated code but there's a comment that now looks old\". That's the dream. reply metafunctor 2 hours agorootparentprevMistakes can happen. But if code comments are frequently not updated as the code evolves, it is a level of lazy that will probably manifest in other ways as well. reply Dylan16807 13 hours agorootparentprev> the whole commit message is just a blog entry in the wrong place. Right. All this wonderful information and detailed error messages need to be findable by someone searching the same error. Someone digging into the code is a very different use case and they need a tiny fraction of that information. reply cerved 11 hours agorootparentprevThe example in the blog post would be a much better example if some kind of test or linting step was added to catch these white-space errors, to explain the need for catching such errors. Pro tip, you can write both comments and commit messages. reply Izkata 5 hours agorootparentprevDefinite agree there: Be it git or svn I spent a huge amount of my bugfixing and refactoring time in the history figuring out why things are the way they are. > Usually though, the PR is just a link to Jira, so that's another degree of indirection I need to follow. Then the Jira is a link to a Slack conversation. And the Slack conversation probably links to a Google doc. Assuming all those links in the chain still exist. Before Jira we had FogBugz, almost all those old cases are gone (some were imported). And we used Flowdock for 10 years, that's completely gone. Commit messages are the only thing we can rely on for this history. Use it. And try to avoid squashing commits, that erases this history - yes, even for a feature branch, changes from code review should be separate from the initial push, explain why it's being changed so we don't make the same mistake later. reply nox101 6 hours agorootparentprevI'm mixed on this. My project has a bug tracker. A commit is required to have a bug id. The bug tracker has entire discussions of what lead to the commit so it's not clear to me that a detailed commit message is a plus when the real detailed info is in the tracker. Yes it's indirect but there's no way I'm going to summarize the entire issue discussion. Maybe this is a job for machine learning. Read the code, read the commits, read the bug tracker, add a git super-blame that asks the LLM to summarize why every line is the way it is and what it's doing reply u801e 6 hours agorootparent> A commit is required to have a bug id. The bug tracker has entire discussions of what lead to the commit Companies do change bug trackers and ticketing systems and those links may no longer work years down the line. > The bug tracker has entire discussions of what lead to the commit so it's not clear to me that a detailed commit message is a plus when the real detailed info is in the tracker. Yes it's indirect but there's no way I'm going to summarize the entire issue discussion. But summarizing it can be one of the most valuable things you can do for a maintainer who has to make changes years after you've moved on. For one thing, the problem and discussion is fresh in your mind and you understand the context. In a few minutes, you could summarize the problem, the approach taken to fix it and alternatives that were considered but not used because the chosen solution clearly didn't have an issue/was more efficient, etc. Even if you didn't want to do that, you could just copy and paste the entire discussion text at the end of the commit message so that even if the bug tracker is no longer in use in the future, the discussion itself was preserved in the commit history and accessible via git log or blame. reply Izkata 5 hours agorootparent> > A commit is required to have a bug id. The bug tracker has entire discussions of what lead to the commit > Companies do change bug trackers and ticketing systems and those links may no longer work years down the line. I've experienced this twice, we switched from Bugzilla to FogBugz to Jira in my time. With one relatively small exception in the FogBugz to Jira transition, all past case information was lost. reply ghqst 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is why at work the only required rule for commit messages is that they include the story number, so we can very easily find at least the general reason for a change from git blame. reply spacemankiller 10 hours agorootparentprev> Edit to add: I didn't address your argument, that commit messages are too hard to find. First, I don't find this to be true. I rarely have trouble following the history of a line of code, a function, or a file. I don’t think this is proper way of reasoning. What is hard and easy is subjective. And you discuss it as it would be objective. Word against word. It would be wise to have some poll and see results. If one geek is writing and reading commit messages doesn’t mean it’s easily accessible by everyone. It’s hard to make something as a widespread standard if tooling doesn’t make it super easy to access. Allow people to leave kudos and emoji to other people commits messages and people will start making them better :D And later show heroic people with git —-stats reply corethree 6 hours agorootparentprevHis credentials indicate that it may be possible that his arguments are based on data while your credentials and evidence indicate personal, anecdotal experience. Therefore I would trust his reasoning more. Additionally, I personally identify with it. I mean a git developer finds git easy to use? That's biased data. I love how both of you dropped your street cred before launching into your reasoning. It just shows how much more credentials convinces people rather then the argument itself. Normally that stuff logically doesn't matter and people are just doing it to grab some \"authoritah\" but in this case your backgrounds actually contributed to the arguments. reply krobelus 13 hours agoparentprev> The main problem is that Git was built so that the commit message is the _email body_, meant to be read by everyone in the project. I find this very hard to believe. Isn't it \"everyone who is interested in the commit subject/files touched should read the body\".

Any good IDE will be able to annotate each line with blame info, and show the diff at the press of a button. On such diffs, the IDE should allow recursive blaming on context/deleted lines. Tools like Tig allow exactly that. GitHub certainly does make it hard to see commit messages, I give you that :) > Hundreds of hours of amazing documentation from a true genius that almost nobody will ever appreciate. It's horrifying. ?? It's not like it was written for fun. This documentation attached to a commit exists to reduce the risk of accepting the patch from someone who might not be around in future, to fix any problems introduced. By disclosing all their relevant thoughts, the author shows their good intentions: they enable others to build on top of their work. If the author kept their thoughts to themselves they would gradually build up exclusive ownership of the code, which is often not a good idea. Also a commit message serves as proof of work, which can be important when there's too many patches. For commercial projects some of this is less important. reply makeitdouble 9 hours agorootparentI might be in the minority, but parent's comment is probably about people like me: most of my coworkers have context free, or at best succinct commit messages. I never read more than the first line listed in the commit list, and don't even assume the description is always accurate. Instead I'll spend my time stalking the related merge request, where the full description of the whole change resides, with probably a link to the ticket or reference documentation, and all the back and forth on why something is or isn't a good idea. I think the world could be a better place if all of that was in git directly, but that's also utting much more burden on an already complex tool. reply brabel 16 hours agoparentprev> Even if you're _very good_ at Git, finding the correct invocation of \"git blame\" (is it \"-w -C -C -C\"? Or just _two_ dash C's?) to even find the right messages I am terrible at git on the terminal, but with IntelliJ or emacs and magit, I can trivially find every commit ever to change a file, and easily navigate the commits to see every full commit message. It's not hard when you use a proper tool, and I have a feeling almost everyone has something like that?! Do you really try to stick with the git CLI and memorize hundreds of commands and flags?? Why?! reply winwhiz 15 hours agorootparentReally simple answer: Repeatability. I am not saying it is the only one right blessed answer, but if you really want to know why people haven't moved to pure GUI interfaces, imagine describing to someone how to add a new directory to their path. fleet $HOME/.config/fish.config # ADD this line somewhere set -x PATH /opt/git/bin $PATH Or: 1. Either hit WINDOWS-E and right click on This PC and select properties (it might be called something other than This PC if someone renamed it) or either press WINDOWS key or click Start or click the Windows icon (if you don't see them try mousing into a corner of your screen (typically bottom left) until they and the rest of the bar un-autohide) look for and click a gear symbol (should expand to say Settings if you hover), click System, on the left and the bottom you should see About. 2. Click the text Advanced system settings (on the right), look for a new window with a set of tabs, you want Advanced. Click the button Environment Variables. 3. In the top columnar box EITHER find a variable named Path, highlight and click button Edit, in a new window click button New, type '/opt/bin/git' in a text field that has appeared at the bottom list items, click OK OR click the button New, in a new window enter Path for Variable name and /opt/git/bin for Variable value, click OK (you shouldn't need to Browse Directory or Browse File). 4. Click OK button, click OK button, close Settings window. reply marwis 14 hours agorootparentOn Windows it's actually just: 1. Press Win key 2. Type env 3. Choose system or account reply fbdab103 7 hours agorootparentIt's even better because thanks to the Start Menu randomization process either could appear first in the results. Sometimes they will switch position after being presented. reply winwhiz 12 hours agorootparentprevThanks! This is what I was secretly hoping for. I am doing this a lot lately. reply gregmac 11 hours agorootparentprevYour fictional example is not a good comparison -- I just can't imagine the scenario where you need to explain to someone who doesn't know how to modify their path why they need to add something to it. For someone actually using git (and the CLI, at that) I'd expect to be able to say \"oh, make sure git is in your path\" and for them to understand how to check and set that, or at least be able to Google it and follow the instructions themselves. Likewise I'd ask something like \"Can you cherry pick just that bug fix into a new PR so we can merge and deploy it today?\", not give them a series of git CLI commands to paste in. My observation of git beginners is ones using CLI say things like \"oh, I screwed up my repo and had to clone a new copy\". Good GUIs don't easily cause this situation, and mostly let you see and fix what happens when you do some weird accidental merge or rebase or someone else has force-pushed. reply rablackburn 5 hours agorootparent> I just can't imagine the scenario where you need to explain to someone who doesn't know how to modify their path why they need to add something to it. Sounds like someone hasn’t had to train fresh graduate engineers for awhile ;) reply winwhiz 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I think I conflated a git specific question from the GP and a more general CLI question, my bad. The argument can be made the interfacing with git is bad whether with mouse or with keyboard. My git secret weapon is to ask myself how do I make git do this thing that is easy in Subversion or Fossil and then I do that thing and I write it down so I can do it again in X number of months. reply Dylan16807 13 hours agorootparentprevHave you ever heard of \"abstraction\"? People that actually use windows can handle opening the start menu as a single part of a step. There's no conscious checklist for how the UI can be customized. If you're going to make that into a complicated mess, then you absolutely do not get to assume the user understands \"add this line somewhere\" or has \"fleet\" installed and set up the way you expect. reply winwhiz 12 hours agorootparentYes, I think we agree that abstraction is great (with or without \"scair\" quotes.) My point is that CLIs are valued as tools of explication, repeatable explication. I have actually used Window since 3.1. I cherry picked a particularly juicy example that I run into a lot. > If you're going to make that into a complicated mess, then you absolutely do not get to assume... As far as tooling goes the GP mentioned IntelliJ so I rewrote code with fleet, I could have easily have picked emacs or vim or bash or zsh or tcsh instead of fish and the complexity of interface would have remained static. I think HN formatting tools are partly to blame for the messiness but if you look at any quality set of docs describing a complicated computer interaction, to achieve the same level of repeatability as text-based, POSIXy interactions you are going to need a lot of screen shots and a few this or thats. WHICH is fine! Remember software engineering is about trade offs! EDIT: CLI allows for abstractions like $EDITOR and $SHELL reply keybored 14 hours agorootparentprevIf the tool calls git(1) then it can show you the script that your actions produced. Magit has something like this but I’ve never used it for that (since I also use git(1)) so I don’t know if it captures the whole context/commands. I used a GUI frontend to R in a statistics course. Never needed to write R myself. reply EdwardDiego 14 hours agorootparentprevDon't even need the set -x, can just use fish_add_path for convenience. reply bradjohnson 15 hours agorootparentprevIME git abstractions make it easy to read and navigate standard workflows, but incredibly difficult to repair issues that arise due to divergence of some kind or another because they are so opinionated. I use git 99% in the terminal, and 1% in some git tool for visualization, but I find that a lot of people use it in the opposite way and have problems working with others that use a very slightly different workflow. You don't need to memorize hundreds of commands and flags, honestly a dozen or two gets you to expert status in most respects. reply brabel 15 hours agorootparentI don't have any problem at all, when some really tricky stuff needs to be done, I google for a solution and run whatever command magic I find. If you don't need to google for git commands to do uncommon things, I imagine you have a huge capacity to memorize things, good for you, but most of us don't. I do understand how git works and could use the CLI most of the time if I wanted to, but there's exactly zero reason to do so. The GUIs offered by modern tools make it much more convenient and efficient to do things correctly.

Push your branch and a great diff is waiting for you. reply mostlylurks 13 hours agorootparentprevI don't find it more difficult to use or remember commands for than remembering how to accomplish similar tasks in some GUI (especially if that GUI is emacs). And unlike most GUIs (emacs may be an exception), I can trust that my knowledge of the git CLI won't become out of date when my GUI tool inevitably undergoes a UI redesign of some sort. But more importantly, the CLI allows my typical workflow where I chain together a bunch of git (and other) commands in a row, allowing me to just type in, for instance, several different commits, their messages, and what files should go into each in one go without having to break my concentration by having to move around in some GUI between commits. Sprinkle in some stash manipulation and interactive rebases, compilation, and unit testing, and you'll really start to see how the CLI allows you to offload some of your working memory to your invocation in a way that a GUI just can't. reply schacon 16 hours agorootparentprevI don't know IntelliJ well, but I would be surprised if they did the rather expensive rename following that the multiple -C invocations did.

I think it's optimized for discussions before integration, which is largely what PR descriptions and comments are largely used for now. I feel like given great commit messages, determining a story and useful history around any block of code given the Git tooling is incredibly difficult even if there are _amazing_ commit messages. Like say you are trying to determine why a 10 line function is the way that it is. You blame it. Not even with the stupid-simple GitHub UI that _I_ originally wrote, but with the more expensive CLI interface that follows renames and ignores whitespace changes, etc. Now you get a list of SHAs of commits and the first 50 chars of commit messages for each line for the last modifications, etc. How do you even stitch those messages into a useful story (in order) to tell you how that function evolved to what it is now and why? reply cesarb 16 hours agorootparentIt might depend on which tools you're using. When I'm doing historical research for how a function evolved, I normally run \"gitk\" on the file, and walk through the commits; the full commit message is shown together with each diff to the file. It used to be even better in the past, when gitk showed the full commit diff, instead of the diff to just the file I passed on the command line, but \"git show\" on the commit hash (or another gitk which is not filtered to a path) is good enough. reply somerandomqaguy 13 hours agorootparentprevTediously commit by commit. But it's often better then the alternative. Design decisions and business logic separately from the code or source control are infinitely harder to reference code against, and realistically that documentation will be lost. At least if you have the git repo then there's at least some chance to be able to git through the history of some code that's kept with the code. Especially for stuff that code cannot document and you're working with devs that seem to be firmly believe that code is self documenting. Doesn't mean that every code base needs to have amazing git commits.

Meanwhile the git project links every commit to the message id whence the original patch (for many years now—not the whole history).

Not every project uses github or a github workflow. > I think it's optimized for discussions before integration It's optimized for discussion of the purpose of the code unit in question. That discussion can be useful before integration; but pre-integration discussion can happen any way you like. PR discussions work, e-mails on mailing lists work. Face-to-face discussion works. The real value (for me, I guess; apparently you just don't see it that way) is explaining the purpose (and possibly circumstances) of the commit, after the fact, when I'm looking at it for some reason or other. Not finding the commit, but explaining it once I'm there. A well-written commit message can be absolutely priceless. Maybe this last point should go in a top-level response to your original comment, but I'm already here, so I'll just say it here. Saying that commit messages are terrible because only short-messages (the \"subject line\") are shown by default, seems to me about the same as saying e-mail bodies are useless for the same reason, or that file contents are terrible because `find` only lists file names by default. You 'have' to collapse by default, or you'd drown in a sea of commit messages anytime you tried to list anything. > Like say you are trying to determine why a 10 line function is the way that it is.

Okay, I hear you, this is not the most ergonomic procedure to one-off. But seriously, you have the SHA commits. If you need to do this often, write a tool that takes those SHA commits, orders them based on log order (or chronological order, w/e, pick an ordering mechanism), and prints out whatever information is interesting to you. A simple display that can expand/collapse full messages, diffs, etc. would probably do nicely. It can be a GUI tool, a CLI tool (menu-driven, maybe); whatever works for you.

So a user of the git CLI will regularly see complete commit messages, unless they purposefully request a different format.

Other than that, `git log` already provides so much information to /search or even `grep` through that I can't think of any other flags I use regularly, and if you don't use them regularly you forget them. The real GOAT that people are sleeping on is `git rebase --interactive` where you can go back and edit part of your branch to clean it up before rebasing or merging towards main. The cleaner the commits are, the more useful they become later for other tools like log, merge, rebase, cherry-pick, bisect, etc. reply ycombobreaker 9 hours agorootparentA rebase to clean up your branch is great, and I lean on my team to do this.

The rest of that discussion is whether it meets the bar and what needs to be adjusted before it can land on the collaborative trunk. Done well, that is valuable reading. Git was designed with the distributed viewpoint. A commit message, as written by the author, is necessarily correct: I’ve decided this is right, and it’s on you to decide if you want to merge it into your history too. In our current systems we usually have a URL in the commit message that links to the actual story behind the commit — the discussion on the pull request, merge request, or code review. I rarely see the results of these discussions being amended into the commit message. If the repo lives forever but the database behind the code review tool gets toasted then something just as important is lost forever. (I come from a background of one idea equals one amended, fast forwarded commit to master. It’s possible other people rely on branch history to reflect the evolution of ideas and how they go from a request for review to approved code. In my experience branch histories tend to have very low quality commit messages and even then they only show one side of the conversation — the author’s responses to their reviewer’s and their own critiques.) reply tux1968 16 hours agoparentprevI never considered the idea that it was atypical, but I read full commit message text all the time.

And sure, I often fiddle with copy-pasting SHA1s like a caveman, but it’s fast enough for some quick history spelunking. Finding the history of a particular code change is even more manual for me: maybe doing a chain of `git log -S'line'` where `line` copy-pasted in at every step. But doable and not a time-sink for my off-hand what’s-this thoughts. (But: something more convenient that isn’t an unreadable Unix pipeline one-liner would be very nice.)

Things like good commit messages and a lot of other best practices are completely avoidable in the name of high pace. However, the time savings are marginal compared to the quality you sacrifice. reply floating-io 15 hours agorootparentprevI would argue (rightly or wrongly) that there are two common truths to such a scenario: Scenario 1, you’re doing a bunch of small changes that work towards a larger purpose. They’re what I like to call “checkpoint commits”. They aren’t the whole story —- just a step along the way to whatever you’re trying to accomplish. Scenario 2, you’re coding instead of thinking. Making “random” changes until you get what you want, but because you’re continuously delivering, they all go to production. Note that “you” here might be the developer, or it might be business people demanding things from said developer. In scenario 1, IMO you should be working on a branch. Then, when you’re finished, you squash your commits and replace the countless mini-messages (“fixed”, “Oops”, “wtf?”) with the actual message you want to be there when you merge it. In scenario 2, especially if it’s driven by business, you’re probably SOL. In this instance, however, I tend to feel like people are making more work for themselves. If they stopped and thought it through for half an hour before starting work, it might only take an hour’s worth of work and one commit, instead of a day and thirty commits. Of course, there are always shades in between. :) reply madsbuch 2 hours agorootparentNone of these, the granularity of the changes are just smaller. Yes, you could argue that we should go with preview envs and only merge larger changes into main. But then again, this adds considerable complexity to the infrastructure – something that might be merited when we scale to 10+ software engineers.

Very much this. If I'm modifying some rather obvious and ovreall simple thing like an obvious config of a grafana, adding a customer to a config and such things... it's hard to really bother with a long commit message. Also, with modern tools like VSCode with the Gremlin plugin, I don't think I'd have spent many words on removing a weird whitespace from a code base, to be honest. On the other hand, if I've spent 4 hours thinking and 2 of those hours discussing the change with another DBA changing a 2 into an 8 in the config of an SLA-critical postgres cluster... spending 10 minutes on a commit message in the config management is - with regard to time - a footnote, irrelevant and inconsequential.

When you're committing is exactly when you already have the context of \"why\" loaded and even a short explanation should be quick to write.

Commit histories are extremely exclusive – everybody not a part of the programming process will be locked out of that information. That is not fair. Regardless, what you describe is more an organisational failure than an issue with commit messages. reply palata 40 minutes agorootparent> In that case, why should the commit history be the place to go? In my experience with open source projects, the history is very much where I go. Say I read some code and don't understand a line (say it is weird, but it does not feel like complete garbage because the rest of the code is actually good), then I will definitely `git blame` or even start digging in the history to see where that line comes from. Good commit messages have saved me more than once in that situation. It doesn't have to be a whole essay, but something meaningful. Something like \"apparently Travis CI wants two white spaces here\" is already useful: it says that back then, they used a CI called \"Travis\" and it required that weird extra space. Now I feel safe removing it because the project does not rely on Travis anymore. (For example). Note: it could be in a comment. But comments rot, move, get out of sync, disappear. It's much harder to check all the revisions of a file in the last 7 years to look for a potential comment on another line than it is to find the commits that actually edited the line of code. reply colelyman 4 hours agoparentprevOne tool that I think promotes commit messages like the OP is magit in Emacs.

In low-velocity opensource libraries, good and clean commit messages can be really helpful when debugging arcane issues. I used to be maintainer of a frontend framework & widget library and we tried to have good commit messages as we'd often go back when over old commits when fixing bugs. I agree that using git from command line for blame is not easy, this is something I always do from GitHub UI instead. When GitHub is the repo's choice for PRs, and the codebase is product codebase with high velocity, having a pristine git history and clean commits and commit messages is not practical; however, the expectation should be to at least have good PR descriptions. When blaming commits in GH UI, it's easy to go to the PR which introduced the commit (it's linked below commit title); and PR descriptions can be enforced via templates in .github folder. PR descriptions have an advantage that they can use images, videos etc. to better explain what they change. This is especially useful for frontend codebases. I work on a big frontend monorepo. We have tools in place to do visual bisect between pull requests (each PR gets its own preview env). We very much do read PR descriptions when doing bisect to confirm which of the recently merged dozens of PRs introduced a regression in production N hours ago. But in general I agree that commit messages are not good place to storage general knowledge (they're good for \"what and why is changing here\"). For documenting gotchas etc. I prefer to have code comments in relevant places of code; or README.md in subfolders. (Sadly, I notice most programmers just don't document anything anywhere at all). reply lawtalkinghuman 16 minutes agoparentprevThe reason people (myself included) rather like good Git commit messages is evident when one compares them to the alternative. You're working in a commercial/closed source environment and want to find out why line 57 in src/blah/db/utils.py does that. Where do you look? - inline code comments. Usually non-existent. Often out-of-date, sometimes misleading, frequently tells you no more than you can discern from just reading the code itself (especially now type annotations are trendy again). Rarely explains why the code exists. There's a reason people caution against too many comments, and that translates into people probably not putting enough commentsin. - calling code? Helpful, but thanks to microservices and increased levels of abstraction (APIs, DI frameworks, messaging buses, config parsing) you've got to go check 900 different repos out to work out what is going on. - email? Give up. You'll find invitations to the company Christmas party and Q2 sales figures but actual tech explanations are in short supply. - Slack etc - same problems as email, plus developers who hide away all the interesting stuff in private team channels - Google Docs - you probably don't have access to the relevant doc, and there's no way to know that you don't - wiki/docs? Half baked, wrong etc. Or it'll be autogenerated JavaDoc type stuff that'll tell you what you already know or can reasonably infer from the code. Also, findability sucks. Or the developers just avoid the whole thing because the software is nasty and corporate and barely usuable. - bug tracker/ticketing system? You ask around and someone says \"oh yeah, Dave made that change two years ago\" and then you search for tickets that match related keywords only to find out that those tickets weren't brought over from Trello into JIRA, and now you need to go ask IT to give you access to the legacy Trello board which they don't want to do because then it'll put them over the five users per month limit or whatever. - Architecture Decision Records / decision logs / whatever you want to to call them - nice if they exist, I guess. - ask the person who wrote it? This assumes they still work there and can remember. Plus you gotta do the asking around routine which takes days and destroys all hope and joy in the world. By a process of elimination, commit messages are the closest you're going to get. They're right there - on your computer, neatly integrated into your editor, hopefully. You can search them fast in a terminal window rather than in some slow web-based monstrosity. If you're lucky, they're actually useful. Even if they aren't, they're at least contextually useful in helping you narrow down your search strategy for the inevitable plunge through email/slack/JIRA/Trello/internal wiki etc. Ideally what should happen is the really useful commit messages get copied into stable technical documentation like decision logs or a properly maintaned wiki. If people did that, great, but it's pretty rare. A culture of sharing weird interesting tech things in a Slack-type system can help because future devs can at least search but you do that at the cost of more interruptions for colleagues now. The broader issue is of all the bad options you can choose, it often tracks the wrong thing. In something like Trello/JIRA/whatever, if you're looking for the technical reasons, it'll have the business reasons without the technical stuff, or vice versa. You generally want both, and most systems only give you half the story. reply phaedrus 4 hours agoparentprevSo then I am not wrong that I do all my git commit messages via the \"-m\" commandline option with a short phrase like \"frob the baz\"?

But even after I gained the option to use e.g. Notepad++ as the editor, I never saw the point in using anything more than \"-m 'message'\".) reply kimixa 3 hours agorootparentGit respects the EDITOR environment variable and has done for decades (so likely before many here really used it) - you should probably be setting that (or equivalent on your platform) to the editor you want anyway. Weird workaround just to avoid basic configuration seems like more work in the long run. reply tibbar 13 hours agoparentprevIn practice, I think GitHub/GitLab/etc solve this UX problem pretty well. Inline git tools let you jump immediately to the PR that generated the code change, and the PR description + code reviews + snapshot of the commit help to understand what the point of the change was. You can search the PRs when you want to find some context. (It's unfortunate that PRs are not stored in the repository itself. I mean, Git is not a great database for a multi-user webpage, so this wouldn't quite work... but it would be nice if the archive was durable and easy to export/share.) reply caskstrength 14 hours agoparentprev> Even if you're _very good_ at Git, finding the correct invocation of \"git blame\" (is it \"-w -C -C -C\"? Or just _two_ dash C's?) to even find the right messages that are relevant to the code blocks you care about is not widely known and even if you find them, still only show the first line. Then you need to \"git show\" the identified commit SHA to get this long form message. There is just no good way to find this information, even if it's well written.

It is also great at letting you seamlessly rebase/split/merge long patch series. reply Groxx 3 hours agoparentprevI feel like this explains a lot about why GitHub is so consistently hostile towards showing or writing decent commit messages. Which has helped push people away from writing useful ones, on an unprecedented scale, which makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy. Great.

I routinely open a file in my editor, hit \"Ctrl-c v B\" for Git Blame mode, go to the line I'm interested in, and hit \"Enter\". Bam, there's the full commit message. From there I can can continue to trace backwards, blaming lines and reading full commit messages. But, you know, not everyone uses Emacs and Magit, fair. How about just using \"git gui blame file\"? Click on a blame line, see the full commit message. This is a tool included with Git (available in a separate package in some installations). OK, rather use an IDE? Install GitLens in VSCode. Easily accessible blame in your editor, where you can hover or click in various places to see full commit messages. I mean, I agree in part; there are some tools which make good commit messages hard to write or find. The tiny little commit message edit box in VScode is not ideal. Lots of people use a workflow of \"commit lots of crappy commits with one liner commit messages, let GitHub/GitLab squash them on merge.\" But as an expert Git user who has managed to convince some teams to have a good commit message culture, if you do get people used to writing good commit messages, they can be very easy to find and read later on, there are tons of tools that make them easy to browse. reply kimixa 3 hours agorootparentI regularly use the git command line, and \"git show (pasted SHA)\" in my second terminal doesn't really feel like the road block to understanding the grandparent seems to make it out to be. It takes me many orders of magnitude more time understanding what is output rather than searching for it, and like you mentioned there are any number of UIs (third party, editor integration, or even shipped with git like gitk) that wire everything up into a nice UI. And I also disagree with the GP's complaint that \"Most people only read the shortlog\" being any kind of disadvantage. The commit message isn't for everyone, it's for the one time someone needs to figure out exactly what it did and why that commit was made, and why a change in X causes a behavior change in Y, and can save hours of work.

So in the case of this commit example would be the very simple message of a generic \"US-ASCII error\" problem. This is a feature, and a crucial one. No one would include fifty lines of explanation if everyone had to see it. It would be better to throw the information away than to inflict it on everyone who was scanning through the commit history looking for a particular change. Yet it is valuable information that only makes sense in the context of that change. There is nothing in the corrected version you can connect to the issue that was fixed. It's obnoxious to include comments about errors that have been removed, like this: # where civica QueryPayments calls are taking too long # use ASCII whitespace (This is ridiculous, but not unrealistic. I've seen code comments that said things like \"# removed syntax error in invocation of query generator.\" This is what you get from programmers trying to juice their LOC stats.) The commit message is the right place for this kind of information, but most people reading the commit messages don't care. They're scanning through looking for something else, and all they need is a few words that tell them if this is the commit they're looking for. The person who needs to see the full story is the person who is interested in this change in particular. Maybe they found it by grepping the git log for \"invalid byte sequence\". Maybe they found it because they're looking at all the changes in that file, because some tooling that occasional modifies that file keeps messing it up. What matters is that if they have a special interest in that change, they have a way to see whatever information they committer felt was worth preserving, and the committer has a place to put that information where only someone with a special interest will see it. reply zaptheimpaler 16 hours agoparentprevI feel half vindicated about my rant a few weeks ago[1] arguing that we should make commit messages as long as we like instead of the stupid 50 character or whatever limit.

It breaks things reply gorkish 15 hours agoparentprevMaking sense of code (or any system that changes over time) vis a vis its own history is one of those things where I really think AI/ML tools can really shine. Even with relatively low quality commit messages, I can look at something that happened 15 years ago in a codebase I am familiar with, and there will probably be enough information that I can assemble the full context, even if finding some of that information is challenging or time consuming. git log, git blame, look at the other code made in the commits, read the issue descriptions, read the code reviews. It just seems like a model could slurp that up and do a decent job of giving you a couple of paragraphs about why the line of code you are staring at is the way it is. TBH putting such a detailed writeup in the git log doesn't really have any return -- for it to ever be useful to you again, you have to know the information is there; you then have to actively seek it out, with the hope that whatever you did to make it 'searchable' is going to work for you again. I can say with surety that if I were looking at a bug similar to the one linked from this article, I would not look to the git log for inpsiring a fix; I'd just fix it. Any extra time I would take would be to understand how a UTF8 nbsp ended up where it shouldn't have been in the first place -- something that the author of this commit seemed to have no interest in doing, but which likely has greater relevance than the documentation of the fix.

Though commit messages are ephemeral and hard to utilize in the future, they're the stream of consciousness of the project.

I think why people just don't care much about good commit messages. It's just not easy to get this data back once it's written. I think people don't care much about good commit messages because they are unprofessional and sloppy. They just want to get the commit in, push the PR/MR, get it reviewed and merged, close that Jira ticket, and get credit for those sweet sweet story points (ugh). And on top of that, they generally don't care to document their changes because they personally don't see the value of doing so. Surely they'll remember the change if they ever revisit it (no of course not, but many people think they will), and they don't really give much thought to the possibility that others might need more context. And besides, all the discussion about the bug or feature or whatever was happening in the bug tracker, so providing a link to that issue in the commit message is enough, right? (No, it's not; I hate it when people do that and think that's all they need to do.) > The main issue is that most of the tooling (in Git or GitHub or whatever) generally only shows the first line. Then maybe this is GitHub's fault; fix your web UI, then. I avoid GUI interfaces to my dev tools as much as possible, and I think the git command line is perfectly fine for this. It absolutely does not only show the first line, generally. 'git log', 'git show', etc. give you the full message by default. In general I would say you have to go out of your way (by providing more command line options) to hide the message when using the command line tools. > the Git commit message is a unique vector for code documentation that is highly sub-optimal. Sure, because it's not a vector for code documentation, it's a vector for change documentation. And there's no better place to put the description of a change than in the record of the change happening.

And nobody reads it because there's so much of it and there's no clear starting point. People just want the summary of what they're looking for. I started to learn Java almost 20 years ago, we had a text book and everything. After the first two chapters, I learned how to google and instead of reading everything, just find what I need.

    "originBody": "Thanksgiving 2023 security incident 02/01/2024 Matthew Prince John Graham-Cumming Grant Bourzikas 11 min read On Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 2023, Cloudflare detected a threat actor on our self-hosted Atlassian server. Our security team immediately began an investigation, cut off the threat actor’s access, and on Sunday, November 26, we brought in CrowdStrike’s Forensic team to perform their own independent analysis. Yesterday, CrowdStrike completed its investigation, and we are publishing this blog post to talk about the details of this security incident. We want to emphasize to our customers that no Cloudflare customer data or systems were impacted by this event. Because of our access controls, firewall rules, and use of hard security keys enforced using our own Zero Trust tools, the threat actor’s ability to move laterally was limited. No services were implicated, and no changes were made to our global network systems or configuration. This is the promise of a Zero Trust architecture: it’s like bulkheads in a ship where a compromise in one system is limited from compromising the whole organization. From November 14 to 17, a threat actor did reconnaissance and then accessed our internal wiki (which uses Atlassian Confluence) and our bug database (Atlassian Jira). On November 20 and 21, we saw additional access indicating they may have come back to test access to ensure they had connectivity. They then returned on November 22 and established persistent access to our Atlassian server using ScriptRunner for Jira, gained access to our source code management system (which uses Atlassian Bitbucket), and tried, unsuccessfully, to access a console server that had access to the data center that Cloudflare had not yet put into production in São Paulo, Brazil. They did this by using one access token and three service account credentials that had been taken, and that we failed to rotate, after the Okta compromise of October 2023. All threat actor access and connections were terminated on November 24 and CrowdStrike has confirmed that the last evidence of threat activity was on November 24 at 10:44. (Throughout this blog post all dates and times are UTC.) Even though we understand the operational impact of the incident to be extremely limited, we took this incident very seriously because a threat actor had used stolen credentials to get access to our Atlassian server and accessed some documentation and a limited amount of source code. Based on our collaboration with colleagues in the industry and government, we believe that this attack was performed by a nation state attacker with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to Cloudflare’s global network. “Code Red” Remediation and Hardening Effort On November 24, after the threat actor was removed from our environment, our security team pulled in all the people they needed across the company to investigate the intrusion and ensure that the threat actor had been completely denied access to our systems, and to ensure we understood the full extent of what they accessed or tried to access. Then, from November 27, we redirected the efforts of a large part of the Cloudflare technical staff (inside and outside the security team) to work on a single project dubbed “Code Red”. The focus was strengthening, validating, and remediating any control in our environment to ensure we are secure against future intrusion and to validate that the threat actor could not gain access to our environment. Additionally, we continued to investigate every system, account and log to make sure the threat actor did not have persistent access and that we fully understood what systems they had touched and which they had attempted to access. CrowdStrike performed an independent assessment of the scope and extent of the threat actor’s activity, including a search for any evidence that they still persisted in our systems. CrowdStrike’s investigation provided helpful corroboration and support for our investigation, but did not bring to light any activities that we had missed. This blog post outlines in detail everything we and CrowdStrike uncovered about the activity of the threat actor. The only production systems the threat actor could access using the stolen credentials was our Atlassian environment. Analyzing the wiki pages they accessed, bug database issues, and source code repositories, it appears they were looking for information about the architecture, security, and management of our global network; no doubt with an eye on gaining a deeper foothold. Because of that, we decided a huge effort was needed to further harden our security protocols to prevent the threat actor from being able to get that foothold had we overlooked something from our log files. Our aim was to prevent the attacker from using the technical information about the operations of our network as a way to get back in. Even though we believed, and later confirmed, the attacker had limited access, we undertook a comprehensive effort to rotate every production credential (more than 5,000 individual credentials), physically segment test and staging systems, performed forensic triages on 4,893 systems, reimaged and rebooted every machine in our global network including all the systems the threat actor accessed and all Atlassian products (Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket). The threat actor also attempted to access a console server in our new, and not yet in production, data center in São Paulo. All attempts to gain access were unsuccessful. To ensure these systems are 100% secure, equipment in the Brazil data center was returned to the manufacturers. The manufacturers’ forensic teams examined all of our systems to ensure that no access or persistence was gained. Nothing was found, but we replaced the hardware anyway. We also looked for software packages that hadn’t been updated, user accounts that might have been created, and unused active employee accounts; we went searching for secrets that might have been left in Jira tickets or source code, examined and deleted all HAR files uploaded to the wiki in case they contained tokens of any sort. Whenever in doubt, we assumed the worst and made changes to ensure anything the threat actor was able to access would no longer be in use and therefore no longer be valuable to them. Every member of the team was encouraged to point out areas the threat actor might have touched, so we could examine log files and determine the extent of the threat actor’s access. By including such a large number of people across the company, we aimed to leave no stone unturned looking for evidence of access or changes that needed to be made to improve security. The immediate “Code Red” effort ended on January 5, but work continues across the company around credential management, software hardening, vulnerability management, additional alerting, and more. Attack timeline The attack started in October with the compromise of Okta, but the threat actor only began targeting our systems using those credentials from the Okta compromise in mid-November. The following timeline shows the major events: October 18 - Okta compromise We’ve written about this before but, in summary, we were (for the second time) the victim of a compromise of Okta’s systems which resulted in a threat actor gaining access to a set of credentials. These credentials were meant to all be rotated. Unfortunately, we failed to rotate one service token and three service accounts (out of thousands) of credentials that were leaked during the Okta compromise. One was a Moveworks service token that granted remote access into our Atlassian system. The second credential was a service account used by the SaaS-based Smartsheet application that had administrative access to our Atlassian Jira instance, the third account was a Bitbucket service account which was used to access our source code management system, and the fourth was an AWS environment that had no access to the global network and no customer or sensitive data. The one service token and three accounts were not rotated because mistakenly it was believed they were unused. This was incorrect and was how the threat actor first got into our systems and gained persistence to our Atlassian products. Note that this was in no way an error on the part of AWS, Moveworks or Smartsheet. These were merely credentials which we failed to rotate. November 14 09:22:49 - threat actor starts probing Our logs show that the threat actor started probing and performing reconnaissance of our systems beginning on November 14, looking for a way to use the credentials and what systems were accessible. They attempted to log into our Okta instance and were denied access. They attempted access to the Cloudflare Dashboard and were denied access. Additionally, the threat actor accessed an AWS environment that is used to power the Cloudflare Apps marketplace. This environment was segmented with no access to global network or customer data. The service account to access this environment was revoked, and we validated the integrity of the environment. November 15 16:28:38 - threat actor gains access to Atlassian services The threat actor successfully accessed Atlassian Jira and Confluence on November 15 using the Moveworks service token to authenticate through our gateway, and then they used the Smartsheet service account to gain access to the Atlassian suite. The next day they began looking for information about the configuration and management of our global network, and accessed various Jira tickets. The threat actor searched the wiki for things like remote access, secret, client-secret, openconnect, cloudflared, and token. They accessed 36 Jira tickets (out of a total of 2,059,357 tickets) and 202 wiki pages (out of a total of 194,100 pages). The threat actor accessed Jira tickets about vulnerability management, secret rotation, MFA bypass, network access, and even our response to the Okta incident itself. The wiki searches and pages accessed suggest the threat actor was very interested in all aspects of access to our systems: password resets, remote access, configuration, our use of Salt, but they did not target customer data or customer configurations. November 16 14:36:37 - threat actor creates an Atlassian user account The threat actor used the Smartsheet credential to create an Atlassian account that looked like a normal Cloudflare user. They added this user to a number of groups within Atlassian so that they’d have persistent access to the Atlassian environment should the Smartsheet service account be removed. November 17 14:33:52 to November 20 09:26:53 - threat actor takes a break from accessing Cloudflare systems During this period, the attacker took a break from accessing our systems (apart from apparently briefly testing that they still had access) and returned just before Thanksgiving. November 22 14:18:22 - threat actor gains persistence Since the Smartsheet service account had administrative access to Atlassian Jira, the threat actor was able to install the Sliver Adversary Emulation Framework, which is a widely used tool and framework that red teams and attackers use to enable “C2” (command and control), connectivity gaining persistent and stealthy access to a computer on which it is installed. Sliver was installed using the ScriptRunner for Jira plugin. This allowed them continuous access to the Atlassian server, and they used this to attempt lateral movement. With this access the Threat Actor attempted to gain access to a non-production console server in our São Paulo, Brazil data center due to a non-enforced ACL. The access was denied, and they were not able to access any of the global network. Over the next day, the threat actor viewed 120 code repositories (out of a total of 11,904 repositories). Of the 120, the threat actor used the Atlassian Bitbucket git archive feature on 76 repositories to download them to the Atlassian server, and even though we were not able to confirm whether or not they had been exfiltrated, we decided to treat them as having been exfiltrated. The 76 source code repositories were almost all related to how backups work, how the global network is configured and managed, how identity works at Cloudflare, remote access, and our use of Terraform and Kubernetes. A small number of the repositories contained encrypted secrets which were rotated immediately even though they were strongly encrypted themselves. We focused particularly on these 76 source code repositories to look for embedded secrets, (secrets stored in the code were rotated), vulnerabilities and ways in which an attacker could use them to mount a subsequent attack. This work was done as a priority by engineering teams across the company as part of “Code Red”. As a SaaS company, we’ve long believed that our source code itself is not as precious as the source code of software companies that distribute software to end users. In fact, we’ve open sourced a large amount of our source code and speak openly through our blog about algorithms and techniques we use. So our focus was not on someone having access to the source code, but whether that source code contained embedded secrets (such as a key or token) and vulnerabilities. November 23 - Discovery and threat actor access termination begins Our security team was alerted to the threat actor’s presence at 16:00 and deactivated the Smartsheet service account 35 minutes later. 48 minutes later the user account created by the threat actor was found and deactivated. Here’s the detailed timeline for the major actions taken to block the threat actor once the first alert was raised. 15:58 - The threat actor adds the Smartsheet service account to an administrator group. 16:00 - Automated alert about the change at 15:58 to our security team. 16:12 - Cloudflare SOC starts investigating the alert. 16:35 - Smartsheet service account deactivated by Cloudflare SOC. 17:23 - The threat actor-created Atlassian user account is found and deactivated. 17:43 - Internal Cloudflare incident declared. 21:31 - Firewall rules put in place to block the threat actor’s known IP addresses. November 24 - Sliver removed; all threat actor access terminated 10:44 - Last known threat actor activity. 11:59 - Sliver removed. Throughout this timeline, the threat actor tried to access a myriad of other systems at Cloudflare but failed because of our access controls, firewall rules, and use of hard security keys enforced using our own Zero Trust tools. To be clear, we saw no evidence whatsoever that the threat actor got access to our global network, data centers, SSL keys, customer databases or configuration information, Cloudflare Workers deployed by us or customers, AI models, network infrastructure, or any of our datastores like Workers KV, R2 or Quicksilver. Their access was limited to the Atlassian suite and the server on which our Atlassian runs. A large part of our “Code Red” effort was understanding what the threat actor got access to and what they tried to access. By looking at logging across systems we were able to track attempted access to our internal metrics, network configuration, build system, alerting systems, and release management system. Based on our review, none of their attempts to access these systems were successful. Independently, CrowdStrike performed an assessment of the scope and extent of the threat actor’s activity, which did not bring to light activities that we had missed and concluded that the last evidence of threat activity was on November 24 at 10:44. We are confident that between our investigation and CrowdStrike’s, we fully understand the threat actor’s actions and that they were limited to the systems on which we saw their activity. Conclusion This was a security incident involving a sophisticated actor, likely a nation-state, who operated in a thoughtful and methodical manner. The efforts we have taken to ensure that the ongoing impact of the incident was limited and that we are well-prepared to fend off any sophisticated attacks in the future. This required the efforts of a significant number of Cloudflare’s engineering staff, and, for over a month, this was the highest priority at Cloudflare. The entire Cloudflare team worked to ensure that our systems were secure, the threat actor’s access was understood, to remediate immediate priorities (such as mass credential rotation), and to build a plan of long-running work to improve our overall security based on areas for improvement discovered during this process. I am incredibly grateful to everyone at Cloudflare who responded quickly over the Thanksgiving holiday to conduct an initial analysis and lock out of the threat actor and all those who contributed to this effort. It would be impossible to name everyone involved, but their long hours and dedicated work made it possible to undertake an essential review and change of Cloudflare’s security while keeping our global network running and our customers’ service running. We are grateful to CrowdStrike for having been available immediately to conduct an independent assessment. Now that their final report is complete, we are confident in our internal analysis and remediation of the intrusion and are making this blog post available.

It also highlights the need for a faster move in the entire industry away from long-lived service account credentials (access tokens) and toward federated workload identity systems like OpenId connect in the software supply chain. These tokens too often provide elevated privileges in devops tools while bypassing MFA, and in many cases are rotated yearly.

Note: I’m not familiar with this incident and don’t know whether that is precisely what happened here or if OIdC would have prevented the attack.

Thank you for the blog post! reply nimbius 10 hours agoparentThen, the advertisement worked. - Insist that you have better integrity than your competitors - share a few operational investigations after your latest security event what cloudflare doesnt do is provide their SOC risk analysis as a PCI/DSS payment card processor. Cloudflare doesnt explain why they ignored/failed to identify the elevated accounts or how those accounts became compromised to begin with. They just explain remediation without accountability. They mention a third-party audit was conducted, but thats not because they care about you. Its because PCI/DSS mandates when an organization of any level experiences a data breach or cyber-attack that compromises payment card information, it needs to pass a yearly on-premise audit to ensure PCI compliance. if they didnt, major credit houses would stop processing their payments. reply tptacek 4 hours agorootparentNone of this would have had anything to do with PCI (nobody gives a shit about PCI; the worst shops in the world, the proprietors of the largest breaches, have had no trouble getting PCI certified and keeping certification after their breaches). At much smaller company sizes than this, insurance requires you to retain forensics/incident response firms. There's a variety of ways they could do that cheaply. They brought in the IR firm with the best reputation in the industry (now that Google owns Mandiant), at what I'm assuming are nosebleed rates, because they want to be perceived as taking this as seriously as they seem to be. It's a very good writeup, as these things go. Cloudflare is huge. An ancillary system of theirs got popped as sequelae to the Okta breach. They reimaged every machine in their fleet and burned all their secrets. People are going to find ways to snipe at them, because that's fun to do, but none of those people are likely to handle an incident like this better. I am not a Cloudflare customer (technically, I am a competitor). But my estimation of them went up (I won't say by how much) after reading this writeup. reply mardifoufs 4 hours agorootparentYeah at best PCI is somewhat hard to get at first, but after that it's basically only good, or less shady, corporations that bother keeping up compliance or make sure that they follow the guidelines at every step. Shady/troubled operators don't, and to an extent don't have to really be afraid of losing said certification unless they just go fully rogue. reply tptacek 3 hours agorootparentIt's not hard to get at first, either. It's the archetypical checklist audit. reply mardifoufs 2 hours agorootparentAh I think I'm just not used to those then, I hated the whole checklist busywork that we had to do even though we were barely related to the sales infra. But yeah, it was a bit like soc2 in that regard. Is there any certification that isn't just checklist \"auditing\"? That involves actual monitoring or something? Not sure if that's even possible reply yardstick 33 minutes agorootparentPCI DSS does require periodical review of lots of elements, and I believe daily log reviews (which let’s face it no one does outside of very big firms with dedicated security teams and fancy SIEM tools). reply yardstick 30 minutes agorootparentprev> nobody gives a shit about PCI; the worst shops in the world, the proprietors of the largest breaches, have had no trouble getting PCI certified and keeping certification after their breaches IMO it’s more a risk reward trade off. I know some companies are paying relative peanuts in non-compliance fines rather than spend money on some semblance of security which they may still not be compliant with and have to pay the fines anyway… reply eastdakota 9 hours agorootparentprevI was the one who made the call to bring in CrowdStrike. It had zero to do with PCI/DSS or any other compliance obligation. It was to 1) bring in a team with deep experience with a broad set of breaches; and 2) to make sure our team didn’t miss anything. The CrowdStrike team were first class and it was good to confirm they didn’t find anything significant our team hadn’t already. And, for the sake of clarity, no system breached touched customer credit card or traffic information. reply elitistphoenix 7 hours agorootparentWas the self hosted environment running a AV like the Crowdstrike agent? Or was it running different AV and that's why you chose to use Crowdstrike as someone different? I guess no need to specific names. I'm just using that as examples. reply tptacek 4 hours agorootparentWhat's an AV going to do about the fact that Okta got popped? reply JakeTheAndroid 9 hours agorootparentprevI am not sure where you're getting your information on requirements for PCI service providers. There isn't anything inside of PCI DSS that requires some sort of SOC report to be generated and distributed to customers. And Cloudflare does make their PCI AoC available to customers. They clearly defined the scope of impact, and demonstrated that none of this impacts systems in scope for PCI. There was no breach to change management inside of BitBucket, and none of the edge servers processing cardholder data were impacted. They will have plenty of artifacts to demonstrate that by bringing in an external firm. So I am really not clear why you're bringing up PCI at all here. They made it clear no cardholder data was impacted so your perspective on the required \"on-site\" audits is moot. Cloudflare operates two entirely different scopes for PCI; The first being as a Merchant where you the customer pays for the services. This is a very small scope of systems. The second is as a Service Provider that processes cards over the network. The network works such that it is not feasible to exfiltrate card data from the network. There are many reasons as to why this is, but they demonstrate year over year that this is not something that is reasonably possible. You can review their PCI AoC and get the details (albeit limited) to understand this better. Or you could get their SOC 2 Type 2 Report which will cover many aspects of the edge networks control environment with much better testing details. After reading that you can then come back to the blog and see that clearly no PCI scoped systems were impacted in a way that would require any on-prem audit to occur. And they are not a card network. They are a PCI Service Provider because cards transit over their network. They are not at risk of being unable to process payments or transactions for their Merchant scope even if there are issues with their Service Provider scope. Because, again, these are two separate PCI audits that are done, testing two different sets of systems and controls. And, as an aside, Cloudflare effectively always has on-prem PCI audits occur. Because the PCI QSA's need to physically visit Cloudflare datacenters to demonstrate not only the software side of compliance, but the datacenters deployed globally. reply autoexec 9 hours agorootparentprev> Cloudflare doesnt explain why they ignored/failed to identify the elevated accounts or how those accounts became compromised to begin with.

The MO screams China to me but I wouldn’t read anything into the name “code red” which would have been selected before they identified the specific threat actor anyway. reply eastdakota 2 hours agorootparentThe name has nothing to do with where we believe the attacker came from. We borrowed it from Google. At Google they have a procedure where, in an emergency, they can declare a Code Yellow or Code Red — depending on the severity. When it happens, it becomes the top engineering priority and whoever is leading it can pull any engineer off to work on the emergency. Those may not be the exact details of Google's system but it's the gist that we ran with. We'd had an outage of some of our services earlier in the Fall that prompted us to first borrow Google's idea. Since our logo is orange, we created \"Code Orange\" to mitigate the mistakes we'd made that led to that outage. Then this happened and we realized we needed something that was a higher level of emergency than Code Orange, so we created Code Red.

With two laptops you lose the ability to, say, send email directly to your task system. It’s really easy to say ‘don’t use your personal stuff at work’, but when work is some locked-down behemoth whose view of productivity software is ‘just use Office’, and you’re really trying to be better at your job, using your own tools can be the only solution.

Whatever HR system you have is going to be in a weird area of personal/employee overlap, as it'll need to have a password that your personal life has access to. (As tax documents, pay stubs, benefits stuff, etc. all impact the \"personal\" side of one's life. E.g., I need to store — in my personal archives — the years W-2.)

Someone hacks your company and during their exploitation window they're going to focus on... keylogging/MITMing random devs (likely far more paranoid/observant than the average computer user) so that they can get access to their personal machines via some artisan crafted attack to maybe make a fraudulent transfer from one person's bank account? In what world is that a low-hanging fruit to go after? reply sneak 8 hours agorootparentDevs in small companies often have a ton of access to systems and almost certainly aren’t heavily scrutinized about random novel binaries (being devs), so those are some of the first machines you’d target in an org.

That is, I'd expect there was a flag in a database somewhere saying that those service accounts were \"abandoned\" or \"cleaned up\" or some other non-active status, but that this assertion was incorrect. Then they probably rotated all the passwords for active accounts, but skipped the inactive ones. Speaking purely about PKI and certificate revocation, because that's the only similar context that I really know about, there is generally a difference between allowing certificates to expire, vs allowing them to be marked as \"no longer used\", vs fully revoking them: a certificate authority needs to do absolutely nothing in the first case, can choose to either do nothing or revoke in the second case, and must actively maintain and broadcast that revocation list for the third case. When someone says \"hey I accidentally clobbered that private key can I please have a new cert for this new key,\" you generally don't add the old cert to the revocation list because why would you. reply htrp 11 hours agoparentprevblameless post mortem most likely Great call out too > Note that this was in no way an error on the part of AWS, Moveworks or Smartsheet.

The 'because' makes it sound like that's a correct reason to leave it; that the only error was thinking they were unused. (i.e. that it's fine to leave them if unused, only a problem if they're used) i.e. instead of 'because they were mistakenly thought to be unused' you can say 'because they were mistakenly thought to be ok to leave as unused' (or something less awkward depending on exactly what the scenario was) and there's no more blame there?

Because if you take it exactly as it's written it's just too weird, I'm not a security expert with something to teach Cloudflare about err maybe don't leave secrets lying around that aren't actually needed for anything, that's not news to many people, and they surely have many actual security people for whom that would not even be a fizzbuzz interview question reviewing any kind of secret storage or revocation policy/procedure. And also the mentioned third-party audit. reply sevg 13 hours agoprev> Even though we believed, and later confirmed, the attacker had limited access, we undertook a comprehensive effort to rotate every production credential (more than 5,000 individual credentials), physically segment test and staging systems, performed forensic triages on 4,893 systems, reimaged and rebooted every machine in our global network including all the systems the threat actor accessed and all Atlassian products (Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket). > The threat actor also attempted to access a console server in our new, and not yet in production, data center in São Paulo. All attempts to gain access were unsuccessful. To ensure these systems are 100% secure, equipment in the Brazil data center was returned to the manufacturers.

But they did and I think that's worthy of kudos. reply barkingcat 12 hours agoparentI think they did have to do that far though. Getting in at the \"ground floor\" of a new datacentre build is pretty much the ultimate exploit. Imagine getting in at the centre of a new Meet-Me room (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-me_room) and having persistent access to key switches there. Cloudflare datacentres tend to be at the hub of insane amounts of data traffic. The fact that the attacker knew how valuable a \"pre-production\" data centre is means that cloudflare probably realized themselves that it would be a 100% game over if someone managed to get a foot hold there before the regular security systems are set up. It would be a company ending event if someone managed to install themselves inside a data centre while it was being built/brought up. Also remember, at the beginning of data centre builds, all switches/equipment have default / blank root passwords (admin/admin), and all switch/equipment firmware are old and full of exploits (you either go into each one and update the firmware one by one or hook them up to automation for fleet wide patching) Imagine that this exploit is taking place before automation services had a chance to patch all the firmware ... that's a \"return all devices to make sure the manufacturer ships us something new\" event. reply vasco 12 hours agorootparentWhat I think they meant is customers would keep paying them. And they are right, one just has to look at Okta, Solarwinds and other providers that have been owned, not done half of this and somehow are still in business. Everyone whistles to the side and pretends they shouldn't switch vendors, rotate all creds, cycle hardware, because it saves lots of work and this stuff falls under \"reasonable oopsie\" to the general public, when in fact there should be rules about what to do in the event of a breach that should be much stricter. So they do some partial actions to \"show work\" in case of lawsuits and keep going. The old engineers leave, new ones come in, and now you have systems who are potentially owned for years to come. It takes some honesty and good values by someone in the decision-making to go ahead with such a comprehensive plan.

Instead, even the \"self correcting\" mechanisms of the \"free market\" obviously didn't work out, as the free market doesn't value technical merit, it only values financial bullshittery.

Eventually I figured out that a non-executive former member of our engineering team was dating someone who worked as a fairly junior staffer at the FTC. On the employee’s personal time they mentioned being frustrated by how the disclosure took place to the person they were dating. I believe the employee’s frustration was because we and Project Zero had agreed on a disclosure timeline and then they unilaterally shortened it because an embargo with a reporter got messed up. There was never anything that Cloudflare or any executive raised with the FTC. And the FTC never took or even considered taking any action. The junior FTC staffer may have said something to Tavis or our employee may have said something about telling the staffer they were dating, but that was the extent of it. I understand Tavis’s perspective, and agree it was inappropriate of the former Cloudflare employee, but this was two people not in any position of leadership at either Cloudflare or the FTC talking very much out of school. reply nolok 1 hour agorootparent> we and Project Zero had agreed on a disclosure timeline and then they unilaterally shortened it because an embargo with a reporter got messed up This is not what happened at all. What happened is that after the initial discovery, the gzero team realized it was much worse than expected AND the cloudflare team who he synced with for the disclosure started ghosting him, and yet gzero still kept to the full timeline. If you working there and having done research can get it this wrong while it's super easy to find the event log in the open, it doesn't give a very good vibe about the attitude inside cloudflare regarding what happened and fair disclosure.

It contains an excellent postmortem, but severely downplays the risk to customers. They've left it too late to negotiate on the content of the notification.

I've dealt with definitely-not-nation-states before, and their pattern was to sign up for free/cheap CI services (CircleCI, Github Actions, that sort of thing) and launch their attacks from there. The VPS thing also sounds very very plausible to me, I figured there was a long tail, but until I was looking up every network that was attacking us, I really had no idea how deep the long tail goes.

Do you mean people are offering build / host services for small biz, and leaving their servers in such a state they can be owned and used as jump points for intrusion? Reason I ask is long-hosted small business websites are sometimes established with the intent to legitimize some future unrelated traffic. reply outworlder 10 hours agorootparent> Do you mean people are offering build / host services for small biz, and leaving their servers in such a state they can be owned and used as jump points for intrusion? Probably not what's happening. I've tried to build a cloud CI service a while ago. Per their nature, you _have to_ allow arbitrary commands to be run. And you also have to allow outbound connectivity. So you don't need to 'own' anything in order to be dangerous. They will not run with heightened privileges but that's of little help if the target is external. It is pretty difficult to reliably secure them against being used as a source of attacks as there's a lot you can do that will mimic legitimate traffic. Sure, you can block connections to things like IRC and you can throttle or flag some suspicious traffic. You can't really prevent HTTPS requests from going out. Heck, even SSH is pretty much required if you are allowing access to git. Generally speaking, a build service provider will try to harden their own services and sandbox anything that is run in order to protect themselves from being compromised. Most providers won't want to be known as a major source of malicious activity, so there's some effort there. AWS and other large providers have more resources and will easily ban your ass, but that doesn't matter if it happens after a successful attack was launched. reply jrockway 9 hours agorootparentThat's exactly right. CI providers are good anonymizers for unsophisticated attackers because they provide an extra layer of obfuscation. But if they were doing something significantly harmful, I'd obviously be talking to those providers and asking for their own logs as part of the investigation, and then it would clearly link back to the actual culprits. So that was one popular technique to use to circumvent IP bans after abusing our service. The whole hosting provider thing was another type of problems. I would always look at who owned the IPs that malicious sign-ups were coming from, and found a lot of ASNs owned by companies like \"hosturwebsite4u.or.uk\" and things like that. Those I assumed were just forgotten-about Linux boxes that the attackers used to anonymize through. Ultimately, this was all to get a \"free trial\" of our cloud service, which did let you run arbitrary code. We eventually had a fairly large number of ASNs that would get a message like \"contact sales for a free trial\" instead of just auto-approving. That was the end of this particular brand of scammers. (They did contact sales, though! Sales was not convinced they were a legitimate customer, so didn't give them a free trial. Very fun times ;) I should really write up the whole experience. I learned so much about crypto mining and 2020-era script-kiddie-ing in a very short period of time. My two favorite tangents were 1) I eventually wrote some automation to kill free trials that were using 100% CPU for more than 12 hours or something like that, and so they just made their miner run at 87% CPU. 2) They tried to LD_PRELOAD some code that prevented their process from showing up in the process table, but didn't realize that our tools were statically linked and that they were running in an unprivileged container, so the technique doubly didn't work. But, good old `ps` and `top` are linked against glibc, so they probably fooled a lot of people this way. They also left their code for the libc stub around, and I enjoyed reading it. reply CubsFan1060 12 hours agorootparentprevM247 is commonly used by VPN providers (https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivateInternetAccess/comments/8xwn...) reply lijok 12 hours agoparentprevWhich nation state has good enough employment protection laws that they can take weekends off while doing recon on a top value target? reply icepat 11 hours agorootparentYes, they must have been a member of the Norwegian Foreningen Svartehattehackere.

    "originLink": "https://www.damnsmalllinux.org/",
    "originBody": "Damn Small Linux 2024 Home Download DSL 2024 DSL Forums Support DSL Historic DSL The New DSL 2024 has been reborn as a compact Linux distribution tailored for low-spec x86 computers. It packs a lot of applications into a small package. All the applications are chosen for their functionality, small size, and low dependencies. DSL 2024 also has many text-based applications that make it handy to use in a term window or TTY. DSL 2024 currently only ships with two window managers: Fluxbox and JWM. Both are lightweight, fairly intuitive, and easy to use. DSL has three X-based web browsers: BadWolf (light, security-oriented, fully HTML5 compatible) Dillo (super-light GUI browser) Links2 (text and light GUI browser) For office applications, DSL has: AbiWord word processor Gnumeric spreadsheets Sylpheed email client Zathura PDF viewer For multimedia applications: MPV (video and audio) XMMS (a lightweight audio player) Other applications: mtPaint (graphics editing) gFTP (FTP, SFTP, and SCP) Leafpad (quick editing) zzzFM (file manager lifted straight out of antiX) There are three GUI-based games picked because they are fun and relatively light. DSL 2024 is also loaded up with a whole bunch of handy term-based applications: Ranger file manager VisiData a powerful CSV and spreadsheet tool FZF fuzzy finder Tmux terminal multiplexer Mutt email client Cmus music player CDW CD burner Htop, an interactive process viewer SurfRaw (with wrapper) to search from the term Weather App MPV video/audio player with wrapper Vim and Nano for editing Five term-based games Two term-compatible web browsers: W3M and Links2 ...and much more Why make a new DSL after all these years? Creating the original DSL, a versatile 50MB distribution, was a lot of fun and one of the things I am most proud of as a personal accomplishment. However, as a concept, it was in the right place at the right time, and the computer industry has changed a lot since then. While it would be possible to make a bootable Xwindows 50MB distribution today, it would be missing many drivers and have only a handful of very rudimentary applications. People would find such a distribution a fun toy or something to build upon, but it would not be usable for the average computer user out of the gate. Meanwhile, in 2024, nearly everyone has abandoned the sub-700MB size limit to run on computers old enough to not have a DVD and cannot boot off of a USB drive. This is completely understandable because applications, the kernel, and drivers have all mushroomed in their space requirements. Hats off to Puppy Linux for staying one of the few that still offer a full desktop environment in a small size. The new goal of DSL is to pack as much usable desktop distribution into an image small enough to fit on a single CD, or a hard limit of 700MB. This project is meant to service older computers and have them continue to be useful far into the future. Such a notion sits well with my values. I think of this project as my way of keeping otherwise usable hardware out of landfills. As with most things in the GNU/Linux community, this project continues to stand on the shoulders of giants. I am just one guy without a CS degree, so for now, this project is based on antiX 23 i386. AntiX is a fantastic distribution that I think shares much of the same spirit as the original DSL project. AntiX shares pedigree with MEPIS and also leans heavily on the geniuses at Debian. So, this project stands on the shoulders of giants. In other words, DSL 2024 is a humble little project! Though it may seem comparably ridiculous that 700MB is small in 2024 when DSL was 50MB in 2002, I’ve done a lot of hunting to find small footprint applications, and I had to do some tricks to get a workable desktop into the 700MB limit. To get the size down, the ISO only has en_US, en_BG, en_CA, and en_AU locales enabled, and I had to strip the source codes, many man pages, and documentation out. I do provide a download script that will restore all the missing files, and so far, it seems to be working well. Unlike the original DSL, this version has apt fully enabled. So if there is anything you feel is missing, it is very simple to get it installed. I also made an effort to leave as much of the antiX goodness enabled as possible. However, it must be said that DSL is a derivative work but also a reductive work. Some things from antiX may be broken or missing. If you find a bug, it is likely my fault. Thank you section: Thank you Debian and antiX for doing all the heavy lifting. Thank you for mirroring the DSL downloads all these years. Thank you GPedde at DeviantArt for the beautiful wallpaper. Finally, thank you to the users of DSL for your feedback and support.",

My debian chroot is mostly to run a 10 year old printer driver from Epson that's compiled against glibc, but doing a little trickery with a small C program works just fine with CUPS still running in alpine (print filters operate on stdin and stdout, so you can launch them in a chroot by themselves no problem). reply vouaobrasil 15 hours agorootparentprevI've used Alpine Linux also but I found it very unintuitive for a general Linux distro (I used to like configuring things like Alpine but I've lost the spark for it and now I just want something light that works.

When you aim for anything that resembles modern “desktop computing” (maybe with at least some “web browsing”), you are limited to decent hardware configurations from last 15 years or so. Yes, you can show to your grand-grand-grandkids how it really was back in the days once, but you are not going to study the splash screens while programs initialize, or wait for each image to appear for a couple of seconds when skimming trough an archive, or watch page load progress bars move in the browser. But with that decent hardware, you almost always can install bog standard modern Debian with an ascetic desktop, and have much less support issues than with specialized system. It'll be the same Linux anyway.

One of the first \"approachable\" Linux distributions circa 1993 was the Soft Landing Systems (SLS) 2-floppy disk set. One held the bootloader and kernel, the other the root filesystem. The kernel disk was swapped out during the boot process, so after that you only needed to leave the root system floppy in. Then, you could use a not uncommon second floppy drive for removable data disks. The SLS system was text console only, but I think (?) had an editor and gcc.

From my experience it works for a proof of concept but slows you down a lot after that. reply danbmil99 11 hours agorootparent(Not with the company) My observation is that ROS 2 is the go-to solution for new projects. Established co's have sunk cost in proprietary stacks and tend to spread the \"ROS is slow and bulky\" meme, but the reality is a sane, seasoned stack that has thousands of contributors offers a time-to-market advantage that is worth more than saving a bit on hardware. Most of the really time-critical code (actuator firmware, video capture etc) is done by C/C++ libraries anyway. It's parallel to the general situation where Python is at the top of the stack in spite of being dog-ass slow. reply carlmr 1 hour agorootparentROS2 is also not ROS.

We're a very tech and research focused org, and are quite different from a lot of other players in the market (more like a tech-driven research institute than a traditional trading firm -- see https://quadrature.ai for the details). We're looking for a skilled engineer to optimise the use of GPUs for our AI workloads, for both our model training and inference environments. This is a great opportunity to work with a group of world-class researchers and developers, building out large-scale algorithmic trading systems using cutting-edge tech (advanced ML, thousands of GPUs, multiple global research data centres and trading co-location sites, petabytes of storage, innovation-lab R&D work with strategic partners). It'll be based out of either London or New York. Responsibilities: - Leading performance optimisation effort for mission-critical end-to-end AI workloads (e.g. profiling and tuning GPU programs, writing custom CUDA kernels, speeding up pre- and post-processing). - Rewriting core parts of our model architectures for maximum performance. - Building a runtime environment that maximises the model capacity and speed.

We’ve built an end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics. Healthcare in the United States runs on private and public insurance billing, but providers spend huge amounts of time on faxes, phone calls, and error-prone legacy systems to get paid. That’s not why they got into care. What’s worse, these systems aren’t hugely successful—clinics regularly get back 80% what they know the insurance company should pay. Those missing dollars could be used to hire more care providers to help more kids, but instead line insurance companies’ pockets. We’re changing that. At Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. It starts with ingesting from a clinic’s EHR, then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections.) Our typical paid rate is above 95%. We are a team of 25 with strong product market fit—we’ve had to push out onboardings because engineering can’t build quickly enough. You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get doctors and clinicians back to work helping kids.

Over the last 7 years I’ve been at YC, our software team has grown considerably both in engineers and in products. We need to invest more in our infrastructure so we can keep shipping our products quickly. The main thing you’ll need in this job is curiosity; I work at every layer of a very large stack. One day you might dig into AWS apis, another it’s a 3rd party Ruby gem or our git history. Or maybe you get paged that all the SSDs for Hacker News (primary and standby!) died on the same day :) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028511. The first few months will be heavier on infrastructure work but in the future the job will hopefully be equal parts developer experience, infrastructure work, and product engineering that impacts all of our products (think SSO, sending email, security, etc). The main products we support are all Ruby on Rails apps running in AWS (mostly in ECS); ideally you’ve already worked on apps like that. You have at least 5 years of experience. Part of that was shipping code to customers but you’ve also got cloud experience (we try to mostly use Terraform). You’re probably the person people turn to when there’s a fire to put out. YC has excellent compensation and benefits (see more in the formal job description: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/y-combinator/jobs/0Ewh...). The team and the work life balance are great. About half of us are former founders and many of us are parents.

As such, many of us here have a huge passion for anime, gaming, or Japanese pop culture in general. It’s not unusual to see an anime figure sitting on someone’s desk, the latest League of Legends tournament streaming on our lounge television, or hear someone discussing their past adventures on Final Fantasy XI. However, our passion doesn’t stop there – we’re a team of self-starters who are driven by results. As Solaris Japan continued its success and our customer base grew, we sought solutions to serve our customers, and added Shopify to our toolkit. We then built a number of custom applications for ourself and automated many of our processes, and realized we could offer these solutions to other e-commerce platforms as well. Thus, Lunaris was born, and with it additional e-commerce solutions like easyPoints, easyRates, and more. We are a team of international engineers, and are actively seeking a few more engineers to join our growing team: - Senior/Lead Engineer - https://teamlunaris.com/eng/jobs/senior-lead-developer - Fullstack Engineer - https://teamlunaris.com/eng/jobs/full-stack-developer Tech stack: Elixir, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, React (mostly JS) If Lunaris sounds like a good fit for you, and you're ready for a new experience in Japan (or already living here), please check out the above positions and send in your application.

    "title": "Juno: A YouTube Client for Apple Vision Pro with Enhanced Features",
    "originLink": "https://christianselig.com/2024/02/introducing-juno/",
    "originBody": "Introducing Juno for Apple Vision Pro February 1, 2024 YouTube is probably one of the parts of the internet I consume the most, so I was more than a little sad when YouTube announced that they don’t have plans to build a visionOS app, and disabled the option to load the iPad app. This leaves you with Safari, and the website is okay, but definitely doesn’t feel like a visionOS app. Couple that with visionOS not having the option to add websites to your Home Screen, and YouTube isn’t that convenient on visionOS by default. Then I remembered for years my old app, Apollo, played back YouTube videos submitted to Reddit pretty well, and I developed a pretty good understanding of how YouTube worked. That sparked the idea to reuse some of Apollo’s code there and build a little YouTube client of my own for visionOS, and after a mad week of coding “Juno for YouTube” is born. How does it work… technically? YouTube has a few different APIs. They have a “Data API” for fetching information (thumbnail, duration, etc.) for a video, that requires an API key, auditing, and you can only call so many times a day. This API doesn’t actually get you the video to play or anything, it’s purely for metadata, and for uploading. They have private/internal APIs that they get grumpy at you for using because you can circumvent ads. The goal with this app was to not make Google grumpy. Lastly, they have an embed API that’s pretty powerful, and is what I used in Apollo and now Juno. There’s no API keys, or limits to how many times a day you can call it, as it literally just loads the video in a webview, and provides JavaScript methods to interact with the video, such as pause, play, speed up, etc. It’s really nice, you can play YouTube videos back, and YouTube still gets to show ads (if the user doesn’t have YouTube Premium) and whatnot so no one is grumpy. This means you can build a fully native visionOS UI that then using JavaScript interacts with the underlying YouTube player, so you get the best of both worlds. Juno even supports detecting aspect ratios of the videos and will resize the window automatically, so ultra-wide 21:9 movie trailers are respected, as are nostalgic 4:3 uploads. The one downside is that occasionally you’ll get a creator who disabled playback for YouTube embeds. This is rare, especially with videos made in the last few years, but for those Juno will auto-detect that and just load up the normal video website page rather than the fancy player. What about the browsing itself? At its core, Juno uses the YouTube website itself. No, not scraped. It presents the website as you would load it, but similar to how browser extensions work, it tweaks the theming of the site through CSS and JavaScript. That results in: Tweaking backgrounds so the beautiful glassy look of visionOS shows through. As the great Serenity Caldwell once said, “Opaque windows can feel heavy and constricting, especially at large sizes. Whenever possible, prefer the glass material (which pulls light from people’s surroundings).” Increasing contrast so items are properly visible Making buttons like the button to view your subscriptions native UI, and then loading the relevant portions of the website accordingly You get your full recommendations, subscriptions and whatnot, just as you would on the normal YouTube site or app It was a lot of work tweaking the CSS to get the YouTube website to something that felt comfortable and at home on visionOS, but I’m really happy with how it turned out. Does it feel like a perfectly native visionOS app? Well no, but it’s a heck of a lot nicer than the website, and to be fair Google apps normally do their own thing rather than use iOS system UI, so not sure we’ll ever fully see that. :) Does it block ads? It doesn’t, I don’t think Google would like that, but if you have YouTube Premium you won’t see ads, just like the website. Honestly, YouTube Premium is like one of the most essential subscriptions for me, it’s so handy to never worry about ads and it’s pretty cool in that it also supports the creators substantially more than if you watched ads. So I dunno, if you can afford an expensive Apple Vision Pro, I’d really consider treating yourself to YouTube Premium! Features Beautiful translucent visionOS interface Automatic aspect ratio detection Speed up or slow down video Native controls for video playback Pinch-drag anywhere to scrub through video (an Apollo classic) Double-pinch either side of the video to jump forward or back 10 seconds in time Quick launch YouTube from Home Screen Dim your surroundings to focus on the video View your recommendations, subscriptions, playlists, etc. Resizable (while maintaining correct aspect ratio) Automatic quality selection, should scale up or down based on the size of your window all the way to 4K Features I’m looking into This was a bit of a mad dash to get finished in time for the Apple Vision Pro launch, so I’m hoping to add some more things with time. Ability to see comments (I mean, they’re useful sometimes…) Maybe select quality directly if interest is there Caption controls (couldn’t quite get this working in time for 1.0) More immersive environments Multiview for multiple videos If there’s more you’d like to see, let me know! Can I give feedback? Yes please, I’d love that! I’ve only been able to develop this in the simulator, which obviously has its limitations, so once I get my hands on a device this Friday I’ll probably have a lot of thoughts on things I want to improve as well. That also means there will probably be some bugs here and there too. But I’d love to hear your experience and feedback with the app, so feel free to reach out to me on Mastodon or Twitter! Check it out! It’s available on the App Store for $5! A fun URL to find it is juno.vision No subscriptions or in-app purchases, just a one-time paid up front app like it’s 2008. I considered making it free, or like a buck, but it’s a premium platform, and I think paying a few bucks for a good app is something we should encourage if we want more developers building for this platform. I think the result is a really comfy way to browse YouTube on visionOS, and having a way to quickly launch YouTube right from your Home Screen is super convenient. I’m looking forward to doing more with it, and cheers to Matthew Skiles for designing the icon! He actually made some beautiful alternate icons as well, but those apparently aren’t supported in visionOS 1.0. Download it today!",

Compare to the official YT client for iPad, for example, which bizarrely uses the same tiny Material touch targets as on phones. reply thrdbndndn 3 hours agoparent> which bizarrely uses the same tiny Material touch targets as on phones I personally think iPad YouTube app's touch is not too bad; but in general (not limited to YouTube), I think the UI design of web video players are all too fixated on the existing design. For example, when not in fullscreen mode, I don't see why all the controls need to be confined to the video frame and disappear when not hovering. While this design choice has its benefits, it also presents significant drawbacks: it obscures the actual content when you're interacting with the controls (a problem that's particularly acute on smaller screens), and performing quick, repetitive actions becomes difficult because the controls aren't visible until you hover over them, among other issues. This approach to web video player UI has been a pet peeve of mine for some time. reply eurekin 2 hours agorootparentAnother one with a same pet peeve here. It's especially \"interesting\", when the slider allows to navigate to the exact frame you want (that happens very rarely) and the information you want to see is in the subtitles burned into the video - the ones not shifting with UI controls. The UI obscures that and I have to make tens of attempts with increased sloppiness due to frustration to take it all in. Most often it's something I keep mishearing and need subtitles to actually understand what's being talked about. For example, I keep hearing \"Hello awful person\" in Anton Petrov's videos. https://youtu.be/PyRf7B1Ji4A?si=bIA7S8qB_WLdLgVs&t=45 reply edflsafoiewq 1 hour agorootparentprevIt used to be like that. https://www.versionmuseum.com/images/websites/youtube-websit... reply bisRepetita 1 hour agorootparentprev> it obscures the actual content when you're interacting with the controls (a problem that's particularly acute on smaller screens) What's the right trade-off here in your mind then? Leave the controls always-on/visible? On a small screen, it takes a lot of real estate (except in portrait mode), and small UI controls are a pain to use so you need to make them big enough. I struggle with this, I really don't know what is the right trade-off here. reply thrdbndndn 53 minutes agorootparent> except in portrait mode Portrait mode is exactly what I have in my mind. You have plenty of places on the bottom of the video canvas. For YouTube at least, you only has full-screen mode when in landscape anyway. reply rakoo 1 hour agorootparentprev> On a small screen, it takes a lot of real estate That's why the full-screen mode exists reply andrepd 2 hours agorootparentprevYou just need to accept that \"user interface design\" has stopped being a thing in everything but niche/pro applications for at least the past 10 years. You have \"follow the trend\", yes, or \"design it so it looks good on screenshots\", but not \"user interface design\". Accept it and you will be less frustrated. reply brookst 1 hour agorootparentAcceptance can be wise, but this is not a 10 year old problem. Look at your oven; unless you are very lucky (or picky, if you bought it yourself), it has terrible UX. Most people don’t care enough about UX to make purchasing decisions based on it. Therefore, most companies don’t prioritize it. Therefore, most product designers have no incentive to care about UX. This has always been true. reply wolpoli 1 hour agorootparentprevIn other words, the designers are just engaging in screenshot-centric design. reply thrdbndndn 52 minutes agorootparentIt would be helpful if you you can hide the UI when pausing for screenshot, then! reply yard2010 51 minutes agoparentprevIt's on purpose though, YouTube app is designed to maximize time spent on app, not UX reply MengerSponge 3 hours agoparentprevFYI, Vinegar is well worth a couple of bucks. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vinegar-tube-cleaner/id1591303... Install it, and delete the janky \"native\" app. Now Youtube is a webpage that does everything it does on a regular browser. PiP? Audio with the screen locked or in the background? Yes and yes. reply rjzzleep 3 hours agorootparentI've been using vinegar forever(Orion browser supports PiP without extension by the way) But it's bizarre to me how bad the PiP experience on iOS is. When you press play on your bluetooth headset it will pause the video you're playing instead play whatever was on your Music app. If you lock your screen, it will stop playing the youtube video and then you have press play again on the lock screen to resume. Contrast that to either third party youtube clients on Android or (Re)vanced, and it's not even close. And it seems every app has its own PiP issues. Every iOS I'm secretly hoping that Apple will address this issue, but it never happens ... reply isametry 3 hours agorootparentprevDoes it still block ads? I happily used Vinegar before, but it lost that functionality when YouTube’s crusade against ad blockers began (I don’t recall if it just let the ads through, or if it triggered the “Ad Blocker Detected” pop-up). With that, YouTube single-handedly forced me to move browsers on all my devices – from Safari to Orion, where I get to use uBlock Origin. uBlock seems to have stayed a step ahead of YT since. reply moi2388 3 hours agorootparentSet your vpn to India and buy YouTube premium there for like 1 dollar a month.

Google obviously doesn't want a smooth youtube experience on vision pro. reply spiderice 4 hours agorootparentWhy is that? Obviously they don’t want a third party app to be that experience, but they make native apps for everything else. Also, Christian can’t help himself but attach his apps to large companies that can cut him off overnight. Haha. reply nindalf 1 hour agorootparentShort answer - usually individual app developers, even of Google’s size, need the platform (iOS) more than the platform needs them. This means Apple has historically driven hard bargains with even the most popular apps. Now Apple is launching a new platform (visionOS) the 3 most popular in their categories - YouTube, Netflix and Spotify decided that visionOS needs them more than they need visionOS. For now. It’s possible they might use this leverage to negotiate better terms on iOS. For example, Netflix would like to offer in app subscriptions and to keep more the revenue without sharing with Apple. If Apple sells millions of visionOS devices then that gives Apple more leverage and these 3 might come crawling back.

Christian is a punk rock indie product hacker who takes his skills all the way to the bank. He keeps making great products, and doing quite well. What have we all done? At worst it's me, surviving. Largely at best, it's group thinkers chasing the VC valuation goes up scheme, until you find the final bag holder. Meanwhile, Christian said no to Apple, said no Reddit, and lives on his own terms as a rockstar.[0] I have major respect for him and his ways.

It's just an iframe. It's 1998 tech. reply andsoitis 3 hours agorootparentIn that case, isn’t it a race to the bottom with just someone else doing something similar? What makes this special? reply manquer 28 minutes agorootparentGood product is first about understanding the user and the problem statement very well foremost. Most product moats are just that, everything else is a function of that. Designing a great UX to interact with the system is the other key ingredient, that requires step 1 and also a great deal of creativity. Anyone can copy same the features after someone as good as Christian Selig has made an app, Few can do similar or better starting on their own, especially indie developers, so he can always be ahead if he wants to. Christian also chooses apps to work which are third party platform controlled for a reason I think. He can operate in markets like this as a extremely talented indie developer that very few competent teams with capital funding would attempt with platform risk. Beeper is the most recent example on Apple, Christian himself got burned in Reddit[1][2]. Finally he prices at a point so low that people are just paying for the brand - for a well designed reliable software which won't crash on them. He likely will not lose all that much sales if a lower priced/free product comes out Safari browser based Youtube.com is already there . --- [1] He can afford to in the sense his monthly cash burn is very low compared to any normal company and he doesn't have 100's of employees to worry about if he gets kicked out. [2] Even then he has carefully choose an API that Google will have a hard time just blocking him ( and not every other use of embedded playback), and he also is careful not to use APIs to render the UI he has just skinned the main website with light CSS. reply RockRobotRock 14 minutes agorootparentprevIt's the first one so it's currently the best one.

I don’t know. It’s not exactly revolutionary is it reply p-e-w 3 hours agorootparentprevThe iframe embed API is API access, and YouTube can remove, paywall, or rate limit it any time they want. How old the underlying technology is is completely irrelevant to that. reply shafyy 5 minutes agorootparentYouTube disabling embedding would be fucking insane. reply adesanmi 44 minutes agorootparentprevUnlike Reddit, Apollo was stopping users from seeing ads and Reddit gaining ad revenue from them, so they went to charge the Reddit app devs for this loss in revenue. The YouTube embed API supports ads, and works perfectly with Premium so Google are not losing any potential revenue with this app existing. Sounds like Christian learned his lesson with his experience with Reddit: \"don't get in the way of the company's ad revenue\". Your statement still stands though, you are ultimately correct. reply po 3 hours agorootparentprevHe's not selling it as a subscription so there's very little downside. Some people will send him $5 and if/when YouTube cuts it off (can they really?) he doesn't really owe anyone anything. reply Hamuko 3 hours agorootparent>if/when YouTube cuts it off (can they really?) It's called \"Juno for YouTube\" so they could definitely send a cease and desist for the YouTube trademark. reply withinboredom 3 hours agorootparentIt uses the magic word: “for” They’ll probably still send a C&D but it will be defensible. reply yard2010 36 minutes agorootparentBut.. aren't most of the c&d defensible? It's like a mafia scare tactic to dominate something - sometimes just the \"or else\" destroys ppl lives reply unobatbayar 2 hours agorootparentprevIt seems that he found a (momentary?) gap in the Vision Pro app market and promptly seized the opportunity. reply wahnfrieden 3 hours agorootparentprevNah this approach is solid. It’s web views not api. It’s basically a web browser. I imagine other iOS browsers like brave will come to vision and have YouTube etc video playback and demonstrate it’s tolerated even with Adblock probably. But maybe easier to get by if more clearly a multipurpose web browser. reply shiroiuma 4 hours agorootparentprevYou don't need third-party APIs to make a YouTube viewer. There's a bunch of 3rd-party YouTube viewers like SmartTube, ReVanced, etc. that bypass ads and don't use the official API, plus of course the yt-dlp downloader. I'd say the lesson here is NOT to rely on official APIs. However, upon reading this blog post, it does seem he's using the official API so I guess he thinks he'll be fine as long as he doesn't block ads. Time will tell. reply yard2010 41 minutes agorootparentI wanted my bot to \"see\" a youtube video and sum it up - so me being the naïve 1998 kid me, spent like 2 hours setting up the API access to get the transcript of a video only to realize I can use this API only on videos I uploaded which is a complete bullshit because as soon as that happened I ditched it and wrote a script using puppeteer scraping the the transcript of ANY video, which ironically took less time than setting up the API. So yeah I learned my lesson I should not resort to piracy, but start with it reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparentprev> However, upon reading this blog post, it does seem he's using the official API so I guess he thinks he'll be fine as long as he doesn't block ads. The idea of strapping something to my face that's going to project ads into my eyeballs that I cannot look away from--well, let's say it's pretty clear technology took a wrong term some time ago. Apple should do the right thing and enforce a strong \"no ads\" policy for this product.

Would love to see a Juno port at some point if it includes this too! Edit: According to the Internet, apparently there is actually a way to resize the MR windows (their \"switch view\" button lets you resize them); I'm apparently just blind.

When it first came out I was like there is no way I would ever pay for such service. Being an early YouTube user, pre Google buyout, I still was in love with the platform that gave me content from real people. Fast forward to 2020 the US election cycle broke me. I could not stand the amount of political ads that were being shoved down my throat. My kids were perma home due to COVID and we were running out of things to watch. I finally caved and got YouTube Premium. I told myself OK after this shit show of an election cycle ends I will cancel and yet here I am still paying for it. It is that good. Yes I realize that I am part of the problem. I just got my first Amazon Prime ad tonight trying to catch up on the train wreck Wheel of Time show they are putting out... and I am going to upgrade to not have them because I simply DGAF about whatever bullshit that they are filling advertisement slots with. $2.99 a month is worth it.

I'd wager you don't. Also, do you really think that any platform as big as YouTube can remain free forever? I will pay for things that bring value to my life. YouTube Premium brings value almost every day.

This might not work for everyone, but I get a much better UX with these tools. Not seeing ads is one benefit, but it's also about not being a participant in training algorithms that have a, mostly negative, psychological impact. > I am pretty sure you pay for things that bring value or make thing easier for you in life Of course.

I understand that you can block YouTube ads and have the techicnal means to block them at the DNS level. I also understand I can run different frontends for YouTube, but it is flat out easier and faster for me personally to not do that and to pay $22.99 a month for my entire family to enjoy ad free content. Time is money. Also, I play a decent amount of video games and I send money monthly to content creators on said games I play.

I'm just saying that, as a consumer, I don't want Google's business. If someone is selling apples in exchange for punching me in the face (and actually watching me and doing that while I eat, for a more accurate analogy :), then I wouldn't like going to their store. I would prefer going to the farmers' market and buying directly from the farmer by paying for it with cash. Farm-to-table type of transaction. Would this make the farmer as rich as selling their apples to the face-punching store? Probably not. They would probably have to work harder for less money, because they would have to manage more of their business themselves, and their products wouldn't reach as many people. There would probably be less apple farmers overall as well. But would it be a more consumer-friendly business that is actually incentivized to put care in their product? Absolutely. It's not my fault that there aren't more farmers' market equivalents on the web. I'll use them if/when they exist, but in the meantime I'll have to resort to acquiring my apples in alternative ways. reply framapotari 26 minutes agorootparentIn your analogy when you say buying directly from the farmer by paying with cash, what does that translate to in the real world?

    "title": "Developing a Reliable ML-KEM-768 Implementation for Secure Key Exchange in Go Ecosystem",
    "originLink": "https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/mlkem768/",
    "originBody": "30 Jan 2024 Post-quantum Cryptography for the Go Ecosystem filippo.io/mlkem768 is a pure-Go implementation of ML-KEM-768 optimized for correctness and readability. ML-KEM (formerly known as Kyber, renamed because we can’t have nice things) is a post-quantum key exchange mechanism in the process of being standardized by NIST and adopted by most of the industry. The package amounts to ~500 lines of code, plus 200 lines of comments, and 650 lines of tests. It has no dependencies except for golang.org/x/crypto/sha3. It’s meant for upstreaming into the Go standard library (initially as an internal-only package used in an opt-in crypto/tls experiment) and was designed to provide high security assurance through ease of review, simplicity, and thorough testing. I livecoded part of its development on Twitch, and you can watch the replay on YouTube. Unlike most other implementations, this code was not ported from the reference pq-crystals library, but written from scratch not having ever closely read other codebases. This was an intentional exercise in spec validation, to show it is possible to produce an interoperable implementation from the specification alone. The FIPS 203 document turned out to be an excellent implementation guide, with detailed pseudo-code, exhaustive definitions, and consistent type information. (This is something I would like to ask of any large specification document: define your types and use them and denote them!) To make the code both easier to review and better as a learning resource, function and variable names, and even operation ordering, are carefully picked to mirror the FIPS specification. The specification actually requires fairly limited math background, but to facilitate the work of implementers, I wrote up Enough Polynomials and Linear Algebra to Implement Kyber. Beyond that, the only parts left as an exercise to the reader were implementing arithmetic modulo the prime 3329; concretely implementing the compress and decompress functions mapping values [0, 3329) to and from [0, 2ᵈ); and ensuring constant time operations. Modulo arithmetic was reasonably easy, as we all collectively learned a lot about finite field arithmetic through years of RSA and elliptic curve implementations. The small prime actually makes the task feel unnaturally simple. Compression and decompression turned out to be the most difficult part of the project. The specification defines them in abstract terms as fractions and rounding rules—“just” compute (2ᵈ/q)·x or (q/2ᵈ)·y and round to the closest integer—but in practice we need to implement them with constant time arithmetic and bitwise operations! In my public comments I pointed out that having each implementation figure out a strategy is risky and redundant. I was more correct than I thought: it turned out that the reference implementation and ~every implementation ported from it used a division which depending on compiler optimizations and platform might result in a DIV instruction, which is variable-time even when the divisor is fixed. This package was unaffected, because it used Barrett reduction from the start, like BoringSSL. You can read the rest of my formal public comments on the pqc-forum mailing list. Readability was a major goal of the implementation, and it was pursued even especially for complex functions like compression and decompression. A readable implementation has two purposes: first, it allows effective review, both during the code review process and later by interested researchers, improving security; second, it serves as an educational resource for the next generation of maintainers and cryptography engineers (or curious nerds). Reading the Go cryptography standard library is how I got started on the path that led me here, so it is especially important to me to preserve and improve it as a learning resource. It’s obviously subjective, but I believe this to be the most understandable public ML-KEM/Kyber implementation. Compare for example our compression/decompression functions with the reference implementation. Sometimes improving readability and reviewability means making code longer and less reusable: for example for ML-KEM-768 we need to serialize 1-, 4-, 10-, and 12-bit integers in a packed format. A universal 1-to-12 bit encoder and decoder is a pretty gnarly piece of code to write correctly, but each of those four sizes are actually pretty easy to write a dedicated encoder/decoder for.[1] This is why we have ringCompressAndEncode1/4/10 etc. instead of a single universal function. This also made it easy to work some special required checks into the 12-bit decoder. This, by the way, was only possible because we targeted ML-KEM-768 specifically, or we’d have had to implement 5- and 11-bit encodings, as well. ML-KEM is specified at three security levels (-512, -768, and -1024). However, the Kyber team recommends using -768 over -512 for a more conservative security margin against novel cryptanalysis, while -1024 exists only for the same reasons 256-bit security levels exist: compliance and blind strength matching. Most protocols being tested or standardized coalesced around ML-KEM-768, so targeting only that improves not only readability, but also security (because there are fewer moving parts), and performance (because we can optimize allocation sizes, iteration counts, and encoding algorithms) at little to no cost. After readability, testing is the main component in this package’s high security assurance strategy. Besides checking that key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation round-trip correctly, and maintaining a test coverage of 95%+, we ensure interoperability with test vectors obtained from NIST and other implementations; exhaustively test every input combination for base field arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication modulo 3329) against expected values computed trivially with variable-time operations; exhaustively test compression and decompression against math/big.Rat (contributed by David Buchanan); test that pre-computed constants match their definition; check that incorrect lengths (both long and short) cause the appropriate error for every input of every function; run an extensive set of reusable test vectors we developed (see below); run test vectors provided by Sophie Schmieg which will be eventually included in Wycheproof. Our test vectors are designed to be reusable by other implementations, and are published as part of the CCTV project along with detailed intermediate values for testing and debugging each intermediate step and partial algorithm, which we used during development. There are different sets of tests vectors, each designed to reach different edge cases. Negative test vectors provide invalid encapsulation keys, where the coefficients are higher than 3329. These were often requested, since all the test vectors from the Kyber and NIST teams are for regular, correct inputs. These vectors individually test every value from 3329 to 2¹²-1 and every coefficient location, sharing the remaining coefficients so they compress from 1–3 MiB down to 12–28 KiB. “Unlucky” vectors require an unusually large number of XOF reads. Kyber samples a matrix from a portion of public keys[2] with rejection sampling: it gets a random value between 0 and 2 ¹²-1 and checks if it’s less than 3329, if not, it tries again. The amount of bytes needed to sample a matrix depends on how lucky you get with the sampling, and that’s a random function of the public key component. These vectors are regular public keys and require reading more than 575 bytes from the SHAKE-128 XOF in SampleNTT, which would ordinarily happen with probability 2⁻³⁸. Sophie’s vectors were bruteforced further, and require up to 591 bytes. At this point I would like to thank our detection and response team for not killing my job(s) hashing vast amounts of random seeds and looking for zeroes in the output. — Sophie Schmieg Special vectors fail if strcmp is used in ML-KEM.Decaps. In ML-KEM.Decaps the ciphertext is compared with the output of K-PKE.Encrypt for implicit rejection. If an implementation were to use strcmp() for that comparison it would fail to reject some ciphertexts if a zero byte terminates the comparison early. This one I hope is going to sit as a silent trap for years—who would use strcmp() in cryptographic code—and then ruthlessly kill a vulnerability, because of course someone will. Accumulated vectors (derived from the reference pq-crystals implementation) allow testing randomly reachable edge cases without checking in large amounts of data. The reference implementation of Kyber includes a test_vectors.c program that generates 300MB of random vectors. I had no intention of checking in the output or compiling C, but since they are just randomly generated vectors, we can regenerate them in our tests from the deterministic RNG (SHAKE-128 with an empty input) and check they hash to an expected value. We can even take it further, and produce hashes for a million random tests, beyond the 10k they generate. I am happy to report that none of the tests, many introduced after completion of the implementation, identified any issues in filippo.io/mlkem768. There is at least one reported instance of the negative vectors identifying a defect in a major implementation, though. Performance is not a primary goal (neither of this package nor of the Go cryptography packages) but the package needs to be fast enough to be useful. Thankfully, ML-KEM is pretty fast, to the point that this simple implementation is competitive with our assembly-optimized P-256 and X25519 implementations. To compare apples to apples, note that we need to compare the whole operation that each side needs to perform for key establishment: for ECDH, two scalar multiplications (one of them by the fixed base point); for KEMs, key generation and decapsulation on one side, and encapsulation on the other. ECDH is symmetrical, ML-KEM key establishment is not. The ECDH benchmarks below already include the two scalar multiplications, while the mlkem768 benchmarks are split as key generation and decapsulation under “Alice” and encapsulation under “Bob”. Since decapsulation includes a full encryption (to check the resulting ciphertext matches the input), Alice takes a lot longer than Bob: the latter does an encryption, while the former does an encryption, a decryption, and a key generation. All in all, “Bob” is as fast as our X25519 or P-256, while “Alice” takes less than twice. Compared to some of the fastest ML-KEM implementations out there (BoringSSL and libcrux), this package takes approximately double the time. For such a simple and unoptimized implementation, this is more than satisfactory. goos: darwin goarch: arm64 cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7400 CPU @ 3.00GHz pkg: crypto/ecdh │ sec/op │ ECDH/P256-8 49.43µ ± 0% ECDH/X25519-8 77.46µ ± 0% pkg: filippo.io/mlkem768 │ sec/op │ RoundTrip/Alice-8 109.4µ ± 0% RoundTrip/Bob-8 56.19µ ± 0% goos: linux goarch: amd64 pkg: crypto/ecdh │ sec/op │ ECDH/P256-4 78.88µ ± 1% ECDH/X25519-4 115.6µ ± 2% pkg: filippo.io/mlkem768 │ sec/op │ RoundTrip/Alice-4 223.8µ ± 2% RoundTrip/Bob-4 114.7µ ± 1% The performance wasn’t entirely free.

Next, I reworked the x/crypto/sha3 package so it could be used without any heap allocation thanks to the mid-stack inlining trick.

There might be an opportunity to save a copy in the sha3 read path, too. After that, it’s a matter of optimizing the field implementation.

Subscribe Bonus track: using a ML-KEM implementation as Kyber v3 NIST made a few small changes to the Round 3 submission of Kyber. They are summarized in Section 1.3 of the FIPS draft. However, there are a few experimental protocols defined in terms of Kyber v3 (or “draft00”), including the main deployed PQ TLS key exchange. Do we have to make a separate package to support them? Luckily, no we don’t. One change adds some validation for an edge case (non-canonical coefficient encodings in public keys) that was undefined in Kyber. Honest implementations will not produce such keys, so we can reject them as specified in the FIPS draft. It will make it possible to fingerprint our implementation as Kyber-on-ML-KEM but will be otherwise harmless. One change removed a hashing step applied to CSPRNG input. Since those bytes are random, it’s impossible for any party to tell the difference. The final change is the major one, and the trickiest. The ciphertext used to be hashed into the shared secret. This difference would prevent interoperability. However, the mixing happens as an additional key derivation, which was entirely removed in ML-KEM, which instead returns the value K as-is. This means we can run ML-KEM to generate the shared secret K and then apply SHAKE-256(K || c)[:32] to generate the Kyber shared secret. No need to break the ML-KEM abstraction. There’s one wrinkle: both Kyber and ML-KEM perform implicit rejection in Decapsulate by hashing a secret with the ciphertext and returning that as the shared secret. If we do the key derivation above on top of ML-KEM, we’ll hash the ciphertext twice for implicit rejections. That’s ok, because the output of implicit rejection is unpredictable by design, not an interoperation target. Subscribe to Cryptography Dispatches for more!

Walking down the taxiways (pictured) or along the centrelines of the 09L/27R and 09R/27L crossed-out runways is kinda unsettling, at least for me. (\"Should I be speaking with Ground or Tower? Can I enter this runway?\") Fun fact, in 2010 a single-engine plane forgot to switch fuel tank and did an emergency landing on 27L. Closed runways are the best bad places to land, after all. This work was funded by a Google Open Source Security Subsidy and by my awesome clients—Sigsum, Latacora, Interchain, Smallstep, Ava Labs, Teleport, and Tailscale—who, through our retainer contracts, get face time and unlimited access to advice on Go and cryptography. Here are a few words from some of them! Latacora — We wrote about password hashing with delegation, a somewhat less known password hashing primitive. It's a PBKDF with a special property, that allows offloading hashing computation to a potentially untrusted server. In this blog post, we describe this primitive and discuss its applicability in the context of End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE) backup systems. Teleport — For the past five years, attacks and compromises have been shifting from traditional malware and security breaches to identifying and compromising valid user accounts and credentials with social engineering, credential theft, or phishing. Teleport Identity Governance & Security is designed to eliminate weak access patterns through access monitoring, minimize attack surface with access requests, and purge unused permissions via mandatory access reviews. Ava Labs — We at Ava Labs, maintainer of AvalancheGo (the most widely used client for interacting with the Avalanche Network), believe the sustainable maintenance and development of open source cryptographic protocols is critical to the broad adoption of blockchain technology. We are proud to support this necessary and impactful work through our ongoing sponsorship of Filippo and his team. The minimum common multiple of 1/4/10/12 with 8 is less than 64, so we can pack a few values in a uint64, and then serialize that. The result is IMHO pretty readable. ↩︎ IIUC the matrix could have been hardcoded but is instead derived from a seed in the key instead to bypass debate on how the hardcoded matrix was generated, and any backdoor concerns. My somewhat spicy opinion is that we’ll come to see this as a mistake, and a case of failing to define parameters. If the matrix was hardcoded ML-KEM would be faster and simpler. For example, there would be no need for these tests at all, and the matrix derivation typo in the spec draft couldn’t have happened. Maybe some deployments can just specify and use a profile of ML-KEM that fixes the matrix seed. ↩︎",

Is it become like AI where instead of actually coming into existence the definition is mostly just changing to bring forth a new product under a previously existing name? reply FiloSottile 18 hours agoparentCryptography has a peculiar approach to the threat of quantum computers, because it is not acceptable for some of the data and connections encrypted today to become decryptable even thirty, fifty years in the future. That means that the question is not \"are QC coming soon\" but \"might QC plausibly come into existence in the next half century\". Since the answer, despite not having a precise consensus, is not \"no\", here we are. This is also why you are seeing a lot more progress on PQ key exchanges, as opposed to signatures: signature verification today is not affected by QC fifty years from now, while encryption is. reply less_less 15 hours agorootparentThere is also the problem of embedded devices. Some of these will still be operational in 20 years, at which point a \"cryptographically relevant quantum computer\" might exist. So we want to ensure today that these devices can support post-quantum algorithms, and depending on the device, this support might need side-channel and fault protection. In some cases we can add support with a device firmware update, but things like secure boot flows and hardware accelerators can't always be updated in the field. And we need to make sure that the devices are fast enough, have big enough key storage, RAM and packet sizes, etc to support the new algorithms. reply hackcasual 14 hours agorootparentprevIt's also important to have an established history of use and vetting so by the time PQ is needed, systems with a long history of security are available reply amomchilov 19 hours agoparentprevIt’s not about protecting against QCs today.

It seems unlikely that that's the case, but still, the question is sort of unanswerable. For now it's not known to be a threat, but how much paranoia you have over its potential is subjective. reply sesm 18 hours agorootparentOne can be paranoid in a completely different direction, like “any quantum computer can’t survive long enough to perform any useful computation because objective collapse theories are right, the whole post-quantum cryptography exists to push implementations with backdoors injected by government”. reply KMag 15 hours agorootparentWe're likely to see hybrid PQ + ECDH key exchange for the foreseeable future, running the pair of exchanged values through a hash-based key derivation function. Partially due to fears of backdoors, but also out of caution because the mathematics of PQ cryptography has seen much less attention than DH / ECDH / RSA cryptography. For a long time, there was similar conservative skepticism regarding ECDH. reply __MatrixMan__ 16 hours agorootparentprevI have this type of tinfoil hat. I put it on whenever I see people blindly merging security fixes in response to vulnerability scans. reply cryptonector 18 hours agorootparentprevThe paranoid answer is to assume that certain organizations (e.g., nation state intelligence services, corporations that have enormous capital available, extremely wealthy people who can create organizations to pursue this) already have quantum cryptanalysis capabilities or very soon will. In any case, it does no harm to be ready for a PQ world. reply jjice 20 hours agoparentprevWithin the last two-ish years, the NIST settled on some post quantum crypto algorithms and there's been some implementation of them more and more since. Quantum computing is still far off, but I think the mindset is \"why not start now?\" I don't know for certain, but I'd assume things like elliptic curve were implemented a good bit before it garnered mainstream usage. I'd love for someone who was around that when it was happening to correct me if I'm wrong though. reply KMag 15 hours agorootparentYou're correct. For a while, elliptic curves were avoided by most for 2 reasons (1) worry about interpretation of some of the now-expired patents and (2) there were some known \"gotchas\" for constructing curves, and there were some fears that there were still some \"gotchas\" to be found. (And, perhaps, the NSA knew some of the gotchas and were keeping them in their back pockets.) Side note: arithmetic/range coding had similar slow adoption due to patents. Depending on your interpretation, IBM's range coding was prior art for the arithmetic coding patents, but nobody really wanted to test it in court. For instance, bzip2 is the original bzip with the arithmetic coding step replaced by a Huffman code. Nobody wanted a repeat of the debacle with GIF images being widely adopted before many realized the use of the patented LZW compression might be a problem. reply Strilanc 15 hours agoparentprevFor quantum computers to break RSA2048, the current quality of physical qubits needs to go up 10x and the quantity needs to go up 10000x. These are rough numbers. The next major milestone to watch for is a logical qubit with fidelity 1000x better than the physical qubits making it up. That will signal the physical qubits are good enough that you could start only scaling quantity. reply uh_uh 16 hours agoparentprevDo you not think that AI has been doing quite a lot of \"actually coming into existence\" the past decade?

So I mostly have done things like qiskit tutorials, but other than reading about the theory I have yet to see a coherent explanation as to how the devices actually implement the theory. Again. I'd love to be enlightened reply squabbles 18 hours agorootparentThere is none. QC is a scam like nanotech and fusion reactors. To learn more I recommended 'Will We Ever Have A Quantum Computer' by Dyakanov. reply Strilanc 15 hours agorootparentThat paper[1] is a joke. The main argument it makes is based on counting amplitudes, and noting there are far too many to ever control: > The hypothetical quantum computer is a system with an unimaginable number of continuous degrees of freedom - the values of the 2^N quantum amplitudes with N ~ 10^3–10^5 . [...] Now, imagine a bike having 1000 (or 2^1000 !) joints that allow free rotations of their parts with respect to each other. Will anybody be capable of riding this machine? [...] Thus, the answer to the question in title is: As soon as the physicists and the engineers will learn to control this number of degrees of freedom, which means - NEVER. The reason this is a joke is because it fundamentally misunderstands what is required for a quantum computation to succeed. Yes, if you needed fine control over every individual amplitude, you would be hosed. But you don't need that. For example, consider a quantum state that appears while factoring a 2048 bit number. This state has 2^2048 amplitudes with sorta-kinda-uniform magnitudes. Suppose I let you pick a million billion trillion of those amplitudes, and give you complete control over them. You can apply any arbitrary operation you want to those amplitudes, as long it's allowed by the postulates of quantum mechanics. You can negate them, merge them, couple them to an external system, whatever. If you do your absolute worst... it will be completely irrelevant. Errors in quantum mechanics are linear, so changing X% of the state can only perturb the output by X%. The million billion trillion amplitudes you picked will amount to at most 10^-580 % of the state, so you can reduce the success of the algorithm by at most 10^-580 %. You are damaging the state, but it's such an irrelevantly negligible damage that it doesn't matter. (In fact, it's very strange to even talk about affecting 1 amplitude, or a fraction of the amplitudes, because rotating any one qubit affects all the amplitudes.) To consistently stop me from factoring, you'd need to change well more than 10% of the amplitudes by rotations of well more than 10 degrees. That's a completely expected amount of error to accumulate over a billion operations if I'm not using error correction. That's why I need error correction. But Dyakonov argues like you'd only need to change 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of the amplitudes to stop me from factoring. He's simply wrong. [1]: https://ebooks.iospress.nl/pdf/doi/10.3233/APC200019 reply squabbles 14 hours agorootparentI said his book, which makes further arguments: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-42019-2 And your rebuttal amounts to \"if I let you mess with a trivial number of amplitudes then the error will be trivial\". Well duh. Another way of phrasing what you said is that you need to control 90% of 2^2048 amplitudes. Which is Dyakanov's point, that nobody knows how to do this. reply Strilanc 13 hours agorootparentI maintain that Dyakonov's arguments are completely missing the mark. I predict this will be experimentally obvious, instead of just theoretically obvious from linearity, within 5 years (due to the realization of logical qubits with lifetimes thousands of times better than their parts). reply tgkudelski 19 hours agoprevHello from Kudelski Security.

While the allegations are vaguely plausible -- NSA employs some very clever people, and of course they would like to interfere -- the evidence DJB put forth hasn't convinced very many other cryptographers. There was also an incident a few months back when someone with an NSA email address suggested significant last-minute changes to Kyber on the PQC forum mailing list. These changes had a security flaw, and they were rejected. NSA might still know a different weakness, of course. Note also that DJB's allegations focus on Kyber-512 being too weak, and this post is about Kyber-768. reply tptacek 11 hours agorootparentI don't think there's a single PQC cryptography researcher other than Bernstein himself (corrections welcome) that takes the claims he made seriously, and one of the basic mathematical arguments he made may have been refuted, two messages down in the mailing list thread, by Chris Peikert. reply less_less 11 hours agorootparentYeah, sorry, \"hasn't convinced very many other cryptographers\" was probably too much of an understatement. reply client4 3 hours agorootparentI appreciate the follow-up.

(The difference being that while there is one major Go compiler, which usually does not go overboard with optimizations, when writing C you have to do increasingly complex tricks to defend against the compiler realizing what you are trying to do and replacing it with a more efficient variable-time branch.)

I don't mean how to use the command line. That is well-documented. But I want to know how I should manage and distribute my keys and what I need to look out for. The entire social layer on top of the technology is unclear to me. Some stories featuring Alice and Bob would be great. reply varispeed 19 hours agoparentprevShame it doesn't have plausible deniability built in. That is you could encrypt at least two files and decrypt one of them based on which key you provide. This seems to be a security flaw of most of these kind of tools. That is there is only one possible key, so someone with a hammer can make you disclose it. But if the number of keys is unknown, you can give up some keys and hope attacker will leave you alone, without revealing the actual protected file. reply woodruffw 19 hours agorootparentI don’t understand the threat model for plausible deniability in a file encryption tool: any adversary that would physically compel you to provide one key would also know that you’re potentially being dishonest about that key. In other words: plausible deniability on decryption doesn’t satisfy the adversary; they’re just going to torture you until you hand over the real key. (Maybe there are scenarios, like airport security, where the adversary probably won’t torture you but needs the appearance of decryption? But I don’t think the adversary in those scenarios is thinking about file encryption tools; they’re thinking about your phone’s PIN or biometric lock.) reply eviks 18 hours agorootparentYou seem to understand it with your own example of airport security types of situations. There are also other similar law enforcement actions where the people wouldn't have enough info to have a high enough degree of certainty that you possess something to be able to get suspect enough to cause additional harm on not finding it when the keys are disclosed reply varispeed 18 hours agorootparentprev> In other words: plausible deniability on decryption doesn’t satisfy the adversary; If there is only one key that decrypts the file, then they will have validation whether you provided the right one. For instance if you have encrypted your crypto wallet info. You would have to give up the real key that will decrypt the file. With plausible deniability scenario, you could have encrypted two wallets, one that you afford to lose. You can give it up and it's possible the attacker will be satisfied and you can keep the wallet that you care about. The attacker will also never know if there are more keys. Mind you, they can always shoot you either way, but with the plausible deniability you might have a chance to leave the wallet you care about to your dependents. reply woodruffw 16 hours agorootparent> With plausible deniability scenario, you could have encrypted two wallets, one that you afford to lose. You can give it up and it's possible the attacker will be satisfied and you can keep the wallet that you care about. The observation here is that there's a _very_ narrow slice of adversaries that satisfy the following constraints: 1. Are willing to force you to hand over private key material; 2. Are ignorant to the underlying thing they're looking for; 3. Are ignorant to the fact that your choice of encryption scheme allows for plausible deniability. This model assumes all 3, when in reality almost any adversary that satisfies (1) is not going to satisfy (2) or (3) -- they almost always have a sense of what they're looking for (i.e., they know the wallet isn't empty or they wouldn't waste their time on you) and, given that, they aren't going to be fooled by a scheme that explicitly supports plausible deniability. We can always contrive exceptions, of course. But part of secure design and threat modeling is having a reasonable conception of your adversary. reply varispeed 16 hours agorootparentYou are moving the goal posts. I didn't say the second wallet is empty, but such that you can afford to lose. For instance you could have one wallet with £10m on it an another with £1.5m. You could certainly convince adversary that they got bad intel and £1.5m is what you have. It's better to lose £1.5m than £11.5m. There are other scenarios like journalist taking compromising photos. They could have two sets of photos - one with key photo missing and another with key photo in the set. When questioned by adversary they could claim they have missed and didn't take the photo and show the set as evidence. Someone in abusive relationship planning on leaving the partner. They could have a folder with properties they are interested in without the property they are actually going to rent. When caught they could convince the partner that they were just looking, but have not committed to anything. If you are not in these kind of situations, sure this additional layer may not be to your interest and frankly you wouldn't have to use it! But for many people lack of such feature is a deal breaker. reply woodruffw 14 hours agorootparentThe \"empty wallet\" isn't an operative part of the argument. The argument is that all three properties need to hold; this is true even in the 11.5m example. Each of the scenarios above fails test (3). The most compelling of them is the abusive relationship one, since we can reasonably imagine a non-sophisticated adversary in that setting. But even then, you're relying on conflicting terms: what kind of abusive partner is sufficiently irrational to be abusive but also sufficiently rational to believe a cryptographic proof? Or, put another way: overwhelming evidence has not historically been a strong defense against abuse. reply varispeed 25 minutes agorootparentYou are moving goal posts again.

    "title": "Tech workers condemn Y Combinator CEO's controversial rant",
    "originLink": "https://missionlocal.org/2024/01/stupid-shameful-say-tech-workers-of-y-combinator-ceo-garry-tans-rant/",
    "originBody": "Following Garry Tan’s seemingly alcohol-fueled rant over the weekend, in which he wrote on social media that seven progressive San Francisco supervisors should “die slow,” tech workers in San Francisco had a few choice words for the Y Combinator CEO: “shameful,” “really dumb,” “very stupid.” Tan “should not have done any of that. He should go for a while. He should not represent tech anymore,” said Kevin Baragona, co-founder and CEO of DeepAI, a text and image generator. “It’s shameful,” added a Y Combinator alumnus who, like others, declined to be named for fear of professional retaliation. He has been checking the Y Combinator internal Slack and monitoring their daily email updates, but there has been “no communication” from the company, he said. “If the CEO of Boeing or Coca-Cola said, ‘I hope Joe Biden dies a slow death,’ someone would be like, ‘Oh, whoops, that wasn’t supposed to happen,’” he said. “It would be a PR nightmare, and yet there has been no acknowledgment.” On Y Combinator’s message board, Hacker News, which is owned by the company but open to the public, the topic generated hundreds of comments debating the wisdom of the purportedly drunken tirade, and whether Tan should now step down. “This kind of behavior shouldn’t be acceptable for the head of a respectable corporation … He should resign or be dismissed, and YC should replace him with a responsible adult,” read one comment. “This isn’t a minor offense, it is grotesque. If he remains, it reflects very badly on YC.” “I’m a YC alum,” began another, “I don’t have a problem with tech leaders holding political positions, nor do I have a problem with them making personal donations based on those opinions. Quietly.” GARRY TAN’S TWITTER TIRADE More SF supes receive threats referencing Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan’s posts by JOE RIVANO BARROS JANUARY 31, 2024 FEBRUARY 1, 2024 Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan’s online rant spurs threats to supes, police reports by JOE RIVANO BARROS and JOE ESKENAZI JANUARY 30, 2024 FEBRUARY 1, 2024 Garry Tan, tech CEO & campaign donor, wishes death upon San Francisco politicians by JOE RIVANO BARROS JANUARY 27, 2024 FEBRUARY 1, 2024 Some in tech, however, said the incident was a “manufactured crisis,” and that city supervisors were running with the incident to score political points. “Do I think that it’s really dumb for the supervisors to be filing restraining orders or police reports against Garry Tan? I mean, come on, dude. Do they really expect that Garry Tan will hire some dudes to drive by and shoot them?” asked another tech founder. “No, of course not.” Even those less who were less critical of the rant wondered about Tan’s judgment. “I look at this as a drunken error, so I wouldn’t cancel him, personally,” added Stephen Gibson, founder of an early-stage AI startup, while acknowledging that it was “poor judgment.” Y Combinator has not responded to multiple requests for comment on the incident — even after Tan’s online tirade begat very real-world consequences: On Tuesday, three of the supervisors named in his posts received identical threatening postcards at their homes, wishing harm to them and their families. The letter received Tuesday by Supervisors Aaron Peskin, Dean Preston and Myrna Melgar, reading “Garry Tan is right! I wish a slow and painful death for you and your loved ones.” “Garry Tan is right!” read the postcards addressed to Supervisors Aaron Peskin, Dean Preston and Myrna Melgar. “I wish a slow and painful death for you and your loved ones.” The postcards, bearing Tan’s face, were addressed to each supervisor individually. The postcards concluded with a note: “This mail was sent to communicate a political opinion. No threats were intended.” The San Francisco Police Department said Wednesday it is investigating the mailers. District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, whom Tan has hosted at his Mission District home, said she would recuse herself from any potential case involving Tan and refer it to the California attorney general, to avoid a conflict of interest. Tan, for his part, apologized over the weekend, noting that his post was a reference to a Tupac Shakur lyric. He initially brushed off the comments as a joke, before taking the incident more seriously: “There is no place, no excuse and no reason for this type of speech,” he wrote hours after the initial post. He has yet to acknowledge the letters sent to the supervisors’ homes. Joke or not, Tan’s tweet emerged from genuine rage The supervisors named by Tan have responded quickly to the tirade: They have filed police reports and consulted with the City Attorney’s Office. At least two supervisorial candidates whom Tan has supported, Marjan Philhour and Trevor Chandler, said they do not condone Tan’s language. Deva Hazarika, another San Francisco tech founder, said that Tan’s statements were “a dumb thing to tweet, especially for a prominent figure, but lots of people have made ill-advised tweets after a couple too many drinks.” And, Hazarika said later, the subsequent threats were the fault of whomever sent the anonymous mailer — not Tan. “If idiots grab onto that as some sort of rationale for threats or harassment, I think that’s on them, not him.” Tan and Y Combinator may not be household names, but they hold an outsized prominence in San Francisco and Silicon Valley: From his perch atop Y Combinator — the most sought-after incubator for startups, a virtual golden ticket for founders — Tan oversees hundreds of companies annually poised to become multi-billion dollar successes. DoorDash, Cruise, Reddit, Coinbase and thousands of others have gone through the program, companies now collectively worth a combined $600 billion, according to Y Combinator. Tan has also used his position to entreat tech workers and executives in San Francisco to involve themselves in local politics. He is a firebrand among anti-progressive political forces in the city, underwriting campaigns and groups aimed at dislodging progressive supervisors from their seats. He frequently lambasts the progressive “political machine” and calls for retaking San Francisco from what he labels leftist excess. He employs partisan and apocalyptic language, calling opponents “cronies,” “corrupt” or “doom loop accelerationists,” and claiming they want to “destroy public safety” and “ruin” or “destroy” the city. IN OTHER ONLINE RANTS… Elon Musk calls for jailing San Francisco supervisor Dean Preston by JOE RIVANO BARROS SEPTEMBER 29, 2023 OCTOBER 4, 2023 Elon Musk calls for jailing San Francisco supervisor — again by JOE RIVANO BARROS OCTOBER 3, 2023 OCTOBER 5, 2023 He is also a fount of misinformation, misunderstanding how the city’s police commission functions, for instance, or claiming that “the mayor can’t fire people.” So even though Tan claimed the tirade was a joke, it fell well within his characteristic hostility. “We weren’t born yesterday, we know this is all-consuming to you, this wasn’t just a joke,” said the Y Combinator alumnus. “He is just sort of trying to laugh it away and claim that he is a Twitter troll, and it’s like, no, you’re not, don’t dismiss years of your consistent attacks, don’t try to wash it all away.” Despite the anger, many agree with Tan’s politics If Tan were not the face of the San Francisco tech community, then whom? Baragona mentioned Emmett Shear, the co-founder of streaming platform Twitch, whom he finds “very reasonable.” But, he added that he generally agrees with Tan’s views, which he described. “Garry Tan was basically in favor of making San Francisco safer, building more housing and moderate politics. I think these are good things.” “I think that tech leaders and business leaders have a responsibility to cities and or to their communities to serve them both, either through politics or any other way … but making a statement like that, I think Tan probably has more to learn about the politics side of things. You can’t just be spouting off like that,” said Gibson. Several others agreed that Tan “genuinely cares deeply” about the city, but is approaching politics in a naive fashion. Anthony Jancso, founder of the group Accelerate SF, said he was “surprised” to read Tan’s post but that Tan “deserves more credit for the work that he’s doing … to set San Francisco up as the best city in the world.” Added Evan Conrad, co-founder of San Francisco Compute: “Garry Tan is broadly a good person who genuinely cares deeply about San Francisco.” The tech worker who asked to remain nameless talked about the fix Tan has created. “They’re making a bigger deal out of this. They’re trying to create some kind of political enemy for everybody to hate. I think it’s stoking a little bit more hate and resentment towards tech people … I’m a little annoyed that Garry Tan’s giving them the ammunition to do that.” EXPLORE GARRY TAN’S CAMPAIGN DONATIONS Explore: $6M poured into Boudin recall by WILL JARRETT MAY 23, 2022 MAY 23, 2022 Who is funding the school board recall? by WILL JARRETT JANUARY 19, 2022 FEBRUARY 12, 2022 Follow Us TAGGED: Garry Tan JOE RIVANO BARROSSENIOR EDITOR joe.rivanobarros@missionlocal.com Joe was born in Sweden, where half of his family received asylum after fleeing Pinochet, and spent his early childhood in Chile; he moved to Oakland when he was eight.

A while back somebody put up some stickers with his face on an octopus and the tentacles holding his various assets. The Twitter mafia went all out saying this was clearly racist and totally unacceptable in civil society, because of some prior art where an asian individual was offensively caricaturized atop an octopus. I tired to point out that the octopus has been used as a symbol of a many faceted organization since forever, and the racist aspect of the prior art wasn’t the octopus but rather the ridiculous caricaturization. The picture of Gary used in his octopus was a totally normal photo, so the racist prior art was of no consequence. Gary somehow saw my comment and decided to launch a tweet thread telling his hundreds of thousands of followers what a terrible racist horrible idiotic person I am, which resulted in a huge hacking campaign being launched against various little personal projects I had posted on my Twitter.

If so, perhaps you're unaware of the dangerous and recent rise in violent political rhetoric here. Garry Tan is a prominent and powerful person in the tech industry, and his words carry weight.

It's human nature. People are social creatures and they love to join some fight as long as they have their own comrades with them. My wife spent years on Twitter embroiled in a very long running and bitter political / rights issue. She was always thoughtful, insightful etc. She'd spend 10 minutes rewording a single tweet to make sure it got the real point across in a way that wasn't inflammatory, and that had a good chance of being persuasive. With 5k followers, I think her most popular tweets might get a few hundred likes. The one time she got drunk and angry, she got thousands of supportive reactions, and her followers increased by a large % overnight. And that scared her. She saw the way \"the crowd\" was pushing her. Rewarding her for the smell of blood in the water. Audience capture is real. Chronically online people with polarised followers will play to their crowd. Inch by inch, day by day, as social creatures, we automatically and subliminally seek approval from our social group.

If it’s set where it’s cheaper to hang onto the vacancy until rents rise again and finish the build then, it’s a problem. reply bsder 4 hours agorootparentprevTaxing vacancies breaks the rent logjam caused by financing agreements that allow you to tack missing rent onto the end but require recapitalization for lower rent. Individuals and small landlords raise or lower rents in response to market conditions as they prioritize cash flow--it's very difficult to make up for lost rent. It's the private equity financed stuff that is artifically keeping rents too high as they have enough cash to ride across an empty property almost indefinitely. Vacancy taxes stop the idiocy and force the private equity financed stuff to be market responsive as well. reply chrisbolt 7 hours agoprevPrevious: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39205676 reply gurchik 7 hours agoparentI read HN probably more than I should, and I was pretty surprised to see this has over 500 comments and I didn't see it at all.

Edit: I've turned off both the flags and flamewar detector on this article now, in keeping with the first rule of HN moderation, which is (I'm repeating myself but it's probably worth repeating) that we moderate HN less, not more, when YC or a YC-funded startup is part of a story (https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&qu...). Please note: that doesn't mean we don't moderate at all; what it means is that whatever we would normally do, we do less of it in such cases. Normally we would never late a ragestorm like this stay on the front page—there's zero intellectual curiosity here, as the comments demonstrate. This kind of thing is obviously off topic for HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html. If it weren't, the site would consist of little else. Equally obvious is that this is why HN users are flagging the story. They're not doing anything different than they normally would. All this goes double when a story has already had extensive discussion, and 10x when the article is sourcing its content from Hacker News itself, as this one is. That's absurd. But I'm willing to take the hit because the first rule of HN moderation is more important. reply gurchik 5 hours agorootparentThanks Dan. When I wrote my comment I thought most people would already know that it was most likely an automated system that downranked the post. The next time I talk about this topic I'll make it extra clear I'm not insinuating any manual censorship. With that said, it is a shame that in cases like this, you may not even know about a post with hundreds of comments unless someone sends you a link. Have you thought about implementing a view that ignores the flamewar detection? This could even be a historical view, like https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2024-01-31 . The post in question was one of the highest upvoted submissions of the day and yet it's not on the first page of this link.

The whole thing is so embarassing. reply bnralt 7 hours agoparentIt's also strange because I've seen Tupac Shakur glamorized in popular culture (for example, hagiographic discussions about him on NPR). But Shakur was rapping about killing people, while those people were being targeted and killed by associates of his, and he himself shot people. A 6 year old was even shot in the head and killed with his gun in one of the fights he got into (he claimed he dropped the gun and someone else fired it during the fight). It's bizarre to see the level of outrage against Tan quoting Tupac compared the the veneration you usually find of Tupac. reply davesque 7 hours agoparentprevI don't see how it makes it any better that it was a quote.

You can’t waive rent if you’re the one doing the living, and by definition if someone is letting someone else “live rent free” in their head, the rent is already waived.

I have seen this a lot lately in online discussions of homelessness and people accused of crime. It's very unsettling. That is the context of why Mr Tan wrote that -- there's a popular narrative that specific individuals are complicit in crime and homelessness in San Francisco. This leads to lots of ad hominem and in my view rises to the level of conspiracy theory in many -- it's not like every problem is the fault of a single office holder or even a \"cabal\" of them. Voting against someone or supporting different candidates is one thing. Calling them solely responsible for all that you consider evil, escalating to the level of death threats, is quite another. And that's just politicians.

Rich people buying journalism is how SF got to be what it is today. reply tlogan 5 hours agorootparentWe are doomed :( The situation with journalism, particularly in the context of investigating significant issues like the SF SAFE fraud scandal, presents a complex paradox that indeed feels disheartening at times. On one hand, the reluctance to financially support news outlets has led to a scarcity of resources for journalists, limiting their ability to conduct in-depth investigations. This trend compromises the quality of journalism, as reporters are pressed for time and resources, often resulting in superficial coverage of complex issues. On the other hand, the alternative – journalism funded by wealthy individuals or entities – raises concerns about bias and influence. When the financial backers of journalism have vested interests, there's a risk that the news could be slanted to serve those interests, potentially undermining the integrity and objectivity that are foundational to the profession. reply ChrisArchitect 7 hours agoprevRelated yesterday discussion: Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan's online rant spurs threats to supes, police reports https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39205676 reply fooker 54 minutes agoprevSo what?

Same story across the UK - taxes and prices ever increase, quality of everything and every service continues to decline. The greed and corruption on display by nearly all politicians is beyond brazen. Lucrative contracts for friends that deliver no value, insider trading, tax avoidance, offshore accounts, communicating government business on burner phones, deleting emails, fiddling expenses, huge infrastructure projects running vastly over budget then being cancelled, etc. What amazes me is how few realise the level of outright theft of their own hard earned money, and seek some form of comfort in blaming the other side, believing their team will fix it next time. There are even some that try to put it down to incompetence. The corruption is now so deeply rooted and endemic throughout all of society, government and media it’s impossible to know where rooting it out could ever start and end. So probably the only way to turn the tide is for everyday hard working people to start rejecting it and rejecting to support it in any way, shape or form, everyday throughout their own lives.

    "originBody": "The web just gets better with Interop 2024 Feb 1, 2024 by Jen Simmons Contents The Interop Project Interop 2023 Interop 2024 The 2024 Focus Areas The 2024 Investigation projects Track the progress Our Commitment The web is amazing. It makes collaborating, learning, and connecting easy for billions of people, because it’s intentionally designed to run on radically different devices. It’s your job as a web developer to ensure your project works in every browser and for every user — and that can be hard to do. It’s a far easier undertaking when browsers have identical implementations of the web technology you use. Identical implementations are accomplished through the web standards process, where people collaborate together to write extremely detailed technical documents that define each new web technology — right down to how website bugs should work. One way to check and see if browsers follow the web standards is through automated testing. There are several shared repositories of such tests, including Web Platform Tests. WPT contains over 1.8 million tests, of which over 95% pass in all of the major browsers. The Interop Project The Interop project aims to improve interoperability by encouraging browser engine teams to look deeper into specific focus areas. Now, for a third year, Apple, Bocoup, Google, Igalia, Microsoft, and Mozilla pooled our collective expertise and selected a specific subset of automated tests for 2024. Some of the technologies chosen have been around for a long time. Other areas are brand new. By selecting some of the highest priority features that developers have avoided for years because of their bugs, we can get them to a place where they can finally be relied on. And by selecting exciting new technology, we can ensure it’s interoperable from the beginning. To better understand where interoperability is going in the future, let’s first take a look at the impact of Interop 2023. Interop 2023 Interop 2023 was even more of an overwhelming success than Interop 2022. In January 2023, 48% of the chosen tests passed in all three of the major browser engines (in those shipped to users: Chrome and Firefox for desktop Linux, and Safari on macOS Monterey). A year later, that pass rate rose to 95% (in Chrome Dev and Firefox Nightly for desktop Linux, and Safari Technology Preview on macOS Ventura). The success of Interop 2023, seen on the “Experimental” dashboard. The “Interop” line, in dark green, shows the percentage of tests that passed in all three — Chrome Dev, Firefox Nightly, and Safari Technology Preview. What did Interop 2023 accomplish? It ensured that all browsers have full support for P3 color, seven years after it started shipping. Form controls now support vertical writing modes, for the first time in the web’s history. CSS border-image now works as originally intended. Subgrid, Container Queries, :has(), Motion Path, CSS Math Functions, inert and @property are now supported in every modern browser. Improved Web APIs include Offscreen Canvas, Modules in Web Workers, Import Maps, Import Assertions, and JavaScript Modules. The entire Media Queries 4 specification is now supported everywhere, with easier to use syntax. Web Components got a boost with adoptedStyleSheets, ElementInternals, Form-Associated Custom Elements, and the basic behavior of Shadow DOM and Custom Elements. Useful CSS pseudo-classes can now be relied on, with consistent cross-browser support for :nth-child(), :nth-last-child(), :modal, :user-valid, and :user-invalid. Feature queries now have new support for detecting font features. Font Palettes provide robust support for color fonts. Significant progress made improving CSS Masking, HTML Forms, Pointer and Mouse Events, Scrolling, Transforms, URL, WebCodecs, and a bucket of bugs causing web compat issues. And more. We hope this work gives you a renewed sense of confidence to use these technologies. If you found any of them hard-to-use in the past, give them another try. Interop 2023 had twenty-six focus areas, twenty of which are being retired as a success. Work will continue on Custom Properties, Pointer and Mouse Events, URL, and a new grouping called “Layout” — consisting of Flexbox, Grid, and Subgrid. Interop 2024 Now, we are doing it all again for 2024. Ninety-six focus area proposals were submitted for consideration. Ultimately, sixteen were chosen. Grouping some of the new proposals together, and continuing some of the work from 2023, gives Interop 2024 a total of seventeen focus areas. The Interop 2024 dashboard, looking at the “stable” browsers (those currently in the hands of everyday people). Coincidentally, the overall Interop score is once again starting at 48%. New this year, Microsoft Edge now has its own column on the Interop dashboard. This currently represents Edge and Edge Dev running on Windows 10. The 2024 Focus Areas Accessibility CSS Nesting Custom Properties Declarative Shadow DOM Font size adjust HTTPS URLs for WebSocket IndexedDB Layout Pointer and Mouse Events Popover Relative Color Syntax requestVideoFrameCallback Scrollbar Styling @starting-style and transition-behavior Text Directionality text-wrap: balance URL Accessibility Interop 2023 included an Accessibility Investigation project. Led by Apple’s accessibility team, the group worked diligently to create new accessibility testing infrastructure for WPT, and write over 1300 new accessibility tests. These tests have now been included in Interop 2024 as a focus area, encouraging browsers to increase their support. The majority of new accessibility tests cover WAI-ARIA, in particular, the Roles Model and the Accessible Name and Description Computation (AccName). Together, these provide a consistent mechanism for conveying the purpose or intent of an element so assistive technology users understand what it is and what they can do with it. Other new accessibility tests cover how those technologies are incorporated into host languages. For example, the HTML Accessibility API Mappings specification (HTML-AAM) defines the default accessibility semantics of HTML elements, along with related rules for how browsers work with features like theelement and image alt text. (See the html-aam/roles WPT tests as an example.) Another new set of tests cover the accessibility of display: contents. This display mode in CSS provides a useful mechanism for removing the box around content — helpful when wanting to adjust the parent/child/grandchild relationships of content for the purposes of Flexbox or Grid. But it was off limits for use for years, because of the lack of accessibility in early implementations. Removing the box on an item completely removed all the contents of that box from the accessibility tree. Sighted users could still see the child content, but many users of assistive technology experienced it completely disappearing. Most of these problems have been fixed in browsers, but not all, not for every situation. These new tests are the next step toward full accessibility and interoperability. By including these new Accessibility tests in Interop 2024, the hope is to fix every issue in all browsers. We want it to be easier for developers to create accessible sites and make the web better for everyone, including people with disabilities. CSS Nesting CSS Nesting is a focus area for Interop 2024 to ensure any differences are ironed out, and to provide you with the confidence to use it. The ability to nest CSS shipped in all four major browsers in 2023 — first in Chrome, Edge, and Safari in April/May. And then in Firefox in August. The web standard changed slightly between May and August, relaxing the original requirement that every nested selector start with a symbol. Developers can now simply write article, rather than needing to use & article. All of the implementations have since been updated, but there are still small bits that could benefit from attention to interoperability, especially as the final complex details of how Nesting works are settled in the CSS Working Group. Most of Safari’s test failures, for example, are about how nested CSS interacts with the Shadow DOM via :host. Custom Properties The @property at-rule started shipping in browsers over the last few years. As part of Interop 2023, the Custom Properties focus area rose from 4% of tests passing in all stable browsers to 7.6% passing — with 90.7% passing in all of the preview browsers. Firefox is the last browser to add support, which is currently in progress in Firefox Nightly. Since this work isn’t done yet, the focus area is being continued in 2024. With @property, developers can declare CSS custom properties in a fashion similar to how browser engines define CSS properties — specifying its syntax, inheritance behavior, and initial value. @property --size { syntax: \"\"; inherits: false; initial-value: 0px; } This allows you to do things in CSS that were impossible before, like animating gradients or certain parts of transforms. Declarative Shadow DOM Declarative Shadow DOM is a declarative API that lets you create reusable widgets and components by using only HTML — no JavaScript is necessary. It’s been supported in Safari 16.4 since March 2023, and in Chrome 90 since April 2021. Firefox has an implementation in Firefox Nightly. Declarative Shadow DOM was one of the often-asked-for features in the State of HTML 2023 survey, so it was chosen to be part of Interop 2024 to ensure it becomes interoperable across all browsers. Font size adjust The font-size-adjust property is a great example of the usefulness of placing attention on older technology. Firefox first implemented font size adjust in 2008, but it was rarely used or even discussed by web designers and developers. The early spec evolved over time, adding support for more languages through the two-value syntax, and becoming easier to use with the from-font value. The WebKit team implemented the basic version in Safari 16.4 and added the updates in September’s Safari 17.0. Mozilla updated their implementation in Firefox 118, also in September 2023. Both Safari and Firefox now pass 100% of all tests. Chrome began an experimental implementation in 2015, but has yet to ship it. Now with Interop 2024, it’s likely every browser will gain complete support. Font size adjust provides a simple way to conform all the fonts used in a string of text to be the same visual size — so every character in 1.4rem-sized text, for example, has the same x-height — or cap height, ch width, ic width, or ic height. The two value syntax allows you to choose which measurement to conform. This property is especially useful when you are mixing code with regular text, or mixing multiple languages together, and the different fonts within the same sentence have different sizes. With font size adjust you can avoid weirdly-big letters. No more fussing with font metrics to find a magic number that makes them all look the same size. The CSS `font-size-adjust: from font` makes the Courier font adjust its size to match its x-height with that from Iowan Old Style, instead of typesetting the code to be visually larger. The size uniformity holds even when fallback fonts are used instead. Learn more about font-size-adjust by watching What’s new in CSS from WWDC23. HTTPS URLs for WebSocket A quirky aspect of the WebSocket API is that you need to use non-HTTP(S) schemes: ws: (insecure) and wss:. As the URLs function otherwise identically to HTTP(S) URLs, this makes the API a bit frustrating to deal with. Based on web developer feedback the WebKit team decided to address this last year by making the API support HTTP(S) URLs as well. We shipped support in Safari 17.0. This means that instead of writing: function webSocketHandle(path) { const url = new URL(path, location); url.protocol = location.protocol === \"https:\" ? \"wss:\" : \"ws:\"; return new WebSocket(url); } // ... const ws = webSocketHandle(path); You can now write the much more ergonomic: const ws = new WebSocket(path); By bringing this to Interop 2024, we hope other browsers will adopt it as well, making it universally available for web developers. IndexedDB IndexedDB is an API that provides powerful ways to store data client-side, in an object-oriented database. It started shipping in browsers in 2011, and over the years the web standard has kept evolving. Both version 2 and version 3 are supported by all major browsers. Version 2 is fully interoperable, but version 3 needs a bit of attention to bring up the quality of implementations. Being part of Interop 2024 will help ensure implementations are completed and aligned. Layout CSS Grid and Flexbox were both included in the original Interop project in 2021. Subgrid was added in Interop 2023. While all three layout methods are now in great shape, they still aren’t quite perfect. The tests for these three areas are now being combined into one Focus Area called Layout. Work will continue to ensure complex edge cases are more interoperable. Meanwhile, developers should absolutely feel confident using these three technologies, since all browsers have solid support for Flexbox, Grid, and now Subgrid. Pointer and Mouse Events Pointer events are DOM events that are fired for a pointing device. They create a single DOM event model to handle pointing input devices such as a mouse, pen/stylus, or touch with one or more fingers. This API first started shipping in browsers in 2012, and landed everywhere by 2019, but still had rocky interoperability. In 2022, the Interop team launched an Investigation Project to look deeper into the current state of Pointer and Mouse Events, in an effort to clarify consensus and write tests that captured the state of that consensus. For Interop 2023, those tests enabled Pointer and Mouse Events to be a Focus Area, where the test pass rate was part of the Interop 2023 dashboard and score. Over the year, Pointer and Mouse Events rose from a test pass rate of 34% to 81% — the most significant progress of any area. While passing 81% of tests is a significant improvement, there is more work to do, therefore Pointer and Mouse Events will continue to be a Focus Area for 2024. Popover The new popover attribute in HTML provides a built-into-the-browser way to have an element pop into view on the top layer of a page. If you are creating an overlay over the entire web page, the dialog element is the best option. But when you want to turn any other element into a popup message, user interface, or other kind of content that appears and disappears, the popover element provides a framework to do it. Support for popover shipped in Chrome 114 and Safari 17.0 in 2023. Firefox currently has support in progress in Firefox Nightly. Being part of Interop 2024 will ensure this highly desired feature has a fantastic start. Relative Color Syntax Relative Color Syntax is a new way to define colors in CSS that allows you do so while referring to another color. You can, for instance, lighten or darken an existing color by a certain amount. You can take a color variable, adjust the saturation, and assign the new color to a second variable. Relative Color Syntax can be especially powerful when creating a design system. Learn more about Relative Color Syntax by watching What’s new in CSS from WWDC23. Safari 16.4 was the first browser to ship support, in March 2023. Chrome 119 and Edge 119 shipped support in Oct and Nov 2023. Currently, none of the implementations have support for using currentcolor with Relative Color Syntax. The Relative Color Syntax focus area for Interop 2024 doesn’t test overall support of Relative Color Syntax. It’s narrowly focused on whether or not currentcolor is supported, and includes tests of out-of-gamut behavior — checking to see what happens on displays that don’t have support for P3 color. Inclusion in Interop 2024 will help these final bits get done. requestVideoFrameCallback Theelement provides powerful functionality for putting video on the web. But often, developers want and need to do more. The HTMLVideoElement interface provides special properties and methods for manipulating video objects in JavaScript. And one of those methods is requestVideoFrameCallback(). It lets you perform per-video-frame operations on video in an efficient manner — operations like video processing or analysis, painting to canvas, and synchronization with audio sources. Supported since Chrome 83 and Safari 15.4, inclusion in Interop 2024 will help browsers complete and polish our implementations. Scrollbar styling The scrollbar styling focus area includes two CSS properties that can be used to style scrollbars. The scrollbar-width property provides three values: auto, thin, and none. The auto value is the default width; thin provides a thinner scrollbar; and none hides the scrollbar while still allowing content to scroll. Firefox 64 implemented support in December 2018, and it just shipped in Chrome 121 and Edge 121. The scrollbar-gutter property lets you reserve space for the scrollbar, so the layout is the same whether or not a scrollbar is present. The scrollbar-gutter: stable rule lets you tell the browser to reserve space for a scrollbar, even when a scrollbar isn’t there. This can prevent layout shifts from happening between states where scrollbars are needed or not needed. It shipped in Chrome 94, Edge 94 and Firefox 97, in 2021–22. Safari has the most work to do to complete this Focus Area. Chrome and Firefox already pass 100% of the tests. Ironically, it was Safari who first provided the ability to style scrollbars with nine pseudo-elements, ::-webkit-scrollbar-*, back in 2009. However that approach to styling scrollbars never became an official CSS web standard. The CSS Working Group instead opted for a far simpler approach. @starting-style and transition-behavior This Focus Area brings attention to two new features for controlling animation. Both shipped in Chrome 117 and Edge 177 in Sept 2023. The @starting-style rule in CSS lets you define starting values for a particular element. This is needed when the element is about to go through a transition. It also provides a way for transitioning in or out of display:none. .alert { transition: background-color 2s; background-color: green; @starting-style { background-color: transparent; } } In the above example, the background-color will transition from transparent to green when the element is appended to the document. Previously, only animations could animate discretely-animatable properties. The transition-behavior property in CSS expands that capability to CSS transitions, paving the way for transitioning the display property when showing or hiding elements. Text Directionality The direction in which text flows is a vital aspect of typesetting on the web. Some languages flow from left-to-right, while others flow from right-to-left. One of the many bits of technology supporting text direction is the dir attribute. It lets you specifically mark any HTML element with the direction: left, right, or auto — where auto asks the browser to guess from the first letter. The interaction of directionality and shadow trees was not well-defined until recently. Now that it’s been addressed at a standards level, adding it to Interop 2024 helps us ensure implementations align as well. text-wrap: balance Web designers have long wished for a way to prevent very short or one-word lines of text — often known as widows or orphans. Since the advent of responsive web design and the lack of control over the width of columns, this desire has gotten even more challenging. The text-wrap property provides you with multiple options for telling the browser how to wrap text with different methods for calculating line breaks for specific use cases. The text-wrap: balance rule is a great solution for headlines. It balances a few lines of text so that each line has about the same amount of text as the others. It shipped in Chrome 114 and Firefox 121, and is implemented in Safari Technology Preview. Interop 2024 also includes tests of how text-wrap-mode, text-wrap-style, and white-space-collapse behave. The CSS Working Group recently changed to how these longhands interact with each other, so support is currently uneven between browsers. Interop 2024 will help ensure all browser engines update to the latest web standards. URL URLs are one of the most fundamental parts of the web. Without them, the web would not exist. But like many things invented very early in the history of the web, support has yet to be fully interoperable. To improve this, the WHATWG wrote the URL Living Standard packed with details on exactly how URLs should work. The tests supporting this web standard were a focus area for Interop 2023, improving the pass rate from 77% to 85%. To ensure interoperability, the work in this area will continue in 2024. Safari is proud to lead the pack, passing 99.7% of the tests. Improvements in other browsers will help ensure websites work correctly everywhere. The 2024 Investigation projects Interop 2024 also includes three investigation areas. These are “homework projects” for the Interop team to work on. All three this year are about writing and making it possible to run more tests — Accessibility Testing, Mobile Testing, and WebAssembly Testing. The Mobile Testing investigation project aims to complete the infrastructure needed at WPT to be able to test browsers on mobile operating systems, potentially to include those scores on the Interop project dashboard in the future. While two of the three investigations are projects continuing from last year, they all are starting 2024 at zero percent done. Each team involved will set new goals for this year, and the dashboard will report progress on those goals. Track the progress Keep up with the progress of Interop 2024 throughout the year, on the Interop 2024 dashboard. Our Commitment We continue to believe that interoperability is one of the fundamental pillars that makes the web such a success. Our efforts in Interop 2022 and 2023 demonstrate how deeply we care about the web. We are excited to again collaborate with our colleagues in seizing this opportunity help the web work better for everyone.",

CSS Nesting is a huge deal for example, since it's one of those features that kinda made SASS and LESS useful to begin with, and (like variables) was always better as a core CSS feature than a preprocessor one. Always super interested in seeing what can be done with custom properties too, since that feels like a lovely next step after things like Shadow DOM and custom elements. And popover is surprisingly neat too. The fact you can do these popup modals and things without any JavaScript now is super useful, and something that should finally stop developers wasting time with custom modals, dropdown menus, hamburger buttons, etc. But I do wish that forms got a bit more attention from projects like this. The current status of them (wildly inconsistent in different browsers for many HTML 5 era fields, reliant on proprietary pseudoclasses being styled for display purposes, things being difficult to customise in general) feels surprisingly archaic for a platform that can let you do seemingly anything. reply paulddraper 8 hours agoparentCSS nesting is the last reason I use a CSS preprocessor.* Once Safari 17.2+ gains more traction, I can use straight CSS :) --- *That, and variables for @media query. But that's a less common need. reply JimDabell 30 minutes agorootparentSafari has supported CSS nesting since 16.5. The only thing added in 17.2 is the ability to omit the & in some cases, which was a more recent change to the specification. reply andirk 12 hours agoparentprevUI designers that are allowed to roam free will often NOT want these new default modals, menus, buttons, etc. even if it was their jam pre-default. This will help, but consistency seems to be seen as a weakness in UI rather than a feature we should all strive for. reply ohrus 9 hours agorootparentConsistency of style in the general sense is what designers wish to avoid. Consistency of browser behaviour and default style, on the other hand, is the grail from which creativity can flourish unbounded on the web. reply jeffhuys 3 hours agorootparentprevIf you’d read the article, you’d have read that the new popover element allows CUSTOM elements, like designers love. Just without JS. reply andirk 2 hours agorootparentAgain, my point is that there will be requests for features that will still be beyond these new features such as needing Javascript. And again, these are great and useful advancements. For example, the `@starting-style` allows for a starting value, but if the UI requires that it's conditional, then that's likely JS. It's toward the end of the article. You may not have gotten to it. reply move-on-by 10 hours agoprevI only do some web stuff very casually, so I’m definitely not the target demographic.

I suppose it was disingenuous of me to say it’s not supported altogether, but I’ve yet to have an opportunity to use it due to the 1-color restriction. reply efields 9 hours agoparentprevSVGs don't scale the way you want them to. You can't make a (for example) 256px square image, even a vector, look good at 24px just by vector transforms. reply move-on-by 8 hours agorootparentI suppose that makes sense for a professional web dev- but it still feels like an arbitrary feature gap and is the first ‘speed bump’ in standing up a simple website for safari. Just because your pixel-perfect corp might rather have specific image renders for all screen sizes doesn’t really explain why I can’t put a SVG in there and call it a day. I can’t imagine my svg-to-png converter does a much better job of it. It’s all just a hassle. Again, happy to recognize I’m not a front end expert and not the target demographic. reply TheCoreh 9 hours agorootparentprevWith HiDPI/Retina displays, that 24px is actually 48px or 72px, so the need for pixel hinting is much less commonplace than it was 10 or 15 years ago. Also, nothing's really stopping most developers from just scaling it naively to those tiny sizes, in fact it's what commonly happens. I agree we should keep support for custom icons for each size, and it's probably a best practice, but shouldn't be a _requirement_ anymore. reply globular-toast 1 hour agorootparentHow many people have HiDPI displays? It seems to me apart from phones people mostly don't. reply DaiPlusPlus 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's a valid reason for non-Apple browsers to prefer or even require raster (non-SVG) image files, such as a 16x16 favicon for a 96dpi display device like a typical office desktop or low-end laptop. Whereas Safari only runs on macOS + iOS, which in-turn only runs on Apple hardware, and all Apple hardware today is going to run at ~140dpi or above - so pixel-perfect art just isn't required - and if someone plugs a (relatively) low-res TV into a Mac then the OS is going to downsample everything down anyway, and (most) users don't seem to care about that. reply runarberg 9 hours agorootparentprevSVGs support media queries.

Kind of baffling, considering it’s the first image format bringing solid improvements across the board in a very long time. I was hoping Interop might finally be what forces Google to stop effectively blocking its adoption, but apparently we’ll have to keep waiting as the half-baked replacements for the ubiquitous old formats keep piling on. reply no_wizard 11 hours agoparentI was also saddened by this. I don't know what Google's problem is with JPEG XL. reply paulddraper 8 hours agorootparentBecause AVIF is already a thing. And is comparable for images and superior for video. reply F3nd0 7 hours agorootparentAVIF hasn’t been around much longer than JXL, has it? Only a year or so. Since both of them are image formats, I assume that by ‘video’ you refer to animated images, in which case yes, AVIF (being based on an actual video codec) seems to perform better. Same with very low-quality pictures. For higher quality JPEG XL still seems to do better, and seems to do much better for lossless encoding. (AVIF struggles to even compete with WebP on that front, if I recall correctly.) Not to mention very useful features like progressive decoding, lossless JPEG recompression, or no practical limit on image size. Yes, AVIF is a thing, but why? Is it worth missing out on an actual full-fledged replacement by refitting yet another video codec into an image one in a rush? That’s just like acting before thinking and then going on to say “oh well, what’s done is done”. And perhaps there’s nothing we can do about it, but it’s still irritating. reply paulddraper 6 hours agorootparent> AVIF hasn’t been around much longer than JXL, has it? Only a year or so. For better or worse, it has much higher adoption. JPEG XL is supported by Safari, and.....well no that's it. reply zokier 48 minutes agorootparentOn web. Outside web the situation is more complex. iirc many camera manufacturers push HEIC, some editing software prefer JXL, and AVIF is kinda around too. reply watersb 7 hours agorootparentprevI could imagine hardware vendors telling the software platform creators to standardize on an image codec.

Old example, my iPad3 was working perfectly fine as a casual web browser until the day iOS updates stopped just as javascript ES6 spread around the web.

Google has more of a \"Ready! Fire! Aim! Fire again!\" approach and is more readily amenable to releasing implementations of unfinished specs, where Apple has more of a \"Ready! Aim! Aim! Fire!\" approach and is generally reluctant to do that. (I can't speak for Firefox.) reply bemusedthrow75 2 hours agorootparentThere's definitely a late adopter/early adopter divide here. I have found myself wondering what good examples there are of successful (Ready Fire Aim) early-draft-standard adoption on the web. CSS in early Internet Explorer is one of them -- that was a choice that ended a ridiculous, unworkable not-invented-here adventure at Netscape. But on the flip side, I am reminded of (Google) Gears, which was promoted as a solution but was really only a technology demonstrator for the idea that ultimately surfaced as Web Workers. reply JimDabell 2 hours agorootparentI wouldn’t use CSS in early Internet Explorer as a good example. There were quite a few cases where they shipped something prematurely based off an early draft, then the final spec. changed, making Internet Explorer incompatible with the standards and other browsers. That’s how the box model ended up the way that it did, for example. The draft was originally border-box behaviour, Internet Explorer implemented it too soon, then the specification changed to content-box behaviour and all the other browsers implemented it. reply bemusedthrow75 28 minutes agorootparentYes. But bad box model is nothing -- absolutely nothing -- compared to where we would be if JSSS had become a de facto standard. It was a total mess, and an arrogant one at that. reply CharlesW 15 hours agoprevI got a lot more excited reading this than I thought I would. Why do we think there isn't a PWA focus area from the participating consortium? reply culi 14 hours agoparentHistorically interop seems to have been focused more on CSS, but that's changed more and more. Even still many of the test areas include tests for workers, ensuring that the state of PWAs will also improve. And in 2023 they had an entire Modules section which heavily tested PWA/worker-specific functionality. Additionally, many of the APIs tested and investigated like OffscreenCanvas and mobile testing are very relevant to many PWA applications. This year, like the year before, is the least CSS-centric interop. With sections for IndexedDB (which I've only ever seen relied on by PWAs) and Websockets and important accessibility improvements. And the 3 investigation areas (WebAssembly, Accessibility, and Mobile testing) are all very relevant to PWAs. What (other?) specific APIs are you interested in them focusing on? reply CharlesW 14 hours agorootparent> What (other?) specific APIs are you interested in them focusing on? If a future Interop were to do this, I'd assume they'd define something like \"profiles\" of PWA capabilities (e.g. \"Minimal\" and \"Extended\") using lists like the ones at https://web.dev/learn/pwa/capabilities and https://whatpwacando.today/ for inspiration. reply JimDabell 8 minutes agorootparentBoth of those websites include APIs that were implemented unilaterally by Google, while both Mozilla and Apple rejected them – mostly on privacy and security grounds. They aren’t a part of the web platform and aren’t on any standards track, they are Google APIs. reply yurishimo 15 hours agoparentprevFrom what I remember, the consortium is maybe a dozen people? And these people also work for the browsers. The goal is to come together and find features that they all can work on or improve over a year, taking into account current roadmaps and workloads. Think of interop like the small extra tickets you can work on in between the main feature development at your day job. Right now the focus has been very low level details about how browsers render content. These are the biggest areas for improvement as the JavaScript APIs are largely standardized and merged in from “upstream”. I suspect we will continue to see more work done to patch holes between browsers, before we see a push to simultaneously implement new features across all engines at once. That said, with Apple finally adding webpush to mobile Safari, we’re getting a lot closer to covering the needs of the vast majority of web apps that would benefit from PWA features.

The popover support is nice, and I like the new CSS stuff, and focus on making Pointer Events and Mouse Events more consistent is a big win, however - Most (all?) of these was work that was being done by the Safari team to support anyway - There is no explanation about why these were chosen over other items - They're still refusing to look at what developers have been clamoring for and I know most of these things are not on the top of the list of every day developers. Things like the Origin Private FileSystem, Trusted Types, URLPattern, Import Assertions, JSON Module scripts and a host of other things that would really benefit day to day developers in greater numbers are completely ignored I feel like Interop is a superficial thing, because these are all things that were going to be implemented anyway and aren't the things that developers have been pounding the door over for years prior (except maybe the CSS nesting stuff, lots of people want to ditch sass and that was one of the last things keeping it around for alot of people) Overall while I appreciate these features, I'm not terribly impressed, it doesn't really solve my day to day concerns in any meaningful way, sans the `popover` attribute (which will take time to roll out across the industry anyway, regardless of browser support). As much as I hate the chromium engine monopoly, Apple resists standards with little explanation way too often, and doesn't bother introducing alternatives when they do. reply chrismorgan 13 hours agoparent> Origin Private FileSystem Safari’s had that for more than two years. (Chromium, more than three, Firefox, almost one.) > Import Assertions An excellent example of why Firefox and Safari tend to be more reserved in what they ship, in contrast to Chromium which is much more fond of shipping immature stuff. Import assertions are dead, superseded by import attributes. V8 has deprecated import assertions and will remove them soon. See https://v8.dev/features/import-assertions for more info on why. Chromium shipping immature stuff is, from time to time, a real pain, because it makes it harder to fix problems in the spec as you sometimes have to avoid breaking real usage. Sometimes this basically makes things worse forever, because of naming things. I can’t remember a specific case in browsers, but know they exist; but a similar case is how we have some methods named includes instead of contains like they should have been because of Mootools touching stuff it shouldn’t have, and so now everyone suffers for that mistake. reply da_chicken 12 hours agorootparentI believe you meant to link this: https://v8.dev/features/import-attributes That page actually explains the change: > V8 shipped the import assertions feature in v9.1. This feature allowed module import statements to include additional information by using the assert keyword. This additional information is currently used to import JSON and CSS modules inside JavaScript modules. > Since then, import assertions has evolved into import attributes. The point of the feature remains the same: to allow module import statements to include additional information. > The most important difference is that import assertions had assert-only semantics, while import attributes has more relaxed semantics. Assert-only semantics means that the additional information has no effect on how a module is loaded, only on whether it is loaded.

Is the Origin Private FileSystem permanent on Safari? Apple released an update a few years ago the cleared the contents of localStorage and indexeddb for an origin if the user hadn't visited in 14 days. This makes it hard for purely offline PWAs to store data offline. e.g. I wrote an offline only exercise tracker PWA (akin to \"Strong\" on Android) that used indexeddb to keep records and required no account. The 14 day policy makes it basically DOA for iOS clients. Is the OPFS a viable alternative? reply streptomycin 11 hours agorootparentLast I looked into it, it's not permanent in any browser. If you're low on disk space, stuff will get deleted. https://twitter.com/tomayac/status/1613605318407094275 It kind of makes sense, given the constraints the browser devs have given themselves. Since there's no way for users to see/manage these OPFS files directly, there is no good alternative except automatically deleting stuff if disk space is low. What would really be nice would be if we could just create normal files and let users control them, but that doesn't seem to be in the cards. And it sucks. The #1 question I get for my PWA is \"how do I stop it from sometimes deleting all my data?\" and there's really no good answer. reply lioeters 9 hours agorootparent> no good alternative except automatically deleting stuff if disk space is low The good alternative is to use navigator.storage.persist(), which requests the user for permission to use persistent storage.

This is another instance where Apple threw up their rails, and Firefox also seized the opportunity to throw up some rails. I don't think all their concerns were justified because you can control with very fine permissions what is and isn't exposed to the browser, which was the main source of contention. No alternative was presented. I believe this can be done in a privacy friendly way (the main stay of the objections). These are smart engineers, some of the best and the brightest, who supposedly are good at solving thorny problems. Simply, I think Apple didn't want to do it because it was remotely threatening to their iOS App Store and I wonder if some kind of anti-trust litigation may eventually expose their leadership around webkit like this.

Because for every one PWA app there are dozens of websites who would use the local storage to store re-targeting metadata for advertising.

Should PWA installation be more obvious/straightforward than it is currently? Sure, but that’s a separate issue. reply no_wizard 9 hours agorootparentprevThere are ways to make sure that doesn’t happen, like making sure only the origin the file was written from can open and see the files.

I'd like to remove that server requirement, for a multitude of reasons, and be able to have read / write permissions to a sandbox directory that lets me do just that.

Your comment would be 100% true 3 years ago, but today is basically completely incorrect. A sibling comments corrects some of it, but needless to say the endless FUD around this is bad. Safari is an incredible browser - standards wise - but also way faster and more efficient than Chrome.

My point still stands on interop though: They aren't picking anything where the interop is divergent and tricky for developers to navigate, and most of this was on their roadmap as going to implement soon anyway. They aren't tackling any thorny issues like OPFS, which is where developers want them to figure out interoperability for consistency because it moves the entire platform forward in big meaningful ways (for instance, makes PWAs more potent alternatives to native apps) I applaud their CSS and HTML work though, that's been nice to see. reply om2 5 hours agorootparentSafari has supported OPFS for some time. But Interop isn’t mainly a “please implement this” list, it’s a list of priority areas for browsers to become consistent with each other and with standards.

Which is why Google who is fully supportive of this has no issues adding it in without any thought to privacy. reply no_wizard 7 hours agorootparentFilesystem persistence removes a whole host of complexities from applications For instance, I would no longer have to store files on a server, I could simply save them locally for the user, which makes it easier for them to have portable files, use it with other apps etc. It also reduces the startup cost of some apps. If for instance I wanted to make a photo editing app, its going to be cheaper to store edited photos back onto the users device, than it is for me to upload them to a server and store them, especially over time. It removes alot of developer overhead and it has benefits for the user (IE, the files are more portable, since they're on your machine, not someone elses). Currently we are perpetually stuck with having to re-create virtual representations of file systems and they aren't the same thing, not by a long shot. reply mardifoufs 6 hours agorootparentBut it also makes tracking much easier, right? reply no_wizard 4 hours agorootparentNot by default. It’s not inherent to it at all.

It's only going to be over the next few years as QLED/MicroLed/etc... displays get cheap enough to be commercially viable that the color functions (relative color possibly excluded) will start to become useful.

Totally false. In Apple's blog post \"Wide Gamut Color in CSS with Display-P3\" (posted March 2, 2020), Apple includes the fact that non-Apple devices shipped with wide gamut displays: - Google Pixel 2 XL - Google Pixel 3 - HTC U11+ - OnePlus 6 They even provided a Wikipedia link [2] that links to an article with addition devices. The hardware wasn't the issue; Chrome and the other browsers that ran on Android back then didn't support wide gamut displays. That's not Apple's fault; they were going out of their way to promote wide gamut/Display P3 as something good for the web. Finally, Safari/WebKit has wide gamut support starting in 2016 [3] by implementing web standards that Google, Mozilla, etc. have access to.

You are free to make criticisms of Scorpion (including if any part of the document is unclear, or if you think some part is good or is not good), too. Actually, the repository there also does include a few other things; the \"astroget\" program (similar than curl) implements Scorpion protocol and also implements Gemini, Gopher, Spartan, NNTP, and HTTP (deliberately not implementing cookies and many other features of HTTP; if you need those features then you can use curl instead, anyways). reply lapcat 15 hours agoprev> Scrollbar Styling I wish that this \"feature\" didn't exist. Just follow the platform and the user's defaults. reply toddmorey 14 hours agoparentYeah so interesting that with 96 focus areas proposed, scrollbar styling made it to the final set of 16. Would be curious to know what 80 things were deemed less important than dinking with how scrollbars look. Maybe it was just an easier area to create a win? Maybe there are some benefits of styling a scrollbar that I'm not thinking about? Something that makes it a little easier to emulate native OS behaviors with web technologies, perhaps?

This is a professional app with a complex dense UI, similar to ones used by image editors, music production software, 3d modelers. All of these use non-native controls, since native ones are too \"wasteful\" reply runarberg 13 hours agorootparentprevGood UX demands the correct distribution of visual weight. If a design requires many scrollbars, and those scrollbars have static styles, than those scrollbars dictate the visual weight of the rest of the app. This can make it impossible to design a nice intuitive UI around. So vital can definitely be an appropriate description for certain UIs reply esafak 11 hours agorootparentprevDo you mind sharing the identity of the app? I am curious to see how/what you customized. reply madeofpalk 10 hours agoparentprevThe new scrollbar styling properties are actually pretty consistent with native platforms. There's not that much flexibility with them - e.g. you can't define width in pixels, you just chose between thick, thin, or none, which match the existing native controls: https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/133#iss... > To add more information to this issue. This property supports three values, auto, thin and none. These match nicely to WebKit's ScrollbarControlSize::Regular and ScrollbarControlSize::Thin and not rendering the scrollbar. reply promiseofbeans 13 hours agoparentprevThis is the compromise - allow the scrollbar to be styled and in exchange developers don't implement their own scrollbars in javascript (as demanded by designers/managers) reply eviks 4 hours agoparentprevThen the platforms should allow plenty of styling, the current \"just\" is just bad reply ijhuygft776 10 hours agoparentprevI hate the default Firefox scrollbar width...

One thing is that some implementations of form fields will not work at all with CSS disabled. One alternative would be a mode to use ARIA for styling instead of CSS. If the web page uses ARIA to denote the custom form fields and other stuff, then this might work; however, I do not know of any implementation that is capable of using ARIA for such a purpose (usually they use ARIA only for people with disabilities, but it could be useful for anyone, I think). reply troupo 13 hours agorootparentprevYes, yes I definitely would apply this to others.

As a bigger example: almost every single CSS framework decides that color and contrast are for suckers and makes many controls (and especially text inputs) with barely visible gray-on-gray colors. reply runarberg 14 hours agoparentprevIf it wasn’t fore scrollbar styling, developers would just roll their own. And even if developers would be aware of how terrible it is, designers would still design it, and project managers would still demand it. Even native scrolling is not without issues. If you have horizontal scrolling on a flex container with `flex-direction: row-reverse` the native scrollbar won’t work in Safari. So developers implementing a list which flows from the inline end to the start, are faced with two bad options. Either implement your custom scrollbar or reverse your list items before rendering to the page and set the scroll position everytime the list updates in JavaScript. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=221347#c12 reply jakub_g 14 hours agorootparentThis. \"How difficult would it be to write a custom implementation of scrollbar in JavaScript?\" (whose performance would be 100x slower than native browser scrolling, but who cares, we all have Macbook Pros, right?) reply Spivak 14 hours agoparentprevThat ship has long since sailed. The web is the preferred framework for creating \"non-native\" (maybe nomadic? colonizer? invasive?) apps that largely ignore their host platform in favor of being the same everywhere. For better and worse this is what developers and designers have always wanted out of portability. reply mostlylurks 14 hours agorootparentIt's also what I, as a user, want. I don't want some middle-man corporate \"platform\" (of which there are very few to actually select from to suit your personal tastes) inserting their vision of what UIs should look like into interactions between me and the service I'm connecting to. I want my platform to be as invisible as possible and interchangeable with other platforms. The more things stay the same when switching between platforms, the better. reply AlexandrB 13 hours agorootparentI want the complete opposite. Most 3rd party developers absolutely suck at UX compared to Apple or even Microsoft. Look at this HP monstrosity, for example: https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/07LJBKFE51UG5cHJPEojwn9...

Apple launched SwiftUI fairly recently and it seems to be being developed at a fairly fast pace. reply zzo38computer 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is a rather bad way of making portability. It is bad for accessibility (even though they tried to add things to improve accessibility, it does not work very well), for working on multiple types of computers (since, then the software specific to that computer cannot do so by itself, and instead needs to use the specification of the received file, which is probably wrong anyways), and for many types of features that may be helpful but that are unavailable or are not designed or implemented well. Furthermore, WWW is also, not work well with multiple programs and with user customization very well, pipes, etc. And, it is complicated to implement and does not run efficiently. And, there are many security issues, having to be made more complicated just to avoid some of them, in ways that would not be necessary if it were designed properly. And, anyways, it cannot be the same everywhere, even if they want it to be. reply jakub_g 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is mostly a question of costs & availability of developers. There's simply not enough native developers on the market, and the good ones can ask very high salaries. Hiring N teams of M developers for N native apps, compared to hiring K maybe nomadic? colonizer? invasive? Blinkenlights output forever! Or seriously, working on software ecosystem preservation just to preserve it it is absurd. Things get replaced because people want, and at this point you are just trying to force people to use things they against their wishes. reply lloydatkinson 14 hours agoparentprevThe most offensive part is that the width is configurable. This gives try-hard designers more of an excuse to hijack and fuck up scrollbars. The colours I don’t mind so much. Ideally all this would be a simple checkbox to toggle on right click of the scrollbar, but that gives the user choice which is almost a foreign concept in some circles. reply simion314 14 hours agoparentprevI would agree but only for the main page scrollbar, but you can have app widgets like dropdowons, listboxes, grids that need to customize it's look like in PRO GUI toolkits. reply carlosjobim 14 hours agoparentprevHow I wish for minimap scrollbars in all applications... reply ghaff 15 hours agoprev [–] Although appropriate enough, Interop is still a somewhat odd choice of name.

    "originLink": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-sleep-apnea-philips-recall-cpap/",
    "originBody": "MoneyWatch FDA says 561 deaths tied to recalled Philips sleep apnea machines By Kate Gibson Edited By Anne Marie Lee Updated on: February 1, 2024 / 11:36 AM EST / CBS News The Food and Drug Administration says 561 deaths have been reported in connection to recalled Philips devices to treat obstructive sleep apnea and other breathing disorders. The FDA said that since April 2021 it has received more than 116,000 medical device reports of foam breaking down in Philips CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines and BiPAP sleep therapy devices. That includes 561 reports of death, the agency said Wednesday. The Dutch medical device maker has recalled millions of the breathing machines amid reports they were blowing gas and pieces of foam into the airways of those using the devices. The grim tally comes days after Philips said it would stop selling the machines in the U.S. in a settlement with the FDA and the Justice Department expected to cost roughly $400 million, the company disclosed in a regulatory filing. Philips reaches $479 million settlement over CPAP machine recall 00:23 The tentative agreement, which must be approved by a U.S. court, calls for the company to keep servicing apnea machines already being used while stopping to sell new ones until specific conditions are met. After an initial recall announced in June of 2021, Philips attempted to fix some of the more than 5 million recalled devices, but the repaired ones were ultimately recalled as well. Philips in late 2023 agreed to pay at least $479 million to compensate users of 20 different breathing devices and ventilators sold in the U.S. between 2008 and 2021. Claims for financial losses related to the purchase, lease or rent of the recalled machines can be now be lodged in the wake of a proposed class-action settlement reached in September. Claims for financial losses related to the purchase, lease or rent of the recalled devices can be made, with eligible users entitled to: a Device Payment Award for each recalled device purchased, leased or rented; a Device Return Award of $100 for each recalled device returned by Aug. 9, 2024; and/or a Device Replacement Award for money spent to buy a comparable machine on or after June 14, 2021 and before Sept. 7, 2023 to replace a recalled device. How to file a claim To determine whether one is eligible and for instructions on what steps, if any, are needed to receive a payment, the settlement administrator has set up in interactive website here. Users can look up their recalled device's serial number to see what device payment award they may be entitled to by clicking here. Those who return a recalled Philips machine by the August deadline are entitled to both the return and payment awards without having to submit a claim form and can use prepaid shipping labels by clicking here at no cost. Those who spent their own money buying a comparable replacement CPAP or ventilator to replace a recalled device will need to complete a device replacement claim form, which can be found here. A paper device replacement form can also be found here or by calling 1-855-912-3432. The deadline for claim submissions is Aug. 9, 2024. The settlement does not impact or release any claims for personal injuries or medical monitoring relief, according to the administrator with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Roughly 30 million people have sleep apnea, a disorder in which one's airways become blocked during rest, interrupting breathing, according to 2022 data from the American Medical Association. The company investigated all complaints and allegations of malfunction and serious injury of death, and \"has found no conclusive data linking these devices and the deaths reported, Philips told CBS MoneyWatch on Thursday.

The stories of people who relied on their CPAP caught up in it were heartbreaking and nerve wracking. Edit: I used a combination of the Snore Gym app and Vik Veer's videos on Youtube. After a couple months my snoring became barely audible, but it doesn't always work for everyone. I was tilting my head down at night which blocked off my throat somewhat, so I lifted my head up higher with a bigger pillow. reply alliao 14 minutes agoparentI've always wondered whether strong singer would snore... they got to have pretty decent control as well as well exercised muscles in that area reply tommica 1 hour agoparentprevI had a coworker that himself is getting a jaw surgery because his bone structure would sometimes make him stop breathing while sleeping for short moments. His brother apparently was a horrible snorer, but that was due to his nose, that the \"skin\" would collapse inwards when he took a sharp breath through his nose, instead of expanding. Apparently just having some kind of tape on his nose to stop that from happening while sleeping made a huge difference. reply baq 45 minutes agorootparentholy shit I'm the brother except I'm an only child. need to try out the tape reply dkbrk 32 minutes agorootparentYou may also want to check out \"Max-Air Nose Cones\". reply diob 3 hours agoparentprevAs someone with apnea due to my anatomy (and AHI of 79 at that), I'm jealous.

E.g. occlusion issues with the teeth, where the jaw is unable to land and find a comfortable-relaxed position - and so jaw/head muscles continue to engage, spasm, or guard completely - causing a potential systematic cascading failure that has a \"ridiculous\" amount of severe symptoms possible, and why it's ridiculous - is that you'd think this would be part of mainstream dentistry practices because of how foundational the bite position is, yet it's not mainstream; the first diagnostic is using a device called BioPak, hooked up to the head/face at different position with electrodes, it monitors muscle activity - and can tell which specific muscles are firing-resting and at what rate. They also use TENS as part of their protocol. It took me 8 years to stumble upon finding the practice-protocol for a problem I figured I had but couldn't find dentists to solve for it. reply nurettin 4 hours agoparentprevI did none of that.

A complete failure of the QMS. I know the FDA wants/needs to keep Philips around to manage the recall, and like... people with CPAPs need them, but I really wish they would just terminate all of Philips' licenses/approvals/clearances right now. I hope the DOJ has bigger penalties to lay down. FDA's post market surveillance relies on manufacturers to be sufficiently honest. Philips sat on thousands of reports for over a decade. This is simply unacceptable. For the FDA to be able to say with a straight face that their post market surveillance has value, they need stronger assurances that manufactures will play by the rules, and I feel that means really making an example of Philips here. I've worked in medical devices before, and I am quite aware of how easily QMS and SOP can diffuse responsibility. It's so easy as a line worker/line manager/middle manager to shrug and go \"well, I did my role as prescribed by QMS and SOP - it's not my problem that we're sitting on 10k medical device reports that we should be notifying the FDA about\". And that's a huge problem. Obviously upper management has the most blame here, but no one involved is blameless. The QMS has some boilerplate about how everyone is responsible for quality. If that's true, then everyone involved is also responsible in some part. I know terminating all of Philips' licenses for like 5 years or something will basically make a lot of people jobless. But like 500 people died because some assholes decided to go for the $$$, and everyone else involved let it happen. That's not an acceptable corporate standard. reply gurchik 4 hours agorootparentThe FDA is preventing Philips from selling any sleep apnea devices in the US for a few years until some unspecified manufacturing quality control problem is fixed. This is interesting because the new devices don’t use the same foam and don’t have this defect. I’m unsure if this ban affects ventilators which were also affected by the foam defect. Still, according to the ProPublica reporting Philips already made bank the last few years. They’re also trying to limit damages by putting all blame on the US subsidiary. reply KennyBlanken 2 hours agorootparentUnspecified? What the fuck. There is no reason Phillips should enjoy any sort confidentiality here. Not before, and especially not now. reply steve1977 2 hours agorootparentprev> But like 500 people died because some assholes decided to go for the $$$ 500 people died so far and that we know of. So yeah, fully agree with your points. reply throwaway290 1 hour agorootparentThe title says 561 right now. reply sand500 6 hours agoprevThe article doesn't explain how these machines caused the deaths but the FDA announcement hints to it > A wide range of injuries has been reported in these MDRs, including cancer, pneumonia, asthma, other respiratory problems, infection, headache, cough, dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dizziness, nodules, and chest pain. reply wkat4242 6 hours agoparentYeah the reason for the recall is the foam inside disintegrating and being blown into the lungs. I have two affected machines (one for each place I regularly sleep, I bought two so I didn't have to keep dragging them around). One of them is so bad that if I let it blow through a facemask for a day, the inside is all black. The air also smells really awful, like plastic fumes. Strange enough the other one which I use a lot more regularly fares a lot better. Unfortunately Philips still didn't bother replacing mine. They are an awful company to deal with. I registered them over 2 years ago. Only last September I got an email back asking me to confirm some details. Since then again nothing. They don't even bother replying to requests for a timeline. I still use the other machine regularly but it's also starting to taint masks when I test it with them. The local health service (I'm in Europe) lent me another brand but I really need these replaced. The disregard for their customers' lives is really appalling. Not surprised people have actually died. I paid big money for them too, 800 and 600 euro roughly (one of them is a full auto, the other isn't). A lot of money for what is basically a pressure fan in a box. reply Kerbonut 6 hours agorootparentGo to their secured email and email the documents including a current prescription for the appropriate machine (bipap vs autosv vs cpap etc). They have a call back number in the secure email, give them a call if needed. I got mine replaced after a lot of frustration but it was worth it. reply wkat4242 5 hours agorootparentI don't have a current prescription because the loaner machine was given to me instead. I did have one when I ordered the original of course. Though I lived in a different country back then. But I can probably get a new prescription. Where do you find this secure email? I don't know what you mean, I only have the email address they emailed me from. Maybe that secure email is a US thing? reply quasarj 6 hours agorootparentprevYou're still using it?! reply tombert 5 hours agorootparentNot the OP, and I don't use a CPAP, but just living with sleep apnea is kind of horrible, and not harmless. It might be genuinely worth the small risks associated with the affected machines if the alternative is having to go back to untreated apnea. reply jupp0r 3 hours agorootparentI understand that some people can't afford to buy a machine on their own, but damn that would be $700 I'd totally spend. Buying a different brand in the US is super easy. reply wkat4242 2 hours agorootparentThe problem is that I moved countries in the meantime and here it's not quite so easy buying one on your own :( reply slowmotiony 1 hour agorootparentYou should have a look at your local craigslist alternative (like OLX in europe) or facebook marketplace. Lots of people sell their CPAP machines. reply wkat4242 5 hours agorootparentprevYeah of course. Especially while I didn't have an alternative yet. I have this machine for a reason and untreated sleep apnea is also dangerous long term. It's also very hard to live while sleeping so badly. I'm not using the bad one though. The one that smells and blackens face masks. Only the other one. I regularly let it blow into a mask for a day to verify. reply tombert 5 hours agorootparentHave you considered the oral appliances? They don't work if your apnea is really severe but they're pretty awesome if it works for you. reply wkat4242 5 hours agorootparentI tried one before I had the machine but it gave me really painful teeth and didn't help enough. I used to wake up with really painful teeth and I also felt them starting to misalign. Like they were pushing my teeth around like braces. reply TheCapeGreek 4 hours agorootparentYeah, oral appliances don't fix the actual problem: tongue slacking into the back of the throat. It's the same reason a chin strap will just make you choke. Supposedly you can \"train\" your tongue to stay in position with tongue & jaw exercises, but I saw no effect. reply euroderf 4 hours agorootparentOral appliance worked for me.

But I don't know how long I'll have the loaner for and I want safe machines (that I paid a lot of money for) so I don't constantly have to drag it from place to place.

Formaldehyde was mentioned in some of the reporting. reply runsWphotons 22 minutes agoprevHow do they determine when one of these machines caused a death? reply jader201 2 hours agoprevCould something like this cause IPF? My father passed away a few years ago, after being diagnosed with IPF only about 1-1.5 years before passing. He had no past of being exposed to anything hazardous. His pulmonologist couldn’t ever figure out what could’ve caused it. He was diagnosed with sleep apnea probably 15 or so years before passing, and used a CPAP nightly. He eventually developed a nasty cough that never went away, and was finally diagnosed with IPF. I’m not looking for any sort of retribution, more just possible answers or even just clues, since it’s not clear whether it was related to anything hereditary (I have 3 siblings). And to be clear, I’m not even sure what brand/model he used (though my mom would likely know). So there’s a decent chance it’s unrelated. reply pyuser583 4 hours agoprevI was directly affected by this. The recall was handled by a third party company, with a third party domain. All communications came from the third party domain. I was unable to communicate with anyone from the manufacturers domain. So I had to respond to emails from shadysounding.com and give my info to phone numbers on www.shadysounding.com. I’m glad the recall list wasn’t leaked. Otherwise there would be tons of ID theft. reply tombert 5 hours agoprevI was recently diagnosed with sleep apnea. I'm on the very lower end of \"moderate\" (about 16 interruptions per hour), which fortunately means that the oral appliances are effective. I've been suspicious of myself having sleep apnea for quite awhile now, and I held off on getting an official diagnosis in no small part because those CPAP machines give me anxiety; I'm somewhat convinced that I would never really get used to them, and I would wake up feeling like a head crab was attacking me. I had also heard some horror stories (not dissimilar to the Phillips machines) that really held me off. I'm very grateful that the oral appliances exists, now even more so. reply tapoxi 5 hours agoparentI was recently diagnosed with severe OSA and I'm using a Resmed machine. I actually adapted to it immediately and I find the mask I'm using (Fisher and Paykel) to be comfortable. Incredible life changer.

This machine delivers air at a positive pressure to force it through patients airways. The manufacturer used polyurethane foam instead of silicon foam. Moisture can make this foam break down. The device is likely to accumulate moisture due to it's purpose.

For many things there is no \"safe\" level, eg. airborne PM2.5 pollution or lead. What you say is a bit of a common sense rule of thumb usually used for stuff we digest and poop out. So that may rule out microplastics, which was shown to cross into tissue (including lungs) which means it would accumulate. And definitely nanoplastic, as those enter even individual cells and screw up their mechanics. I wouldn't be surprised if in a few years we would consider no safe level of micro/nanoplastic exposure. Maybe we would already if not for the interests of manufacturers and oil industry. reply tomtheelder 5 hours agoparentprevI think there’s plenty of reason to be concerned about microplastics, but not necessarily. There are plenty of fine particulates that you could eat to no ill effect which are very harmful if inhaled. reply throwup238 5 hours agoparentprevAlmost any particulate matter that you can breathe in is a concern but microplastics are mostly ingested. reply gurchik 4 hours agoprevI was reading the original source yesterday and it said 385.

FDA does not provide evidence that they will provide better controls or improved safety, just that there were very minor reports from LDTs. CPAP machines were reclassified to class II devices in 2018, which requires that companies perform QMS and tell the FDA, and sometimes get audited. LDTs require Lab Directors to take responsibility for the quality of a test at the risk of their license. Auditing is performed by professional societies, to high level. Public health labs and hospitals are furious about the extra, unnecessary paperwork that FDA taking this action would cause, for no apparent benefit. The FDA allowing more than 500 deaths to happen is a massive indictment of their quality of auditing, and should signal that if they take over LDT regulation, more lives will be at risk. reply apexalpha 2 hours agoprevAs someone from the Netherlands, the mismanagement at Philips has been almost physically painful to witness.

    "originBody": "Bard Bard’s latest updates: Access Gemini Pro globally and generate images Feb 01, 2024 4 min read Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Mail Copy link Starting today, you can generate images in Bard in most countries, and use Gemini Pro in any language, country and territory Bard currently supports. Jack Krawczyk Product Lead, Bard Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Mail Copy link Today, we’re bringing Bard’s latest capabilities — including Gemini Pro in Bard — to more languages and places. Plus, we’re introducing image generation to help more of your ideas come to life. Use Gemini Pro in all supported languages and places Last December, we brought Gemini Pro into Bard in English, giving Bard more advanced understanding, reasoning, summarizing and coding abilities. Today Gemini Pro in Bard will be available in over 40 languages and more than 230 countries and territories, so more people can collaborate with this faster, more capable version of Bard. The Large Model Systems Organization, a leading evaluator of language models and chatbots across languages, recently shared that Bard with Gemini Pro is one of the most preferred chatbots available (with or without cost), noting that it has made a “stunning leap” forward. And blind evaluations with our third-party raters identified Bard with Gemini Pro as one of the top-performing conversational AIs, compared to leading free and paid alternatives. Double-check your responses in more languages Since we know people want the ability to corroborate Bard’s responses, we’re also expanding our double-check feature, which is already used by millions of people in English, to more than 40 languages. When you click on the “G” icon, Bard will evaluate whether there is content across the web to substantiate its response. If it can be evaluated, you can click the highlighted phrases and learn more about supporting or contradicting information found by Search. Bring your ideas to life with image generation For an extra creative boost, you can now generate images in Bard in English in most countries around the world, at no cost. This new capability is powered by our updated Imagen 2 model, which is designed to balance quality and speed, delivering high-quality, photorealistic outputs. Just type in a description — like “create an image of a dog riding a surfboard” — and Bard will generate custom, wide-ranging visuals to help bring your idea to life. Consistent with our AI Principles, image generation was designed with responsibility in mind. For instance, to ensure there’s a clear distinction between visuals created with Bard and original human artwork, Bard uses SynthID to embed digitally identifiable watermarks into the pixels of generated images. Prompt: “Generate a realistic photo of a person looking off camera during sunset. Portrait mode so the background is faded.” Prompt: “Generate a collage art, with photorealistic images of oceans and plants with muted colors and 3D shading, that’s mixed media.” Prompt: “Write a social media post and generate a mouthwatering image that I can use for a buffalo wing festival.” 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Our technical guardrails and investments in the safety of training data seek to limit violent, offensive or sexually explicit content. Additionally, we apply filters designed to avoid the generation of images of named people. We’ll continue investing in new techniques to improve the safety and privacy protections of our models. These updates make Bard an even more helpful and globally accessible AI collaborator for everything from big, creative projects to smaller, everyday tasks. Try it out today at bard.google.com.

It pains me to say this but it appears that bard/gemini is extraordinarily overhyped. Oddly it has seemed to get even worse at straightforward coding tasks that GPT-4 manages to grok and complete effortlessly. The other day I asked bard to do some of these things and it responded with a long checklist of additional spec/reqiurement information it needed from me, when I had already concisely and clearly expressed the problem and addressed most of the items in my initial request. It was hard to say if it was behaving more like a clerk in a bureaucratic system or an employee that was on strike. At first I thought the underperformance of bard/gemini was due to Google trying to shoehorn search data into the workflow in some kind of effort to keep search relevant (much like the crippling MS did to GPT-4 in it's bingified version) but now I have doubts that Google is capable of competing with OpenAI. reply gundmc 15 hours agoparentI don't think Google has released the version of Gemini that is supposed to compete with GPT4 yet. The current version is apparently more on the level of GPT 3.5, so your observations don't surprise me reply CSMastermind 14 hours agorootparentI will say as someone who tries to regularly evaluate all the models Google's censorship is much worse than other companies. I routinely get \"I can't do that\" messages from Bard and no one else when testing queries. As an example, I had a photo of a beach I wanted to see if it knew the location of and it was blocked for inappropriate content. I stared at the picture for like 5 minutes confused until I blacked out the woman in a bikini standing on the beach and resubmitted the query at which point it processed it. It's refused to do translation for me because the text contains 'rude language'. It's blocked my requests on copyright grounds. I don't at all understand the heavy-handed censorship they're applying when they're behind in the market. reply nuclearnice3 14 hours agorootparentIt won't surprise me if the photo or similar ends up banning your entire Google life with no reasonable appeal possible. reply jonplackett 14 hours agorootparentprevI just tried to get it to write me some code that queries an API and it refused.

Yes. And I don't buy the lmsys leaderboard results where Google somehow shoved a mysterious gemini-pro model to be better than GPT-4. In my experience, its answers looked very much like GPT-4 (even the choice of words) so it could be that Bard was finetuned on GPT-4 data. Shady business when Google's Bard service is miles behind GPT-4. reply resters 15 hours agorootparentTrue, what is most puzzling about it is the effort Google is putting into generating hype for something that is at best months away (by which time OpenAI will likely have released a better model)... My best guess is that Google realizes that something like GPT-4 is a far superior interface to interact with the world's information than search, and since most of Google's revenue comes from search, the handwriting is on the wall that Google's profitability will be completely destroyed in a few years once the world catches on. MS seeems to have had that same paranoia with the bingified GPT-4. What I found most remarkable about it was how much worse it performed seemingly because it was incorporating the top n bing results into the interaction. Obviously there are a lot of refinements to how a RAG or similar workflow might actually generate helpful queries and inform the AI behind the scenes with relevant high quality context. I think GPT-4 probably does this to some extent today. So what is remarkable is how far behind Google (and even MS via it's bingified version) are from what OpenAI has already available for $20 per month. Google started out free of spammy ads and has increasingly become more and more like the kind of ads everywhere in your face, spammy stuff that it replaced. GPT-4 is such a refreshingly simple and to the point way to interact with information. This is antithetical to what funds Google's current massive business... namely ads that distract from what the user wanted in hopes of inspiring a transaction that can be linked to the ad via a massive surveillance network and behavioral profiling model. I would not be surprised if within Google the product vision for the ultimate AI assistant is one that gently mentions various products and services as part of every interaction. reply fatherzine 11 hours agorootparentthe search business has always been caught between delivering simple and to the point results to users and skewing results to generate return on investment to advertisers. in its early years google was also refreshingly simple and to the point. the billion then trillion dollars market capitalization placed pressure on them to deliver financial results, the ads spam grew like a cancer. openai is destined for the same trajectory, if only faster. it will be poetic to watch all the 'ethical' censorship machinery repurposed to subtly weigh conversations in favor of this or other brand. pragmatically, the trillion dollar question is what will be the openai take on adwords. reply resters 11 hours agorootparent> what will be the openai take on adwords Ads are supposed to reduce transaction cost by spreading information to allow consumers to efficiently make decisions about purchases, many of which entail complex trade-offs. In other words, people already want to buy things. I would love to be able to ask an intelligence with access to the world's information questions to help me efficiently make purchasing decisions. I've tried this a few times with GPT-4 and it seems to bias heavily toward whatever came up in the first few pages of web results, and rarely \"knows\" anything useful about the products. A sufficiently good product or service will market itself and it is rarely necessary for marketing spend or brand marketing for those rare exceptional products and services. For the rest of the space of products and services, ad spend is a signal that the product is not good enough that the customer would have already heard about it. With an AI assistant, getting a sense of the space of available products and services should be simple and concise, without the noise and imprecision of ads and clutter of \"near miss\" products and services (\"reach\" that companies paid for) cluttering things up. The bigger question is which AI assistant people will trust they can ask important questions to and get unbiased and helpful results. \"Which brand of Moka pot under $20 is the highest quality?\" or \"Help me decide which car to buy\" are the kinds of questions that require a solid analytical framework and access to quality data to answer correctly. AI assistants will act like the invisible hand and shoudl not have a thumb on the scale. I would pay more than $20 per month to use such an AI. I find it hard to believe that OpenAI would have to resort to any model other than a paid subscription if the information and analysis is truly high quality (which it appears to be so far). reply xiphias2 14 hours agorootparentprevThe ad model already went to take attribution / conversion from different sources into account (although there's a lot of spammy implementations), but it took many years for Google to make youtube / mobile ads profitable, and now adoption is much faster. reply EvgeniyZh 13 hours agorootparentprev> And I don't buy the lmsys leaderboard results where Google somehow shoved a mysterious gemini-pro model to be better than GPT-4.

Or that google is lying to lmsys and have a better model to serve exclusively to lmsys but not to others? Or something else? reply behnamoh 11 hours agorootparentMost likely the latter. Either Google has a better model which they disguise as Bard to make up for the bad press Bard has received, or Google doesn't really have a better model—just a Gemini Pro fine tuned on GPT-4 data to sound like GPT-4 and rank high in the leaderboard. reply EvgeniyZh 4 minutes agorootparent> Either Google has a better model which they disguise as Bard Why wouldn't they use this model in bard then?

Maths problems like that are probably a small minority of usage. One other thing I notice: if you ask about controversial issues, both GPT-3.5/4 and Bard can get a bit “preachy” from a progressive perspective - but I personally find Bard to be noticeably more “preachy” than OpenAI at this (while still not reaching Llama levels) reply EvgeniyZh 13 hours agorootparentprevThey are getting whatever you give them ;) reply YetAnotherNick 17 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, Bard is not comparable to GPT-3.5 in terms of instruction following and it sometimes gets lost in complex situations and then the response quality drops significantly.

That made me curious so I ran a second prompt: `a Roman emperor addressing a large gathering of citizens at the circus` It returned a single image, that of a black emperor. I asked why the emperor was portrayed as black and Bard informed me it wasn't at liberty to disclose its prompts, but offered to run a second generation without specifying race or ethnicity. I asked if that meant, by implication, that the initial prompt did specify race and/or ethnicity and it said that it did. I'm all for Google emphasizing diversity in outputs, but the hamfisted manner in which they're accomplishing it makes it difficult to control and degrades results, sometimes in ahistorical ways. reply nycdatasci 13 hours agoparentI did the same and asked for the horse to have a helmet too so it would be safer in space with the astronaut. \"I understand your request and apologize for not meeting your expectations.

E.g. doctors/lawyers/whatever else might need some care to prevent the base model from reinforcing stereotypes. Shoehorning in race or ethnicity by rewording the user's prompt irrespective of context just feels, as I said, hamfisted. reply physint 13 hours agorootparentRome had a north african emperor. we don't have pictures of him, and 'race' is a modern invention. Ancient people didn't care about that. to be worried that a model does not reproduce white roman emperors is to be worried about its replication of popular images of roman emperors over the last 100 years or so. In this case it is not accurately replicating popular images of roman emperors, and if that's good or bad is up to you. but to say it is not accurately replicating roman emperors themselves? well, its not doing any worse. reply vagabund 13 hours agorootparentWe have pretty good clarity that Septimius Severus wasn't racially African. His parents were of Italian and Carthaginian descent. To portray a Roman emperor -- with no further specification -- as black is to intentionally misrepresent the historical record.

If anything our protections are rather underwhelming compared to most peer countries -- we basically just echo whatever the US does -- so that certainly doesn't seem to be it. Such a weird, unexplained situation. At this point I just have to assume Pichai has some grievance with Canada or something. Thankfully Google is a serious laggard in this realm. We have full access to OpenAI products, including through Microsoft properties, Perplexity, and various others. So, eh. [1] - Like, literally, every Google employee/apologist in here claimed it was C-18. C-18 is basically settled for Google, so now it's...checks notes...that some government talking head once said they need to think about regulating AI, just like every single country and jurisdiction on the planet.

On top of that, the Federal privacy commissioner and five provincial privacy commissioners are currently investigating whether to sanction OpenAI under PIPEDA and various provincial privacy laws.

Every government on the planet has laws which \"might\" apply to AI, for which one could claim \"uncertainty\". The EU's privacy protections make Quebec's bill 64 look positively pedestrian. Pointing to various government agencies making noise about something is just a meaningless distraction. Again, literally every government on the planet has someone who says maybe they should think about maybe considering. Canada walks in lockstep with the US on virtually all matters. As a US company, Google even has special protections in Canada under NAFTAv2 that they have nowhere else on the planet. And again, this all seemingly is zero concern for Microsoft or OpenAI, among many others. I guess those scary Quebec laws (that don't even apply) aren't as formidable as held. \"Anthropic's Claude also isn't available in Canada, likely for similar reasons.\" Claude is unavailable on most of the planet, and seems to be a capacity issue more than anything else. Bard is available pretty much everywhere on the planet but Canada. Like at this point it is very obvious that it's \"personal\". As to the too small of a market claims, this is always such a weird one. Bard operates in much, much smaller markets. All of which have onerous regulations and are having the rumblings of scary new restrictions on AI. reply AlanYx 16 hours agorootparent>Canada walks in lockstep with the US on virtually all matters. On the topic of AI regulation, if you look at Bill C-27 and Canada's involvement in the ongoing Council of Europe negotiations towards a treaty on AI, Canada is currently aligned much more closely to the EU's AI Act. The same goes for privacy law; PIPEDA is closer in spirit to the GDPR but even more ambiguous and in some need of modernization. And as we've seen with today's announcement, which also excludes the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, and the UK, Google's approach to regulatory risks associated with AI appears to be a cautious one. >And again, this all has seemingly is zero concern for Microsoft or OpenAI... Microsoft is willing to shoulder the legal risks because they have a solid revenue stream through Azure OpenAI services. OpenAI itself will just block Canada if the regulatory authorities get too aggressive, like they did temporarily in Italy until a deal was reached. reply llm_nerd 16 hours agorootparent>And as we've seen with today's announcement, which also excludes the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, and the UK I'm unsure what this is referencing. Bard (and thus Gemini Pro) is available in all of the EEA, Switzerland and the UK. >OpenAI itself will just block Canada if the regulatory authorities get too aggressive So Google has withheld Bard from Canada for a year+ because maybe at some future point Canada might have some burdensome AI legislation (if some toothless bills that are unlikely to ever receive ascent might take some future form eventually), and this is validated because OpenAI can withdraw their service if at some point Canada might have some burdensome AI legislation.

The APIs for Vertex still say it's in GA, but then you have to call Google to get access, even if you are a trusted developer.

For everyone else to still be converted but ending up at the page it's more effective to try to show all the reasons you might want to give it a go then show the link. Unfortunately, optimizing for people who want to use your thing often gives worse conversion metrics.

I was expecting Google to be pumping much more AI upgrades this year to survive. Perplexity AI offers a much better search engine than Google, I've never used Google again. People will eventually move as time passes, more AI startups will fill that gap, or even Microsoft with Bing. By now Google should be at least beating GPT-4, which Pro doesn't.

If you're the best horse and buggy company in the world, do you go all in on building cars or just keep doing what you're good at and extract profits while you still can?

But they are focused on doing it reliably and safely and not getting sued. These things just take longer. reply xnx 9 hours agorootparentprevOne more bullet I forgot to include: Google likely has to deal with at least 100x the volume that OpenAI does. reply lern_too_spel 16 hours agorootparentprevReason #1: Mismanagement. reply riwsky 17 hours agorootparentprev* utterly incapable of the product thinking needed to turn research into something people can actually use reply cma 17 hours agorootparentInitiall the worry was probably: A) If Google is found liable for copyright on each thing trained, that's more than their net assets by thousands fold at the mandatory minimum rates. B) If OpenAI is found liable, they go bankrupt and creditors don't even get their non-transferable 70% margin (to Microsoft) cloud credits from Microsoft's investment. Once Google released Bard though there is pretty much no excuse not to put out better stuff, they already made a legal determination that it is iron-clad fair use. reply loudmax 16 hours agoparentprevThis is entirely due to complacent management. In the early 2000's Google's cleverness and engineering competence built a money cannon. The founders recognized the challenges that would be involved in running a huge corporation so they looked for some professional managers to do the job. Eventually the current management settled in, and they've consistently chosen the path of lowest risk and least resistance for their next quarterly financials. As long as there are no external shocks, they could always expect a profitable next quarter. Now that a shock to the system is here, the management lacks the vision or long term planning to have any idea what to do about it. I don't doubt that there's plenty of engineering talent left at Google. Under the right leadership they could be leveraging their unmatched assets to create the most capable AIs that exist. Under the current leadership, that's just not going to happen.

They all look like a low-effort painting, or those pre-computer-age advertising photos. Even when I use keywords like \"photorealistic\" or mention camera models in the prompt, the image still has that style. I don't hate the Bard look, but certainly other image generators are much more flexible in terms of style. I find this to be a big misstep. Image generation is inherently more fantastical than text generation, and dialing up the creativity here is really essential, unlike text generation where it could be derided as hallucination. reply jasonjmcghee 17 hours agoparentprevHave you been watching midjourney 6?

This is at heavy risk for confirmation bias, but I believe that writing chat bots is one of the best ways for people to get into and enjoy coding, because it's fun and rewarding, and simple enough (with an existing framework to use) that just uses strings. For a large generation it was MySpace and the ability to customize your page heavily with HTML. I know a number of people who learned HTML for that reason. Chat bots seem like the closest modern day equivalent (despite the main platforms making it harder with stuff like difficult to connect to the real time websocket and force use of webhooks). 10 years ago or so when Slack was new and had a gloriously simple API, I even wrote a framework that made it as easy as implementing one function, and you could receive messages (among other metadata like the username of the sender) as strings and send replies easily as strings. It served as an entry point for a few friends who had some fun with it and learned some ruby in the process. Anyway, if you're looking to get into coding but want to do a \"real\" project (or something very rewarding), start by writing simple chat bots! If you need some ideas, these are simple: 1. Start with writing a simple echo bot that just replies to every message with the same message that it received. 1. Write a bot that responds to every message with a random number between 1 and 100. For a slight increased challenge, have it do fizzbuzz where the nth message received is the counter. 2. Write a bot that that will reverse the message of whatever it receives, so it echoes replies but backwards. 3. Write a bot that will lookup a word when the message sent is \"define \" and reply with the definition from one of the many dictionary APIs out there. Go from there! reply ndr 1 minute agoparentThere's a whole generation of us who started coding on mIRC-scripting exactly for that reason. reply lexlash 5 hours agoparentprevI teach software engineering to grad students.

It's easier to show of the final result to (non programming) friends, or get some ideas for potentially useful tools or at least fun toys. Sure for experienced developers command line tools are used daily (at least for some developers), but for many students it can be alien world that they don't use outside the lessons. Also overall usefulness. Simple terminal program that responds with a fixed message, is just an exerciser but otherwise useless. You need to get a lot more complicated to make useful tool. But a chatbot which responds with fixed messages (usually FAQ type stuff) is a commonly used tool for the purpose of community management. reply richeyryan 59 minutes agorootparentprevMost computer users don't use command-line apps day in and day out. Most computer users nowadays use chat apps (Discord, Slack, Whatsapp) and have probably encountered bots on those platforms before. There is an inherent familiarity that makes it feel more accessible. reply dharmab 58 minutes agorootparentprev1. Networking, multiplayer and multimedia are built in. 2. The social component is fun. Students can easily show their work to each other. Don't underestimate the power of memes. 3.

The show is divided into four segments of contrasting moods. 1. The Pop Party section will feature upbeat, cheerful songs with a more light-hearted message about love and relationships. It will be high energy and encourage the audience to participate in singing along and dancing. 2. The Emotional Ballads section will feature slower-paced songs with poignant lyrics about love and relationships. The instrumentals provide a reflective atmosphere that may be heavy at times, but ultimately brings comfort. 3. The Dark and Heavy section will focus on heavier topics such as mental health/anxiety struggles or social commentary/satire. These songs will have intense instrumentals to match the mood of the lyrical content, allowing for an honest exploration of these issues in a safe space. 4. the Fun and Uplifting segment will have a similar vibe but with deeper lyrics that speak to mental health/anxiety struggles or spiritual enlightenment. The instrumentals may be slightly slower paced than in the Pop Party section, however they are still uplifting as they celebrate hope for brighter days ahead.

    "originLink": "https://www.wired.com/story/appin-training-centers-lawsuits-censorship/",
    "originBody": "BY ANDY GREENBERG SECURITYFEB 1, 2024 12:30 PM A Startup Allegedly ‘Hacked the World.’ Then Came the Censorship—and Now the Backlash A loose coalition of anti-censorship voices is working to highlight reports of one Indian company’s hacker-for-hire past—and the legal threats aimed at making them disappear. ILLUSTRATION: WIRED STAFF; GETTY IMAGES Hacker-for-hire firms like NSO Group and Hacking Team have become notorious for enabling their customers to spy on vulnerable members of civil society. But as far back as a decade ago in India, a startup called Appin Technology and its subsidiaries allegedly played a similar cyber-mercenary role while attracting far less attention. Over the past two years, a collection of people with direct and indirect links to that company have been working to keep it that way, using a campaign of legal threats to silence publishers and anyone else reporting on Appin Technology’s alleged hacking past. Now, a loose coalition of anti-censorship voices is working to make that strategy backfire. For months, lawyers and executives with ties to Appin Technology and to a newer organization that shares part of its name, called the Association of Appin Training Centers, have used lawsuits and legal threats to carry out an aggressive censorship campaign across the globe. These efforts have demanded that more than a dozen publications amend or fully remove references to the original Appin Technology’s alleged illegal hacking or, in some cases, mentions of that company’s cofounder, Rajat Khare. Most prominently, a lawsuit against Reuters brought by the Association of Appin Training Centers resulted in a stunning order from a Delhi court: It demanded that Reuters take down its article based on a blockbuster investigation into Appin Technology that had detailed its alleged targeting and spying on opposition leaders, corporate competitors, lawyers, and wealthy individuals on behalf of customers worldwide. Reuters “temporarily” removed its article in compliance with that injunction and is fighting the order in Indian court. As Appin Training Centers has sought to enforce that same order against a slew of other news outlets, however, resistance is building. Earlier this week, the digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) sent a response—published here—pushing back against Appin Training Centers’ legal threats on behalf of media organizations caught in this crossfire, including the tech blog Techdirt and the investigative news nonprofit MuckRock. No media outlet has claimed that Appin Training Centers—a group that describes itself as an educational firm run in part by former franchisees of the original Appin Technology, which reportedly ceased its alleged hacking operations more than a decade ago—has been involved in any illegal hacking. In December, however, Appin Training Centers sent emails to Techdirt and MuckRock demanding they too take down all content related to allegations that Appin Technology previously engaged in widespread cyberspying operations, citing the court order against Reuters. Techdirt, Appin Training Centers argued, fell under that injunction by writing about Reuters' story and the takedown order targeting it. So had MuckRock, the plaintiffs claimed, which hosted some of the documents that Reuters had cited in its story and uploaded to MuckRock's DocumentCloud service. In the response sent on their behalf, the EFF states that the two media organizations are refusing to comply, arguing that the Indian court's injunction “is in no way the global takedown order your correspondence represents it to be.” It also cites an American law called the SPEECH Act that deems any foreign court’s libel ruling that violates the First Amendment unenforceable in the US. “It's not a good state for a free press when one company can, around the world, disappear news articles,” Michael Morisy, the CEO and cofounder of MuckRock, tells WIRED. “That's something that fundamentally we need to push back against.” MOST POPULAR CULTURE TikTok’s Missing Music Is Making Users Very Upset REECE ROGERS SECURITY The Mystery of the $400 Million FTX Heist May Have Been Solved ANDY GREENBERG CULTURE Taylor Swift Conspiracy Theorists Get Psyops All Wrong JUSTIN LING CULTURE Here's How ASCII Barbie Came to a Screen Near You AMANDA HOOVER Techdirt founder Mike Masnick says that, beyond defeating the censorship of the Appin Technology story, he hopes their public response to that censorship effort will ultimately bring even more attention to the group’s past. In fact, 19 years ago, Masnick coined the term “the Streisand effect” to describe a situation in which someone's attempt to hide information results in its broader exposure—exactly the situation he hopes to help create in this case. “The suppression of accurate reporting is problematic,” says Masnick. “When it happens, it deserves to be called out, and there should be more attention paid to those trying to silence it.” The anti-secrecy nonprofit Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets) has also joined the effort to spark that Streisand Effect, “uncensoring” Reuters' story on the original Appin Technology as part of a new initiative it calls the Greenhouse Project. DDoSecrets cofounder Emma Best says the name comes from its intention to foster a “warming effect”—the opposite of the “chilling effect” used to describe the self-censorship created by legal threats. “It sends a signal to would-be censors, telling them that their success may be fleeting and limited,” Best says. “And it assures other journalists that their work can survive.” Neither Appin Training Centers nor Rajat Khare responded to WIRED's request for comment, nor did Reuters. The fight to expose the original Appin Technology’s alleged hacking history began to reach a head in November of 2022, when the Association for Appin Training Centers sued Reuters based only on its reporters’ unsolicited messages to Appin Training Centers’ employees and students. The company’s legal complaint, filed in India’s judicial system, accused Reuters not only of defamation, but “mental harassment, stalking, sexual misconduct and trauma.” Nearly a full year later, Reuters nonetheless published its article, “How an Indian Startup Hacked the World.” The judge in the case initially sided with Appin Training Centers, writing that the article could have a “devastating effect on the general students population of India.” He quickly ordered an injunction stating that Appin Training Centers can demand Reuters take down their claims about Appin Technology. That ruling has preceded any legal arguments over the truth of Reuters’ reporting, which the news agency has promised to bring up in an appeal. In fact, Reuters wrote that it based its story on interviews with dozens of Appin Technology's former staff and hundreds of alleged targets, as well as thousands of its internal documents. Those files include Appin Technology's marketing pitch documents that remain publicly available on DocumentCloud thanks to MuckRock, and appear to show the company explicitly offering to hack targets on behalf of clients via “phishing,” “social engineering,” “trojan” infections, and even discussing specific cases when clients hired them for hacking operations. Appin Training Centers, for its part, argues that it’s merely a collection of educational institutions whose brand has been tarnished by Reuters’ reporting. Reuters has responded in a legal filing arguing that Appin Training Centers was created “solely for purposes of this lawsuit, with ulterior motive,” and pointed out, through an exhibit attached to a court filing, that it was incorporated only months after it named itself as the plaintiff suing Reuters.

Soon, in a kind of domino effect of censorship, others began to take down their own reports about Appin Technology after receiving legal threats based on the same injunction. SentinelOne, the cybersecurity firm that had helped Reuters in its investigation, removed its research on an Appin Technology subsidiary’s alleged hacking from its website. The Internet Archive deleted its copy of the Reuters article. The legal news site Lawfare and cybersecurity news podcast Risky Biz both published analyses based on the article; Risky Biz took its podcast episode down, and Lawfare overwrote every part of its piece that referred to Appin Technology with Xs. WIRED, too, removed a summary of Reuters' article in a news roundup after receiving Appin Training Centers' threat. Aside from the injunction that Appin Training Centers has used to demand publishers censor their stories, Appin cofounder Rajat Khare has separately sent legal threats to another collection of news outlets based on a court order he obtained in Switzerland. Two Swiss publications have publicly noted that they responded to court orders by removing Khare’s name from stories about alleged hacking. Others have removed Khare’s name or removed the articles altogether without a public explanation, including the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the UK’s Sunday Times, several Swiss and French news outlets, and eight Indian ones. “This is an organization throwing everything against the wall, trying to make as many allegations in as many venues as possible in the hopes that something, somewhere sticks,” says one person at a media outlet that has received multiple legal threats from people connected to Appin Technology, who declined to be named due to the legal risks of speaking out. “Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Unfortunately, in India, it’s worked.” Even before the EFF, Techdirt, MuckRock, and DDoSecrets began to push back against that censorship, some had immediately resisted it. The New Yorker, for instance, had mentioned a subsidiary of Appin Technology and Rajat Khare in a feature about India's hacker-for-hire industry in June of last year. It was sued by Appin Training Centers, but has kept its piece online while the lawsuit proceeds. (The New Yorker and WIRED are both published by Condé Nast.) Ronald Deibert, a well-known security researcher and founder of the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, a group that focuses on exposing hackers who target members of civil society, had also mentioned Appin Technology in a blog post. Deibert received and refused Appin Training Centers' takedown threat, posting a screenshot of its email to his X feed in December along with his response: seven middle-finger emojis. As the backlash to the censorship of reporting on Appin Technology's alleged hacking snowballs, however, it may now be going beyond a few cases where Appin Training Centers’ and Rajat Khare’s censorship attempts have failed, says Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, who has written about the censorship campaign. Instead, it may be backfiring, he says, particularly for Appin Technology cofounder Rajat Khare. “It does seem like a sort of dubious strategy to be stirring this up now, and I do wonder if he is starting to regret that given the coverage it's getting,” says Stern. “You could easily see that it'll do more reputational harm than good for Khare and for Appin.” MuckRock's Morisy says that attention is exactly the intention of his move, along with Techdirt and the EFF, to put a spotlight on the legal threats they've received. “It’s leveraging the Streisand effect to an extent.

Here's a concise summary: - Appin, an Indian firm, is accused by Reuters of functioning as the e-commerce platform for hacking (similar to Amazon but for hacking). Users log in to a covert portal, place orders to hack into target mailboxes, make payments, and receive the delivered data. - Appin received requests globally, including from RAW, IB, and the Indian military. However, when the Indian government detected financial irregularities, government contracts ceased. In desperation, Appin took on any available work, but it didn't survive. - Despite Appin's demise, its former employees initiated similar ventures that are still active today. Considering the involvement of the Indian government, I anticipated Appin and its founders to dispute the allegations, and they did. The article was subsequently removed, raising allegations of censorship. The linked article discusses the backlash against this alleged censorship. The timing of this article is intriguing, coinciding with the recent Pannun affair and now presenting another accusation, this time in the cyberspace. Reuters mentions that \"The National Security Agency (NSA), which spies on foreigners for the U.S. government, began surveilling the company after watching it hack “high value” Pakistani officials around 2009, one of the sources said. An NSA spokesperson declined to comment.\" This may lead Indians to question: if the NSA can hack, why can't we? reply alephnerd 1 hour agoparent> The timing of this article is intriguing, coinciding with the recent Pannun affair It's just pure coincidence. The APT was detected by SentinelOne Labs who then worked with Reuters to publish an investigation.

I understand Reuters taking down the article, but why would Lawfare or other blogs comply? What could an Indian court possibly do to someone entirely outside of their jurisdiction? It seems like the most appropriate response is \"no, and we're going to publish the demand letters,\" which is exactly what techdirt did. Let Rajat Khare - the guy who is likely behind Appin - file in a US (or EU, or wherever) court.

If a US person were doing this in another country, I'd expect them to be told to fuck right off. Would you just accede to the dictates of a court in a country to which you have no connection? That a much worse look, imo. reply shadowgovt 11 hours agoprevReal big example of the Streisand Effect in play here. It seems this company got one ruling from one court in India serving as an injunction against one news agency reporting on them, and they then went on to try and leverage that into getting everyone to stop reporting on the entire situation, including the injunction itself. That's not how injunctions work, that's not how international law works, and it has created a new cycle of news outlets being able to report on the fact that the company tried to gag them. reply FergusArgyll 11 hours agoprevThis feels pretty easy but I don't really know.

Assange may have started out with pure intentions, but as he ran out of money, the only funding became available from the Kremlin. The cover for funding him was his show on RT, the Kremlin-funded English-language television station. You might recall that Assange bragged about a huge dump of info about Putin and other Russian leaders/oligarchs that was soon to be dropped. It never did. It was either entirely BS from the start to provide cover, or existed but was withheld to keep happy his new sponsors. You also may recall that the Wikileaks dumps of info stolen by Russian hackers on Hillary Clinton was miraculously released within hours of Trump's \"I grabbed her by the pussy\" tapes. A classic Russian disinformation move to distract the media, which was quite successful. That's just glancing at a few highlights. By the time Wikileaks became significant, it was a straight-up Russian operation. It would have been a far better life decision for Assange to simply quit when he ran out of funds, than to sell out. Sad reply lukan 10 hours agorootparentThe FSB might have had more means to convince Assange, than just money. But from what I remember with a interview with him, he seemed to entrench himself with the narrative that the US as superpower number 1, is the evil empire number 1 ( he has a anarchist, anti state background). So blinded by fanatism would be my assumption. So blinded, that he does not mind the open power abuse by those new allies. It is a phenomen, I often witnessed. More so now, with the various alternative rebells, against globalisation, power abuse etc. - and then finding all sorts of wild justifications for Putins Invasion in Ukraine. Black and white thinking, combined with double think, in all its glory. reply thrwwycbr 2 hours agorootparent> open power abuse by those new allies I would argue that the capitol raid fanatics are anarchists as well, under the cover of being republican voters.

Released under the Apache Licence, Version 2.0. FAQs Report a bug About Keybindings How does X feature work? CyberChef has a contextual help feature. Just hover your cursor over a feature that you want to learn more about and press F1 on your keyboard to get some information about it. Give it a try by hovering over this text and pressing F1 now! What sort of things can I do with CyberChef? There are around 300 operations in CyberChef allowing you to carry out simple and complex tasks easily. Here are some examples: Decode a Base64-encoded string Convert a date and time to a different time zone Parse a Teredo IPv6 address Convert data from a hexdump, then decompress Decrypt and disassemble shellcode Display multiple timestamps as full dates Carry out different operations on data of different types Use parts of the input as arguments to operations Can I load input directly from files? Yes! Just drag your file over the input box and drop it. CyberChef can handle files up to around 2GB (depending on your browser), however some of the operations may take a very long time to run over this much data. If the output is larger than a certain threshold (default 1MiB), it will be presented to you as a file available for download. Slices of the file can be viewed in the output if you need to inspect them. How do I run operation X over multiple inputs at once? Maybe you have 10 timestamps that you want to parse or 16 encoded strings that all have the same key. The 'Fork' operation (found in the 'Flow control' category) splits up the input line by line and runs all subsequent operations on each line separately. Each output is then displayed on a separate line. These delimiters can be changed, so if your inputs are separated by commas, you can change the split delimiter to a comma instead. Click here for an example. How does the 'Magic' operation work? The 'Magic' operation uses a number of methods to detect encoded data and the operations which can be used to make sense of it. A technical description of these methods can be found here. If you find a bug in CyberChef, please raise an issue in our GitHub repository explaining it in as much detail as possible. Copy and include the following information if relevant. Raise issue on GitHub What A simple, intuitive web app for analysing and decoding data without having to deal with complex tools or programming languages. CyberChef encourages both technical and non-technical people to explore data formats, encryption and compression. Why Digital data comes in all shapes, sizes and formats in the modern world – CyberChef helps to make sense of this data all on one easy-to-use platform. How The interface is designed with simplicity at its heart. Complex techniques are now as trivial as drag-and-drop. Simple functions can be combined to build up a \"recipe\", potentially resulting in complex analysis, which can be shared with other users and used with their input. For those comfortable writing code, CyberChef is a quick and efficient way to prototype solutions to a problem which can then be scripted once proven to work. Who It is expected that CyberChef will be useful for cybersecurity and antivirus companies. It should also appeal to the academic world and any individuals or companies involved in the analysis of digital data, be that software developers, analysts, mathematicians or casual puzzle solvers. Aim It is hoped that by releasing CyberChef through GitHub, contributions can be added which can be rolled out into future versions of the tool. There are around 200 useful operations in CyberChef for anyone working on anything vaguely Internet-related, whether you just want to convert a timestamp to a different format, decompress gzipped data, create a SHA3 hash, or parse an X.509 certificate to find out who issued it. It’s the Cyber Swiss Army Knife.

There are three operations that make calls to external services, those being the 'Show on map' operation which downloads map tiles from wikimedia.org, the 'DNS over HTTPS' operation which resolves DNS requests using either Google or Cloudflare services, and the 'HTTP request' operation that calls out to the configured URL you enter. You can confirm what network requests are made using your browser's developer console (F12) and viewing the Network tab. If you would like to download your own standalone copy of CyberChef to run in a segregated network or where there is limited or no Internet connectivity, you can get a ZIP file containing the whole web app below. This can be run locally or hosted on a web server with no configuration required. Be aware that the standalone version will never update itself, meaning it will not receive bug fixes or new features until you re-download newer versions manually.

I can get a lot of the simple text manipulation stuff done w/ hexdump, cut, tr, sed, etc. I find CyberChef easier to use when I'm doing operations on binary blobs. I particularly like easily doing encryption and decryption. Lately I seem to find many \"secrets\" (database connection strings, API keys, etc) in software I'm RE'ing stored as base64-encoded AES-encrypted blobs w/ the key sitting right beside them as a base64-encoded blob. reply wrboyce 10 hours agoparentImmensely useful, I assume you mean - but you missed a word! Useless commentary aside, could you give some examples of what you’re talking about in your second paragraph? Sounds like the sort of thing I’d enjoy reading! reply saagarjha 14 hours agoprevCyberChef is really useful, and it runs locally, so you never have to send your sensitive data to some random server anymore. The “recipes” feature is quite powerful, too, but I think my favorite thing about it is that I can often just paste random data in and run the “Magic” script and it’ll try to guess the data format for me. reply Hnrobert42 7 hours agoparentIs the Magic function anything like running `file` on a Linux/Mac? reply nailer 14 hours agoparentprev> you never have to send your sensitive data to some random server anymore If you live in the UK you are already sending one entire month of your full personal communications, and three months of your communications metadata, to this government organisation.

All my personal communication is encrypted. reply _xerces_ 14 hours agoprevI love how you can build complex operations from each of the simple primitives like From Hex->Uppercase->XOR->Remove NULL->To Hex and save them as a recipe. It reminds me of the Linux command line where each program is simple but you can pipe the output of one into another to create a chain that can perform complex data processing. reply fuzztester 6 hours agoparent>I love how you can build complex operations from each of the simple primitives like >reminds me of the Linux command line quite true. upvoted. but, oddly enough, it also reminds me of the Unix command line. maybe because: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix > https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux ;) reply signalblur 14 hours agoprevDon’t forget to turn on Geocities mode (Settings > Theme > Geocities) reply 2024throwaway 11 hours agoparentAnd don't forget to turn it immediately off. reply tamimio 11 hours agoprevI use Ciphey instead in any reverse engineering stuff, far better. https://github.com/ciphey/ciphey reply sprremix 39 minutes agoparentI also discovered Ciphey. Neat little tool indeed, but I just found out it's being deprecated. It's mentioned in this issue[1] and being replaced with Ares[2].

GCHQ is the signals intelligence agency that grew out of the work at Bletchley Park on code breaking in WW2. So the UK's version of the NSA. https://www.gchq.gov.uk/Copper & Cable Services. That's a dim recollection of what may have been one of many inside jokeschuckles from WWII Bletchley as retold to an Australia some 30 odd years later so YMMV. It's in keeping with keeping secrets from the general public & foreign agents via a Boring Name. The BritishCommonwealth WWII company front for their pre Manhatten Project nuclear programme was Tube Alloys .. so they did like a dull metals related cover name. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_Alloys reply JetSetIlly 4 hours agorootparentI've always been amused by these boring sounding cover names. In the USSR, nuclear related work was administered by the \"Ministry of Medium Machine Building\". And The Manhattan Project was originally the \"Manhattan Engineering District\". Although that sounds a little bit exotic, at least to my ears. reply RobinL 14 hours agoparentprevYes.

The recipe idea and chaining, plus the crazy list of ingredients is super useful if anybody does CTFs.. much faster than throwing together some bits of Python reply EvanAnderson 13 hours agorootparentSame here. I did a CTF last year and spent much of it just sitting in CyberChef. reply declaredapple 13 hours agorootparentprevWhat use cases are you using it for? I haven't used it a ton, but I've found the UI to be clunkly and somewhat difficult to figure out compared to using the shell with jq reply _xerces_ 13 hours agorootparentI use it for deobfuscation, decryption, base64 en/decode and and sometimes just for converting hex to readable strings or vice versa via copy paste and no effort. It can switch up endianness, sort out network packet data, etc. For even less effort there is a MAGIC function where you just dump some bytes (sometimes with a from/to hex block first) and it tries to make sense of them for you. It saves me writing custom C or Python scripts every time I want to manipulate or analyze some data. reply pbhjpbhj 11 hours agorootparentprevI use it for parsing/formatting out text data instead of Excel because I don't have access to a shell and my JavaScript is rusty enough that it is quicker to put regexes in CyberChef than use jsfiddle. Before I found it I was using an online regex tool for that; simple dedupe, and line counting made it worthwhile shifting. reply mianm 13 hours agoprevIt's always useful to be able to use the operation it can provide to check if your data is a Numberwang. reply edm0nd 12 hours agoprevI keep this open for usage during CTFs.

It is general purpose data wrangling software, rather than security specific. But it can do base64 and url encoding (in the 'Decode' transform) as well as 65 other transforms (join, dedupe etc) and it can handle multi-million row datasets.
