    "originBody": "This isn’t the standard YouTuber burnout-apology video. And it’s not “oh, woe is me, I’m leaving forever”. I’m going somewhere with this. Literally. I’ve been throwing stuff at the internet since 1999. And for many, many years, that stuff went almost nowhere. I had occasional bits of success, but could never make any of them last long-term. I remember thinking, so many times during all those years… will any of this stuff I’m making ever work? Well, this did. I didn’t know that, back when I was filming the first videos for the series that was then called Things You Might Not Know, I just held out my phone at arm’s length and talked into it for 90 seconds with almost no research! I really don’t like those videos now. But the first of them was published exactly ten years before this one. To the minute. 4pm, January 1st, 2014. For the first month of that format, I was publishing a video almost every day, and then I settled down: one video a week. Mostly on location, near windswept infrastructure, although there’s computer science and linguistics in there too, and occasional green-screen animated videos. I experimented with other formats on other days, but the rule I set myself was: Monday, 4pm, something interesting. I never got to space. I never got to the ocean depths. And I never got to fly harnessed underneath a helicopter, I couldn’t find an excuse to do that one. But I never missed a week. There’s been a few guest videos, of course, and occasionally some blatant filler. One time I just uploaded two and a half hours of unedited footage of garlic bread flying to the edge of space, and that turned into one of the most viewed videos I’ve ever had. Sometimes a video would be a day or two early or late for one reason or another. But to my own satisfaction, which is ultimately the only thing that I’m counting, there’s been a video a week for ten years. I never broke the streak. I don’t know when I decided to try for ten years. It felt like a good, round number to reach. As the YouTube game changed over the years, as the channel became bigger, as my own standards became higher and higher to keep pace with all the people I was collaborating with and competing with, as this became my life– I decided that my goal was ten years. And that is today, as this is published. 4pm, January 1st, 2024. So now it’s time to take a breather. I can’t keep this up. This is my dream job, and I have a lot of fun doing it. I know I’m incredibly lucky. But a dream job is still a job. And it’s a job that keeps getting bigger and more complicated and I am so tired! There’s nothing in my life right now except work. I did get close to burning out, but fortunately I always knew when to step back from the brink. And it’s not like I can drop the quality back down? That’s not how YouTube works these days. Over the last year or so, I have talked to some folks who are more successful than me, who were in this position a few years back. And it’s clear that I now have two possible choices. I could keep making bigger and better things, keep climbing the ladder, build a business, hire full-time employees… and end up as a manager. And that would be great for someone who isn’t me, but I know I’m bad at that, and I’d hate every second of it. So, option 2… I could not do that, I could do less, and be happier. So I’m taking a break for… some time. I don’t know when or if I come back, but when I do, it won’t be weekly. At least, not in this format, not here. This probably isn’t goodbye-goodbye? Like, not forever? The podcast I host, Lateral, is still going out weekly, my newsletter’s still going out, the Plus channel will probably return at some point, there’ll likely be new Technical Difficulties episodes, there are links to all those things around here somewhere. And there will probably be all-new projects here or somewhere else, projects that are experimental and weird and might fail. Because I miss doing stuff like that. And when some fool comes along and goes “oh, you fell off, “this new stuff isn’t getting the views is it?”… Yeah. Okay. That’s fine. This project has worked, and it’s time to move on. I’m still going to be looking for interesting things to film here, there’ll probably still be videos here from time to time, I really do love doing this. There is a part of my brain that desperately, desperately does not want this to end. So if you’ve got an idea for a future video, you can still tell me about it. And one day, I might make it. But right now, I need to spend time with people I hold dear, I need there to be things in my life that are not work, and it’s been years since that’s been true. I never celebrated the milestones. Subscriber numbers weren’t ever my goal. So I never did any big so-many-subscribers thank you videos. But, still… thank you. To you watching, and to everyone who’s helped along the way. I did think that I should end this with a big, syrupy, sentimental, self-indulgent montage and head off into the sunset… …and you know what? Just this once, for the first time in ten years… that’s exactly what I’m going to do.",

In a sea of short derivative junk-food content, he made things that i honestly learned from, without demanding more than 10 minutes of my time a week! There’s of course a lot of people also doing the same sort of great content, but it does feel like a slowly dying breed. Tom definitely deserves an indefinite break though. If&#x2F;when he goes back to short form web video, I’ll be happy to watch again! :) reply Waterluvian 16 hours agoparentI agree! But the thing is— I’ve got about fifty Tom Scotts in my subscription list. I’m perplexed by doomsaysers’ laments about the state of online educational media. I’ve got far more high quality content for a huge variety of topics than I’ve ever had before.My theory is this: your favourite hobby store expands and adds one more aisle of fantastic products and five aisles of garbage. You’ll likely perceive quality as having gone way down. In a limited sense, sure: it might be in the way. But it didn’t replace the good stuff. reply phillryu 16 hours agorootparentYeah but the burden is now on you to sift through the garbage to find the good stuff, especially since it&#x27;s mostly mixed together in recommendations or search results etc. It feels more limited to me the other way around, like yes we have added some more good stuff, but good luck finding it.If my favorite hobby store kept on expanding and expanding and the ratio of great stuff to garbage kept going down, I would definitely perceive the overall quality as being well into some death spiral. reply j-bos 15 hours agorootparentYoutube makes it pretty easy for me. The algorithm recommends videos nd channels, and I say &#x27;not interested&#x27; to the garbage, the result: a high quality subscription tab. reply qup 14 hours agorootparentI do the same thing, but they just show me more garbage.My \"subscriptions\" tab is pretty good, though. reply tstrimple 12 hours agorootparentThere seems to be a few topics which will cause your recommendations to spiral into conspiracy theory nonsense pretty quickly. Unfortunately you’ve got to be very careful with any gun content in YouTube as they almost always lead to bullshit in your feed. reply ballenf 10 hours agorootparentGarand Thumb videos I&#x27;ve seen have been very good. Like the one about what supersonic rounds sound like going overhead. I&#x27;d guess there&#x27;s somewhat less overlap with his content and conspiracy stuff. reply qup 8 hours agorootparentContent aside, I hate the click bait titles a lot of big channels employ. Garand thumb included.I click \"don&#x27;t show this channel\" on those replyjebarker 15 hours agorootparentprevThis has always been the case since the printing press practically. There&#x27;s always been way too much quality &#x27;content&#x27; to manage and you have to sift your way through it. What has changed is that everything is now at our fingertips and we expose ourselves to the recommendation feed. I guess I&#x27;m saying that the problem hasn&#x27;t changed, just our awareness of it. reply rokkitmensch 8 hours agorootparentThe pulp mills must run, that capacity is already paid for. Let us convince the chattering classes of their value to the human enterprise in putting words down to keep the presses running.\"Romance\" literature is honest in its own provincial way. No pretensions to much besides entertainment and consuming printing capacity. reply kbenson 16 hours agorootparentprevIs it really on you to sort and sift, or is it on you to find a good guide? In the hobby store example, there are other people around to ask, and I think that is similar as well.The future is more content, not less, so finding mechanisms to cope with that is well worth the effort. reply withinboredom 15 hours agorootparentNot exactly. Assuming the number of people in the hobby store didn’t grow exponentially, you would be completely empty in your favorite isle, most of the time. reply bombcar 15 hours agorootparentAnd the guides do increase in the 5 crappy to 1 good ratio also. Eventually it’s infinite crap even thought there is gold in there. reply kbenson 15 hours agorootparentprevBut you aren&#x27;t, because there&#x27;s really only a few stores, not thousands, so people congregate at the same ones, and if there&#x27;s nobody in those aisles continuously, they stop getting stocked (people create less content if nobody consumes it).The problem is almost never that there&#x27;s nobody in your aisle, it&#x27;s about finding the right way to connect with them. There are numerous ways to do this. Even just leaving a comment on a video asking a question or responding to someone else&#x27;s comment. That&#x27;s about as low effort as you can get, but actually works. reply brucethemoose2 16 hours agorootparentprevThis affects the other end too.Quality niche creators are partially motivated (and sometimes supported) by viewers. The bigger the sea of garbage they are swimming against, the less inclined they will be to start or continue. reply Eisenstein 14 hours agorootparentPeople are motivated by viewers, but once it gets above a certain amount I think it becomes a different motivation. When I write things on reddit on a specific topic subreddit that have few posts in it, and those things get a few upvotes, I am more motivated to continue than posts in huge subs which get boatloads of upvotes. Because in order to get those one or two important ones, you need to know something specific and valuable, but to get thousands you have to find a way to appeal to a lot of people in a broad way.Trying to chase the broad appeal will lead, in my experience, to a downslide where content gets less and less useful and more pop-culture oriented, or it becomes outright fraud or manipulation. reply jwestbury 28 minutes agorootparentprev> My theory is this: your favourite hobby store expands and adds one more aisle of fantastic products and five aisles of garbage. You’ll likely perceive quality as having gone way down.This is actually something which is borne out by research, though in a slightly different context. Niro Sivanathan at the LBS has studied how arguments are presented, and essentially, recipients of arguments engage in an averaging function instead of an additive function, when evaluating strength -- adding one weaker point to a pair of very strong points actually detracts from the perceived strength of an argument.It would not be at all surprising if we did the same sort of thing in different contexts, such as the example you gave here. reply JoBrad 16 hours agorootparentprevI’ve also been watching Tom Scott since he started, and love his content.

Highly entertaining and informative. reply TheCleric 9 hours agorootparentHe and CodingTrain are my favorites. reply kragen 15 hours agorootparentprevthe problem i have with educational youtube is that it&#x27;s competence porn. it&#x27;s quite satisfying to watch lyle peterson, kiwami japan, grandpa amu, nigel braun, grant sanderson, andy george, or xyla foxlin working through the problems involved in creating something, to the point that hours spent getting satisfied that way displace the far more effortful hours required to work through those problems myself. but i don&#x27;t gain skills by watching someone else work through problems (or, in the less praiseworthy cases, glossing over problems); at best, i might get an idea to try out, or a feeling of inspiration, or a declarative, factual understanding of a particular mechanism—a kind of understanding which still requires exercise to convert into knowhow. but it&#x27;s much easier to just click on another video and vicariously enjoy someone else&#x27;s stunning competence than to close the window and struggle with my ownworse, sometimes it isn&#x27;t actually competence. yesterday i watched a video where a guy made opaque soda-lime glass and convinced himself it was a better refractory than his insulating firebricks because he was, among other things, confused about thermodynamics, confused about different material properties, confused about the composition of waterglass, confused about the composition of garden lime, and confused about the temperature of his oxyhydrogen torch (and, I suspect, in significant danger of blowing his foundry to kingdom come)watching porn or sex tips videos won&#x27;t make you a great lover. neither will reading alt.sex.wizardsfifty tom scotts is ten hours a week of, basically, watching porn. i spend more time than that on watching the youtubers listed above and others; what if i spent that time on deliberate practice instead? ten hours a week of etudes might not get you into juillard, but pretty soon you&#x27;re better than the average garage band memberwhere do you get your etudes or katas, and how do you judge your success on them? textbooks are pretty okay for that, and it&#x27;s possible to make youtube videos with exercises in them, but those aren&#x27;t the videos that become youtube hits. and i think it runs counter to the nature of the medium: not just memetic fitness, but also the effort gradient for both creators and consumers reply ramenbytes 14 hours agorootparentI definitely agree that these sorts of videos have the potential to be a poor substitute for the real thing. Sometimes I notice that I&#x27;ve spent all my time watching videos about stuff I&#x27;m interested in and not actually doing the stuff I&#x27;m interested in. On the flip side though, as another commenter mentioned, they have the potential to serve as motivation too. For example, when I&#x27;m learning a particular technique on guitar I&#x27;ll intentionally watch or listen to performances that exemplify what I want to learn in order to remind myself of how great it&#x27;d be to play that and of why I&#x27;m training. I find it helps boost and sustain motivation. Of course it can&#x27;t be the only thing I do, but when I can&#x27;t practice (much) on guitar because, say, I&#x27;m eating lunch and need both hands, I can loop some Paul Gilbert or EVH performances and get fired up for the next practice session. reply ecuzzillo 13 hours agorootparentprevYou might be unfair to yourself in the sense that not all hours are created equal; some hours were never going to be productive hours, and so if you can immerse yourself in a subject with some easy-to-watch videos, that might be better than trying to force productivity where none is available. reply JohnBooty 12 hours agorootparentprevnext [–]the problem i have with educational youtube is that it&#x27;s competence porn. it&#x27;s quite satisfyingIt&#x27;s a balance we all need to find, for sure -- competence porn vs. actual practice.I think it&#x27;s only a problem when you fool yourself and&#x2F;or hurt yourself.Late in 2023 I started watching some streaming coders (a thing I did not know existed) and I&#x27;ve found it beneficial. Definitely exposed to some things I wouldn&#x27;t have been otherwise. reply coeneedell 15 hours agorootparentprevIt’s interesting to hear your perspective. I personally have had the opposite effect from watching these people on YouTube. I find it highly inspirational and I’ve gone out and made interesting projects on my own without them. Not all educational content needs to be structured like school, in fact most of it shouldn’t. With this stuff it just needs to humanize the process, so you can see the process for yourself, and follow it for yourself. reply redraga 5 hours agorootparentprevI completely agree with this observation. In fact, you can use this to your advantage to save time. During the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, Blizzard released \"Classic\" World of Warcraft and I had this huge itch to play the game. I satisfied it by watching YouTube videos on Classic WoW instead.Did I waste time watching WoW YouTube videos? Yes. Did I save much more time by tricking my brain into thinking I was playing the game when I actually wasn&#x27;t? Yes! reply sireat 2 hours agorootparentSimilarly, Doug DeMuro quirks videos have saved me millions (which I do not have) on 80s and 90s dream cars.That Porsche 928 or Lamborghini Countach or the ultimate teenage dream Vector W8? Fun to look at the videos but realistically it would not be fun to own and maintain one. reply goldcd 8 hours agorootparentprevI think of it more like learning a language. Yes, you have to put the effort in and learn your grammar and basic vocab yourself - but in conjunction you want to immerse yourself into hearing experts speak it. Watching a film you fancy with subtitles or another audio stream is still mainly entertainment, but it&#x27;s making you better. Every person who&#x27;s picked up an instrument has done so, so they can play something they heard and enjoyed.Also - I don&#x27;t need to master something. I like the messing about. Occasionally you&#x27;ll later stumble across a problem you&#x27;d accidentally learnt the answer to - and that&#x27;s gratifying, but it was never the point. reply pixl97 14 hours agorootparentprevThe particular problem I have with your reply is it is half wrong.Textbooks tend to be filled with crap themselves.

Basically he says that subtitling and dubbing are done by different teams with different goals. The dubbing crew tries to match lip movement. OK, so why not use the script that the dubbing team produced for the subtitles? Why do the translation twice?His explanation for that: (a) sometimes what&#x27;s spoken is too long to fit as subtitles on the screen, (b) what&#x27;s spoken needs to be summarized, like multiple people shouting over one another on a reality show, otherwise the subtitles would be a confusing jumble of words, and (c) jokes&#x2F;slang&#x2F;puns can be difficult to translate.I that agree (a) and (b) are legitimate reasons why subtitles might occasionally not match dubbing, but (c) is irrelevant. Jokes&#x2F;slang&#x2F;puns might be difficult or impossible to translate, but whatever way it ends up being translated can be spoken and written identically. In fact his goose joke is spoken and written in Portuguese as Eu estou gansado deles in the same way (timecode 3:57). I.e., the dubbing matches the subtitles. So the examples he gives do not support what he did in his own video.Furthermore, his video (like almost all videos and TV shows) is chock full of cases where the subtitles and dubbing are different for no plausible reason related to (a), (b), or (c) above:All examples below are when the video is set to Brazilian Portuguese audio and Brazilian Portuguese subtitles. Time: 0:22 Dubbing: E o motivo disso é que as legendas e a dublagem ... Subtitles: Isso acontece porque as legendas e a dublagem ... Time: 0:51 D: as legendas e a dublagem são praticamente idênticas S: as legendas e a dublagem são quase idênticas Time: 1:08 D: é sincronizar o movimento dos lábios o mais próximo possível S: é sincronizar os lábios o mais próximo possívelAlthough I agree that reasons (a) and (b) above might be valid on rare occasions, I think the real reason that subtitles don&#x27;t match dubbing is because they are done by different teams with no coordination, with different timelines and deadlines, and probably by completely different companies in different countries.If you cared strongly about this issue, I don&#x27;t see any reason why the subtitles and dubbing couldn&#x27;t be 99% or 99.9% identical in any particular target language. The 1% or 0.1% case being when the dialog is much too long for the screen or when you have to summarize a bunch of people talking simultaneously. reply eozoon 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s been a while since I watch that video, but I&#x27;m pretty sure he mentioned the different team working on it reason as well, and the rest of the video was only explaining the intentional differences instead of the inherent differences that comes from different people working on the translations?Where I live, due different dialects being widely in use, it&#x27;s common for TV and movies to show subtitle in the same language as the spoken language. Even then, it is not uncommon for the subtitle to deviate from what is spoken.Also, as an English learner I used to watch TV shows with subtitles for the visually impaired, and there are times when the English subtitle deviate from what&#x27;s the actors says as well.Sometimes it&#x27;s phrases that are commonly use in speech but strange to see written down; sometimes it&#x27;s just tonal things that would get lost if written as-is; sometimes long speech is summarized so it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; become a wall of text; sometimes it&#x27;s most likely to just be mistakes.Unless the difference actually contains significantly different meaning and can lead to misunderstanding, I don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;d an issue that is worth spending the effort on eliminating?Especially when it comes to translation, it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s only one possible way of translating a sentence, who should make the editorial choice on which version is best and would that even be helpful for the purpose of disseminating information? If anything, having two version is probably better for gaging the tone and nuance in the original language. reply alister 6 hours agorootparent> Unless the difference actually contains significantly different meaning and can lead to misunderstanding, I don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;d an issueThe following are some of the reasons why it&#x27;s very desirable that audio and subtitles should match:(1) It&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re trying to learn a language or to watch in a language in which you&#x27;re not fluent. It&#x27;s extremely frustrating when the audio and subtitles don&#x27;t match. This point is made by many people in the comments to the video[1].(2) Even if you&#x27;re fluent in the language, if you&#x27;re watching with both audio and subtitles enabled, it&#x27;s jarring when they don&#x27;t match.(3) If you didn&#x27;t understand something in the audio (because of poor pronunciation, poor sound quality, or whatever), and you turn on subtitles to see what was said, you expect to see exactly what was said, not something \"similar in meaning\".(4) A reason quoted directly from the YouTube comments[1] (which I think is a more common a problem that people realize): As someone with sensory processing issues but technically normal hearing - sometimes understanding what i&#x27;m hearing comes with a short delay, and accurate subtitles help bridge that gap so I can still keep pace with what i&#x27;m watching! If the subtitles don&#x27;t match, however, it can COMPLETELY throw me off because of the conflict in information and I end up more confused than if i&#x27;d only read the subtitles or only listened to the audio. Accurate subtitles are an accessibility feature!> phrases that are commonly use in speech but strange to see written downI&#x27;m curious to know if you can give an example of that?[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pU9sHwNKc2c reply lifthrasiir 5 hours agorootparentAs someone who did work on subtitles in modestly popular videos as well, I believe there should be two subtitles---one for disabled peoples and one for language learners. They serve overlapping but not entirely identical purposes. The point 1 is well said though I think Tom Scott aimed his subtitles mostly to the former, as like television regulations.The points 2 and 3 are comparably of less concern in my opinion. I don&#x27;t watch TV nowadays, but when I did I used to watch programmes with on-screen captions (as opposed to optional subtitles, pretty common in East Asian channels), which never faithfully reproduced what has been said, and I was fine. Maybe I was more annoyed if I were able to turn captions off and only occasionally turn them on, but the whole points don&#x27;t really match my experience.The point 4 is what I&#x27;m most unsure about. I believe this kind of experience can be replicated by who can hear some but not all of foreign words and need subtitles (of the second kind) to connect them. For example, I can hear and speak Japanese but very slowly, so I normally have Japanese subtitles turned on. And I think I often experienced a lack of understanding due to my weak knowledge of Japanese, but never experienced such a conflict in understanding. Maybe the sensory processing issue has a substantially different mechanism to my model then?> I&#x27;m curious to know if you can give an example of that?Filler words, cut-off words, etc. Faithful transcriptions need to reproduce them (and yes, I also did some transcription works and that was really annoying) but subtitles needn&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t in most cases. replyvorticalbox 15 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve lost a lot of my hearing so I play games, watch videos and people who put effort into subtitles are very much appreciated.Simple things like tagging who is talking is so helpful to understanding what is going on when there are multiple people in the video reply Twirrim 15 hours agorootparentIn a number of his videos, they&#x27;ll use different colours for different speakers.

It&#x27;s a way of coding up points in the Unicode space. You decode the bits and it yields a number that corresponds to a glyph, possibly with some decorations. The only thing special about UTF8 is that it happens to write ASCII as ASCII, which is nice as long as you realize that there is much outside that.Either that, or I&#x27;m completely off base and part of the vast horde who don&#x27;t get it. reply Dylan16807 15 hours agorootparentVariable width encodings are inherently harder to understand.And while UTF-8 tries very hard to be simple whenever possible, it does have some nonobvious constraints that make it significantly more complex than the actual simplest variable-width encoding (a continuation bit and then 7 data bits). reply asveikau 14 hours agorootparentUnicode is variable length even if you use 32 bits, because glyphs sometimes require multiple codepoints.

Interesting how that can be the main factor -- maybe both in keeping people&#x27;s interest, but also developing the skills to create content that was improving each time and becoming more engaging.

The search results are very clearly the right thing. replyimiric 15 hours agoprevI always appreciate when authors of successful projects decide to stop after they&#x27;ve figured out the formula for success. Whether these are films without sequels, TV shows without dozens of seasons, or video content creators who are not compelled to keep uploading in perpetuity. It shows true care and dedication to their craft, and a desire to keep innovating in perhaps other areas of their career. It also avoids the pressure of keeping the high bar for quality, as there are not many authors who can consistently pull this off. I&#x27;d rather enjoy high quality content for a short time than see it gradually worsen over a long period.Still, 10 years is a long run for any type of content, and uploading every week without fail is very impressive. I&#x27;m sure Tom Scott used the \"Seinfeld strategy\" for this, which goes to show that great minds think alike, considering Seinfeld is one of the shows that ended at the peak of its success.Thanks for the interesting content over the years, Tom, and best of luck in whatever you decide to pursue next. reply leros 12 hours agoparentHe&#x27;s in a nice position in that he&#x27;s diversified his content with a game show and podcast, so he can stop his main channel content and still have some income flowing.

    "originLink": "https://solvingprocrastination.com/perfectionism/",
    "originBody": "Perfectionism and Procrastination: How They’re Connected and What to Do About It Procrastination is a common issue, which occurs when people unnecessarily postpone decisions or actions, generally despite knowing that doing so is likely to cause them issues. One reason why people procrastinate is perfectionism. For example, perfectionistic students might be so critical of themselves for making mistakes in school assignments, that they will postpone doing homework to avoid dealing with the associated negative emotions. Similarly, perfectionistic writers might be so worried about their book being criticized, that they will delay sending the book for feedback. The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination can have serious implications, so it’s important to understand it. As such, in the following article you will learn more about how perfectionism and procrastination are connected, and see what you can do about this in practice. Contents The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination Associated psychological mechanisms Other causes of procrastination Perfectionistic procrastinators Dealing with perfectionistic procrastination The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination is complex, and depends on the specific aspects of perfectionism that a person has: Some aspects of perfectionism generally increase procrastination. These include, most notably, perfectionistic concerns, which are characterized primarily by critical and negative self-evaluations, excessive preoccupation with other people’s expectations, lack of satisfaction from successful performance, excessive worry over making mistakes, and doubts about one’s abilities and actions, often in irrational ways or to irrational degrees. Such concerns represent the more maladaptive side of perfectionism, since they generally lead people to experience negative outcomes, in terms of factors such as their performance and wellbeing. For example, these concerns can lead a student to unnecessarily delay submitting their assignments, because they’re excessively worried that they’ve made mistakes. Some aspects of perfectionism generally decrease procrastination. These include, most notably, perfectionistic strivings, which are characterized primarily by setting and striving for excessively high personal standards, often with a focus on attaining flawlessness in one’s work. Such strivings represent the more adaptive side of perfectionism, since they generally lead people to experience positive outcomes, in terms of factors such as their performance and wellbeing. For example, these strivings can lead a student to submit all their assignments on time, because they want to get a perfect grade. Furthermore, other characteristics of people’s perfectionism can also play a role in determining how their perfectionism influences their procrastination. For example, socially-prescribed perfectionism, which involves people having high standards set for them by others, is more likely to increase procrastination, whereas self-oriented perfectionism, which involves people setting high standards for themselves, is more likely to decrease procrastination. In addition, various issues can influence people’s perfectionism, and the relationship between it and their procrastination. For example, when people receive parental criticism, this can exacerbate their perfectionistic concerns, which in turn can exacerbate their procrastination. Alternatively, when people have high self-efficacy, this can improve their ability to control any perfectionistic concerns that they have, which in turn can decrease their procrastination. In summary, perfectionism can either increase or decrease procrastination, depending on various factors. These factors include the aspects of perfectionism involved (e.g., concerns vs. strivings), the types of perfectionism involved (e.g., self-oriented vs. socially-prescribed), and personality traits, such as self-efficacy. This means that while perfectionism can sometimes cause procrastination, not all perfectionists procrastinate. Associated psychological mechanisms There are various ways in which perfectionism can lead to procrastination. For example, it can increase the negative emotions that people experience when they make mistakes, which leads people to delay their work as a way to delay the associated negative emotions. Alternatively, perfectionism can substantially increase people’s expectations of themselves, which increases the discrepancy between people’s current situation and their desired situation so much that their goals feel unattainable, which causes them to give up. These mechanisms can cause people to enter a perfectionism-procrastination cycle. For example, this can happen when someone’s perfectionism makes them afraid of negative feedback, which causes them to procrastinate, which leads them to perform poorly and get negative feedback, which makes them more afraid of getting negative feedback again in the future, and so on. Other causes of procrastination People can procrastinate for many reasons beyond perfectionism, such as anxiety, fear of failure, and depression. Accordingly, although perfectionism can sometimes lead to procrastination, not all procrastinators are perfectionists, and even those who are don’t necessarily procrastinate because of their perfectionism, or only because of it. Nevertheless, many other causes of procrastination, such as anxiety and fear of failure, are associated with perfectionism in various ways, for example by co-occurring with it, or by being involved in perfectionistic concerns. Perfectionistic procrastinators There’s no universal definition for what constitutes a perfectionistic procrastinator. Nevertheless, this term generally refers to people who suffer from substantial procrastination that’s caused primarily by their perfectionism. For example, an artist can be considered a perfectionistic procrastinator if they unnecessarily delay publishing their work for a long time, because they worry the public won’t think it’s perfect. In addition, the term “perfectionistic procrastinator” can be when perfectionism is only one of the key causes of a person’s procrastination, in conjunction with other key causes as descriptors. For example, if someone procrastinates due to a combination of perfectionism and depression, then they may be referred to as a perfectionistic and depressed procrastinator. Dealing with perfectionistic procrastination If you realize that your perfectionism is causing you to procrastinate, there are several key things that you can do about it: Set reasonable goals and standards. This doesn’t mean that you should aim low, but rather that you should assess the situation, to determine what performance will be good enough for you to achieve what you want and need to achieve. Focus on yourself, rather than on others. Many of the issues associated with perfectionism come from caring too much about what others expect of you, or about what others will say or think. If this is a problem for you, then you should instead focus on goals and standards that you set for yourself, and minimize the degree to which you care about other people’s opinions. Question and address your fears. For example, if you realize that you’re afraid of someone criticizing you for not having perfect work, you can ask yourself things such as “how likely is it that they will actually care if I make some small mistakes” or “so what if this person criticizes my work?”. When doing this, it could help to use self-distancing techniques, for example by asking yourself “why should you care so about making small mistakes?” or by considering what advice you would give to a friend if they were in your situation. Consider the negative impact of your perfectionism. For example, you might consider how your perfectionism-driven procrastination means that you’re not getting any feedback on your work, which is preventing you from making progress. Give yourself permission to make mistakes. For example, if you’re writing a paper, accept that your work won’t be perfect, especially when it comes to the first draft. Essentially, you should avoid an all-or-nothing approach, both when it comes to your work, and when it comes to your attempts to reduce procrastination (i.e., don’t let perfect become the enemy of good enough). Develop self-efficacy. Specifically, this is your belief in your ability to perform the actions needed to achieve your goals. You can develop it in various ways, such as identifying the strategies that you can use to achieve your goals, and then thinking about how you can execute those strategies successfully. Develop self-compassion. Specifically, you should develop the three components of self-compassion: self-kindness, which involves being nice to yourself, common humanity, which involves recognizing that everyone experiences challenges, and mindfulness, which involves accepting your emotions in a non-judgmental manner. There are many techniques for doing this, including some that are particularly relevant in the case of perfectionism, such as changing your critical self-talk to make it more positive and compassionate. Get support and encouragement from others. For example, you can talk with a professional therapist about your perfectionistic concerns, or you can ask a friend to be by your side and motivate you when it’s time to act. If you’re reluctant to ask for help because of your perfectionism, remind yourself that it’s perfectly fine and normal to ask for help, and that doing so can help you achieve better outcomes and feel better in the long term. Before choosing which of these techniques to use, you should assess your perfectionism and procrastination, to understand how they’re connected. This can help you figure out which specific aspects of your perfectionism you should address and how you should address them. In addition, there are many other anti-procrastination techniques that you might benefit from using to reduce your perfectionism-driven procrastination. These include the following: Break your work into small and manageable steps. For example, if you have a large project that feels overwhelming, such as writing a research paper, you can break it down into a series of small steps, such as creating an outline, finding relevant resources, and writing the introduction. Start with a tiny step. For example, commit to writing only a single sentence or exercising for only 2 minutes, while giving yourself permission to stop after taking that tiny first step, to reduce the pressure associated with getting started. Switch between tasks. For example, if you’re stuck on a task and can’t make progress, switch to a different task until you’re ready to go back to the first one. Acknowledge and reward your progress. For example, you can treat yourself to some pleasant treat once you’ve managed to achieve your study goals for a week in a row. Schedule your work according to your productivity cycles. For example, if you find it easier to concentrate on creative tasks in the morning, then you should schedule such tasks for that time period as much as possible. Improve your work environment. For example, if your current work environment has a lot of irritating background noise, get noise-canceling headphones or go somewhere quieter. Get enough rest. For example, if you need to work hard on tasks that require deep concentration, make sure to take enough breaks that you don’t get burnt out. To encourage yourself to do this, you can remind yourself that even if getting rest can reduce your productivity in the short term, it will often be much better for you in the long term, both in terms of your productivity and in terms of your wellbeing. Forgive yourself for past procrastination. For example, if you need to get started on a task that you’ve been postponing for a long time, you can say “I shouldn’t have postponed this task in the first place, but that’s in the past, and what’s important now is to move on and just get this done”. Before using these techniques, you should figure out why you procrastinate, especially if there are other reasons for your procrastination beyond perfectionism, as well as when and how you procrastinate. This will then help you find the best anti-procrastination techniques to use in your particular situation, and will also figure out how to use these techniques as effectively as possible.

When he&#x27;d have a bad day, he&#x27;d start picking apart a random team&#x27;s product. \"Unbelievable!\" he&#x27;d say in Slack, dropping a screen recording of the app that showed something we were supposed to be embarrassed about. It could be that the app took 3 seconds to load and show fresh data from his hotel WiFi, or it could be as simple as the UI not matching some directive he gave to the UI designers who failed to update the designs or tell us about the change. He would rant about how disappointing we were. At his worst, he fired some people on the spot for a problem that wasn&#x27;t even their fault.I quickly learned that the only way to avoid that pain was to not ship anything. The people he liked most were the ones who were operating in hypotheticals: The people who made UI designs in Figma, or the architects who drew nice diagrams about how things would work, or the people who wrote long design documents to hand to other teams. They never shipped anything for him to critique, so he thought they were the geniuses of the company. As long as they could avoid having to actually implement anything, they continued to be favorites.It took me longer than I like to admit to shake that habit when I finally escaped. I found myself delaying shipment, pivoting from design doc to design doc, and trying to operate in that hypothetical space as long as I could. Fortunately I learned to get over it, but it was scary how much that single job could shape a large part of my personality. reply CooCooCaCha 15 hours agoparentYou put into words something I&#x27;ve had a hard time understanding for a long time. Some people really do have a clear preference for people who don&#x27;t ship.Out of curiosity, what kind of background did your toxic boss have? Is it technical or business side?I have a couple hunches for why this happens: 1. These people are dreamers and dislike people who bring them back down to reality, even if they need those people to actually build things.2. They feel superior to people on the ground doing the building. Like they&#x27;re above getting their hands dirty. reply majormajor 8 hours agorootparent> 1.

In my experiences, they also tend to insist on saying \"everything needs to go through me\", but never make time to follow through - out of laziness. This gives a high ROI on effort expended to stress created.The best times I had with these people (when I was beyond caring) was laying low and doing launches semi covertly, so that there was time for clients to provide positive feedback and praise first. Then play dumb and deliver news about launch and feedback as a package. reply jayd16 14 hours agorootparentprevIs this true?

Narcissists gather so called “flying monkeys” around them which fuel their sense of superiority and they bind them through various techniques to them (until they are also discarded). In this case the narcissist the PowerPoint-mockup people are these flying monkeys, feeding the narcissist all the grandiose ideas and it gives the narcissist a high for going towards that idea - similar how somebody just announcing they will do a hard task, e.g. stop smoking will make somebody feel good immediately before even reaching that goal.Then, the people to whom the actual task of implementing it was left can’t deliver the grandiose perfectionist idea, and the narcissistic boss can and actually wants to fiercely abuse their power over them in order to feed on the high of superiority and control over them. It’s the perfect position for this kind of person, they can feel high all the time (eventually the tolerance will kick in and the boss must leave though but this can take some time).Organization-wise it’s a bad boss really. It’s the job of the creatives to come up with great ideas, then the boss should moderate that working together with the feedback from the implementers. Instead the boss is due to personal weakness too suggestible against the creatives and puts the damage of his own making on to the team with bullying. reply primitivesuave 16 hours agoparentprevThis so accurately describes my own experience a couple years ago, down to the specific anecdotes, that I had to double check the username to make sure it wasn’t something I drunkenly wrote last night. reply Chungjiloll 17 hours agoparentprevAurornis really hit the nail on the head about how a toxic boss can twist your work habits into a loop of perfectionism and procrastination.

I often do side projects with two goals: there&#x27;s something I want to exist, and something I want to learn. And I&#x27;ll learn that thing by using it to build something I want.At one point, the thing I wanted to learn was \"call something done\". So I did that, and because it was a side project with learning as an explicit goal, I was able to actually do that - it was literally impossible to ship something imperfect, as shipping would already mean I&#x27;d perfectly reached my goal.But that turned out to be enough faking it to make it - the feeling of shipping it felt good, and gave me the confidence to spend a small amount of time to polish my side projects up enough for shipping, rather than a large amount of time to do everything I want. And it&#x27;s way more fun now to be able to occasionally pull up an old side project of mine that&#x27;s still usable, because I got it to a usable state in the first place.(In case anyone&#x27;s interested, you can see the project, and how small its scope was, at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agripongit.vincenttunru.com.) reply garrickvanburen 15 hours agorootparentprevThe best I’ve been able to do is: if perfection == high quality, then shipping smaller iterations faster is the most cost-effective means of improving quality. reply groestl 14 hours agorootparentI did that too :) I learned that sometimes, I&#x27;d ship the perfect wrong thing.

Even small things, order something from amazon, you have to wait in to get it, the delivery might get messed up, it might be the wrong thing, it might not work etc, doing something requires more doing, it increases the changes of frustration&#x2F;annoying things to happen, when doing noting often seems like it doesn&#x27;t cause much issue. This is perhaps why even the smaller tasks are an issue, because the downsides of not doing it are less apparent. It&#x27;s no wonder we want to procrastinate.The trick I think is to meditate on the idea of momento mori, as the stoics did, remember your time here is limited and also reflect on the negative of not having done or achieved things, because the mind automatically considers the negative of doing something and wants to protect you from that. reply sjfjsjdjwvwvc 19 hours agoprev„ We need to think about failure differently. I’m not the first to say that failure, when approached properly, can be an opportunity for growth. But the way most people interpret this assertion is that mistakes are a necessary evil. Mistakes aren’t a necessary evil. They aren’t evil at all. They are an inevitable consequence of doing something new (and, as such, should be seen as valuable; without them, we’d have no originality). And yet, even as I say that embracing failure is an important part of learning, I also acknowledge that acknowledging this truth is not enough. That’s because failure is painful, and our feelings about this pain tend to screw up our understanding of its worth.

If they never finish the task, they can&#x27;t experience that disappointment. Some of them will happily do nothing at all, walk around, or daydream to avoid even engaging with their computer, because engaging with the computer would remind them that they&#x27;re procrastinating, which would remind them that failure to deliver is also imperfection.> Of course, this requires some discipline and self-awareness.Unfortunately, the people with the worst procrastination problems are in their situation largely due to a lack of discipline and self-awareness in some variation. reply Modified3019 13 hours agorootparentAgree with this, from personal experience.

If you give them amphetamines you see exactly the same problems, but with the boundless energy amphetamines give you. When you give amphetamines to ADHD children they visibly and noticeably become calmer, quieter, and more focused. If you did not come into it with the predetermined idea that this drug is \"speed\" you would certainly not arrive there from watching the behavior of medicated children with ADHD.You were addicted to twitter good for you for solving your problems. Don&#x27;t extrapolate that experience out to kids though. ADHD is fucked up, life ruining stuff. Look at the rates for drug abuse, car crashes and incarceration for adults with untreated ADHD. This sort of scare mongering makes it less likely for children to access effective treatment when it can be most impactful on their lives. It is harmful and you should be ashamed. reply sersi 17 hours agorootparentThanks for your comment. I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult late (after 4 x 2 hours sessions with extensive questionnaires and iq test). Originally I was really worried that I&#x27;d be incorrectly diagnosed with ADHD despite not having it so was reassured by how serious the process was.One thing that jumped out at me though with regards to your comment about medicine. I started taking concerta and quickly noticed that if I&#x27;m the slightest bit sleep deprived, concerta doesn&#x27;t amp me, it doesn&#x27;t make me have more energy but instead it makes me sleepy. With it, I&#x27;m visibly calmer and quieter and I also have a lot less craving for chocolates (which I&#x27;d keep eating non-stop during the day). It&#x27;s quite magical actually. reply teunispeters 7 hours agorootparentprevI have a suspicion the high rate of ADHD may be related to the low rate of employment in kinaesthetic jobs (eg construction, farming, even to a great degree historical militaries) and high rates of high-attention-demand work - which yes, I&#x27;ll include most fast food industry.That said ADHD runs through my family like a (mad) bull in a china shop, and yes, hence very much voting this comment up. Lots of individual things can help - getting enough sleep for one, enough exercise ... but at the end of the day, one has to be reasonable and accept that medicines help.An aside : children under a certain age, one can&#x27;t (safely) detect ADHD because the symptoms are \"ordinary behaviour\".

It was due to the link title \"solvingprocrastination\", as that name framed procrastination as a thing that needed to be \"solved\" somehow.I&#x27;m sure that for some, sometimes that is the case. For me, not much so.See, procrastination is a tool. It allows my subconscious to review and analyse a problem field while I keep my conscious self engaged with something else. Preferably solving some other issue. Rarely entertainment. I guess the situations where I&#x27;d want to peruse entertainment are not that often situations where I have important stuff to do, but I don&#x27;t know. (I&#x27;m thinking mostly @job here, not leisure time)What I do when faced with a problem that needs a solution, but for some reason or other I have no obvious \"attack vector\" (just to make a poor pun on the HN site name) it this: I do nothing. That is, I do something of course, especially if it&#x27;s at $job: I do something else. Go solve some other task.

But it works great. reply sylware 20 hours agoprevAs a public open source (yep, open source can be private) programmer (currently x86_64 assembly), and I am very aware of this pitfall.It is very important to move forward in code, because you cannot predict how will actually end up a complex program: you need to have all the (sane) features in to actually know. Since code is all about trade-offs, there is \"no perfect\".You have to be carefull at avoiding falling into a mental spinning loop about this.Once you have a reasonable minimum of usable features in, publish it. It help breaking such mental loop.For instance, currently writing a printf implementation, and printf specs are already brain damaged by themselves, so I am not looking for perfection, far from it. I did set myself a minimal set of features (full format decoding, hexadecimal and byte strings) before publishing it. Until it does not require the complexity of a compiler, does a good enough job, I&#x27;ll be happy.Sometimes it is not about perfectionism, but a question of resourses required to achieve something reasonably working: you have a montain to deal with just to get something minimaly working, and you are given a spoon... when you are lucky. reply GuB-42 19 hours agoparentIsn&#x27;t assembly programming already a form of perfectionism in itself.

But I am not alone, and some did assembly written printf like functions (gogol).The actual real way to work around the inappropriate complexity of that function is to remove it and switch to a brutal \"put string\" with string conversion functions (with space allocated on the stack). In the end it would be not that much more work in most cases, then in the end I may not even use my assembly code, but lower some printf function usage to what I said. reply CoastalCoder 15 hours agorootparentAh, thanks.

It is intriguing.In light of the need for community, talking about plans might be seen as a way to search for ideas that could have group buy-in and become something to undertake together. Failure to move forward on those plans would reflect that the group interest just wasn’t there. The mistake would have been in assuming you would have ever pursued the goal independently, the social impulse to share could have been the hint.Shared interests between friends can help individual interests and goals become collective ones.Ecclesiastes: one may be overcome (by the exhaustion of going to the gym), two can defend themselves (against lapsing on their New Year’s resolution).

Although I haven&#x27;t invested any thought in it, I would&#x27;ve assumed that announcing plans would have the opposite effect because people are now watching and know what you&#x27;re trying to achieve, so you&#x27;d be more motivated to avoid losing face.

    "title": "Enhanced Public Domain Ebooks by Standard Ebooks",
    "originLink": "https://standardebooks.org/",
    "originBody": "Free and liberated ebooks, carefully produced for the true book lover. Standard Ebooks is a volunteer-driven project that produces new editions of public domain ebooks that are lovingly formatted, open source, free of U.S. copyright restrictions, and free of cost. Ebook projects like Project Gutenberg transcribe ebooks and make them available for the widest number of reading devices. Standard Ebooks takes ebooks from sources like Project Gutenberg, formats and typesets them using a carefully designed and professional-grade style manual, fully proofreads and corrects them, and then builds them to create a new edition that takes advantage of state-of-the-art ereader and browser technology. Standard Ebooks aren’t just a beautiful addition to your digital library—they’re a high quality standard to build your own ebooks on. Browse our library of free ebooks What makes Standard Ebooks different? Modern & consistent typography Other free ebooks don’t put much effort into professional-quality typography: they use \"straight\" quotes instead of “curly” quotes, they ignore details like em- and en-dashes, and they look more like early-90’s web pages instead of actual books. Standard Ebooks applies a rigorous and modern style manual when developing each and every ebook to ensure they meet a professional-grade and consistent typographical standard. Our ebooks look good. Full proofing with careful corrections Transcriptions from other sources are often filled with typos or suffer from issues like inconsistent spelling, missing accent marks, or missing punctuation. Submitting corrections to such sources can be difficult or impossible, so errors are rarely fixed. At Standard Ebooks, we do a careful and complete readthrough of each ebook before releasing it, checking it against a scan of the original pages to fix as many typos as possible. Even if we do miss something, our ebooks are stored in the hugely popular Git source control system, allowing anyone to easily submit a correction. Rich & detailed metadata Our ebooks include complete, well-researched, and consistent metadata, including original, detailed book blurbs and links to encyclopedia sources. Perfect for machine processing or for extra-curious, technically-minded readers. State-of-the-art technology Each Standard Ebook takes full advantage of the latest ereader technology, including: Hyphenation support, Popup footnotes, High-resolution and scalable vector graphics, Ereader-compatible tables of contents, and more. One of our goals is to ensure our ebooks stay up-to-date with the best reading experience technology can provide. Just because it’s a classic doesn’t mean it has to use old technology. Quality covers Everyone knows a book is judged by its cover, but most free ebooks leave it to your ereader software to generate a drab default cover. Standard Ebooks draws from a vast collection of public domain fine art to create attractive, unique, appropriate, and consistent covers for each of our ebooks. Clean code & semantic markup Our strict coding standards allow technologists and ebook producers to use Standard Ebooks files as reliable, easy to read, and robust bases for their own work—not to mention as models of what well-crafted ebook files look like. Common code patterns are repeated through different ebooks, so the code never surprises you. Each ebook is also enhanced with careful standards-based semantic markup that opens the gateway for exciting new kinds of machine processing. Free, open-source, & public domain We use the popular Git source control system to track each and every change made to our ebooks. Anyone can easily see a history of changes, or contribute their own changes with the click of a mouse. And while all of the ebooks we feature and the cover art we draw from are already believed to be in the public domain in the U.S., Standard Ebooks releases all of the work we put in to each ebook into the public domain too. That makes each and every one of our ebook files not just free, but libre too—because the world deserves more unrestricted culture.",

I&#x27;ve often found it to be the easiest way to get non-store books on my Kindle. I&#x27;ve also noticed that cover images are handled correctly when the ebook is downloaded straight onto the device, with no need for a separate image file.A hurdle for this though, is that building a good website for the Kindle browser is a pain, as the browser&#x27;s support for various html&#x2F;css&#x2F;js features and standards is all over the place, with no debugging tools available. reply acabal 13 hours agorootparentI believe our website does have some basic Kindle browser support.

It makes it harder to distinguish when looking at a list of open tabs.

It feels SEO-ish; not sure why that would be a priority for a free culture project like Standard Ebooks, especially give the momentum and cachet it already has.)Collections should also have placeholders for unavailable titles. For example, currently the \"Utopian Trilogy\" collection[4] contains exactly one item, in spite of the true size of the set it actually belongs to. When an item is not available because of copyright, that (along with the year in which SE will first be allowed to make its own edition available) should be made clear. Where it&#x27;s unavailable because no one has yet proofed the text for an SE edition, a clear call to action can be made.And it&#x27;s seemingly minor, but on the subject of editions, I wish SE followed closer to the print tradition instead of the modern Web millieu and clearly identified its microeditions as exactly that: distinct editions of the same text. (Yes, that means there are possibly dozens (or hundreds?) of different editions, given that errors can be found after the fact and the SE house style may even change, necessitating updates. No, that&#x27;s not a problem.)1. 2. 3. 4.reply Jiro 8 hours agorootparent>The pagefor collections could stand to lose the \"Browse free ebooks in the\" preamble.That looks like it might be search engine optimization. reply cxr 8 hours agorootparentIt seems like maybe it&#x27;s for SEO. reply Lukas_S 15 hours agoparentprevThis is such a cool project.

A kind of SE Wrapped thingy? reply devashishp 12 hours agoparentprevI’m curious, why do you have a policy against hosting religious books? reply weijiacheng 12 hours agorootparentThe site actually hosts several \"religious books\" (try filtering by the \"Spirituality\" tag -- I&#x27;ve even produced several books on religious topics myself for SE). What it doesn&#x27;t host are \"Religious texts from modern world religions\" (what some might call \"scriptures,\" e.g. the Bible or the Quran) which is a much narrower category than \"religious books.\"As a religious person myself, I actually think this policy is very sensible. Most (nearly all?) religious texts of major world religions were originally written in languages other than English, and so if SE were to try to host those texts the site would have to make an editorial call about which translations of those texts are the \"best.\" That quickly enters very murky theological territory, where one side of a given religion might push for one particular translation, whereas another side would push for another translation.To give the Bible as an example, Catholics and Orthodox Christians include the deuterocanonical books (e.g. Tobit, Judith, Sirach) in their canons whereas Protestants exclude these. Would the SE version of the Bible include these? Some American fundamentalist Christians claim that the King James Version is the only valid English translation of the Bible, whereas the Revised Version (also available in the public domain) is based on more reliable Greek manuscripts. But some conservative Christians reject the Revised Version and its descendants based on certain theological premises...Do you catch my drift? IMHO it&#x27;s very sensible for SE to avoid these sorts of debates entirely by sticking to books where you could argue (with some degree of handwaving) that there really is a \"best version\" :) reply devashishp 5 hours agorootparentI think that makes sense, but it still seems a bit arbitrary, I don’t see bookshops having these issues reply weijiacheng 4 hours agorootparentYes, bookshops will sell one version of the Bible to Catholics, another to Protestants, another to fundamentalists, another to progressives, etc. :)In contrast, part of the SE editorial philosophy is that it tries to host the best (based on academic scholarship, translation quality, academic acclaim, etc.) version of each text available in the public domain, which excludes that \"something for everyone\" sort of play available to a commercial bookstore. You could rightly argue that this is losing something (it&#x27;s good to have multiple translations to compare if you&#x27;re reading a text for critical purposes), but the SE editorial philosophy avoids a certain amount of confusion and clutter for the general reader. So there&#x27;s a deliberate (you could call it \"arbitrary\" in some sense, if you wish) tradeoff being made here. reply opminion 1 hour agorootparentprevUS Barnes & Noble can have a few meters of shelves with different versions of the Bible, and a buying guide.

Em-dashes, curly quotes, etc. are all nice, it&#x27;s a step in the right direction, but in the end the EPUB file needs to be interpreted by the ebook reader on the fly and in terms of typesetting quality the outcome is far from what physical books provide, since you still get orphans, weird hyphenations, ugly&#x2F;misaligned chapter titles. For me, nothing beats reading a print-ready PDF file. reply acabal 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a common request but there are no plans to officially offer PDFs. We offer a variety of reflowable file formats, and each format is more burden to maintain; since PDF is a famously difficult format, maintaining it would be even more burden. A reader requiring a PDF can use a tool to convert any of our files to PDF. That&#x27;s basically what we&#x27;d do at the end of the day, anyway.There&#x27;s been some mailing list chatter lately on how to best format PDF editions, but that&#x27;s not being pursued on a project level. reply NelsonMinar 15 hours agoparentprevThank you for Standard Books!I remember when Manybooks used to be what you want. But quality dropped precipitously with self-published new novels, I suspect some money is changing hands somewhere.What happened to Manybooks? Does Standard Books have a plan for avoiding that? reply acabal 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know anything about Manybooks&#x27; history, sorry.At SE we focus exclusively on US public domain titles; that&#x27;s one of the major philosophical points of the project. The other major point is a high quality standard, so it&#x27;s in our best interest to keep pursuing that. SE became known due to its quality standard, not because it&#x27;s more free ebooks. Therefore if we strayed from those points then we&#x27;d be just another free ebook site, of which there are no shortage.Quality is also why we reject self-published books that have been dedicated to the public domain, as those are typically low-quality content to begin with. (Though I wouldn&#x27;t call every single book we host \"high quality content\" in the sense that each one is up there with Shakespeare. But books that have survived a hundred years tend to have survived because they&#x27;re not slush.) reply boznz 5 hours agorootparentprevGood to know that as a self-published author myself that the quality of any site is going to drop as soon as I put my book on there.Every other book I read now is by an author with NO rating, I have read six this year, none were memorable, or my cup of tea I will give you that, but two of the four- or five-star offerings on Amazon were just as bad.

In the link above, it mentions how Kindle converts epub to an Amazon format before allowing your device to read it. Amazon&#x27;s formats on the whole are inferior, with poor rendering capabilities, and an automatic conversion means all bets are off in terms of what the ebook will look like.Kindle will not natively support epub until you can connect it to a USB cable, transfer an epub using a file manager, and it does not get secretly converted. reply boznz 4 hours agorootparentI did not know that and does kind of explain one book with pictures that looked a bit weird.

Raw PHP code is legendarily insecure and prone to XSS and other issues if you don&#x27;t do things exactly right.Nice site, though. reply cowsandmilk 11 hours agorootparent> prone to XSS and other issues if you don&#x27;t do things exactly right.Not any more so than sites with frameworks. I’ve found XSS issues in Java Spring framework built sites that didn’t “do things exactly right”. A framework doesn’t magically fix that. reply krapp 11 hours agorootparentNo one mentioned magic. Frameworks are designed to do what PHP developers wind up implementing in an ad-hoc, haphazard way themselves, and tend to be better at doing it on average. Any code can have security issues but I&#x27;d trust a battle-hardened open source PHP framework over some random coder&#x27;s hubris any day of the week. reply mmastrac 17 hours agoprevI published a couple of books for the project during a sabbatical in 2021 (The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary [0] and a cheesy, small H. Beam Piper book named Four-Day Planet).The process and tools are quite nice and it&#x27;s very rewarding to see your work in ebook form. It takes a _long_ time to proof and re-read a book, but it&#x27;s surprising how many times you can do this and how differently you need to read to catch errors versus just enjoying the damn book.The fascinating part of the project is a _strong_ editorial opinion, which IMO makes the project successful. There is a core group of people that upholds the standards for the project, and the resulting consistency of quality of output derives from that. The team clearly cares about the quality, and has demonstrably maintained that over the huge number of releases.I even went to the archives of the \"San Francisco Newletter and California Advertiser\" to collect some of Bierce&#x27;s original work, making it the most complete, and most corrected open-source version of the book. [1] The one previously hosted by Project Gutenburg was quite old and, frankly, quite riddled with transcription errors.I haven&#x27;t tried reading the Devil&#x27;s Dictionary back-to-back since I published it, but I might one day. There&#x27;s a lot of detail in this work that I never saw until I had it under a microscope.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;standardebooks.org&#x2F;ebooks&#x2F;ambrose-bierce&#x2F;the-devils-...[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;san-francisco-newletter-dec-11-1... reply NKosmatos 16 hours agoprevFor other curious HNers, what differentiates [0] them from Project Gutenberg [1] is the improved typography&#x2F;styling and the full usage of modern reader techniques.

Particularly the typography ones like curly quotes and proper dashes, as those are almost always corrections where the overly-ASCII Gutenberg source doesn’t match the original. reply acabal 15 hours agorootparentLike PG, our editions are blends of other editions, along with our own updates. Often our edition winds up looking nothing like the PG edition, for example when we combine volumes, extract footnotes into endnotes, remove pagination, and so on.So submitting back to PG would be more like replacing a PG edition, instead of updating it; and I doubt the original PG submitter would like it if their hard work was simply replaced by someone else who thought their version was an improvement.Our volunteers do sometimes submit typos they find back to PG. We don&#x27;t require that, so some producers do, and others don&#x27;t. reply chrismorgan 14 hours agorootparentYeah, I was just looking through A Christmas Carol and observed a handful of editorial changes in the commits(bran-new → brand-new, frouzy → frowzy, and “Lowercase some gratuitously uppercased words”). Frouzy → frowzy I’m mildly in favour of. Ditching bran-new definitely loses character (he omitted the d on purpose!). One or two of the lowercased words were mildly strange capitalised (e.g. Idol was inconsistent with the previous paragraph); but the lowercasing of many introduces broad stylistic inconsistency, and direct local inconsistency sometimes; and most of the capitalisations were not gratuitous. In fact, more than a few were clearly to be pronounced, as a form of emphasis (e.g. Poor, One, Us); and some were distinctly proper nouns in the context, the removal of which increases the parse difficulty (e.g. One¹, &#x2F;(Cold )?(Roast|Boiled)&#x2F;); and some reflect customs still common or even preferred in their domains (e.g. Act, Angelic, Apostles, Star). I just reckon that commit should be reverted, because from my perspective it’s mostly actively bad, and the rest subjective. I’m curious what your reaction is to my opinion here.But yes, I see that you’re practising some editorial oversight and not aiming to faithfully represent the original in all regards, which I gather is more generally Project Gutenberg’s goal; and this would obviously contraindicate upstreaming.On the other hand, when it comes to more stylistic matters, I tend to wish Project Gutenberg had more consistency. There’s too much gratuitous variation in presentation and ridiculous 256-colour backgrounds. It’s often too obvious much of it is the work of a group of individuals rather than a coherent effort.I’m curious about the footnote-to-endnote thing, because I’m not sure how the various formats in question handle them all, but in print endnotes are almost always just awful. If anything, I’d be expecting to replace endnotes with footnotes. (Me, I’m partial to sidenotes.)—⁂—¹ Hickory dickory dock, three mice ran up the clock; the clock struck one, and has been charged with assault and battery. reply wharvle 11 hours agorootparentYeah, any edition of a book that&#x27;s \"updating\" modern English loses me, including messing with capitalization. Not interested. I love the formatting on Standard Ebooks, but they&#x27;re no use to me if they&#x27;re \"updating\" language, aside from things like repairing typesetting and formatting lost or mangled in PG editions.Agree on notes in print, side notes (on very-wide editions) are best, then foot, then end of chapter endnotes. Full end-of-work endnotes are awful. Maybe they&#x27;re better in ebooks, than footnotes, though? E-readers&#x27; poor UX for not-even-that-advanced features of books is part of why I barely use them, and practically never for any work that&#x27;d have notes of any sort. reply bentley 10 hours agorootparentAs someone who regularly compares different scans of old books, I counter: for centuries it’s already been common practice for publishers to update spellings, recapitalize, and even make more drastic changes. You just never noticed because print books don’t have a public commit log.In the case of Standard Ebooks, “sound‐alike” changes are allowed (so spelling and capitalization changes are allowed when they make sense). Censorship, and even innocuous grammatical changes, are not. Despite generally appreciating old works in their own context, I find the tradeoff in readability for such a widespread practice to be worth it given how minor SE’s alterations are. reply chrismorgan 5 hours agorootparentSometimes capitalisation matters are close to purely stylistic, but other times they really are part of the content, guiding pronunciation or emphasis, so that lowercasing them harms the work. What is your opinion of my assessment in the above comment of some of the specific changes in ? reply bentley 5 hours agorootparentI haven’t looked into your example, but certainly it can be true that lowercasing can be harmful. It goes without saying, I think, that the SE policy is only to lowercase words when doing so doesn’t harm.When I see erroneous changes in SE books, I argue to revert, and have generally been successful. In my experience it’s drama‐free, like fixing any other typo. reply kevin_thibedeau 3 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is when irregular spelling is intended to capture a vernacular. It does a disservice to everyone, erasing the author&#x27;s intent with homogenized language. reply bentley 3 hours agorootparentIf the spelling is intended to be vernacular, the SE policy is not to change the spelling. I (a mere reader) have successfully reverted dialectal spellings in SE several times. replyweijiacheng 14 hours agorootparentprevIn addition to what Alex has said, as an SE contributor I do try to submit errata to Project Gutenberg where I can find the time and energy. Part of the problem, though, is that PG&#x27;s errata process (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;help&#x2F;errata.html) is quite cumbersome since you have to write an email to their errata team with each individual error. That&#x27;s a real hassle to try to keep track of and submit. Ideally, if PG had something like a pull request system, I would just be able to find those errors in their code and submit the changes directly, but unfortunately they don&#x27;t have that, so far as I am aware.That is one major advantage SE has, I think, which is that we do allow people to make pull requests against any of our ebook repositories and any PRs that get merged are automatically deployed to the site. This makes it much, much easier for tech-savvy people to submit proofreading corrections! reply cxr 12 hours agorootparent> Part of the problem, though, is that PG&#x27;s errata process (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;help&#x2F;errata.html) is quite cumbersome since you have to write an email to their errata team with each individual error.

I miss the time where you could get a high-quality hardcover, but more and more those seem reserved only for the current week&#x27;s NYT best-seller books. reply acabal 15 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve considered running a campaign to finance a print run of some of our (SE&#x27;s) books. But the fact is that it&#x27;s just so easy to find super cheap paper copies of these books almost anywhere. As long as you buy a copy that was printed before, say, 2005 - or from a reputable publisher like Oxford or Penguin - then the edition will already be pro quality. (After that, it&#x27;s much more likely that you&#x27;re buying a print-on-demand copy of a raw Project Gutenberg text.)If we did offer print books, I think the value-add would be making them extremely ornate, one-of-a-kind editions like Arion Press or Folio Society make, and we&#x27;d charge a lot for a copy. But even then I&#x27;m still not sure the juice would be worth the squeeze, because that&#x27;s also been done to death... how many more fancy editions of Dracula or whatever does the world need? reply zopa 15 hours agorootparentI think you might be underestimating the value-add---at least based on the existence of this thread! Yes quality copies are out there, but easy to find for the Editor-in-Chief of Standard Ebooks doesn&#x27;t mean easy for everyone. I suspect plenty of people would find a trusted, no hassle source for a quality print copy worthwhile, just for the simplicity and convenience. Though I totally respect not wanting to waste ink and kill trees reprinting something that&#x27;s already widely available. reply acabal 13 hours agorootparentFolio Society basically already does this, at a premium price. Used copies of well-set PD classics from respected publishers like Franklin Library or Modern Library go for pennies and can be shipped to your door fron places like Abebooks, or you can easily find them at your nearby library sale&#x2F;used bookstore&#x2F;charity shop&#x2F;etc.I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea for a while but I think the market is just too saturated, even for premium editions. Maybe the focus should be on reviving more obscure works... not sure. reply dimmke 17 hours agoparentprevThis could be a cool monetization strategy. I don&#x27;t really read physical books, but the \"classics\" on Amazon are often complete ripoffs.

E.g.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Greatest-Works-Dostoyevsky-Punishment...Although there&#x27;s no saying as to whether or not they will have proper spellcheck, TOC, if they are legitimately in the public domain, or even if it&#x27;s the right book with all the pages. That&#x27;s where a service like Standard Ebooks is superior to the potluck you get from Amazon. reply paulcole 14 hours agorootparentprevWhy is that book a ripoff? reply cxr 11 hours agorootparentWithout discounting the point made by smogcutter about Penguin&#x27;s edition not actually being public domain: for a classic work, I&#x27;d expect to be able to get a paperback for less than $10.* And that involves a real-life physical artifact which (a) necessarily has lower margins than an ebook, and (b) doesn&#x27;t come with the omnipresent threat that it will evaporate from your device (or your managed online locker or whatever), nor that you&#x27;ll have to stop reading if your battery dies, nor that you&#x27;re unable to easily hand it to someone else to let them thumb through or borrow it. For an ebook, $3 or $4 sounds about right. Maybe $5 for a relatively modern translation, as in the case here. Recall that Netflix in comparison is $X per month (fill this is in; I don&#x27;t actually know, but I know the number is not high) and libraries are free-ish. Price points at or around $10 per work or more feel like a shameless ploy to trigger the sensation of \"economy\" in \"false economy\" and push people into rent-seeking platforms where they consistently hand over a continual stream of monthly payments in perpetuity for \"unlimited\" access—to select items within the very limited one month term that the payment gets you.* NB: whether this is actually the case or not is a separate matter reply dimmke 10 hours agorootparentYes basically. I understand if a publisher commissioned a translation and put in work but $10 for a DRM digital copy is too steep. Maybe $3-$4 would be reasonable? Crime and Punishment was written in the 1800s, the author is long dead. And it&#x27;s considered a historic and important piece of literature.Regardless, it&#x27;s great that these works are available in high quality for free. reply paulcole 8 hours agorootparentIf it was $3 would you buy it today? reply dimmke 8 hours agorootparentBecause there are high quality alternatives that are free and have no DRM there&#x27;s no price point I would buy it.

I&#x27;m personally very skeptical of LLMs as a technology, but even I have to admit that this was a pretty ideal and unobjectionable use of LLMs.That being said, though it was a fun experiment, I later found that it was easier (and less wasteful of natural resources) to just do the same thing with a bit of custom markup and a search and replace script. reply duskwuff 10 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s quite what the parent had in mind.The most natural application of a language model in proofreading is to compute perplexity across the text; if all goes well, errors should be detectable as points of unusually high perplexity. (In principle, this should even be able to spot otherwise undetectable errors like missing words.) reply weijiacheng 9 hours agorootparentI could see how that would be helpful, but at least for my use case I&#x27;m more interested in seeing how LLMs integrated with computer vision can speed up transcriptions. Since a thorough proofread by a human is already baked into the SE production process (and is indeed one of the major selling points), having more automated tools to aid proofreading is nice but doesn&#x27;t do anything fundamentally different, from my point of view. Whereas if LLMs can be leveraged for transcription SE producers no longer need to depend on external projects like Project Gutenberg or Wikisource to produce texts (which can take months) or transcribe texts from OCR results by hand (very tedious and error-prone--believe me, I&#x27;m speaking from experience!). It would drastically open up the range of possible books someone could reasonably produce (in a timely fashion) for SE. reply Forge36 15 hours agoparentprevAs a first pass I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll save some effort (i.e. l -> 1 in some fonts).

    "originBody": "HOME > ANTI-PIRACY > DMCA > New Year's resolutions come in all shapes and sizes, with an equal number of excuses to explain what went wrong. From today, January 1st 2024, here at TorrentFreak we're quietly hoping that anti-piracy companies will at least try to stop targeting us with bogus DMCA notices. At the start of 2023, the main culprits managed less than three weeks while others were still sending them two days ago. Any content creator who sees their work being used by unauthorized third-parties can file DMCA notices against platforms communicating that content to the public. Platforms should respond by taking allegedly-infringing content down but in practice, some do and some don’t. Full-blown pirate sites may not respond to notices at all for obvious reasons but some entirely legitimate platforms also refuse to comply in appropriate circumstances. Google is one of those platforms and without the diligence of the Google Search team, at least 150 articles published on TorrentFreak.com would’ve been disappeared over the years due to bogus DMCA notices. We very much appreciate that first line of defense; since we don’t have to commit resources towards countering wrongful complaints, we can concentrate on our reporting. To that end, today we can report that DMCA notices continued to be filed against us at Google, all of them demanding the deindexing of links to our news reports in Google search. We also received a few direct to us via email, more than usual in 2023. All complaints/takedown notices had something in common; 100% bogus, right across the board, and a complete waste of resources for everyone involved. New Year 2023: Peaceful for 19 Days By January 19, 2023, things were looking quite promising. No direct DMCA notices sent by email and no complaints sent to Google either, at least as far as we’re aware. On January 20, Google received a takedown demand to deindex from search results an article published just four days earlier. Due to the popularity of the software, we believed that the alleged operator of pirate app PikaShow being arrested in India was newsworthy. Sadly, India-based anti-piracy outfit Markscan (on behalf of Hotstar and/or rightsholder Novi Digital Entertainment Pvt. Ltd) decided that Google should deindex our work, as the notice on Lumen Database reveals. One of these is not like the others Google’s transparency report indicates that the notice, which demanded the removal of 47 URLs, was rejected in its entirety but because we mentioned PikaShow by name, the takedown notices kept on coming. On January 21, Markscan sent a substantially similar DMCA takedown notice to Google, this time on behalf of the Disney+ Hotstar “over-the-top streaming service owned by Novi Digital Entertainment of Disney Star and operated by Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, both divisions of The Walt Disney Company.” Once again, the complaint demanded the removal of our article. The next day, January 22, Novi Digital Entertainment tried its hand with a similar takedown notice which targeted the same article once again. It enjoyed the same level of success as the first. Inexplicably, on the very same day yet another anti-piracy company tried to remove exactly the same article but for different reasons. Working on behalf of Cricket Australia, India-based Copyright Integrity International claimed our article was in direct violation of its client’s rights in content relating to cricket matches of the KFC Big Bash League. There were no violations, obviously, but in the cut-and-thrust world of bulk URL disappearance, no one sends notices demanding that content stays up. Writing About House of the Dragon Infringes Warner Bros’ Rights On October 22, 2022, we reported that the season finale of HBO’s “House of the Dragon” had leaked online, two days ahead of its official premiere. After almost two weeks of DMCA silence following the PikaShow debacle, the calm was interrupted by a new complaint from Markscan. Alongside demands to take down links to House of the Dragon episodes and season packs on various pirate sites, this notice informed Google that our report on the months-old leak infringed Warner’s copyrights. It didn’t in any way. And then, adding insult to injury, Hotstar sent another DMCA takedown notice to Google, this time targeting a different article that also mentioned PikaShow; or ƿᵻꝄɅ§ƕɵꟺ for those who don’t want to be targeted by bogus notices seemingly reliant on basic keyword searches. Hey DMCA Bot: ████ █████████ ███████ ██ ██████████ When anti-piracy companies target a platform directly, Google’s diligence doesn’t enter the equation. Any DMCA notices received must be treated as legal documents and responses must be governed accordingly. On April 3, 2023, we received an email from Turkey-based anti-piracy outfit DigiGuardians Inc. and since the title contained the words ‘Copyright Claim’ we immediately gave it our full attention. This is a notice in accordance with the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA) a part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 requesting the service providers to be held strictly liable for the acts of their users & immediately cease the access to copyrighted material. We have found an infringing material in your website which indeed is our movie ‘Güneşin Kızları’ released worldwide in 2015 The notice listed three URLs which needed to be “disabled immediately” along with a statement that the “information in the notification is accurate.” Unfortunately, we were unable to comply with the takedown demands because the URLs provided were not for TorrentFreak.com but an entirely different domain that we’d never heard of, under someone else’s control. We aren’t publishing the domain name here since it’s flagged as malicious by several security vendors and blocked by a laundry list of DNS providers. What we can confirm is that graphics from TF were used on this bogus platform to make it look like a news site, albeit one with our logo, authors’ names, and sundry other pieces of information removed. Sixty-two minutes after receiving the takedown notice, a detailed report containing all necessary information to show why the notice shouldn’t have been sent to us, was sent back to DigiGuardians. We even included a screenshot and explanatory text using the most sophisticated font available today. Ruthlessly ignored artwork We received no response to our detailed response addressing the bogus notice, which was also sent to a file-hosting platform that we’d never heard of, an email address listed in WHOIS records, and hosting company LeaseWeb, apparently. More DMCA Notices For Another Site On April 4, 2023, DigiGuardians sent another substantially similar DMCA takedown notice, with the domain name of the malicious site in the title, this time demanding the removal of 50 allegedly infringing URLs. Just seconds later we received yet another takedown notice demanding the removal of an additional 50 URLs, followed by another seconds after that containing a further 10 URLs. “The information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed,” the complaints added, pointlessly. Then in the middle of October, DigiGuardians unexpectedly reached out, indicating they were interested in working with us to publish news on products or services, that type of thing. Nothing wrong with that of course but since TorrentFreak is a news site, we politely declined and said we’d happily take a look at anything newsworthy, should anything come up. We also asked about the problematic takedown notices and noted that we’d be grateful if someone could fix the problem. Hard to say with 100% certainty that a bot responded, but the text seemed to assume we were interested in the offer. Sadly, it mentioned nothing about the copyright claims. Give That Bot a Slap After largely forgetting about the earlier run of nuisance, erroneous notices, on December 14 we started receiving them again. This time we were instructed to remove five allegedly infringing URLs pointing to the movie ‘Muhteşem İkili’ but once again a fundamental problem got in the way. The infringing URLs listed in the notice were for a completely different and new domain, also nothing to do with us. On December 29, when we received not one but two ‘Copyright Claims’ demanding the removal of over 50 URLs on someone else’s domain, after our communications about these issues were ignored yet again, inclusion in today’s list of bogus takedown notices was sealed. In closing, we must acknowledge that these companies face massive challenges in their line of work and as such, mistakes will inevitably get made. We’re not unsympathetic either but when the same mistakes get made over and over again against the same site, one that is more likely to mention these disasters in public than any other online today, you do start to wonder.",

Neither fact is necessarily relevant to the target of the notification. reply andrewaylett 10 hours agoparentprevWhat&#x27;s under penalty of perjury is the right to file a claim about the work allegedly infringed, rather than the accuracy of the reported content, which merely needs to be \"a good faith belief\".If you publish something you hold copyright on, and someone makes an unauthorised copy, I can&#x27;t submit a DMCA claim against the copy without your authorisation. Even if the claim would be 100% valid were you to submit it, the courts may enforce that only you and your agents may actually make that submission. On the other hand, it&#x27;s quite hard to prove that someone is acting in bad faith, rather than being earnest but entirely incompetent. reply JumpCrisscross 6 hours agoparentprev> Does torrentfreak have any legal recourse?Penalty of perjury is criminal.

Or maybe not recovered at all and cover the cost of investigation. It might help combat the bogus claims. As for the real ones, that&#x27;s should be part of the cost of doing business. But the current situation that it is almost zero cost will only encourage more bogus and vague claims. reply jorams 12 hours agoparentI think it makes more sense to disqualify abusers from the entire takedown system. The DMCA takedown process takes a guilty-until-proven-otherwise approach, and companies like Markscan from the article can clearly not be trusted with that power. After maybe 3 false takedowns the receiver should be allowed to assume anything they send is bullshit.There should also be consequences for copyright owners choosing to be represented by a large number of such abusers, but that&#x27;s a lot more complicated and would require more due process. reply gizmo 11 hours agorootparentAbusers of DMCA should just have the IP in question automatically reclassified as Public Domain.

Y&#x27;all can find this section of the constitution I&#x27;m sure, and it&#x27;s dull but short! This is super up to the legislature, otherwise how would they have passed the DMCA in the first place? Of course they could make a law to revoke IP for any kind of thing they decide they need to -- like for national security:\"The Congress shall have Power To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\" reply roblabla 8 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a source for that?

Even if you have 90% accuracy in claims if you have to put out 10,000 claims in a year that&#x27;s 1 million you have to escrow with the expected loss of 100,000 despite rarely being wrong. And you may well need to do significantly more than 10,000 claims per year given the number of sites and users uploading and re-sharing content. If it were just a token value of 1 dollar or something then you&#x27;re back to the largest corporations being able to file a million bogus complaints as the cost of doing business.Absent a balanced number this would ultimately turn into another debate about the place of the DMCA itself. reply throwup238 13 hours agorootparent“Even if you have 90% accuracy”???You either have 100% certainty you are the rights holder and 100% accuracy, or you’re abusing the system.

And making a fair use defense ipso facto is an admission of using the work without permission (and thus making the preceding DMCA takedown valid). reply hn_acker 11 hours agorootparent> And making a fair use defense ipso facto is an admission of using the work without permission (and thus making the preceding DMCA takedown valid).Not quite right. Using work without permission is not the same as infringing on the copyright on the work, and a DMCA is a claim of infringement. Fair use can only be used as an affirmative defense, as you noted; only a court decides whether a use of a copyrighted work is fair use. But formally, fair use is not infringement according to the Ninth Circuit in Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. (2015) [1]:> \"Because 17 U.S.C. § 107[9] created a type of non-infringing use, fair use is &#x27;authorized by the law&#x27; and a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under § 512(c).\"Not that the Lenz ruling helped very much in practice. To meet the Lenz standard, the sender of the DMCA notice can claim in court that they believed in good faith that the use of the copyrighted work was not fair use. The only part of the initial DMCA notice that the sender writes under penalty of perjury is the claim of being the copyright holder or someone authorized to send the notice on behalf of the copyright holder [2]:> (3)Elements of notification.—> (A)To be effective under this subsection, a notification of claimed infringement must be a written communication provided to the designated agent of a service provider that includes substantially the following:[omitted](vi)A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.In contrast, a party sending a counter notice - which they might be too intimidated to do in the first place, and otherwise happens before the rightsholder initiates court precedings - must dispute the initial DMCA notice under penalty of perjury [2]:> (3)Contents of counter notification.—To be effective under this subsection, a counter notification must be a written communication provided to the service provider’s designated agent that includes substantially the following:[omitted]> (C)A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.The safest response by far for the recipient of the DMCA notice is to resign from contesting it i.e. let the service provider permanently remove the material.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lenz_v._Universal_Music_Corp.[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;512 reply rimunroe 12 hours agorootparentprevTwo people can reasonably disagree on who owns the rights to a derivative work, can&#x27;t they? reply wnevets 11 hours agorootparentThey can but that isn&#x27;t what is happening according to the article.> The notice listed three URLs which needed to be “disabled immediately” along with a statement that the “information in the notification is accurate.” Unfortunately, we were unable to comply with the takedown demands because the URLs provided were not for TorrentFreak.com but an entirely different domain that we’d never heard of, under someone else’s control.I don&#x27;t consider that a reasonable disagreement, I consider that a bogus claim. reply rimunroe 7 hours agorootparent> They can but that isn&#x27;t what is happening according to the article.I&#x27;m aware, but I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s relevant to these comments.

    "originBody": "Linear Pathing Dijkstra’s Algorithm A* Search Algorithm A* Tricks Implicit Graph Data Structure Geometry Informed Heuristics My wife and I decided to make an 8-bit, top-down, Zelda-like game written for the PPU466 (from CMU 15-466 Computer Game Programming course). The PPU466 is a graphics API kind of like the PICO-8 fantasy console, in the sense that it’s restricted to 8-bit graphics, 4 colors per tile, fixed backgrounds, and a low number of sprites. As a part of the game, I wanted our monsters to chase the player. So I spent some time exploring and implementing different pathing techniques and I wanted to share what I discovered, especially some fun A* tricks not covered by Wikipedia. Linear Pathing Let’s start with the most basic pathing: draw a straight line between the monster and the player and have the monster go in that direction. Everything is great until the monster hits a wall and then it stops dead. You can fix this particular issue with wall-sliding: instead of stopping when you hit a wall, you move along the wall. This approach works surprisingly well for pathing, but it really shines for player movement. Nearly every game uses this technique for player movement (and have since Pac-Man) because it makes movement controls more responsive near walls and edges. (Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ adds sparks when the player wall-slides which is really cool) One side-effect of wall-sliding in linear pathing is monster trapping: This is not necessarily as bad as it looks. Many games even use this as a feature, adding monster trapping as a strategic element (e.g. safespotting in Runescape). But this isn’t what I wanted for our game, so I looked into true path-finding algorithms. Dijkstra’s Algorithm This is the algorithm everyone learns in school. It’s straightforward to implement and it’s guaranteed to find the shortest path. But the problem is that it does too much work: for the starting node, it finds the shortest path to every other node in the graph. You can stop once you find your destination node, but there’s no way to direct the algorithm to make progress towards that node in particular. And in a videogame, the monster’s destination changes every frame as the player moves! And really, the monster doesn’t even need the full path: it just needs to know which direction to go. You could pre-compute the shortest path for every pixel or tile on your map, but that’s a lot of memory. So if you are designing your game to run on a legacy or resource-constrained platform, Dijkstra’s isn’t going to work. Luckily there’s a better way. A* Search Algorithm Wikipedia has an in-depth overview of the algorithm (and a really nice animation showing how it works), so I’ll just share my intution for how it works. First, steps are weighted by the distance of the starting node to the destination now. This means the algorithm starts by trying to go in a straight line to the destination. Unlike Dijkstra’s, it won’t waste a bunch of time going in the opposite direction (unless it has to). Second, if a wall is blocking the path, it will start investigating nearby nodes to try to get around the wall. And most importantly, it won’t get stuck: like Dijkstra, it won’t revisit node’s it’s already seen, so it will eventually find a way to get around the way, even it has to backtrack a lot. Here’s the algorithm in action: Note that the monster does not get stuck behind the wall. A* Tricks Here’s a few tricks to make the algorithm faster and easier to implement. Implicit Graph Data Structure In textbooks, graphs are represented by a list of nodes and an adjacency matrix or adjacency list. But you can be a little more flexible about representing adjacency nodes. For example, let’s say our game screen has 256 * 240 pixels. We’ll call the coordinates of each pixel a node. Then we can say there are 8 adjacent pixels: up, down, left, right, and the 4 diagonals. The cardinal directions have a weight of 1, while the diagonals have a weight of the square root of 2 (~1.4). We don’t need to create a huge adjacency list: we can generate it on the fly. Moreover, not every pixel is a valid position for the monster: it might be on a wall or occupied by another sprite. In that case, we can dynamically exclude that pixel from the adjacency list. Here’s how this might look: # suppose current is some data structure with x and y coordinates neighbors = [current + dir for dir in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]] for neighbor in neighbors: if out_of_bounds(neighbor) or occupied(neighbor): continue # do something with neighbor So we only need to generate the adjacency list for the nodes we are actually going to visit, and we don’t have to manually exclude adjacent nodes with a map editor. Geometry Informed Heuristics You can also manually tune aspects of the algorithm based on the geometry of your map. Step size Above I talked about using the pixels as nodes, but in a 2d tile based game, you can use the tiles as nodes. This speeds up the search dramatically, since the monster can find a path to the player in fewer iterations. With this method, the path really isn’t an exact sequence of steps: your monster likely isn’t moving at a speed of 1 tile per frame. Now the path is a series of directions the monster should go.1 And that’s okay! As I said in the Dijkstra section, our monster doesn’t actually care about the exact path, which is changing each frame as the player moves. It just needs to move in a direction that could possibly reach the player (i.e. not straight into a wall). Iteration depth One cool feature about A*: once a node comes off the priority queue, we know that that node represents the last step in the best path we’ve seen so far. Therefore, if we stopped the algorithm at some fixed number of iterations, we would know that the resulting path is our best guess for the shortest path to the destination. So we can get reasonable progress without the running the algorithm to completion. You need to tune this maximum iteration depth to the geometry of the level. For example, if the depth is too small you can still have monsters get stuck behind a wall: With a fixed iteration depth of 30 tiles, we can position the player so the monster gets traps and can’t make progress towards the player. How does this happen? Remember that A* is recomputed each frame. On the first frame once reaching the wall, the monster calculates that it should move down. But on the next frame, it calculates that it should move up. This casuses the monster to get stuck in a loop. However, as soon as the player moves into it’s range, the monster is able to correctly find a path to the player. You can see this effect exaggerated with a fixed depth of 1: frame 1 frame 2 4 3.m 2 pm p. 1| 0 The monster always returns to pxiel 2 because it’s the shortest (Euclidean) distance to the player. If you wanted to be really fancy, you could pre-compute the maximum depth A* needs to find a path from any position on the map. Unlike the pre-computed Dijkstra, you only have to save that maximum, since you know A* will find a valid path in real time, given that maximum depth. Technically, this is true of the pixel-based path as well. The monster isn’t moving at a speed of 1 pixel per frame either! It’s probably not even moving an integer number of pixels each frame!↩︎",

Hierarchical graphs: city-level, inter-room in building, intra-room. Allows for navigation from any point in any room in any building in any city to any other point in a fraction of a millisecond.2. Store metadata about the current a* search in the graph nodes themselves so you don&#x27;t have to maintain in a separate associative array.3. Don&#x27;t follow the resulting paths directly, use them as input to a steering behavior that tries to cut corners to the next path node when possible. Also, if you are pathing to go to another character, make the target character drop \"breadcrumbs\" that get added to the path when their new position would not be straight-line navigable from the last node of the path . reply aappleby 12 hours agoparentOh, and compute the distance from each path node to the nearest obstacle and store that in the path node.

Expanding on point 1...1. The streets have their own graph, as does each individual building. There&#x27;s an address book; each building stores the driveway tile connecting to the street graph here.2. Pathing inside homes uses A*. In order to make this extra fast, I bake the 8-directional egress weights for each tile in the building&#x2F;yard.2b. This gets condensed down into a 16-bit bitmask (2 bit chunks, 8 directions) and then stored in a hash table2c. Each bit-chunk has four possible states:FULL_BLOCK (e.g. a wall)HARD_BLOCK (e.g. a large object that prevents walking through the tile from any direction)SOFT_BLOCK (e.g. a smaller object that prevents passage on one edge)NO_BLOCK (e.g. an unoccupied tile, or a tile with a tiny object)This way a unit pathing inside a building does not need to check for obstacles on every tile. This also allows units to pass through tiles with objects provided the object is not huge and is rotated in such a way that the exit and entrance edge is not blocked. Lastly, an agent can still walk through a wall if the player e.g. forgot to place a door, to prevent the simulation from breaking down.3. I use a waypoint system (stored in a queue) for agents so they can traverse through the different graph hierarchies with ease. This is also used to e.g. tell the unit to walk to their car first if they are driving.4. Pathing on the street uses a different method (though still utilizes a baked graph) that makes it extra zippy.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;2287430&#x2F;Metropolis_1998&#x2F; reply hwillis 12 hours agoparentprev> Hierarchical graphs: city-level, inter-room in building, intra-room.Handmade? It&#x27;s always annoying to me when you have a small NP-hard problem (graph partitioning is definitely a recurring one for me) and you want to just throw some box algorithm at it without having to shop around for a library that you have to learn.I remember there was a while in college where I didn&#x27;t understand why A* in an RTS would be such a hard thing... and then I watched a video or read something that pointed out that if you don&#x27;t want units walking through each other then every single moving thing is constantly re-pathing around every other unit. New respect for command and conquer. reply araes 12 hours agorootparentThis is one of the main issues in attempting to build a game like the Total War series.When you start getting into 10,000 unit formations that need to pivot or strafe, while moving around or through other unit groups and obstacles, A* starts being rather challenging.Trying to get 100,000 horses to ford a river reasonably when there&#x27;s only a relatively small zone of safety can be tough to program.Also, mipmaps towards the hierarchical comment of aappleby and hwillis. reply sojuz151 9 hours agorootparentTBH running a full A* for each soldier is not only waistfull but also not realistic. Most people are just moving with the group and might not even know where the entire formation is going reply otikik 8 hours agorootparentprevIsn’t the standard solution there to pick one of the horses to do the full path while telling the others “try to move along this path, if not possible then as close as possible, otherwise in the average direction of this group of horses” or something similar? reply alexey-salmin 2 hours agorootparentprev> Trying to get 100,000 horses to ford a river reasonably when there&#x27;s only a relatively small zone of safety can be tough to program.I imagine this is also very tough in real life reply aappleby 12 hours agorootparentprevHandmade, but trivial to build - I made a tool so the guys in the world editor could just click anywhere to drop a path node and the tool would automatically link path nodes and prune redundant edges from the graph. Took a few minutes to do a whole city. Building graphs were mostly autogenerated from the navigation mesh and labeled \"door\" objects, with optional manually placed nodes when the room geometry was weird. reply aappleby 12 hours agorootparentprevAlso every single thing shouldn&#x27;t be pathing around everything else, they should use something like a flocking behavior to organize themselves. Pathing is only for long distance navigation in complex environments. reply superjan 12 hours agorootparentprevI have seen an article posted here that did A* on a low resolution versions of the game map, and use the output of that as the heuristic for the full res version. In that design, the low res version was auto generated. reply eru 5 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s nifty, because A* itself is already a two-step process that uses a heuristic. You can blow it up to multiple steps fairly easily. reply eru 5 hours agorootparentprevSmall NP-hard problems aren&#x27;t actually that bad. You can usually formulate them as eg a integer programming problem or a SMT problem, and throw an off-the-shelf solver at them.You only need to learn the solver once, and you can re-use it for all kinds of problems. (Assuming that your instances don&#x27;t have to be solved with low latency.

Their speed was constant as they moved. reply KptMarchewa 8 hours agorootparentprevSome of the units in Brood War are legendary due to their bad pathfinding like Dragoon. reply chii 6 hours agorootparentWhich is incidentally what made SC the high skill ceiling it has.If the pathing of SC had been \"great\", the game mightn&#x27;t have taken off the way it did competitively. reply forrestthewoods 12 hours agorootparentprevSearch for \"flowfield pathfinding\".

Store metadata about the current a* search in the graph nodes themselves so you don&#x27;t have to maintain in a separate associative array.This might be suitable in some circumstances, but it mixes your hot & cold data, prevents concurrent searches from being performed. Personally I&#x27;d steer away from this without an extremely good reason. reply aappleby 12 hours agorootparentCorrect, but it was still way faster that way. Pathfinding was already asynchronous (queries happened on another thread so they didn&#x27;t block any game update loops) and queries were infrequent enough that doing one at a time was fine. reply KptMarchewa 8 hours agorootparentOh that would be unpleasant if you wanted deterministic behaviour - for example multiplayer RTS. reply mrmuagi 6 hours agoparentprevSongs of Syx is a very performant game that uses 1.

It allows you to feed in the results of previous searches in order to speed up pathfinding.- JPS (jump point search) looks very appealing in theory because it allows you to significantly reduce the number of \"nodes\" considered, but I found that the increased overhead in identifying jump points meant it didn&#x27;t provide a speedup. There might be a way to marry the ideas of MPAA and JPS, but it is very easy to conceptually shoot yourself in the foot with minor conceptual details when getting creative with the algorithms. (As a contrived example, using a \">\" when you needed a \">=\" might mean you are no longer guaranteed to output the real shortest path in certain situations)- Instead of using a proper heap for storing open nodes, consider using a bucketed priority queue if your max priority value is a relatively low integer. This means there&#x27;s an underlying array indexed by priority, which makes push&#x27;ing and pop&#x27;ing quite fast.[0] Quoridor takes place on a 9x9 grid, and repeated pathfinding is essential in order to determine how close a player is to their goal, and more broadly whether the goal is even reachable. (In order to even determine the valid moves from a given position, all moves must be checked to see if they make a goal unreachable). I plan to release this within the next few months, including at least 3 decision making \"engines\": mtdf (a min-max variant), MCTS (parallel with some tricks), and a hybrid involving catboost. reply GuB-42 11 hours agoparent9x9 is a really small grid. 81 tiles. Storing all the distances from every tile to every other tile would take 6561 bytes. Fits in a typical L1 cache.The nice thing about that is that you can use it as a lookup table for your heuristic function instead of the usual straight line. This table can be initialized at the start of each turn, for example using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm with the already placed walls. I managed to significantly speed up my A* on a similar problem using this technique, plus, it is really simple, it was straight A* though, no MPAA or JPS. reply mopierotti 11 hours agorootparentInteresting idea, thanks! I will probably try this. I had stopped tweaking things too much after implementing MPAA, because most of the searches end up \"short circuit\"-ing relatively quickly.With MPAA you preserve all previous shortest paths that have been found (in the form of an Array where array(nodeIndex) points to the nodeIndex of the next node on the path). When attempting to optimistically follow one of these paths, if the algorithm hits a new wall, it will null out the path it took up until the wall. However a future search (or iteration in the same search) may still reuse the part of the shortest path that still exists after the wall.That said, you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s a tiny grid, and cache behavior can dominate any abstract theoretical properties in surprising ways. reply bigbillheck 10 hours agorootparentprev> would take 6561 bytes3240 if you&#x27;re nasty. reply keriati1 4 hours agoparentprev+1 for the bucket queue.

It does require preprocessing the map first though. reply o11c 11 hours agoprevSome other tricks:* If you assign terrain costs to tiles rather than borders (= paths) between tiles, that creates a user-visible asymmetry! ... unless the cost is always max() of the two tile costs or something.* The direction in which you run the algorithm matters, especially if you&#x27;re doing one-to-many or partial paths. That said, it is possible to do any-to-goal directly, by adding an extra field to your datum.* A* fails pretty badly on C-shaped obstacles* You need to have an admissible heuristic. This means no negative (usually stricter, in fact: not less than 1) weights (usually reasonable, but can cause complications if you want to funnel traffic onto \"highways\" even if that&#x27;s slightly longer), and makes teleporters complicated: \\* if a teleporter connects to all other teleporters, the new heuristic is `min(old heuristic, heuristic to the nearest teleporter, heuristic from the teleporter to the goal) \\* if sets of teleporters are unrelated, you probably want to preprocess paths between every pair of teleporters. Doing this without unnecessary work is left as an exercise for the reader.* If you have a convex walkable area, you know that the shortest path between any two points within it is a straight line, and this can significantly shorten A*. Note that a given tile will almost always be part of more than one such useful area (you certainly don&#x27;t want to consider all valid areas), and this should not be limited to rectangular areas (in particular, don&#x27;t let diagonal corridors be a worst case). It&#x27;s okay to exclude \"pocket\" tiles near the wall; they&#x27;ll still exist as individual tiles for pathfinding purposes if you really need to go there.* Optimization gets harder if your map has multiple movement types (e.g. walk, swim, fly) and individual entities can exercise more than one of those.* When pathfinding across multiple maps (hierarchial pathfinding is important), the shortest connectivity is not necessarily the shortest path. Sometimes cutting through a building is faster than going around it. If your transitions are not point-like, even recording shortest paths between all such transitions isn&#x27;t enough. (imagine citygate| .house. |citygate, where the house transitions are small enough to not be part of the shortest paths from the extremity of one gate to the other, but are optimal if you start at the center of the gate) \\* speaking of non-point-like transitions, *please* preserve relative position at least somewhat. Instead of \"entering this transition line teleports you to this point on the other map\", use \"entering this transition line teleports you to the equivalent (with scaling if needed) position along this other transition line\". It&#x27;s not hard when I say it like that, right? (even if you want one-way transitions, you should model them as a transition that is currently disabled, so your target is homogeneous)* Even if you do run a full A*, you don&#x27;t have to store every node, only nodes where you turn (this usually beats storing immediate direction for every node, except for extreme mazes of twisty little passages). Rounded convex obstacles (thus concave open spaces) are your enemy unless you also add wall-sliding logic here. reply markisus 15 hours agoprevIt would be interesting to see these classical methods compared to a simple RL method that optimizes a tiny neural net or decision tree which is given access to the map, player, and monster positions.

Imagine a long barrier with the start and goal placed on either side at the exact midpoint.Tie handling is really important! A* is often described as minimizing f(n), where f(n) = g(n) + h(n), g(n) = path distance so far, h(n) = distance to goal heuristic. But for any valid shortest path the remaining work for the algorithm to do is determined by the size of g(n). So when selecting the next node to explore you must minimize first by f(n), and then maximize g(n) as a tiebreaker. Same is achieved by breaking ties with LIFO. reply deadbabe 11 hours agoprev [–] Can someone share tips for A* pathfinding where NPCs have limited knowledge about the map, where they must got from point A to point B without knowing entirely about what’s in between? reply mm_aa 11 hours agoparent [–] Micromouse competition is exactly about this.

We review essential components of deep learning algorithms in full mathematical detail including different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (such as fully-connected feedforward ANNs, convolutional ANNs, recurrent ANNs, residual ANNs, and ANNs with batch normalization) and different optimization algorithms (such as the basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, accelerated methods, and adaptive methods). We also cover several theoretical aspects of deep learning algorithms such as approximation capacities of ANNs (including a calculus for ANNs), optimization theory (including Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz inequalities), and generalization errors. In the last part of the book some deep learning approximation methods for PDEs are reviewed including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep Galerkin methods. We hope that this book will be useful for students and scientists who do not yet have any background in deep learning at all and would like to gain a solid foundation as well as for practitioners who would like to obtain a firmer mathematical understanding of the objects and methods considered in deep learning.

Quite the Herculean effort (600 pages!). It just seems to me like they&#x27;re putting the emphasis on the stuff that is more straightforward to formalize rather than the stuff that would be interesting to understand.Look eg at the SGD chapter. I picked this because I think optimization is one of the areas where mathematicians actually can and do make impactful contributions to ML. But then look at the chapter in the book: most of the proofs are fairly elementary (like bias-variance decompositions or Jensen inequalities), some more interesting theorems (on convergence) are cited from the literature and do not build on the lemmata, and the sub-chapters on the actually interesting methods like ADAM,... are completely free of proofs or theory. It seems to me that after reading the chapter, a reader will have a good understanding of modern SGD methods and how we got there, but they won&#x27;t necessarily be much wiser about why those methods work, other than having a good intuition confirmed by numerical experiments. If that&#x27;s the outcome, then I wonder what the fuss proving all the basic stuff was all for. Wouldn&#x27;t it be more useful to dedicate the space to convergence proofs for ADAM (which do exist) rather than showing lots of stuff like E(XY) = E(X)E(Y) for independent random variables?That&#x27;s just one chapter, I may not be doing them full justice here, although I did read through a few others as well. I first got this impression from the ANN chapter, which is ripe with long proofs for rather basic and uninteresting stuff, and from the physics-informed neural networks paper (which I actually find really nice, although it suffers a bit from the same problem as the SGD chapter). I don&#x27;t want to be too critical here, it is nice in general to move towards a more rigorous and unified exposition of ML methods, and their approach should extend to the more technical results as well, just questioning where they drew the line of what to include and what not. reply modeless 2 hours agoparent> they won&#x27;t necessarily be much wiser about why those methods work, other than having a good intuition confirmed by numerical experiments.This is the state of the field as a whole, isn&#x27;t it?> Wouldn&#x27;t it be more useful to dedicate the space to convergence proofs for ADAM (which do exist)Convergence proofs don&#x27;t really explain why Adam tends to work better than other methods.It&#x27;s hard to blame them for not being able to explain things that, currently, nobody understands.

My background is in math (Ph.D. and a couple of postdoc years) before switching to practitioner in deep learning. This year I taught a class at university (as invited prof) in deep learning for students doing a masters in math and statistics (but with some programming knowledge, too).I tried to present concepts in an as reasonably accurate mathematical way as possible, and in the end I cut through a lot of math in part to avoid the heavy notation which seems to be present in this book (and in part to make sure students could spend what they learnt in the industry). My actual classes had way more code than formulas.If you want to write everything very accurately, things get messy, quickly. Finding a good notation for new concepts in math is very hard, something that gets sometimes done by bright minds only, even though afterwards everybody recognizes it was “clear” (think about Einstein notation, Feynman diagrams, etc., or even just matrix notation, which Gauss was unaware of). If you just take domain A and write in notations from domain B, it’s hard to get something useful (translating quantum mechanics to math with C* algebras and co. was a big endeavour, still an open research field to some extent).So I’ll disagree with some of the comments below and claim that the effort of writing down this book was huge but probably scarcely useful. Who can read comfortably these equations probably won’t need them (if you know what an affine transformation is, you hardly need to see all its ijkl indices written down explicitly for a 4-dimensional tensor), and the others will just be scared off. There might be a middle ground where it helps some, but at least I haven’t encountered such people… reply tnecniv 11 hours agoparentprevSo this is a book written by applied mathematicians for applied mathematics (they state in the preface it’s for scientists, but some theoretical scientists and engineers are essentially applied mathematics). As a result, both the topics and the presentation are biased towards those types of people. For example, I’ve never seen in practice worry about the existence and uniqueness conditions for their gradient-based optimization algorithm in deep learning. However, that’s the kind of result those people do care about and academic papers are written on the topic. The title does say that this is a book on the theoretical underpinnings of the subject, so I am not surprised that it is written this way. People also don’t necessarily read these books cover-to-cover, but drill into the few chapters that use techniques relevant to what they themselves are researching. There was a similarly verbose monograph I used to use in my research, but only about 20-30 pages had the meat I was interested in.This kind of book is more verbose than my liking both in terms of rigor and content. For example, they include Gronwall’s inequality as a lemma and prove it. The version that they use is a bit more general than the one I normally see, but Gronwall’s inequality is a very standard tool in analyzing ODEs and I have rigorous control theory books that state it without proof to avoid clutter (they do provide a reference to a proof). A lot of this verbosity comes about when your standard of proof is high and the assumptions you make are small. reply aurareturn 3 hours agorootparentAre there any books you recommend for deep learning that are written for developers who don&#x27;t use math every day?I suppose the goal would be to understand deep learning so that we know enough of what&#x27;s going on but not to get stuck in math concepts that we probably don&#x27;t know and won&#x27;t use. reply stefr- 40 minutes agorootparentI am&#x2F;was in this scenario. I&#x27;m sure there are other resources out there specifically aimed at developers, but a book I&#x27;m reading now is \"Deep Learning From Scratch\" by Seth Weidman. He takes a different approach, by explaining concepts in three distinct methods: a mathematical way, by using diagrams and by showing the code.I like this approach because it allows me to connect the math to the problem, whereas otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t have.In the book, you&#x27;re slowly creating a DL framework, as the title says, from scratch. He also has all the code on GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SethHWeidman&#x2F;DLFS_codeI think if you are truly trying to understand deep learning, you will never get to avoid the math because that&#x27;s really what it is at it&#x27;s core, a couple of (non-linear) functions chained together (obvious gross oversimplification). reply layer8 13 hours agoparentprevMathematical notation is more concise, which may take some getting used to. One reason is that it is optimized for handwriting. Handwriting program code would be very tedious, so you can see why mathematical notation is the way it is.Apart from that, there is no “the code” equivalent. Mathematical notation is for stating mathematical facts or propositions. That’s different from the purpose of the code you would write to implement deep-learning algorithms. reply tnecniv 9 hours agorootparentThe last part was a big hurdle for me as an early undergrad. I was a fairly strong programmer toward the end of high school, and was trying to think of math as programming. That worked for the fairly algorithmic high school stuff and I got good grades, but it made I was awful at writing proofs. I also went through a phase where I used all the logical notation and rules to manipulate it possible in order to make proofs more algorithmic to me, but that both didn’t work well for me and produced some downright unreadable results.Mathematical notation is really a shorthand for words, like you’d read text. The equals sign is literally short for equals. The added benefit, as others have pointed out, is that a good notation can sometimes be clearer than words because it makes certain conclusions almost obvious. You’ve done the hard part in finding a notation that captures exactly the idea to be demonstrated in its encoding, and the result is a very clean manipulation of your notation. reply HybridCurve 8 hours agorootparentThis is essentially my problem. I started writing programs at a young age and was introduced (unknowingly) to many more advanced mathematical concepts from that perspective rather than through pure mathematics. What was it that helped break this paradigm for you? reply j2kun 6 hours agorootparentI wrote a book: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pimbook.orgYou might find it useful for your situation. The PDF is pay-what-you-want if you don&#x27;t feel like paying for it. reply HybridCurve 5 hours agorootparentAh, I think I remember bookmarking this when it was posted before. You really don&#x27;t have to go very far in computing to find a frontier where most everything in described pure mathematics and so it becomes a substantial barrier for undiversified autodidacts in the field. The math in these areas can often be quite advanced and difficult to approach without the proper background and so I appreciate anyone who has made taken the time to make it less formidable to others. reply light_hue_1 1 hour agorootparentI would suggest something like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-... instead of that book.I appreciate that some may find the book useful, but I personally don&#x27;t agree with the presentation. There are too many conceptual errors in the book that you need to unlearn to make progress. For example, the book describes R^2 as a \"pair\" of real numbers. This is very much untrue and that kind of thinking will lead you even further astray.I say this as someone with a math&#x2F;cs degree and PhD having taught these topics to hundreds of students. reply tnecniv 7 hours agorootparentprevReally trial and error and grinding through proofs. Working through Linear Algebra Done Right was a big a-ha moment for me. Since I was self-studying over the summer (to remedy my poor linear algebra skills), I was very rigorous in making sure I understood every line of the proofs in the text and trying to mimic his style in the exercises.In hindsight, I think the issue was trying to map everything to programming is a bad idea and I was doing it because programming was the best tool in my tool chest. It was a real “when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail” issue for me. reply bawolff 8 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know that has anything to do with programming.Arithmatic and writing proofs are very different skills. There is going to be a gap for everyone. reply tnecniv 7 hours agorootparentYeah I know it’s a common challenge.

Because the (original, and the most useful) purpose of mathematical notation is to enable calculation, i.e., in a general sense, to make it possible to obtain results by manipulating symbols according certain rules. reply layer8 9 hours agorootparentI see the steps of a calculation as stating a sequence of mathematical facts, so that’s just an instance of the general definition. reply Koshkin 9 hours agorootparentSure, but the whole point is to avoid the need to do that! Manipulating symbols is the way to automate reasoning, i.e. to get to a result while completely ignoring said \"facts.\" Using the symbols to merely \"state the facts\" is abuse (of the reader, mostly). reply aabajian 13 hours agoparentprevAll three authors are PhDs or PhD-candidates in mathematics.

Such as metric theory. My opinion is that it is context driven. E.g. Introduction to Differential Geometry or Introduction to Homotopy Theory. But I think you can&#x27;t look at the title and infer prerequisites that are within the ballpark. I&#x27;d wager most people outside math and some physics students are familiar with Galerkin methods (maybe a handful of engineers) at the undergraduate level. I don&#x27;t think most outside math and physics even learn PDEs (my engineering friends mostly didn&#x27;t and my uni&#x27;s CS program doesn&#x27;t even require DE). reply WhitneyLand 4 hours agorootparentWhat percent of LLM knowledge requires proficiency in anything you mentioned?From what I’ve seen it’s a small percentage, and there’s no reason for most people to be put off by it.Everyone come on in the water is fine. reply godelski 2 hours agorootparentBetween 0% and idk 70%? depending on what you&#x27;re doing. reply outrun86 11 hours agoparentprevI’m just wrapping up a PhD in ML.

Coming from physics (B.Sc only) the notation is refreshingly familiar and straightforward. My topology and analysis classes were basically like this.In fact, this pdf is literally the resource I&#x27;ve been searching for as many others are far too ambiguous and handwavey focusing more on libraries and APIs than what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes.If only there were a similar one for microeconomics and macroeconomics, I&#x27;d have my curiosity satiated. reply outrun86 10 hours agorootparentBishop’s Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning is one example that has tremendous depth and much clearer notation. Deep Learning by Goodfellow et al. is another example, albeit with less depth than Bishop.I’m glad you’re enjoying the book. The approach is ideal for a very small subset of the ML population, no doubt that was their intention. I’m just weighing in that it’s entirely possible to cover this material with rigour yet much simpler notation. Even as someone who could parse this I’d go with other options. reply jeffhwang 8 hours agorootparentThanks for highlighting Bishop to me! I&#x27;ve self-taught through various resources esp. Goodfellow et al 2016. It&#x27;s taken me a number of years to rebuild my math knowledge so that I feel comfortable with Goodfellow&#x27;s treatment and look forward to learning from the Bishop book. Fwiw, I&#x27;ve found the math notation in the Goodfellow textbook to be among the best I&#x27;ve ever seen in terms of consistency and clarity. Some other books I enjoy, for example, do not seem to make any typographic indication of whether an object is a vector, scalar, or other. :( reply HybridCurve 6 hours agorootparentI appreciated the notation in Goodfellow book as well, it was easy enough for me to follow without having a strong mathematics background.

That is accurate for, say, describing the training of a neural network, but if you want to prove something about generalization, for example (which the book at least touches on from my skimming), you’ll need other techniques as well reply angra_mainyu 10 hours agorootparentprevIf you&#x27;re referring to micro&#x2F;macro, I meant more like a mathematical introduction to the models.I recall giving Mankiw a try and wished I could just find a physics-style textbook as I found it way too wordy. reply zwaps 3 hours agorootparentMost economists (who write these sort of textbooks) have some sort of math background. The push to find the most general \"math\" setting has been an ongoing topic since the 50&#x27;s and so you can probably find what you are looking for. It&#x27;s not part of undergraduate textbooks since adding generality gives better proofs but often adds \"not that much\" to insight. Nevertheless, the standard micro&#x2F;macro models are just applications of optimization theory (lattice theory typically for micro, dynamical systems for macro). Game theory (especially mechanism design) is a bit of different topic, but I suppose that&#x27;s not what you are looking for.E.g., micro models are just constrained optimization based on the idea of representing preference relations over abstract sets with continuous functions. So obviously, the math is then very simple. This is considered a feature. You can also use more complex math, which helps with certain proofs (especially existence and representation).You could grab some higher level math for econ textbooks, which typically include the models as examples, where you skip over the math.For example, for micro, you can get the following: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press.princeton.edu&#x2F;books&#x2F;hardcover&#x2F;9780691118673&#x2F;an... I think it treats the typical micro model (up to oligopoly models) via the first 50 or so pages while explaining set theory, lattices, monotone comparative statics with Tarski&#x2F;Topkis etc. reply t_mann 9 hours agorootparentprevRe your question on economics books, I think Advanced Macroeconomics by David Romer could fit your bill. It goes a lot into why the math is the way it is (arguably more interesting, like another poster said). Modern macroeconomics is also built on microeconomics, and to that extent it&#x27;s covered in the book, so you&#x27;re sort of getting two-for-one here. reply conformist 12 hours agoparentprevYes, it&#x27;s easier for mathematicians, because a lot of background knowledge and intuition is encoded in mathematical conventions (eg \"C(R)\" for continuous functions on the reals etc...). Note that this is probably a book for mathematicians. reply ivancho 9 hours agoparentprevI have a strong mathematical background, and I found the notation completely insane. Right out of the gate in chapter 1 we get a definition that has subscript indices in the subscript index and a summation with subscripts in the superscript, and then composed in a giant function chain. Later we get to 4-level subscripts deep, invent at least 3 new infix operators, define 30 new symbols from 3 different alphabets and we&#x27;re barely at page 100 out of 600. I have no idea who is supposed to follow and digest this reply chongli 6 hours agorootparentI’m not sure what specialization of math you studied, but using superscripts for indices is pretty common where you’re dealing with multi-dimensional objects. I used it in a lot of the courses in my degree. reply tsimionescu 14 minutes agorootparentThey are not complaining about superscripts for indices, but about having a subscripts in those superscripts. Basically like x² but the ² has a subscript of its own. That is very dense and graphically hard to follow as notations go. reply ivancho 4 hours agorootparentprevI have no problem with superscripts.

There’s no more getting stuck.I think it’s underrated because people hear “LLM’s aren’t good at math”. They are not good at certain kinds of problem solving (yet), but GPT4 is a fantastic conversational tutor. reply godelski 7 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t suggest this. While I agree it can be helpful, the problem is if you&#x27;re a novice you won&#x27;t be able to distinguish hallucinations. Which in my experience are fairly common, especially as you do advance topice. If you got good math rigor then it&#x27;s extremely helpful, because often things are hard to exactly search, but it&#x27;s a potential trap for novices.

See my answer to the other person (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38837646).A lot of negativity comes from people who goofed around with 3.X for a while, came away unimpressed, muttered something under their breath about stochastic parrots or Markov chains that sounded profound (at least to them), and never bothered to look any further. 4 is different. 4 is starting to get a bit scary.The real pedagogical value comes when you try to reconcile what it tells you about the equations with the equations themselves. Ask for clarification when something seems wrong, and there is an excellent chance it will catch its own mistakes. reply godelski 1 hour agorootparentThat answer isn&#x27;t very compelling as it is one of the most well known equations in ML. There are some very minor errors but nothing that changes the overall meaning. But you even seem to agree with me in your followup: don&#x27;t rely on it, but use it. I&#x27;m only slightly stronger than you.And stop all this 3.5 vs 4 nonesense. We all know 4 is much better. But there&#x27;s plenty of literature that shows its limits, especially around memorization. You also don&#x27;t understand stochastic parrots, but in fairness, seems like most people don&#x27;t. LLMs start from compression algorithms and they are that at their core. But this doesn&#x27;t mean it is a copy machine despite the NYT article but it also doesn&#x27;t mean it is a thinking machine like the baby AGI people. Truth is in between but we can&#x27;t have a real conversation because hype primed us to just bundle people into two camps and make us all true believers. Just please stop gaslighting people when they say they have run into issues. The machine is sensitive to prompts, so that can be a key difference or sometimes they might just see mistakes you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not an oracle so don&#x27;t treat it like one. And don&#x27;t confuse this criticism as saying LLMs suck, because I use them almost every day and love them. I just don&#x27;t get why we can&#x27;t be realistic about their limits and can only believe they are a golden goose or pile of shit. It&#x27;s, again, neither. reply joshuanapoli 13 hours agoparentprevMathematical notation usually has a problem with preferring single-letter names. We usually prefer to avoid highly abbreviated identifier names in software, because they make the program harder to read. But they’re common in Math, and I think that it makes for a lot of work jumping back and forth to remind oneself what each symbol means when trying to make sense of a statement. reply tsimionescu 7 minutes agorootparentI think the main difference is that in programming you typically use names from your domain, like \"request\" or \"student\". But math objects are all very abstract, they don&#x27;t denote any domain. For example, if I have a triangle and I want to name its vertexes so I can refer to them later, what would be a good name? Should I call them vertexA, vertexB, and vertexC just so it&#x27;s not a single letter? reply strangedejavu2 12 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not too difficult to understand, but this introduction isn&#x27;t written with pedagogy in mind IMO reply HybridCurve 8 hours agorootparentThis is the probably the most succinct explanation, and as an experienced perl developer, I admire your brevity. reply talentedcoin 12 hours agoparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] CamperBob2 12 hours agorootparentHonestly, because the very first sentence of the preface is \"This book aims to provide an introduction to the topic of deep learning algorithms.\" Really?

Deep learning is clearly an empirical science for the time being, and very little theoretical work that has been so impactful that I would think to include it in a book. Of the such books I&#x27;ve seen, this one seems like actively the worst one. A significant amount of space is dedicated to proving lemmas that provide no additional understanding and are only loosely related to deep learning. And a significant chunk of the code I see is just the plotting code, which I don&#x27;t even understand why you&#x27;d include. I&#x27;m confident that very few people will ever read significant chunks of this.I think the best textbooks are still Deep Learning by Goodfellow etal and the more modern Understanding Deep Learning (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;udlbook.github.io&#x2F;udlbook&#x2F;). reply thehappyfellow 12 hours agoparentThis book is not aimed at practitioners but I don’t think that means it deserves to be called „actively the worst one”.Even though the frontier of deep learning is very much empirical, there’s interesting work trying to understand why the techniques work, not only which ones do.I’m sorry but saying proofs are not a good method for gaining understanding is ridiculous. Of course it’s not great for everyone but a book titled „Mathematical Introduction to x” is obviously for people with some mathematical training.

I can do this across multiple seeds and run a statistical test on the deltas. reply psyklic 10 hours agorootparentEmpirical studies are only useful until the system is mathematically understood.

Now as someone with a PhD, I get it — It’s just too cumbersome to write out what exactly you mean and you write like you’re writing for peers +\\- a level. reply HighFreqAsuka 12 hours agorootparentprevI agree with that, I think UDL uses the necessary amount of math to communicate the ideas correctly. That is obviously a good thing. What it does not do is pretend to be presenting a mathematical theory of deep learning. Basically UDL is exactly how I think current textbooks should be presented. reply blauditore 13 hours agoparentprevI think the mathematical background starts making sense once you get a good understanding of the topic, and then people make the wrong assumption that understanding the math will help learning the overall topic, but it that&#x27;s usually pretty hard.Rather than trying to form an ituition based on the theory, it&#x27;s often easier to understand the technicalities after getting an intuition. This is generally true in exact sciences, especially mathematics. That&#x27;s why examples are helpful. reply ottaborra 12 hours agoprevThis makes me wonder.

It&#x27;s an empirical science because the mathematical tools we possess are not sufficient to describe the phenomena we observe and make predictions under one unified theory. Being an empirical science does not mean that the field is a \"wild west\". Deep learning models are subjectable to repeatable controlled experiments, from which you can improve your understanding of what will happen in most cases. Good practitioners know this. reply trhway 11 hours agorootparent>It&#x27;s an empirical science because the mathematical tools we possess are not sufficient to describe the phenomena we observe and make predictions under one unified theory.To me the deep learning is actually itself a [long-awaited] tool (which has well established, and simple at that, math underneath - gradient based optimization, vector space representation and compression) to make a good progress toward mathematical foundations of the empirical science of cognition.In the 90-ies there were works showing that for example Gabors in the first layer of the biological visual cortex are optimal for the feature based image recognition that we have. And as it happens in the DL visual NNs the convolution kernels in the first layers also converge to the Gabor-like. I see [signs of] similar convergence in the other layers (and all those semantically meaningful vector operations in the embedding space in LLMs are also very telling). Proving optimality or similar is much harder there, yet to me those \"repeatable controlled experiments\" (i.e. stable convergence) provide strong indication that it will be the case (as something does drive that convergence, and when there is such a drive in dynamic systems, you naturally end asymptotically up (\"attracted\") near something either fixed or periodic), and that would be a (or even \"the\") math foundation for understanding of cognition (dis-convergence from the real biological cognition, ie. emergence of completely different, yet comparable, type of cognition would also be great, if not even the much greater result) . reply ottaborra 11 hours agorootparentprevThe main point you&#x27;re making is fairThe only gripe I have is > Being an empirical science does not mean that the field is a \"wild west\"I think what you meant to say is: \"Being an empirical science does not necessarily mean that the field is a \\\"wild west\\\"\"you clearly haven&#x27;t seen the social sciences> Good practitioners know thissure?Edit: Removed unnecessary portions that wouldn&#x27;t have continued the conversation in any meaningful way reply bawolff 8 hours agorootparentI think the necessarily is clearly implied from context. reply tnecniv 11 hours agoparentprevA little bit of A and B. You can do a lot with very little math beyond linear algebra, calculus, and undergraduate probability, and that knowledge is mainly there to provide intuition and formalize the problem that you’re solving a bit. You also churn out results (including very impressive ones) without doing any math.A result of the above is that people are empirically demonstrating new problems and solving them very quickly — much more quickly than people can come up with theoretical results explaining why they work. The theory is harder to come by for a few reasons, but many of the successful examples of deep learning don’t fit nicely into older frameworks from, e.g., statistics and optimal control, to explain them well. reply sealWithIt 7 hours agoprevLooks like exactly what I was looking for :p reply dachworker 14 hours agoprevIs anyone using any of this math?

I first off should say that by no means do I think any of these people (at least those publishing) are dumb. You can also be a genius in one direction and a fucking idiot in another, and that&#x27;s okay. Certainly describes me haha (well less on the genius side and more on the functioning idiot side. So take everything I say with a grain of salt). Don&#x27;t get me wrong, scale is incredibly important and is certainly the reason for our recent advancements. But scale taking us to AGI is fairly naive to me. The idea here has a few clear assumptions being made. First is that the data can accurately explain all phenomena if the machine is capable of sufficient imputation. I just don&#x27;t even know how to tackle this one because it is so well established as false in the statistics literature. Another is that RLHF is enough for alignment. I like to say that RLHF is like Justice Stewart&#x27;s definition of porn: I know it when I see it. This is certainly a useful tool, but we shouldn&#x27;t be naive about its limitations. Just go on any reddit discussion on what constitutes NSFW and you&#x27;ll find tons of disagreement or even the HN discussions of \"Is This A Vehicle\"[0]. Those comments are just beautiful and crazygringo (top comment) demonstrates this all perfectly. There&#x27;s a powerful inference and imputation game going hand in hand and this is the issue. There needs to be more time spent thinking about one&#x27;s brain and questioning assumptions we&#x27;ve made. As you advance, details become more and more important. We get tricked because you can often get away without nuance in the beginning of studying something but with sufficient expertise nuance ends up dominating the discussion and you might often actually see that naivety doesn&#x27;t take a step in the right direction but rather can take you a step in the wrong direction (but often moving is more important). I&#x27;ll reference Judea Pearl and Ilya on this one[1]. Pearl is absolutely correct, even if not conveyed well (it is Twitter after all). His book will give a good understanding of this though.> What math would you use to describe the limitations of deep learning?This is hard, because there isn&#x27;t as much research in it as there is in demonstrations. I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying that there&#x27;s no work, but it is just far less popular and advancements are slower. Some optimal transport people really get into this stuff as well as people that work on Normalizing Flows. Aapo Hyvarinen is a really good person to read and you&#x27;ll find foundations for many things like diffusion in his works that far predate the boom. I&#x27;d also really suggest looking at Max Welling and any&#x2F;all of his students. If you go down that path you&#x27;ll find many more people but this is a good place to enter that network.But honestly, the best math to get started on to learn this stuff isn&#x27;t \"ML math\". It&#x27;s statistics, probability, metric theory, topology, linear algebra, and many specialized domains within these. I&#x27;d even go as far to say that category theory and set theory are very useful. It&#x27;s all that math that you learn for a lot of other things, but you just need to have the correct lens. There is a problem in math education that we&#x27;re often either far too application focused or too abstract focused that we forget to be generalist and have that deeper understanding[2]. But this is a lot and I&#x27;m not sure of a good single resource that pulls it all together in a way good for introductions (this paper certainly has many of the things I&#x27;d mention but it is not introductory). After all, things are simpler after they are understood.I&#x27;ve written a lot and feel like I may have not given a sufficient answer. There&#x27;s a lot to say and it is hard to convey in general language to general audiences. But I think I have given enough to find the path you&#x27;re asking about but just wouldn&#x27;t suggest you&#x27;re going to get a complete answer in a comment, unfortunately (maybe someone is a better communicator than me)[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36453856[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;yudapearl&#x2F;status&#x2F;1735211875191910550[2] I think the theory focused people do often understand this more, but that&#x27;s usually after going through the gauntlet and likely isn&#x27;t even seen by them along that journey and especially prior to the point where many people stop. Certainly Terry Tao understands how math is just models and something like \"the wave equation\" isn&#x27;t specifically about waves and far more general. You&#x27;ll also find a lot of breaktroughs where the key ingredient is taking something from one domain and shoving it into another. Patchwork is often needed but sometimes it gets more generalized (or they derive a generalization, then show that the two are specific instances of that general form). reply armoredtech 4 hours agorootparentML researchers saying they need \"category theory\" sounds like a way to try to convince mathematicians that their work is cool. You absolutely do not need category theory.Math is just models? Lol! reply borissk 8 hours agorootparentprevVery interesting. Are any of your lectures available online? reply godelski 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m trying not to dox myself so I can be more open on HN (though more concerns in modern era...). You can find some harsh words against some ML community practices in my history and I think it is easy to get misinterpreted as calling people dumb or confuse academic bashing from utility (I criticize LLMs and diffusion a lot because I like them, not the other way). So yes and no. But the lectures I have aren&#x27;t recorded and public (zoom for my Uni. I&#x27;m ABD in my PhD). My lecture slides and programs should be publicly visible though, but I don&#x27;t go into this with them because I&#x27;ve been specifically asked to not teach this way :&#x2F; In all fairness, our ML course only has Calc 1 as a pre-req and CS students aren&#x27;t required to take Lin Alg (most do though, but first courses are never really that great ime) or differential equations. TBH to get into this stuff you kinda need some metric theory. If you actually poke through this paper you&#x27;ll find that come up very quickly, and this is common in the optimal transport community. But I think if you get into metric theory a lot of this will make sense pretty quickly. So if you can, maybe start with Shao&#x27;s Mathematical Statistics? reply light_hue_1 13 hours agorootparentprevOh sure. I say the same to my students.But the particular spin on this book makes it look to non-experts that this is the math you need to do something useful with deep learning. And that&#x27;s just not true.Certainly you need to understand what you&#x27;re optimizing, how your optimizer works, what your objective function is doing, etc. But the vast majority of people don&#x27;t need to know about theoretical approximation results for problems that they will never actually encounter in real life, etc. For example, I have never used used anything like \"6.1.3 Lyapunov-type stability for GD optimization\" in a decade of ML research. I&#x27;m sure people do! But not on the kinds of problems I work on.Just look at the comments here. People are complaining about the lack of context, but this is fine for the audience the book is aimed at. It&#x27;s just the average HN reader.I think it would be better if the authors chose a different title. As it stands, non-experts will be attracted and then be put off, and experts will think the book is likely to be too generic. reply godelski 13 hours agorootparentYeah I would have a very hard time recommending this book too. It is absurdly math heavy. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve even seen another book this math dense before and I&#x27;ve read some pretty dense books targeting review. So I&#x27;m not even sure what audience this book is aimed for. Citations? And I fully agree that the title doesn&#x27;t fit whoever that audience is. reply nerdponx 14 hours agoparentprevDescribing it as \"moral support\" really sells it short.Imagine computer science without sorting algorithms, search algorithms, etc that have been proven correct and have known proven properties. This math serves the same purpose as CS theory.So yes, if you&#x27;re just fitting a model from a library like Keras, you&#x27;re not really \"using\" the math. If you&#x27;re working with data sets below a certain size, problems below a certain level of complexity, and models that have been deployed for many years and have well studied properties, you can do a lot with only a cursory understanding of the math, much like you can write perfectly functional web apps in Python or Java without really understanding how the language runtime works at a deep level.But if you don&#x27;t actually know how it works, you&#x27;re going to get stuck pretty badly if you encounter a situation that isn&#x27;t already baked into a library.If you want to see what happens when you don&#x27;t know the underlying math, look at the current generation of \"data science\" graduates, who don&#x27;t know their math or statistics fundamentals. There are plenty of issues on the hiring side of course, but ultimately the reason those kids aren&#x27;t getting jobs is that they don&#x27;t actually know what they&#x27;re doing, because they were never forced to learn this stuff. reply danielmarkbruce 14 hours agoparentprevSome people like to think and communicate in dense math notation. So, yes. reply fastneutron 13 hours agoparentprevIn the latter part of the book that covers PINNs and other PDE methods, it helps to frame these using the same kind of functional analysis that is used to develop more traditional numerical methods.

The comments under reflect to some degree about this observation.In any case, it is not for everyone but for someone who has received some rigorous math training and appreciates some abstract nonsense. This books is quite helpful in a sense that if you never touched \"deep learning\" before, in couple of weeks you can have deeper understanding on this topic than most of the practitioners out there and if you happen to also know how to program, you can skip most other readings and actually star to use it in your work. reply chongli 4 hours agoparentPeople tend to hate things they don&#x27;t understand more than the things that are wrong. The comments under reflect to some degree about this observation.I have noticed that most HN discussions on math topics seem to devolve into complaints about notation. There seems to be a fairly large contingent of people from the programming side of things who don&#x27;t have a formal background in mathematics.I get the feeling that it isn&#x27;t just frustration from a lack of understanding. If the topic was from some other technical field like organic chemistry or medicine I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d see this kind of response. I believe where the frustration comes from is adjacency: people have an expectation that they ought to be able to understand it because programming (via computer science) is adjacent to math. This expectation combined with a lack of understanding is what leads to cognitive dissonance. And that cognitive dissonance is what leads to the complaints about notation.The notation isn&#x27;t the problem. Every field has its own notation, jargon, and conventions. Mathematics notation is very simple and terse but the underlying concepts can be very abstract. Understanding comes from a lot of mathematical practice, not a glossary of terms. To paraphrase Euclid: \"there is no royal road to mathematics (geometry).\" reply tnecniv 3 hours agorootparentNot just understanding, but how to parse it. For example, I can read a theorem that introduces a bunch of variables in the first sentence that don’t get used until a few lines later and say “yeah those are probably just some constants they’ll use in an upcoming equation for an upper bound or something.” Before I was familiar with higher math, I’d say “what the hell are these where did they come from?” After reading enough books and papers, you can see a few steps ahead a lot of the time due to past experience (similar to what veteran chess players do). I can also jump to the middle of the document and see some notation that was defined earlier and guess what it is. Different authors might denote the space of continuous functions in a few different ways but they tend to be very similar for common objects.That said, there’s a lot of poorly written theory publications out there in my opinion. A big sin to me is that a lot of them will do stuff without explaining in simple English beforehand how they’re going to do it, why they’re doing it, and why it is important. The first item you can get if you’re going through the math line by line at least, but that can be arduous and often I want to understand the big picture before I dig into the details. It doesn’t take much — just a couple of sentences before or after the result can go a long way. reply chongli 3 hours agorootparentA big sin to me is that a lot of them will do stuff without explaining in simple English beforehand how they’re going to do it, why they’re doing it, and why it is important.I don&#x27;t fault theoreticians for not using simple English. In many cases you&#x27;re dealing with objects that are built upon a tower of abstractions with which you and your colleagues are already intimately familiar. This is true in any technical field. Sit in a hospital cafeteria long enough and I&#x27;m sure you can overhear surgeons talking shop over lunch. I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to use simple English either. They have a huge corpus of terminology for every muscle, tendon, ligament, and bone in the body. Skipping past the simple English allows them to be brief and fluid in their communication style, at the expense of leaving laypeople out of the loop. reply j2kun 6 hours agoparentprev> in couple of weeks you can have deeper understanding on this topic than most of the practitioners out thereThis book is just over two months old...

No \"prompt engineering\", no \"double deep\". In fact words \"prompt\" and \"double\" aren&#x27;t used at all. \"Recognition\" is used only once outside of bibliography just for reference. Looks like theory will not catch up with practice any time soon. With looming singularity it&#x27;s bit worrying. reply tnecniv 3 hours agoparentRight in the title it explains it’s a book on theory. “Prompt engineering” doesn’t really fit in any theoretical framework I’m aware of and, while I also like graphics, most theory publications are light on them. You might be looking for a different kind of book, which is fine, but I think the content matches the title.Also, a book on theory is going to lag quite a bit in terms of topics. The general process is that people discover something new and interesting empirically and publish articles on it. Other people develop theory explaining why that things work and publish articles on it. Once the theory gets crystallized, big ideas get distilled into a book. reply fourier456 6 hours agoparentprevThis just isn’t really a good book.

The theorems are just hints about what might be happening.The key deep learning knowledge is in papers that basically only show that X approach works best on Y (plus maybe some suggestive theorem) - for example Attention Is All You Need. reply godelski 10 hours agorootparent> The theorems are just hints about what might be happening.Isn&#x27;t this true everywhere? Certainly it is just, in the words of Asimov, the relativity of wrongness. I mean even physics is \"just a hint\" despite being an incredibly strong one. I think maybe a lot of people might not agree but I think a lot of people aren&#x27;t as aware of all the research that still goes on in every day physics. Like studying ocean waves&#x2F;currents, wind, explosions, materials, and so much more that is not quantum or relativity. But quantum and relativity get far more attention, so perception bias.> The key deep learning knowledge is in papers that basically only show that X approach works best on Y (plus maybe some suggestive theorem)I very much disagree. Those are certainly the most visible, but not the most foundational. Actually I believe this approach is holding us back, and diffusion is my best example of this. Big steps in diffusion and GANs were made around the same time, but GANs were easier to implement and less resource heavy. Sohl-Dickstein certainly is a key player despite Ho being more well known. Same with Aapo Hyvarinen. I think we got too captivated by GANs that it made it harder to publish anything else. I&#x27;ve had some experience with this personally, where I&#x27;ve given up trying to publish in Normalizing Flows because reviewers will ask why my works are not better than GANs (or now diffusion) despite being better than other Flows or even got this on a distillation based paper (multiple times before we abandoned it). If there&#x27;s too heavy of concern on metrics (not using as guides&#x2F;hints, but as targets) then how can other things advance in a normal way? You&#x27;d have to take leaps and bounds instead of incrementalism (which we&#x27;ve established is fine for popular paths. Former GANs, now diffusion). Leaps and bounds because the community size is exceptionally disproportionate and that is far more time and research being put into one than another. I&#x27;d argue that we have pretty good evidence to believe a hypothesis that counterfactually diffusion would have emerged as a strong player sooner if this weren&#x27;t how we measured publication criteria (SOTA chasing). I believe this problem has only become worse. But this is how technology always advances, it isn&#x27;t one technology getting better and better, but we see the composition of different technologies. Almost always where the replacement starts out as significantly worse than the existing status quo. So I&#x27;d argue we&#x27;re leaving a lot of good work on the table by doing this. Certainly we have enough people working in ML that we can adequately do both, which is certainly much more optimal. You need both, but problem is we just comparetoas if benchmarks are the only component of the story here. reply h423oi4j234 9 hours agoprevnext [2 more] [flagged] Koshkin 9 hours agoparentI find that programming languages is a compromise between the need to communicate between a human and the (dumb) machine on the one hand, and the need to make this communication more or less readable by humans.

    "originBody": "Computer Science > Sound arXiv:2312.01479 (cs) [Submitted on 3 Dec 2023 (v1), last revised 21 Dec 2023 (this version, v4)] Title:OpenVoice: Versatile Instant Voice Cloning Authors:Zengyi Qin, Wenliang Zhao, Xumin Yu, Xin Sun Download PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract:We introduce OpenVoice, a versatile voice cloning approach that requires only a short audio clip from the reference speaker to replicate their voice and generate speech in multiple languages. OpenVoice represents a significant advancement in addressing the following open challenges in the field: 1) Flexible Voice Style Control. OpenVoice enables granular control over voice styles, including emotion, accent, rhythm, pauses, and intonation, in addition to replicating the tone color of the reference speaker. The voice styles are not directly copied from and constrained by the style of the reference speaker. Previous approaches lacked the ability to flexibly manipulate voice styles after cloning. 2) Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Voice Cloning. OpenVoice achieves zero-shot cross-lingual voice cloning for languages not included in the massive-speaker training set. Unlike previous approaches, which typically require extensive massive-speaker multi-lingual (MSML) dataset for all languages, OpenVoice can clone voices into a new language without any massive-speaker training data for that language. OpenVoice is also computationally efficient, costing tens of times less than commercially available APIs that offer even inferior performance. To foster further research in the field, we have made the source code and trained model publicly accessible. We also provide qualitative results in our demo website. Prior to its public release, our internal version of OpenVoice was used tens of millions of times by users worldwide between May and October 2023, serving as the backend of MyShell.

(i.e. O(days) instead of O(months))(warning: detailed opinionated take, I suggest skimming)Why? Local inference is hard. You need two things: the clips to voice model (which we have here, but bleeding edge), and text + voice -> speech model.Text to voice to speech, locally, has excellent prior art for me, in the form of a Raspberry Pi-based ONNX inference library called [Piper](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rhasspy&#x2F;piper). I should just be able to copy that, about an afternoon of work! :PExcept...when these models are trained, they encode plaintext to model input using a library called eSpeak.eSpeak is basically f(plaintext) => ints representing phonemes.eSpeak is a C library and written in a style I haven&#x27;t seen in a while and depends on other C libraries. So I end up needing to port like 20K lines of C to Dart...or I could use WASM, but over the last year, I lost the ability to be able to reason through how to get WASM running in Dart, both native and web.Re: ElevenLabsI had looked into the API months ago and vaguely remembered it was _very_ complete.I spent the last hour or two playing with it, and reconfirmed that. They have enough API surface that you could build an app that took voice recordings, created a voice, and then did POSTs &#x2F; socket connection to get audio data from that voice at will.Only issue is pricing IMHO, $0.18 for 1000 characters. :&#x2F; But this is something I feel very comfortable saying wouldn&#x27;t be _that_ much work to build and open source with a \"bring your own API key\" type thing.I had forgotten about Eleven Labs till your post, which made me realize there was an actually meaningful and quite moving use case for it. All of Elevens advantages (cloning, peak quality by a mile) come into play, and the disadvantages are blunted: local voice cloning isn&#x27;t there yet, and $0.18 &#x2F; 1000 characters doesn&#x27;t matter as much when it&#x27;s interpersonal exchanges instead of long AI responses reply peddling-brink 17 hours agoprevGitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;myshell-ai&#x2F;OpenVoice Checkpoint: hxxps:&#x2F;&#x2F;myshell-public-repo-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;checkpoints_1226.zip(Checkpoint link defanged because I’m allergic to direct links to zip files hosted on Amazon.

Libschrift[1] is an example of a TTF renderer that doesn&#x27;t do any.

The need for hinting is only going to go down.Maybe one day, but I&#x27;ll note e.g. FreeType also did a lot of work on auto-hinting because as it turns out the hinting in a lot of TTF files is pure garbage.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tomolt&#x2F;libschrift[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vidarh&#x2F;skrift - X11 integration in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vidarh&#x2F;skrift-x11 reply jahewson 10 hours agorootparentFreeType did auto-hinting because Microsoft held patents on some of the hinting engine instructions.

    "originBody": "We Could Fix Everything, We Just Don't [programmers frantically pulling cables out of the wall] AI: \"Nuclear power. Double teachers' salaries. Build more houses. Distribute food more fairly. TRAINS—\" — qntmyrrh (@qntm) November 24, 2023 I remember growing up with that same old adage of how you could be the next scientist to invent a cure for cancer, or a solution to climate change, or whatever. What they don’t tell you is that we already have solutions for a lot of problems, we just don’t use them. Sometimes this is because the solution is too expensive, but usually it’s because competing interests create a tragedy of the commons. Most problems in the modern age aren’t complicated engineering problems, they’re the same problem: coordination failure. It was recently unveiled that basically every single UEFI SecureBoot implementation ever made can be bypassed with a malicious image file. This means that any manufacturer that allows the user to customize the boot image is now vulnerable to a complete bypass of SecureBoot and Intel Boot Guard. Luckily, the fix for this is pretty simple: don’t make the logo customizable. But how did something this absurd happen in the first place? The results from our fuzzing and subsequent bug triaging unequivocally say that none of these image parsers were ever tested by IBVs or OEMs. We can confidently say this because we found crashes in almost every parser we tested. Moreover, the fuzzer was able to find the first crashes after running just for a few seconds and, even worse, certain parsers were crashing on valid images found on the Internet. — binarly.io It’s pretty obvious what happened, actually. The image parsers were written with the assumption they’d only ever need to load an image file provided by the manufacturer. When this assumption was violated, all hell broke loose, because we don’t test software anymore. None of this happened because engineering is hard. None of this happened because of some tricky, subtle bug. It happened because the people writing the image parsers made an incredibly stupid mistake and then didn’t bother testing it, because the software industry doesn’t bother with QA anymore. Thus, there was no swiss cheese. There was just one slice of cheese with a gaping hole in it, because it turns out that some manufacturers decided to let users customize their boot image, thinking it would be harmless, and that by itself was enough to wreak havoc. Every layer of this problem is a different flavor of coordination failure. No one on the team who implemented this either thought that there might need to be a warning about untrusted images, or whoever did bring it up was ignored because it was supposed to be handled by another team. Except whoever was supposed to put in a warning about this either wasn’t told, or buried it inside a technical document nobody ever reads. The vendors who decided to implement user-customizable boot logos didn’t ask whether this would be a problem, or weren’t told about it. And nobody, not a single layer in this clown train, implemented a proper QA or pentesting process that could have caught this bug, because we just don’t bother testing anything anymore. Our economic incentives have somehow managed to incentivize building the worst possible piece of shit that still technically works. We know how to avoid this situation. We have decades of experience building in-depth QA processes that we are simply ignoring. We could fix this, we just don’t. This is not exclusive to software, as this fantastic video about the popcorn button explains. Our economic race to the bottom has been sabotaging almost every aspect of engineering in our society. To save a few cents per microwave, the cheap microwaves don’t include a humidity sensor and then lie about having a popcorn button when it can’t actually work properly, which leads to everyone saying “don’t use the popcorn button” and now nobody uses the popcorn buttons even on microwaves that actually have a humidity sensor and a working popcorn button. The cheapskates control the supply chain now. They have pissed in the proverbial pool, and if this sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a classic example of the Tragedy of the Commons. Except, that’s not an excuse. What’s truly absurd is that the tragedy of the commons isn’t inevitable. We know this because ancient human tribes managed to navigate responsible utilization of common resources all the time. It has no historical basis whatsoever. The tragedy of the commons only happens when you have a total failure of collective action. It is the original symptom of societal enshittification. [...] many nomadic pastoralist societies of Africa and the Middle East in fact \"balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in ways that were ecologically sound\", reflecting a desire for lower risk rather than higher profit... We actually have a cure for blood cancer now, by the way. Like, we’ve done it. It’s likely that a similar form of immunotherapy will generalize to most forms of cancer. Unfortunately, the only approved gene therapy we have is for sickle-cell disease and costs $2 million per patient, so most people in America simply assume they will never be able to afford any of these treatments, even if they were dying of cancer, because insurance will never cover it. This is actually really bad, because if nobody can afford the treatment, then biotech companies won’t bother investing into it, because it’s not profitable! We have built a society that can’t properly incentivize CURING CANCER. This is despite the fact that socialized healthcare is a proven effective strategy (as long as the government doesn’t sabotage it). We could fix this, we just don’t. Some people try to complain that this happens because democracy is hard, or whatever, and they’re also wrong. We know exactly what’s wrong with our current voting systems and CGP Grey even put out a video on it 13 fucking years ago. It inevitably results in a two-party system, because strategic voting is rational behavior, and you can’t break out of this two-party system because of the spoiler effect, and the solution is Ranked Choice Voting (or the Alternative Vote). If you want to go further and address gerrymandering you can use the Single Transferable Vote. All of these better systems were proposed decades ago. We have implemented exactly none of them for the presidential election (except for Maine and Alaska). In fact, America still uses the electoral vote system, which is strictly worse than the popular vote, we all know it’s worse, and we even have a potential solution but we still can’t get rid of it due to counterproductive societal interests. We HAVE solutions for these problems. We just don’t use them. We could be running fiber-optic cable to every house in America, and we even know how much it would cost. We just don’t because we gave the money to corporations who then used none of it and instead paid themselves huge bonuses. We know that automation is chipping away at low-skill jobs, which means our workforce needs to be better educated, and that providing free college to everyone would be a good idea, we just don’t. We know how to build interstate high-speed commuter rail, we just don’t (although Biden is trying). We could fix everything, we just don’t. We have no excuses anymore. None of these are novel or difficult problems, not even the tragedy of the commons. We can do better. We don’t need AI to fix things. We don’t need new technology to solve these problems. We already know how to do better, we’ve just dug ourselves into a cooperation slump that’s so bad we can’t even implement solutions we already know about, let alone invent new ones. We’re in this hole simply because society is run by people who are incentivized to sabotage cooperation in the name of profits. That’s it. It’s January 1st of the new year, and with all these people wishing each other a “better year”, I am here to remind you that it will only get worse unless we do something. Society getting worse is not something you are hallucinating. It cannot be fixed by you biking to work, or winning the lottery. We are running on the fumes of our wild technological progress of the past 100 years, and our inability to build social systems that can cooperate will destroy civilization as we know it, unless we do something about it. We live in what is perhaps the most critical turning point in all of human history, and we’re on a ship that has drifted far off course. The rapid current of technology means that we are swept along faster and faster, making it exponentially harder to steer away from the icebergs ahead of us. We must address our coordination failures. We must build systems that foster better cooperation, or this century won’t be a turning point for humanity, it will be the end of humanity. \"All that would remain of us would be a thin layer in some future rock face. This is the future we must avoid at all costs.\" — John D. Boswell (melodysheep) Published on January 1, 2024 at 5:30pm share:",

The UK just poured the national insurance contributions into the general taxation pool.The Manx fund (and by extension their health service) is rolling in money. The UK NHS is broke.

Claiming that we could lay fiber cable to every house, but not how to actually do it. Claiming that an alternative voting system would improve policits, but not how to move to an alternative voting system.The \"solution\" presented here is a first step in _mapping_ the problem and doesn&#x27;t even begin to solve anything. reply Telemakhos 1 hour agorootparentThere are two unexamined assumptions in the article: first that the “we” in “we can solve everything” is synonymous with “government,” and next that “we” know the correct answers.The former is a very twentieth century notion. The identification of government with society (“we”) went hand in hand with the idea that government should have power in every domain of human life and co-opt or liquidate every competing authority like academia or media or church. Here, it’s that “we” the government should take over healthcare (although regulatory approval of a cancer treatment was cited as one obstacle) and fiber-laying instead of leaving those to non-governmental authorities. Carl Schmitt in the early twentieth century had a great term for such a totalizing government: the Totalstaat. It’s not clear, however, that a Totalstaat is actually a good idea. Governments have never solved many problems at all—-homelessness comes to mind—-and it’s not clear that a government seeking to expand its power into previously non-governmental domains will serve its own interests best by solving problems rather than by providing treatments that abate problems without solving them. Treating a problem expands a state’s authority while preserving the problem as a reason for further government action; solving a problem would end that authority by ending the reason for it. Winning a war, for example, used to remove the need for a standing army until the twentieth century saw the invention of a “cold war” and “war on terror” and a perpetual standing army to treat the unsolved problem of a lingering threat. It’s not clear that this increase in government power was a good thing.Secondly, the idea that “we” (government) “know” the answers is hubris. The author claims that “we” know it would be good to send everyone to college for free, but is that actually best for everyone? Or does that just turn college to more high school, lower the quality of education, waste a lot of people’s time, slow down the creation of families and negatively impinge on demographic trends, etc? “Knowing” the solution presupposes knowledge of second-order effects, and people are generally very bad at that. Thinking that a total state “knows” the best solutions to problems is a good way to impose lots of (potentially negative) second-order effects without much recourse to do anything about it, since this total state has all the authority and no longer has competing authorities to check its hubris. reply yetihehe 1 hour agorootparentprev> Claiming that we could lay fiber cable to every house, but not how to actually do it.This one is pretty simple if you can accept 98% as \"every house\".

Nothing about the dangers of the vaccine changes in this scenario, and covid didn&#x27;t suddenly become more dangerous to them. It just became more emotionally visceral. That&#x27;s not desperation. It&#x27;s straightforward emotional persuasion, and is the \"feeling the pain\" as originally commented about.I do think there is many more social dynamics at play, but I don&#x27;t feel confident in articulating my scattered thoughts on them well.

Wearing a mask and socially distancing doesn’t matter if it means not losing another family member. Conversely, if you experience just a minor cold, you start questioning all the media you’ve seen about the death rates and this and that which can definitely lead you to thinking everyone’s exaggerating the whole thing for a reason unknown to you.I’m not anti vax at all (studied biomedical science) but I do see how people can be pushed towards having those views, even subconsciously, through highly manipulated algorithms that can use emotions to extract content in the form of comments, reaction videos, memes etc from real people.

You can&#x27;t say that about US.So two things how I hold this view.First in all those years Hamas didn&#x27;t manage to make a dent in Israel. Which makes me really think even Hamas leaders didn&#x27;t expect this attack to go this far. But it so happened Israel was unprepared with its military all busy defending illegal Jewish settlements on the West bank. Maybe they got complacent. Or a conspiracist might say Netanyahu set it all up (but I doubt it). Whatever it was, Hamas did way more damage than anyone expected so things got out of handAnd second in all these years of throwing rockets, smuggling weapons and all the stuff they were getting away with they got no serious retaliation. Paradoxically because Israel&#x27;s defenses were so good. So maybe Hamas also got a bit complacent and thought they are immune camping there under civilian hospitals and schools. replythrowaway290 3 hours agorootparentprevYour first sentence is correct but I don&#x27;t think the second tracks. US is surrounded by massive bodies of water and has no land border with a hostile nation. Invading it is not very practical.

They describe an ambient privilege, whereas capabilities represent explicit authorisation i.e. one invokes a capability to use it, and this is why entire classes of security vulnerabilities aren&#x27;t possible in true capability-based systems.Unfortunately capabilities have long been misunderstood as equivalent to access control lists, and therefore ignored or misnamed due to the difficulty of building working capability-based systems Vs ACL-based systems. (ACL-based systems should be built on top of a capability-based core, and only apply to a smallest possible domain of objects - a single global namespace with an ACL-based access control mechanism is where the common security vulnerabilities of modern operating systems begin.)Smartphone permissions are also ambient privileges, but that&#x27;s not the reason they get hacked: they get hacked because the operating systems are not designed around capabilities from boot and up, and have shared critical global namespaces with an ambient authority access control mechanism. Capabilities provide defense in depth, they don&#x27;t make a system automatically unhackable but they do make it so that a critical attack path is highly unlikely to exist. reply maxbond 3 hours agorootparentprevRe your edit, what disqualifies eg smartphone app permissions from being capabilities?

How many large-scale elections are decided by one vote?I&#x27;m well aware that that the 2000 US Presidential election was officially decided by 537 votes (in Florida, though recounts were not allowed). Nonetheless, 537 votes is not 1 vote. If one person had changed their vote, it wouldn&#x27;t have made a difference. If two people had changed their votes, it wouldn&#x27;t have made a difference. If three people had changed their votes, it wouldn&#x27;t have made a difference. You could try to coordinate all of your friends and family (in Florida), and it still wouldn&#x27;t have made a difference.Realistically, the chances of your vote changing the outcome of a large-scale election with millions of voters is practically nil. You have better odds of winning the lottery; as proof, people do actually win the lottery! But buying lottery tickets is not generally considered to be rational behavior.Admittedly, there are a number of smaller, local elections that have been decided by one vote. In general, though, I would consider strategic voting to be irrational, indeed delusional.If you want to significantly influence the outcome a large-scale election, then become ultra-wealthy and throw your money at politics. (Or you could just ignore the elections and buy off whoever wins.) The irony is that in a democracy, every vote is equal, which means none of us individually has any power as voters.You don&#x27;t need \"ranked choice voting\" or any other convoluted system in order to \"vote your conscience\", as it were. You could just do it, but we just don&#x27;t.I&#x27;m not suggesting that you ought to vote your conscience, by the way. It really doesn&#x27;t matter one way or the other. But that&#x27;s precisely why you could if you wanted to. From a kind of Kantian moral framework, you might vote as you would want everyone else to vote, and in that case, if you truly hate the two major political parties, then why would you vote for them, and want everyone else to vote for them?

To take one:> We know that automation is chipping away at low-skill jobs, which means our workforce needs to be better educated, and that providing free college to everyone would be a good idea, we just don’t.University education is primarily a signalling mechanism. Getting a degree in English literature doesn&#x27;t actually make you a better oil marker analyst to an appreciable degree, it just signals the ability to do work with minimal supervision.And if higher education is indeed a positional good then funding everyone to do it is just setting money&#x2F;time on fire. reply nmilo 4 hours agoprevDavid Graeber in Utopia of Rules:> \"When historians write the epitaph for neoliberalism, they will have to conclude that it was the form of capitalism that systematically prioritized political imperatives over economic ones.

It means convincing us that technological progress is indeed continuing, that we do live in a world of wonders, but to ensure those wonders largely take the form of modest improvements (the latest iPhone!), rumors of inventions about to happen (“I hear they actually are going to have flying cars pretty soon”), even more complex ways of juggling information and imagery, and even more complex platforms for the filling out of forms.\"The system we are in is inert and we need more than ranked voting to fix it. reply panick21_ 3 hours agoparentThat one of the dumbest things I have recently heard, and that by David Graebers amazing standard of saying nonsense. reply nmilo 3 hours agorootparentHow so? reply panick21_ 1 hour agorootparentFirst of all, I don&#x27;t actually think the argument is even very coherent. So lets break it down as far as I can understand.As background I would argue leftist in the 1970s created &#x27;neoliberalism&#x27;, its not and never was a coherent framework of policy proposed or defended by anybody. What it was is simply a framework for leftists to throw literally anybody that doesn&#x27;t agree with them (outside of leftist anarchists) into that bucket.The function was to simply group all opposing view points under one umbrella to have a unified attack vector.Somehow extreme free market people, social democrats and social conservatives are under one umbrella and somehow together have organized a global conspiracy to defend this supposed philosophy.Swedish policy makers who wanted to reduce government share of GDP from 60% to 50% are just evil Friedman loving market fundamentalists. Neoliberals want to somehow reduce governments but also want military to globally enforce neoliberal hegemony. Of course, that makes total sense. Or it maybe just could be that we are talking about lots and lots of different groups with fundamentally different points of view.> If the ultimate aim of neoliberal capitalism is to create a world where no one believes any other economic system could really workThis just fundamentally makes no sense, &#x27;neoliberal capitalism&#x27; does not have any opinions. There isn&#x27;t even a clear organization that represent &#x27;neoliberalism&#x27;.So somehow what he is saying here is that all the people who &#x27;believe&#x27; in neolibearlism somehow have convinced themselves that their live goal should be &#x27;creating a world where no one believes in alternatives&#x27;.The idea that all those supposed neoliberals somehow have a coherent program of eliminating alternatives is ridiculous.Politicians don&#x27;t want to successfully solve problems and get reelected in a land-slide victory, they much rather lose but preserve neoliberal world order. Anybody that believes this is actually delusional.The reality is solving problems is actually hard. The solution David would like (as far as I can tell) to see aren&#x27;t a magical pill that will win election no matter how much he thinks they would be. And most of the problems aren&#x27;t hard because of some neoliberal conspiracy against progress but because they politically hard and even if you can get politics to somewhat line up, actual execution is also very hard. See California High Speed Rail for example.> but really any radically different technological future at allOk, so neoliberalism is somehow preventing technological improvements, if I understand that correctly. I guess one can make that argument, but I would like some actual facts and examples. Because I don&#x27;t see it.Countries that are very neoliberal in global comparison have gone in very different direction. The Netherlands, inventor of modern capitalism, is revolutionizing transport thanks to the humble bike.Switzerland, has fundamentally changed its rail transportation system and massively increased rail modal share. They built the largest tunnel in the world to protect the Alps from to much trucking.Japan has people travel even more by rail and they are even building a crazy high speed maglev.If you look at the US, Netherlands, Switzerland and Japan, you see radically different conception of the future of transport. But these countries are all some form of neoliberal.What amazing transport technology is &#x27;neoliberalism&#x27; preventing from taking over? What path of technology is prevented by being &#x27;neoliberal&#x27;.> It cannot mean convincing us that technological change has come to an end—since that would mean capitalism is not really progressive.And &#x27;it&#x27; (again not a thing) wouldn&#x27;t want to ...> It means convincing us that technological progress is indeed continuing, that we do live in a world of wonders, but to ensure those wonders largely take the form of modest improvements (the latest iPhone!), rumors of inventions about to happen (“I hear they actually are going to have flying cars pretty soon”), even more complex ways of juggling information and imagery, and even more complex platforms for the filling out of forms.Again, there is no substance to this. Its in the nature of semiconductors that it can evolve faster then say massive rail infrastructure. To simply dismiss all progress in computing as somehow irrelevant is absurd. Improvements in software, sensors and data is what makes so many other things possible, modern manufacturing, modern research and development wouldn&#x27;t be the same without it. His casual divisiveness about computation as trivial is simply idiotic.But its hard to argue with him since he provides no counter argument at any kind, just some vague assertion that (a) neoliberalism is a dominate ideology (b) technological progress is slow.If we look at most machines, efficiency is rising continuously. New EMU trains and electric lokos are more efficient, new passenger planes are significantly more efficient, rocket technology has improved by a huge margin, electric cars have unprecedented growth, electric bikes are revolutionary. I could go on.At the same time, as I have demonstrated above, countries are doing revolutionary things even with existing technology. The bike hasn&#x27;t gotten better, but the Dutch have revolutionized transport anyway.He needs to demonstrate that technology is failing us to actually make this argument.> (“I hear they actually are going to have flying cars pretty soon”)The obsession with flying cars is a US obsession that is not talked about much here in Switzerland where I live. Instead we are in process of talking about Rail 2050 project and how it should look. Rail 2035 project is ongoing.The US has built itself into a car depended hellhole and the flying car is the only solution a car dependent nation can figure out. I guess for David this is also neoliberals fault, despite many other nations who are also &#x27;neoliberal&#x27; according to him not having the same issues.And of course the obsession with the car is something that actual classical liberals never would have wanted. National highway program is a gigantic ongoing infrastructure project. A massive book of regulation about road building that encodes all the worst design principles in law and makes it impossible to build modern advanced infrastructure. Governments that use state power to take over private property and put highways threw that land. I guess that neoliberalism as well?I have not read this new book (and wont) but from what is written here it seems to me that he believes:- Neoliberalism is a coherent philosophy --> It isn&#x27;t.- Assuming it &#x27;was&#x27; an actual philosophy, its core tenant is the suppression of alternatives --> It wouldn&#x27;t be. And even if it was, it couldn&#x27;t successfully do so.- Neoliberalism defenders accept personal failure to preserve the NWO (Neoliberal World Order) --> They don&#x27;t.- Neoliberalism prevents &#x27;real&#x27; technological improvement --> It isn&#x27;t.- Neoliberalism prevents solving &#x27;real&#x27; problems -> It isn&#x27;t since it isn&#x27;t a dominant philosophy to begin with.To some it up, David Graeber is the &#x27;perfect&#x27; leftist intellectual. Never clearly define your own own position and clearly state what and how things should be done instead but still strongly imply that it would be utterly amazing. Spread a bunch of vague smart sounding criticism about societies big evils ( capitalism). Throw some hand selected historical examples with health dose of historical revisionist takes. Throw in a strong dose of &#x27;other intellectuals that don&#x27;t agree with me are capitalist shills&#x27;.

Almost any other form of government would be better setup for things in this essay like universal healthcare, and hopefully it’s obvious why the current stock-market-obsessed version of capitalism isn’t good for long term engineering tasks like testing and QA.Here they just say that we need better voting algorithms, which is a necessary but not sufficient fix — we’re not stuck with this bad electoral system because we couldn’t figure out a better one, we’re stuck here because it benefits those in power.Also this essay could do with a bit more “and AI is going to exacerbate this injustice” but that’s my bias lol reply derelicta 2 hours agoprevAs long capitalism is allowed to exist, its prime directive aka \"ACCUMULATE WEALTH AT ALL COST\" will ALWAYS win over whatever mankind needs, for it is the capitalist class that effectively rules over the \"free\" world.

This was the age of High Modernism, with all of its planned cities and collective farms and so on. Philosopher-bureaucrat-scientist-dictator-manager-kings would lead the way to a new era of gleaming steel towers, where society was managed with the same ease as a gardener pruning a hedgerow.> Realistically this was all a sham. Alan Greenspan had no idea how to prevent recessions, scientific progress was slowing down, poverty remained as troubling as ever, and 50% of public school students stubbornly stayed below average. But the media trusted the government, the people trusted the media, and failures got swept under the rug by genteel agreement among friendly elites, while the occasional successes were trumpeted from the rooftops.> In Gurri&#x27;s telling, High Modernism had always been a failure, but the government-media-academia elite axis had been strong enough to conceal it from the public. Starting in the early 2000s, that axis broke down. People could have lowered their expectations, but in the real world that wasn&#x27;t how things went. Instead of losing faith in the power of government to work miracles, people believed that government could and should be working miracles, but that the specific people in power at the time were too corrupt and stupid to press the \"CAUSE MIRACLE\" button which they definitely had and which definitely would have worked. And so the outrage, the protests - kick these losers out of power, and replace them with anybody who had the common decency to press the miracle button!EDIT to be more topical to the submission:> So for example, Gurri examines some of the sloganeering where people complain about how eg obesity is the government&#x27;s fault - surely the government could come up with some plan that cured obesity, and since they haven&#x27;t done so, that proves they&#x27;re illegitimate and don&#x27;t care that obesity is killing millions of Americans. Or homelessness - that&#x27;s the fault of capitalism, right? Because \"we\" could just give every homeless person a home, but capitalism prevents \"us\" from doing that. Or if you&#x27;re a conservative, how come the government hasn&#x27;t forced the liberal rot out of schools and made everybody pious and patriotic and family-values-having? Doesn&#x27;t that mean our lack of strong values is the government&#x27;s fault? The general formula is (1.) take vast social problem that has troubled humanity for millennia (2.) claim that theoretically The System could solve the problem, but in fact hasn&#x27;t (3.) interpret that as \"The System has caused the problem and it is entirely the system&#x27;s fault\" (4.) be outraged that The System is causing obesity and homelessness and postmodernism and homosexuality and yet some people still support it.

    "originBody": "In the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake, when everything came to a standstill, the availability of information was the difference between life and death for many people. While some lives were saved by the information they had beforehand, others may have lost their lives because of it. There must have been many lives that could have been saved if the information had been available immediately afterwards. We, modern people, trust our lives to information. Without information, action is delayed. But when a disaster of that magnitude strikes, you have to use your intuition and act on your own before waiting for information. Excerpt from the description of the permanent exhibition at Rias Ark Museum ENTER About FAQ Supporters' Club Contact Us Download About FAQ Supporters' Club Contact Us Download Japanese Site Release 2023.09.01 Strong-Motion Monitor Layer The Strong-Motion Monitor layer is a feature that displays the real-time shaking situation throughout Japan, as observed by the Strong-Motion Observation Network (a network of seismometers for recording strong shaking), operated by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED). When an Earthquake Early Warning (Forecast) is issued, the Strong-Motion Monitor layer automatically integrates and displays the information from the EEW, including the forecasted Seismic Intensity distribution, and estimated propagation of the P and S waves along side the Strong-Motion data. If you enable Shaking Detection Notifications, you can receive Push Notifications when shaking from an earthquake is believed to have been detected. In some cases, it is possible to detect and be notified about earthquakes for which no Earthquake Early Warning has been issued. Please note that the detection method is not perfect, and notifications may be sent due to false positives. The Strong-Motion Monitor layer has been experimentally worked on since February 2023 based on the \"Joint Research Implementation Plan for the Utilisation of Strong-Motion Monitor Data\" which was established by four parties: the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED), Gehirn Inc., TBS Television Inc., and TBS / JNN NEWS DIG LLC. This service has been made available to the general public through the \"Mutual Cooperation Agreement for the Utilisation of Strong-Motion Monitor Data\". Gehirn Inc. processes and distributes the information received from a dedicated communications line installed at NIED. This dedicated line uses a redundant configuration to ensure a fast and reliable service for the NERV Disaster Prevention app. Please note that this is a separate service from the \"Strong-Motion Monitor\" web service provided by NIED. Towards Universal Design Accessibility for all Tailor the app’s interface to your own preference. Choose a colour scheme that’s optimised for colour vision deficiency/colour blindness(※1), change the contrast to suit visual sensitivity(※2) and low vision, adjust the text size and thickness, or even make use of VoiceOver, throughout the app. Learn more on the Accessibility Features page. ※ 1. Colour vision deficiency can be a group of eye conditions in which the photoreceptor cells (cone cells) that identify colours, recognise and discriminate differently from the majority. There are three types: Standard colour vision, Deuteranopia/Protanopia (red/green colour deficiency), Tritanopia (blue/yellow colour deficiency), and Monochromacy (achromatopsia/complete colour deficiency). ※ 2. Visual hypersensitivity is a sensory sensitivity of the eyes to brightness and colour. Symptoms include difficulty keeping the eyes open due to glare from the sun, and inability to look directly at certain colours or combinations of colours, such as primary colours. Learn More The NERV Disaster Prevention app is a smartphone service that delivers optimised disaster prevention and weather information, such as earthquake, tsunami and volcanic eruption bulletins, as well as landslide, flooding and inundation risk information based on the user’s current and registered locations. The app has been developed to assist residents and visitors to areas where damage is expected to occur to accurately recognise the situation and make quick decisions to be able to take action. The provided disaster prevention and weather information is received directly through a dedicated line connected to the Meteorological Service Support Centre (in both the main building of the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Osaka District Meteorological Observatory) to ensure the reliability of the information, and our independently developed technology enables the fastest level of information distribution in Japan. Various Disaster InformationAll in One Place Receive a wide range of disaster prevention information - real-time earthquake early warnings (with expected seismic intensity at your current location and a countdown until the arrival of shaking), earthquake, tsunami, and volcanic eruption early warnings, weather warnings and advisories, landslide, flooding and inundation risk distribution, rain cloud radar, real-time weather observations, typhoon information, ashfall forecasts, snow depth, and even J-Alert (Civil Protection Information) - in just one app. By touching the map displayed on the screen, you can view rain cloud conditions and local seismic intensity at any scale. Providing Users With the Most Appropriate Disaster Information The home screen displays the information you need at the time and place you need it. When there’s an earthquake, the home screen will show you the latest information. If another type of warning or alert is issued while the earthquake is active, the app will sort them depending on the type, elapsed time and urgency, so you’ll always have the most important information at your fingertips. The timeline screen shows you information related to your current location (or your registered areas) for the past three days. Before a flood or landslide caused by heavy rain, a lot of relevant information will be available, so you can confirm and react to the immediate situation at a glance. FEATURE 01 At-a-glance design Disaster prevention and weather information are integrated with an easy-to-understand map interface, so you can find the information you need at a glance. On the home screen, information is automatically sorted according to importance. FEATURE 02 Useful for daily activities Check the rain cloud radar and weather forecasts, as well as other useful daily information such as current temperature, wind speed and direction and volcanic ashfall forecasts. FEATURE 03 Unobtrusive by nature We don’t send unnecessary push notifications such as advertisements or announcements. There are no advertisements or pop-ups in the app that interfere with operation. We only provide you with the information you need for disaster prevention. FEATURE 04 Real-time updates Real-time earthquake alerts that display the expected seismic intensity at your current location and the number of seconds until arrival, seismic intensity and tsunami information that is automatically updated while the screen is open, and lightning strike information* that is updated every minute. Other frequently updated information is also immediately reflected. * Lightning strike information is currently only available through Early Access to Supporters’ Club members. Push Notifications for Important Information We send out different types of notifications depending on the device’s location, the type of information and level of urgency. If the information is not urgent, we send a silent notification as not to disturb the user. For more urgent situations where a disaster is time-sensitive, a ‘Critical Alert’ alerts the user to an imminent danger. Notifications like Earthquake Early Warnings (Alert level) and Tsunami Warnings will be forced to sound, even if the device is in Silent or Do Not Disturb modes. ※ If you prefer not to have critical alerts, you can disable them at any time from; [iOS] Settings > Notifications > Critical Alerts, or [Android] Settings > Notifications > Silent Mode Exception (Android 9.0 or later). When disabled, critical alerts will be treated as normal notifications.

Learn More Disaster Awareness Series We created this series of commercials as a message of 'self-discipline' to ourselves. Japan is a country that experiences frequent natural disasters, so it's important that the message we wish to convey with this series, is that \"so long as you're here, be prepared\". \"Natural Disaster Monument\" Released 2020.12.11 \"The History of Tsunamis\" Released 2021.01.11 \"As Quickly As Possible\" Released 2021.02.11 \"Our Duty\" Released 2021.03.12 Voice Actor: Koichi Yamadera / Planning and Production: Gehirn Inc. / Video Production: mimoid inc. and Shunsuke Sugiyama / Music Production: PASOCOM MUSIC CLUB / Cooperation: Geospatial Information Authority of Japan NERV Disaster Response Vehicle Introduction Video Reflection is about thinking about the future The NERV Disaster Response Vehicle is a PHEV, a hybrid vehicle with power generation capabilities, that can be deployed to ensure that our information dissemination activities can continue in the event of an accident or disaster that results in a prolonged power outage. When we imagined what would happen if a blackout like the one caused by the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake were to occur in the Tokyo metropolitan area, we could see ourselves helplessly regretting our lack of preparedness. As long as such events are possible, we want to be as prepared as possible. Voice Actor: Tetsuya Iwanaga (portrayed Kensuke Aida in the Neon Genesis: Evangelion series) / Planning and Production: Gehirn Inc. / Video Production: mimoid inc. and Shunsuke Sugiyama / Music Production: PASOCOM MUSIC CLUB / Audio Production: Takaki Kato (TREE Digital Studio) / Assistants: Ayuko Kuwata, Kanta Doki, Yutaro Nakamura / Cooperation: Mitsubishi Motors Corporation In the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake, when everything came to a standstill, the availability of information was the difference between life and death for many people. While some lives were saved by the information they had beforehand, others may have lost their lives because of it. There must have been many lives that could have been saved if the information had been available immediately afterwards. We, modern people, trust our lives to information. Without information, action is delayed. But when a disaster of that magnitude strikes, you have to use your intuition and act on your own before waiting for information. Excerpt from the description of the permanent exhibition at Rias Ark Museum Reliability Privacy The NERV Disaster Prevention app puts user privacy and security first. The app does not acquire any information about the user or their device that are not required to help the app to function. The user’s detailed location information (precise position) is only used for disaster prevention purposes and is calculated and processed entirely on-device, and is never transmitted externally. Location information required for push notifications of disaster prevention information is stored on the device only after having been converted to an area code (similar to that of a postcode). No location history is stored either on your device or the server, so your movements cannot be tracked. Credibility The Earthquake Early Warning service of the NERV Disaster Prevention app has been reviewed for operational systems, equipment and technical suitability, and is distributed under a licence from the Director General of the Japan Meteorological Agency to forecast earthquake ground motion. The Risk Distribution notification service was jointly developed with the JMA as a cooperating operator. Other disaster prevention and weather information that’s displayed in the app is processed independently based on JMA data. The maps are independently created based on the Geographical Survey Institute’s map data. System Reliability The NERV Disaster Prevention app’s information processing system is connected by a dedicated line to the Japan Meteorological Agency’s main office in Tokyo, and the Meteorological Service Support Centre at the Osaka District Meteorological Observatory. The system is geographically redundant with multiple data centres based in Tokyo and Osaka, and is designed to be able to continue working in the event of a major disaster.

FAQ If the problem persists... If your question was not answered on the FAQ page, please contact us via the Contact Us form. ※ Please note that our responses may be delayed as we’re only a small team of developers. Contact Us Privacy ※3 Acquired location information and registered area information is used only for displaying disaster prevention information and sending push notifications. Location information sent from the application to the server is converted into an area code or mesh code in advance, within the application (client side), and only those codes are sent over the internet. In other words, the user’s detailed location coordinates never leave your device. Battery Consumption ※4 If the app's location setting is set to \"Always Allow,\" the app will periodically retrieve your location in the background. This should have very little impact on your battery life. Also, when \"Low Power Mode\" is enabled, the app will not update your location in order to reduce power consumption. Requests and Feedback Please use the review function on the App Store or Google Play Store for any requests or feedback regarding additional features or quality improvements. ※ Please note that we may not respond to requests submitted via the Contact Us form. The NERV Disaster Prevention App is a smartphone service that delivers earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption and emergency warnings, as well as provides weather-related disaster prevention information for flooding and landslides, optimised based on the user's current and registered locations. It was developed to help people living in or visiting an area where damage is expected to occur, to accurately assess the situation and make quick decisions and actions. With information received directly through a leased line connected to the Japan Meteorological Agency, our proprietary technology enables the fastest information distribution in Japan. ※3 Gehirn Inc. is first and foremost an information security company. The security and privacy of our users is our highest priority. We take great care not to collect excessive amounts of information about our users through this application. Acquired location and registered location information is used only for displaying disaster prevention information, and for sending push notifications. The location information that's sent from the app to the server is first converted to an area code. An area code is roughly equivalent to a zip code. Only that code is sent to the server, meaning the user's exact location is never sent to the server. For example, if you were located in \"Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo\", it will be converted to a code that is used by everyone in Chiyoda-ku, so no one will ever be able to trace your exact location back to you. Additionally, the server doesn't store past area codes, so your movements cannot be tracked. All data sent over the internet is first encrypted, and all data stored in the server's database is encrypted before being stored. If you ever set your location permissions to \"Do Not Allow\" or \"Allow Only While Using\", the registration information will be deleted from the server. Additionally, if the user ever uninstalls the app, the registration information will automatically be deleted from the server roughly one month after the app last tried to communicate with the server. ※4. In order to receive notifications about disasters related to your current location; [iOS] Set Location permissions to \"Always Allow\" and enable \"Background App Refresh\". [Android] Set Location permissions to \"Always Allow\". When you set the app's location permissions to \"Always Allow\", the app will periodically retrieve your location in the background. This doesn't happen often, so the battery usage impact is negligible. Additionally, if \"Low Power Mode\" is enabled, the app will not update your location in the background in order to save power.

In that way naming this app NERV is similar to the US’s “Star Wars” strategic defense initiative…Except there was a law suit in that case because nobody bothered to get the rights from Lucasfilm reply pacificmint 11 hours agoparentThe government didn&#x27;t call it Star Wars, they called it SDI. Some lobbyists used that term and they were the ones that Lucasfilm tried to sue.The lawsuit was dismissed, btw.> On November 26, 1985, the suit was dismissed by Judge Gerhard Gesell of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, on the grounds that the lobbyists&#x27; use of the mark in a noncommercial and non-trade context fell outside the jurisdiction of trademark law.

While OP designates the root post, GP is two posts up. reply ShakataGaNai 4 hours agoparentprevI was so confused when I clicked this link. I saw \"NERV\" and knew it was related to Evangelion. But then reading the website it seems so real and legit. But then they&#x27;re using the real NERV logo from Eva, even with the \"God is in his heaven, all is right with the world\" subtext. Which makes seem like it must be some sort of spoof. But who&#x27;d set up something like this, in light of the recent disaster, and even publish real apps.Man... the cognitive dissonance I went through mentally bouncing back and forth for a few minutes. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever experienced anything like that before in my life.I&#x27;m glad all the top comments on HN are about Eva though. reply Cthulhu_ 28 minutes agorootparentThey even have Shinji in the contact form as a placeholder, it&#x27;s definitely not an accidental naming thing. reply zdw 10 hours agoparentprevArguably Gundam is more equivalent to Star Wars - similar initial release timeframe (late 1970&#x27;s), aimed at a wide audience, lots of toy and video game deals, many different stories with continuity, etc. reply p_l 4 hours agorootparentGundam has definitely wider reach, including governmental recognition https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cultural_impact_of_Gundam#Gove...

It&#x27;s the simile I&#x27;ve used to explain Eva to people who don&#x27;t know anything about anime.But then I think about some of the things in the series and movies and it&#x27;s incredibly hard to fathom those showing up in any kind of Star Wars IP.But I love that about it... I&#x27;ve always thought Star Wars sucks to be honest. I love that Japan&#x27;s is so much darker and angstier. reply Andrex 6 hours agorootparentThe original Star Wars is a perfect Hero&#x27;s Journey story told on film. In a vacuum, it&#x27;s an incredibly inventive and scrappy film.Evangelion has the benefit of not being owned by Disney, and thus not being milked into oblivion*. If all we had of Star Wars was the original trilogy, and maybe the \"Rebuild of Star Wars\" aka the sequel trilogy (speaking purely in story terms of soft-rebooting things), it could probably stand toe to toe with Evangelion on prestige. It&#x27;s just been watered down so much in the last two decades, as opposed to Evangelion which has been fiercely protected by its original creator.Weird, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be defending Star Wars in 2024. And I do much much prefer Evangelion.*I am aware of how badly Evangelion has been milked for merch, but I&#x27;m talking exclusively about media appearances in this discussion. There was Evangelion manga, but I can remember there being three series or less for about 20 years (and two of those were gag manga). In terms of visual media outside the main series (anime, EoE, Rebuild films), I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s just been a smattering of Japanese commercials using Evangelion characters. reply habitue 4 hours agorootparentNot so sure about this. I&#x27;m walking past a pachinko parlor playing the evangelion theme right now. It&#x27;s... pretty milked reply Schiendelman 7 hours agorootparentprevI thought the same until Rogue One. :) reply atleastoptimal 8 hours agoparentprevThough there are probably at least 10 anime series Americans know about (Pokemon, Naruto, Dragonball-z, Yu-gi-oh, Death Note, Demon Slayer, One Piece, etc.) more often than Eva. Eva is a relatively strange anime in contrast. Is it that Eva is more \"Japan\"-coded than the other ones, which are more \"American\"-coded, thus they would have an outsized impact overseas but not comparatively in Japan? reply Andrex 6 hours agorootparentTime and place sort of thing. There could easily be another timeline where Evangelion and Sailor Moon swap places popularity-wise in the US. The demographic for anime on broadcast television in the late &#x27;90s and early 2000s, when Evangelion was getting dubbed, just skewed too young for it to really be profitable in any way. If I remember correctly, it only ever had one complete run on Adult Swim, a late night block which really limited its exposure. I don&#x27;t think End of Evangelion has ever aired on a major broadcast network. (The Rebuild movies did get play on the revived Toonami about a decade ago, though.)I don&#x27;t think Evangelion would ever have been a breakout hit, per se, like DBZ, but depending on the circumstances it definitely could have had moderate success. reply krapp 7 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t Evangelion (in)famous for its use of Western religious and occult symbolism? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s more \"Japan\" coded than say Death Note (with Western characters) or One Piece (based loosely on Western pirate lore.) reply atleastoptimal 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s more Japan-coded in that the framing of Christianity and the occult is from a Japanese perspective: it views Christian symbolism via an outsider&#x27;s lens, as an abstract, esoteric ancient cult (which it is, but not in the common way it&#x27;s perceived in the West)Also, Eva is much more, for lack of a better term, adult-themed, thematically complex, and sexually weird than Pokemon, One piece, etc. This certainly would make it less universally popular as a cultural export. reply earthboundkid 5 hours agorootparentEva is on some level a parody of Gundam used to explore adult themes of depression, isolation, loneliness, parental conflict, and figuring out your sexual identity. It&#x27;s more like Akira or Ghost in the Shell than it is like Pokemon or One Piece. For an American analogy, it&#x27;s like Watchmen vs. Superman. Watchmen is a case of taking the kids entertainment of superhero comics and using it to explore more adult topics. reply breakbread 3 hours agorootparentOr put another way, they’re both deconstructing a genre reply falcor84 7 hours agorootparentprev> Though there are probably at least 10 anime series Americans know about ...I can&#x27;t help but feel you&#x27;re significantly overestimating the \"average familiarity\" here.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;2501&#x2F; reply atleastoptimal 7 hours agorootparentRead the end of the sentence after the parenthetical: \"more often than Eva\". I mean that if you asked any random American to name an anime, I&#x27;d wager if they knew any they&#x27;d know one of those much more often than Eva, it&#x27;s about relative awareness, not absolute awareness.And I&#x27;m pretty sure at least Pokemon is well entrenched into popular culture. Death Note and One Piece have had Netflix series, also indicated a good amount of penetration in the average market. reply krapp 7 hours agoparentprev>I read somewhere that Evangelion has similar cultural impact with the Japanese as Star Wars does in the US.related: \"Can You Live Entirely Off of Evangelion Merchandise?\" by Red Bard[0].[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_0Qr9rztRw4 reply InTheArena 11 hours agoparentprevI very much doubt that they licensed the NERV logo from Gainex here. reply striking 11 hours agorootparent> The name and logo of \"NERV\" are used with the explicit permission of khara Inc., the copyright holder of the \"Evangelion\" series, and Groundworks Corporation, which manages the rights to the series. reply hotjump 7 hours agoprevI&#x27;m japanese.TBH for a long time i had thought this was a parody account. Around the time of 2011 3.11 earthquake, the NERV Twitter account(the origin of this app) gained popularity and reputation as a reliable source of information in the social media space (At that time government official information provided on Twitter was extremely little).I guess a part of the reason of its popularity today belongs to otaku culture on the Internet that was a good fit for this kind of anime-origin stuff. Plus the company that runs NERV is owned by Sakura-Internet, which is one of the biggest computer infra business, and is believed to provide a reliable system at time of emergency. reply evanjrowley 12 hours agoprevFor those unaware, the name and logo are inspired by NERV from the Japanese anime Evangelion (1995): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;evangelion.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NERV reply mezzode 5 hours agoparentThe logo isn&#x27;t even just inspired by, it just outright is the NERV logo from Rebuild https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.evageeks.org&#x2F;Nerv_Logo reply chromakode 11 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s very funny and odd that they retained the \"God&#x27;s in his heaven, all&#x27;s right with the world\" text. reply aspire2Bamalek 10 hours agorootparent“Pippa’s Song”THE year’s at the spring,And day’s at the morn;Morning’s at seven;The hill-side’s dew-pearl’d;The lark’s on the wing;The snail’s on the thorn;God’s in His heaven –All’s right with the world!Robert Browning (1812-1889) reply Garlef 23 minutes agorootparentAh...

It was coined in the context of whatever Meta was doing with \"the Metaverse\" which for some reason everyone decided to lose their minds about as some sort of imminent threat rather then just a ge nobody wanted to play.The thing is, The Metaverse wasn&#x27;t a problem in Snow Crash. It just was - it was a thing, and it was generally regarded as one of the last places not totally under the dystopian corporate lawlessness that the rest of the world was.So the motivating example is built on misunderstanding the original text, in the same way that Meta doing it was built on misunderstanding everything about the concept. reply kmeisthax 6 hours agorootparentOk. I get that The Metaverse from Snow Crash is not quite a Torment Nexus.However, the concept still holds weight. If you want a less obnoxious motivating example, there&#x27;s actually a very, very old Torment Nexus that we&#x27;ve been trying to build for over a hundred years: humanoid robots. The play that literally coined the term robot - R.U.R.[0] - very much made them the central problem of the story. Building humanoid robots IRL is a very bad idea, and yet people still do it, resulting in all sorts of creepy robots with awful problems that could have been built as far more useful machines had they not been forcibly anthropomorphized.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;R.U.R.Yes, I am aware that the robots in this story were more grown-in-a-vat than built-from-parts, but still. reply krapp 7 hours agorootparentprevLanguage and memes evolve beyond their original intended context, boo. reply lebean 6 hours agorootparentLanguage evolves = you are wrong to use the original meaning of words? Hm reply krapp 4 hours agorootparent\"Language evolves\" means language evolves. To insist that the only valid use of the torment nexus meme is in the context of a reference to the Metaverse from Star Crash vis a vis Facebook&#x27;s meta is language prescriptivism at its most absurd. It works as a general metaphor in numerous contexts relative to the tech industry and the dystopic effects of its own utopian nerd hubris, in trying to make science fiction real while failing to heed the warnings of that same science fiction.In fact, there was a whole HN thread about an article on just that phenomenon recently[0,1].The meme is used so often because there are many, many torment nexuses. Just as the definition of \"enshittification\" ceased to be bound to a description of platform decay almost as soon as it went viral here, and \"literally\" has been its own contronym for literal centuries, \"torment nexus\" has evolved to communicate a broader concept than was originally intended. And that&#x27;s OK. It doesn&#x27;t take anything away from the original usage.Yes, one can be angry that human language doesn&#x27;t follow the strictly defined, rigid rules of a programming language, and that the meaning of words can change quickly, and that language is fluid, sometimes vague and even self-contradictory. But to be mad that other people are using a meme in a way you don&#x27;t approve of is petty and silly, because that&#x27;s how the internet works. Such people need to touch grass and get a life.[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;tech-billionaires...[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38813976 reply djur 3 hours agorootparentThe comment you replied to wasn&#x27;t complaining that the meme was being misused, but that the original tweet itself misconstrued the book it was referring to. This isn&#x27;t a prescriptivism vs. descriptivism situation, it&#x27;s a matter of literary interpretation. (Anyway, linguistic descriptivism doesn&#x27;t forbid people from having opinions about usage.) reply MeImCounting 3 hours agorootparentprevI think that pointing out of the misunderstanding about what exactly the metaverse was in the book and how it relates to silliness around Metas \"metaverse\" could actually become a meme in it own right. It speaks to how often the \"torment nexus\" meme is really just misinformed pessimism because \"technology is scary\" and many people just totally completely misunderstood the message in cyberpunk fiction.\"The radio is powered by satanic devils\" reply bee_rider 3 hours agorootparentprevI think there’s a difference here in the sense that the “torment nexus” meme was originally “off” (in the sense that it was apparently misunderstanding the Metaverse from fiction—I don’t know, didn’t read the book). I still don’t 100% understand why they dislike the meme, but I think it just might be that people are misunderstanding a book they like. I don’t really get why anyone who isn’t a fan of that particular book should care about this, it is just trivia about the book, the meme stands alone.A change in the meaning of enshittification would be worse, IMO, because it is a nice description of a widespread phenomenon. It didn’t really have a great name before (“platform decay” sounds too passive, enshittification is good because it emphasizes the fact that it is incentivized to proactively make the platform bad).So, I think we should go along with the former but not the latter. reply worthless-trash 6 hours agorootparentprevI think OP knows, its still okay to be mad about things, we do not need to accept everything is what it is. replynvahalik 11 hours agoparentprevMy first thought.

I&#x27;m not in Japan but my phone went crazy with all the earthquake and tsunami warnings. Remarkable how slow all the non-Japanese media were in covering the earthquake. Remarkable still how every streaming station I looked at was showing the shore somewhere. Fortunately these days without a reporter standing there explaining how dangerous despite the fact they are in harms way. Webcams instead. reply godelski 8 hours agoparentprevPersonally: Yeah, I think that would be a good use of tax money. I&#x27;d love to see systems like this (as well as ones like covid contact detection) built by governments, in open source, and I literally mean goverment__s__. I&#x27;d love it if they had strong encryption and privacy preservation.Practically: they aren&#x27;t doing it, so does that mean it shouldn&#x27;t be made? Government also seems pretty captured by industry (not just US) who are more interested in profits than utility. Sadly that&#x27;s supposed to be where governments should shine the most as they are supposed to have different incentive structures.Best note(?): Seems when incentives align and there isn&#x27;t strong capture that the two can work in tandem pretty well. But that seems more and more rare these days. In fact, this particular app works with JMA (government).Additional note: But couldn&#x27;t we also say the same thing about texting, calling, and even email? Are these not social goods? In fact, even in some ways the government does this. It&#x27;s why the USPS exists, which is not a profit seeking entity and services places that UPS and FedEx don&#x27;t. Also, the US gov donates to Signal (and Tor and some others) under the Radio Free Asia program. The intent is to get people under oppressive regimes encrypted communication so they can organize against tyrannical rule. But this also causes conspiracy around Signal (and Tor) because there are larger factions of the government that want to destroy encryption. This also creates a lot of distrust, especially among Americans, so would we&#x2F;they have trust in such a system? reply getwiththeprog 8 hours agoparentprevThey certainly have a nerve to dilute and add an extra layer to an important public system.

Great synergy I guess reply sneak 7 hours agoparentprevShootings affecting many people (ie mass shootings) in America aren’t common, and are over very quickly. Notification apps would not change the outcomes.Earthquakes in Japan are a fact of life, and affect many many people very often. Mass shootings anywhere (USA included) are rare, freak occurrences, that involve small numbers of people.Additional fearmongering over the very tiny risk from gun violence in the US actually makes the problem worse, not better. The mass media already does more than enough of that. reply fungi 7 hours agorootparentLoss of life from mass shootings in America is a far more regular occurrence then loss of life from earth quakes in Japan. reply solidsnack9000 13 minutes agorootparentIt turns out not to be that common, after all: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fbi.gov&#x2F;file-repository&#x2F;active-shooter-incidents...When you look at a source like Gun Violence Archive, they report many incidents where there is no loss of life as \"mass shootings\", and they also report many incidents of criminal conflict as mass shootings. The reality is that if you are not involved in criminal activity, you are vanishingly unlikely to be shot by someone else in the United States. reply graphe 6 hours agorootparentprevThe best way to stop gun violence is to stop \"fearmongering\" and shrug it off?

You appear to have constructed a strawman. reply krapp 7 hours agorootparentprevAccording to the Gun Violence Archive[0], the US has averaged 2 mass shootings a day over the last three years - less common than earthquakes in Japan, but far from being rare or a freak occurrence.I would agree that it would be pointless, though.[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gunviolencearchive.org&#x2F; reply solidsnack9000 16 minutes agorootparentA report from the FBI on \"active shooter incidents\" from 2022 indicate between 30 and 70 occur in a year. In 2022, there were 13 that met the Federal criterion for a \"mass killing\": 3 or more killed.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fbi.gov&#x2F;file-repository&#x2F;active-shooter-incidents...The reason these statistics are so different from what GVA provides is because the FBI is looking at the kinds of incidents that present a risk to a member of the general public, otherwise going about their business: they exclude self-defense incidents, gang wars, drug deals gone bad, and domestic disputes.GVA, however, defines any incident with 4 or more injured or killed with a gun as a \"mass shooting\", which technically includes even some gun range accidents. Many of the incidents they report do not involve any deaths at all. Most of the incidents they report are criminal conflict, not the kind of terrorist attacks people are thinking of when the term \"mass shooting\" is used. The risk profile of criminal conflict is very different from that of a terrorist attack, generally, since being involved in crime is a significant predisposing factor.Using GVA statistics to get a sense of one&#x27;s likelihood of injury from guns in the USA, as a basis for a comparison to natural disasters, greatly overestimates the likelihood of firearms related injury (unless you are a gang member or regularly engage in robbery, burglary, &c). reply sneak 4 hours agorootparentprevI am using the term in the layperson sense. In that sense, there are generally only 1-3 events per year, affecting fewer than 500 people in a country of 350M. (Most of the gun murders in the US are not from mass shootings.)Significant earthquakes in Japan occur at least 5-10x more often, and affect 2-4 orders of magnitude more people.Websites like the one you linked use a definition of the term much different than the one commonly used by everyday people. reply snvzz 6 hours agoprevIs there any actual reason this is not open source? reply humanlity 6 hours agoprevIt is like a biological company named Umbrella. reply positus 11 hours agoprevThis is somewhat eerie considering the earthquakes happening in Japan over the past day. reply MBCook 11 hours agoparentThey got some fame because they were posting “too many updates” this morning due to the earthquake&#x2F;tsunami and got blocked on Twitter and had to tell people to use their app instead.That’s the reason I heard about them, for the first time, this morning.I saw the name and had to go digging to see if it was real (yes), if NERV was a real government agency and not fictional as I always assumed (no), or if they stole the name&#x2F;logo (no). reply corethree 9 hours agoprevThe UI&#x2F;UX graphic design from Evangelion is actually pretty cool and clean.

Popular yes, somewhat main stream in japan but also strange enough that its mostly liked by a certain crowd. I&#x27;m part of that crowd but at the same time I get why that crowd is different.To help illustrate imagine 2010s Justin Beiber or Twilight themed earth quake apps. Right? That&#x27;s sort of a different crowd from the people who like Eva and not everyone is into that stuff. Are you more likely to download the app if it was themed liked that?Additionally Anime was not always mainstream in the world. It was considered nerdy to like it.

    "originBody": "uBlacklist 简体中文 Blocks specific sites from appearing in Google search results Chrome Web Store / Firefox Add-ons / App Store (for macOS and iOS, thanks to Group-Leafy) Description This extension prevents the sites you specify from appearing in Google search results. You can add rules on search result pages, or on sites to be blocked by clicking the toolbar icon. Rules can be specified either by match patterns (e.g. *://*.example.com/*) or by regular expressions (e.g. /example\\.(net|org)/). You can synchronize rulesets across devices via cloud storage. At the moment, Google Drive and Dropbox are supported. You can also subscribe to public rulesets. Some subscriptions are listed on the website: https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/subscriptions Supported search engines This extension is available in the below search engines.Web Images Videos News Google ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Bing ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Brave *3 ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ DuckDuckGo ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Ecosia ✔Qwant ✔ ✔ *1 ✔ SearX *2 ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Startpage ✔✔ ✔ Yahoo! JAPAN ✔Yandex ✔ ✔ *1 Only if \"Always play videos on Qwant.com\" is turned off *2 Only certain public instances are supported. If you want to add support for your own SearX/SearXNG search engine, edit src/common/search-engines.ts and build the extension manually *3 Due to the difficulty in obtaining the full URLs of image links, this extension does not support per-subdomain blocking in Brave Image Search. (For example, if the link is to \"www.example.com\", it will block the entire \"example.com\"). For subscription providers To publish a ruleset as a subscription, place a ruleset file encoded in UTF-8 on a suitable HTTP(S) server, and publish the URL. Here is an example hosted on GitHub: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iorate/ublacklist-example-subscription/master/uBlacklist.txt In uBlacklist >=6.6.0 for Chrome, subscription links are available. To add a subscription with name and url, the following URL can be used as a shortcut to the options page: https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/subscribe?name={urlEncode(name)}&url={urlEncode(url)} For the above example: https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/subscribe?name=Example&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fiorate%2Fublacklist-example-subscription%2Fmaster%2FuBlacklist.txt For developers Build To build this extension, Node.js>=16 and Yarn are required. git clone https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist.git cd ublacklist yarn # yarn build yarn build firefox production Before opening a pull request, you should make sure that yarn lint, yarn test, and yarn build-all pass. yarn lint # Some lint errors can be fixed automatically # yarn fix yarn test yarn build-all NOTE: The API keys and secrets for the sync feature are not included in this repository.

    "originBody": "PyPy has moved to Git, GitHub mattip 2023-12-29 14:19 Comments PyPy has moved its canonical repo and issue tracker from https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy to https://github.com/pypy/pypy. Obviously, this means development will now be tracked in Git rather than Mercurial. Motivation¶ We still feel Mercurial is a better version control system. The named branch model and user interface are superior. But foss.heptapod.net is not well indexed in google/bing/duckduckgo search, so people find it harder to search for issues in the project. Since Heptapod has tightened its spam control, we get reports that users create issues only to have them flagged as spam. Open Source has become synonymous with GitHub, and we are too small to change that. Much of the current development comes as a reaction to fixing issues. Tracking interlocking issues is easier if all the code is on the same platform. The FAQ presents two arguments against the move. Github notes solves much of point (1): the difficulty of discovering provenance of commits, although not entirely. But the main problem is point (2), it turns out that not moving to GitHub is an impediment to contribution and issue reporting. People who wish to continue to use Mercurial can use the same method below to push to GitHub. GitHub is more resource rich than foss.heptapod.net. We could add CI jobs to replace some of our aging buildbot infrastructure. Method¶ The migration required two parts: migrating the code and then migrating the issues and merge requests. Code migration 1: code and notes¶ I used a fork of git-remote-hg to create a local Git repo with all the changesets. Then I wanted to add a Git note to each commit with the branch it came from. So I prepared a file with two columns: the Git commit hash, and the corresponding branch from Mercurial. Mercurial can describe each commit in two ways: either the commit hash or by a number index. I used hg log to convert an index i to the Mercurial hash, and then git-hg-helper from git-remote-hg to convert the Mercurial hash to a Git hash: $(cd pypy-git; git-hg-helper git-rev $(cd ../pypy-hg; hg log -r $i -T\"{node}\")) Then I used hg log again to print the Mercurial branch for the index i: $(cd pypy-hg; hg log -r $i -T'{branch}') Putting these two together, I could loop over all the commits by their numerical index to prepare the file. Then I iterated over each line in the file, and added the Git note. Since the git note add command works on the current HEAD, I needed to checkout each commit in turn and then add the note: git checkout -q&& git notes --ref refs/notes/branch add -m branch: I could then use git push --all to push to GitHub. Code migration 2: prepare the branches¶ PyPy has almost 500 open branches. The code migration created all the branch HEADs, but git push --all did not push them. I needed to check them out and push each one. So I created a file with all the branch names cd pypy-hg; hg branchescut -f1 -d\" \" > branches.txt and then push each one to the GitHub repo while read branch; do git checkout branches/$branch && git push origin branches/$branch; done < branches.txt Note that the branches were named branches/XXX by the migration, not branch/XXX. This confuses the merge request migration, more about that later. Issue and merge request migration¶ I used the solution from node-gitlab-2-github which worked almost perfectly. It is important to do the conversion on a private repo otherwise every mention of a sucessfully mapped user name notifies the user about the transfer. This can be quite annoying for a repo the size of PyPy with 600 merge requests and over 4000 issues. Issues transfered without a problem: the script properly retained the issue numbers. However the script does not convert the Mercurial hashes to Git hashes, so the bare hashes in comments show up without a link to the commit. Merge requests are more of a problem: The Mercurial named branch \"disappears\" once it is merged, so a merge request to a merged branch does not find the target branch name in Git. The conversion creates an issue instead with the label gitlab merge request. For some reason, the branches created by git-remote-hg are called branches/XXX and not branch/XXX as expected by GitLab. This messes up the merge request/PR conversion. For some of the branches (open PRs and main target branches) I manually created additional branches without the es. The net result is that open merge requests became open PRs, merged merge requests became issues, and closed-not-merged merge requests were not migrated. Layered conversions¶ PyPy already migrated once from Bitbucket to Heptapod. Many of the issues reflect the multiple transitions: they have lines like \"Created originally on Bitbucket by XXX\" from the first transition, and an additional line \"In Heptapod\" from this transition. Credits¶ We would like to express our gratitude to the Octobus team who support Heptapod. The transition from Bitbucket was quite an effort, and they have generously hosted our developement since then. We wish them all the best, and still believe that Mercurial should have \"won\". Next steps¶ While the repo at GitHub is live, there are still a few more things we need to do: Documentation needs an update for the new repo and the build automation from readthedocs must be adjusted. The wiki should be copied from Heptapod. buildbot.pypy.org should also look at the new repo. I hope the code is up to the task of interacting with a Git repo. speed.pypy.org tracks changes, it too needs to reference the new location To keep tracking branches with Git notes on new commits, I activated a github action by Julian to add a Git branch note to each commit. Please see the README there for directions on using Git notes. Some of the merge requests were not migrated. If someone wants to, they could migrate those once they figure out the branch naming problems. Additionally, now is the time for all of you to prove the move is worthwhile: Star the repo, let others know how to find it, Help fix some of the open issues or file new ones, Take advantage of the more familiar workflow to get involved in the project, Suggest ways to improve the migration: are there things I missed or could have done better? How will development change?¶ Heptapod did not allow personal forks, so we were generous with a commit bit to the main repo. Additionally, we (well, me) have been using a commit-directly-to-main workflow. We will now be adopting a more structured workflow. Please fork the repo and submit a pull request for any changes. We can now add some pre-merge CI to check that the PR at least passes the first stage of translation. The live and active branches will be: main: what was \"default\" in Mercurial, it is the Python2.7 interpreter and the base of the RPython interpreter, py3.9: the Python3.9 interpreter, which also includes all RPython changes from main. This is exactly like on Mercurial, and py3.10: the Python3.10 interpreter, which also includes all RPython changes from main and all bugfixes from py3.9. This is exactly like on Mercurial. Working between the repos¶ Finding commits¶ If you want to figure out how a Mercurial commit relates to a Git commit, you can use git-hg-helper. You run it in the Git repo. It takes the full long hash from one repo and gives you the corresponding hash of the other repo: $ git-hg-helper git-rev d64027c4c2b903403ceeef2c301f5132454491df 4527e62ad94b0e940a5b0f9f20d29428672f93f7 $ git-hg-helper hg-rev 4527e62ad94b0e940a5b0f9f20d29428672f93f7 d64027c4c2b903403ceeef2c301f5132454491df Finding branches¶ Branches migrated from Mercurial will have a branches prefix, not branch. While GitLab uses branch for its prefix, the git-remote-hg script uses branches. New work should be in a PR targeting main, py3.9 or py3.10. Thanks for helping to make PyPy better.

I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t use it for personal (actually personal) stuff, but if I actually want to publish something — I&#x27;d do it there. If I want to contribute to something — it&#x27;s way easier to do it on Github than most other places. It makes searching for code easier too. If Microsoft decides to abuse the monopoly, or if Gitlab&#x2F;etc. would actually be much better, I don&#x27;t imagine it would be very difficult to switch. Well, yeah, sure, Github Actions and issue history are somewhat of a vendor-lock, but it&#x27;s not that bad, I suppose.Maybe Copilot (made possible by the huge non-commercial codebase on Github) being somewhat unfair advantage to other commercial alternatives is a bit troublesome, yeah. But otherwise I just don&#x27;t see why Github being a de-facto standard is bad. In fact, I am somewhat annoyed when a really popular project doesn&#x27;t have a Github repository (mostly because it makes filing an issue, or even reading existing issues much more difficult in most cases). So I&#x27;m actually glad to hear that some big projects feel pressed to migrate to github. What&#x27;s even a problem with that, apart, maybe, for github actions, that honestly suck?(Maybe I should add: I am a git hater, and do think that mercurial is just unquestionably better, but this battle is lost long time ago, so I don&#x27;t suppose it&#x27;s the topic of this discussion.) reply politelemon 11 hours agoparentprevI will admit, I&#x27;ve often searched for $project_name github to get to their repositories.

The Git model essentially says that B consists of all commits that are an ancestor of B that aren&#x27;t the ancestor of any other branch. But now I go and rebase A somewhere else--and as a result, B suddenly grew several extra commits on its branch because those commits are no longer on branch A. If I want to rebase B on the new A, well, those duplicated commits will cause me some amount of pain, pain that would go away if only git could remember that some of those commits are really just the old version of A. reply sampo 11 hours agorootparent> If I want to rebase B on the new A, well, those duplicated commits will cause me some amount of painNot really.

Advanced branching&#x2F;merging workflows become extremely painful if not impossible, which makes mercurial unusable as a \"true\" DVCS (where everyone maintains a fork of the code and people trade PRs&#x2F;merges). reply jcranmer 8 hours agorootparent> Advanced branching&#x2F;merging workflows become extremely painful if not impossibleThat&#x27;s really, really not true. First off, I used the word \"inherent\", which doesn&#x27;t mean \"immutable\"; you can retain all the benefits of mutability if you so desire. Of course, Mercurial historically focused a lot heavier on immutable commits than Git did, but hg eventually found a different path that really makes using git feel antediluvian in comparison.The second thing to note is that there&#x27;s no requirement that the &#x27;branch&#x27; property of a commit correspond to only one head. Actually, I don&#x27;t think any of the mercurial repositories I&#x27;ve contributed to ever bothered with branches; there&#x27;s just simply no need in mercurial to create multiple named branches, the way there is in git.Finally, mercurial solves the workflow problem in another way, by essentially realizing that there is a dichotomy between public, immutable commits and work-in-progress draft commits. The problem with PRs is that you end up in a situation where you have the unenviable choice between making updates with &#x27;address fixes&#x27; commits that pollute history or rebases that risk making comments go into the ether (especially on GitHub). You might have extra squashes or rebases that make PRs that depend on other PRs painful. Mercurial instead makes a rebase or other history edit simply mark the old commit as dead and link to the new version, so that any other commits that depend on it can know how to be updated to the new version. And this information is spread to anyone who pulls from your repo, but need not be retained when pushed to anyone who didn&#x27;t know about the old dead versions! reply Dylan16807 8 hours agorootparentprevLike what?How does it differ from an extra line on each commit message saying the branch name, and some options to parse it if desired?I definitely get annoyed sometimes when I have to put in extra effort to figure out which side of the tree is which. reply notPlancha 13 hours agoparentprevPypy described the following in the FAQ:> The difference between git branches and named branches is not that important in a repo with 10 branches (no matter how big). But in the case of PyPy, we have at the moment 1840 branches. Most are closed by now, of course. But we would really like to retain (both now and in the future) the ability to look at a commit from the past, and know in which branch it was made. Please make sure you understand the difference between the Git and the Mercurial branches to realize that this is not always possible with Git— we looked hard, and there is no built-in way to get this workflow.> Still not convinced? Consider this git repo with three commits: commit #2 with parent #1 and head of git branch “A”; commit #3 with also parent #1 but head of git branch “B”. When commit #1 was made, was it in the branch “A” or “B”?

And Mercurial has even lighter weight branches since you can just make a new head by committing without having to name anything, and it won&#x27;t yell at you about a detached head like git will. reply judge2020 13 hours agoprevGit should be a pretty easy-to-federate system, at least in terms of mimicking pull requests.

The original Git VFS for Windows that Microsoft designed did in fact do this, but as your third link notes, Microsoft abandoned that in favor of Scalar&#x27;s totally different design which explicitly was about scaling repositories without filesystem virtualization.There&#x27;s a bunch of related features they added to Git to achieve scalability without virtualization, including the Scalar daemon which does background monitoring and optimization. Those are all useful and Scalar is a welcome addition. But the need for a virtual filesystem layer for large-scale repositories is still a very real one. There are also some limitations with Git&#x27;s existing solutions that aren&#x27;t ideal; for example Git&#x27;s partial clones are great but IIRC can only be used as a \"cone\" applied to the original filesystem hierarchy. More generalized designs would allow mapping arbitrary paths in the original repository to any other path in the virtual checkout, and synchronizing between them. Tools like Josh can do this today with existing Git repositories[1].The Git for Windows that was referenced isn&#x27;t even that big at 300GB, either. That&#x27;s well within the realm of single machine stuff. Game studios regularly have repositories that exist at multi-terabyte size, and they have also converged on similar virtualization solutions. For example, Destiny 2 uses a \"virtual file synchronization\" layer called VirtualSync[2] that reduced the working size of their checkouts by over 98%, multiple terabytes of savings per person. And in a twist of fate, VirtualSync was implemented thanks to a feature called \"ProjFS\" that Microsoft added to Windows... which was motivated originally by the Git VFS for Windows they abandoned![1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;josh-project&#x2F;josh[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gdcvault.com&#x2F;play&#x2F;1027699&#x2F;Virtual-Sync-Terabytes... reply sunshowers 10 hours agorootparentprevI worked on source control at Facebook&#x2F;Meta for many years.

    "originBody": "Support PDR Essays Collections Explore Shop About Blog BLOG Happy Public Domain Day 2024! PUBLISHED January 1, 2024 The Mouse is free! Kind of... For anyone vaguely tuned in to the machinations of copyright law, this Public Domain Day (the day at the start of each year on which works enter the public domain) is an extra special one, for it finally sees the appearance of a certain mouse. That's right... Mickey is free! At least the particular iteration of Mickey that first graced our screens in Disney's 1928 film Steamboat Willie. And, at least in the United States, which sees works from 1928 enter the public domain today. To appreciate the monumental nature of this one needs to understand a little about Disney Corporation's relationship to, and perverse effect on, copyright law in the United States — and so how symbolic Mickey has become in the fight to preserve the public domain. The story starts (or at least takes a significant turn) in 1998 with the passing of the Copyright Term Extension Act, which basically did what it says on the tin: extended copyrights for many thousands of works which otherwise would have entered the US public domain, including Steamboat Willie (and also Plane Crazy). While Disney wasn’t the only lobbyist involved, it was certainly one of the most prominent and its involvement earned the legislation the derisory moniker of “The Mickey Mouse Protection Act”. The effect of this Act (and previous extending Acts, also involving Disney) has been devastating to the enlargement of the US public domain, locking up an enormous number of works for many decades, but… all things must pass, and so too the copyright on Steamboat Willie. So what does this mean? In a simple sense it means one can use the film as one wishes (in the US at least). And this relates also to the characters of Mickey and Minnie which star in the film, but with two important caveats: i) it’s only these particular versions of Minnie and Mickey (e.g. long arms, gloveless), later iterations are still under copyright; and ii) Disney still has the trademark, so you can’t reuse in a way which implies an affiliation with the company. For a more in-depth look at the issues involved here (including why aspects of the later Mickey iterations might also be fine to reuse), we highly recommend this great post by Jennifer Jenkins from the Center for the Study of the Public Domain and also this Twitter thread by Cory Doctorow. What else will join the public domain in 2024? Due to differing copyright laws around the world, there is no one single public domain, but there are three main types of copyright term for historical works which cover most cases. For these three systems, newly entering the public domain today are: works by people who died in 1953, for countries with a copyright term of “life plus 70 years” (relevant in UK, Canada, most of the EU, and South America); works by people who died in 1973, for countries with a term of “life plus 50 years” (relevant to most of Africa and Asia); films and books (incl. artworks featured) published in 1928 (relevant solely to the United States). Some of you may have been following our advent-style countdown calendar which revealed day-by-day through December our highlights for these new public domain entrants. The last window was opened yesterday, and while such a format was fun for the slow reveal, for the sake of a good gorgeable list we’ve exploded the calendar out into a digestible array below. Enjoy! Entering the public domain in the US Karl Blossfeldt’s Urformen der Kunst In 1928, at the grand old age of 63, just four years before his death, Karl Blossfeldt produced his first photography book, the internationally best-selling *Urformen der Kunst* (later translated into English as *Art Forms in Plants*). The book’s 120 plates display Blossfeldt’s remarkable photographs of plants – varieties from Equisetum hyemale (Winter Horsetail) to Tellima grandiflora (Fringe cups) — all captured in extraordinary detail, as if under the microscope, frozen into new forms almost beyond recognition. Using a relatively simple handmade camera, Blossfeldt achieved startling results — the plants becoming graphic, geometric. Blossfeldt’s work was quiet and unassuming, but it quickly aligned with the avant-gardes of Weimar Germany: from “New Vision” to “New Objectivity”. It provided a counterpart in the natural world to what others had attempted to achieve in the excess of the modern city: from the work of August Sander to László Moholy-Nagy. The critic Walter Benjamin was one of the first to review Blossfeldt’s book, claiming his fellow German had discovered the “optical unconscious”: that which was invisible to the naked eye, revealed retrospectively or technically through the apparatus of the camera.

See images and read about the work in The Public Domain Review Wanda Gág’s Millions of Cats Millions of Cats (1928), the oldest American picture book still in print, is the work of the American artist, author, translator, and illustrator Wanda Gág. The hand-lettered text, done by the author’s brother, tells the story of an elderly couple who live comfortably, but realize that they are very lonely. The wife wants a cat to love, so her husband sets off in search of a beautiful one to bring home to her. After travelling far away from home, he finds a hillside covered in “cats here, cats there, Cats and kittens everywhere. Hundreds of cats, thousands of cats, Millions and billions and trillions of cats...” This rhythmic phrase is repeated several other times throughout the story. Wanda Gag pioneered the double-page spread in this book. Writer and reviewer Anita Silvey explained, “She used both pages to move the story forward, putting them together with art that sweeps across the entire page spread: her favorite illustration fell in the center of the book - with the old man carrying cats against the rolling hills.” Millions of Cats is on the New York Public Library’s list of 100 Great Children’s Books.

Du Bois’s Dark Princess In Dark Princess (1928), Du Bois, a prominent African American scholar and civil rights activist, delves into themes of race, identity, and international politics. The novel follows the journey of a young African prince, Matthew Towns, as he becomes involved in a political conspiracy to uplift the Black race worldwide. Du Bois explores internationalism and international racial solidarity, as well as corruption and violent radicalism within African-American culture. The book’s subtitle, A Romance, points to the narrative’s double valence. As Michèle Mendelssohn argues, “it is the story of a love affair, as well as the story of an ideological romance that challenges one of the United States’ most cherished ideas about itself, the notion that it is a land of progress and possibility for all. The love lost between the hero and the U. S. is the spur for the novel’s political reorientation.” Not well received when first published, the novel was criticized for its expression of eroticism as well as for what some critics thought was a failed attempt at social realism. Late in life, Du Bois described this as his favorite work. (Wikipedia) Already public domain in countries with a “life plus 50 years” copyright. Bertolt Brecht’s The Threepenny Opera Die Dreigroschenoper (The Threepenny Opera) is a German “play with music” by Bertolt Brecht, adapted from a translation by Elisabeth Hauptmann of John Gay’s 18th-century English ballad opera, The Beggar’s Opera, and four ballads by François Villon, with music by Kurt Weill. It opened on 31 August 1928 at Berlin’s Theater am Schiffbauerdamm. The influential play is a satirical take on society, crime, and morality. Set in the grim underbelly of London, the narrative follows the antihero Macheath, known as Mack the Knife, and his exploits as a criminal. and i the process explores the corrupting influence of capitalism, the blurred lines between good and evil, and the nature of justice. With influences from jazz and German dance music, songs from The Threepenny Opera have been widely covered and become standards, most notably “Die Moritat von Mackie Messer” (“The Ballad of Mack the Knife”) and “Seeräuberjenny” (“Pirate Jenny”).

Lawrence, which was first published privately in 1928, in Italy, and in 1929, in France. An unexpurgated edition was not published openly in the United Kingdom until 1960, when it was the subject of a watershed obscenity trial against the publisher Penguin Books, which won the case and quickly sold three million copies. The book was also banned for obscenity in the United States, Canada, Australia, India and Japan. The book soon became notorious for its story of the physical (and emotional) relationship between a working-class man and an upper-class woman, its explicit descriptions of sex and its use of then-unprintable profane words.

Read on Project Gutenberg André Breton’s Nadja André Breton’s surrealist novel Nadja (1928) explores the dreamlike and enigmatic encounters with an imaginative woman who later became mentally ill. Through a blend of autobiography and fiction, Breton delves into the realm of the subconscious, where reality and dreams intermingle. The narrative unfolds as a series of chance meetings, discussions, and musings on the nature of love and identity. In many ways Nadja captures the essence of the surrealist movement, emphasizing the irrational and the unexpected.

Wyndham Lewis’s The Childermass: Section I Wyndham Lewis’ 1928 avant-garde novel The Childermass: Section I takes readers on a journey through a post-apocalyptic, dystopian world. The narrative follows the protagonist, Gulliver, as he navigates a surreal landscape inhabited by eccentric and grotesque characters. Challenging traditional narrative conventions and exploring themes of war, technology, and dehumanization, the book is a complex and experimental work of modernist literature that reflects the turmoil and disorientation of the interwar period.

Walt Disney’s Steamboat Willie Steamboat Willie is a 1928 animated short film directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Produced in black and white by Walt Disney Studios, the cartoon is considered the debut of both Mickey and Minnie Mouse, although both characters appeared in a test screening of Plane Crazy several months earlier. Steamboat Willie is especially notable for being one of the first cartoons with synchronized sound, as well as one of the first cartoons to feature a fully post-produced soundtrack, which distinguished it from earlier sound cartoons. Music for Steamboat Willie was arranged by Wilfred Jackson and Bert Lewis, and it included the songs “Steamboat Bill”, a composition popularized by baritone Arthur Collins during the 1910s, and “Turkey in the Straw”, a composition popularized within minstrelsy during the 19th century. The film has received wide critical acclaim, not only for introducing one of the world’s most popular cartoon characters but also for its technical innovation. In 1994, members of the animation field voted *Steamboat Willie* 13th in the book The 50 Greatest Cartoons, which listed the greatest cartoons of all time. However, the film has been the center of a variety of controversies, notably regarding the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act passed in the United States. It was close to entering the public domain in the U.S. several times: each time, copyright protection was extended. It could have entered the public domain in four different years: first in 1955, renewed to 1986, then to 2003 by the Copyright Act of 1976, and then to 2023 by the Copyright Term Extension Act (also known pejoratively as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act”) of 1998. It has been claimed that these extensions were a response by Congress to extensive lobbying by The Walt Disney Company.

Wells’s The Open Conspiracy The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution was published in 1928 by H. G. Wells. Many of its ideas are anticipated in Wells’s 1926 novel The World of William Clissold. The book is, in Wells’s words, a “scheme to thrust forward and establish a human control over the destinies of life and liberate it from its present dangers, uncertainties and miseries.” It proposes that largely as the result of scientific progress, a common vision of a world “politically, socially and economically unified” is emerging among educated and influential people, and that this can be the basis of “a world revolution aiming at universal peace, welfare and happy activity” that can result in the establishment of a “world commonwealth”. This is to be achieved by “drawing together a proportion of all or nearly all the functional classes in contemporary communities in order to weave the beginnings of a world community out of their selection.” This will ultimately “be a world religion.” (Wikipedia) Already public domain in countries with a “life plus 70 years” and “life plus 50 years” copyright. Radclyffe Hall’s The Well of Loneliness The Well of Loneliness (1928) is a lesbian novel by British author Radclyffe Hall. It follows the life of Stephen Gordon, an Englishwoman from an upper-class family whose “sexual inversion” (homosexuality) is apparent from an early age. She finds love with Mary Llewellyn, whom she meets while serving as an ambulance driver in World War I, but their happiness together is marred by social isolation and rejection, which Hall depicts as typically suffered by “inverts”, with predictably debilitating effects. The novel portrays “inversion” as a natural, God-given state and makes an explicit plea: “Give us also the right to our existence”. Shortly after the book’s publication, it became the target of a campaign by James Douglas, editor of the Sunday Express. Douglas wrote that “I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel.” A British court judged it obscene because it defended “unnatural practices between women” and it would not be published again in England for another two decades. In the United States, the book survived legal challenges in New York state and in Customs Court. Publicity over the legal battles increased the visibility of lesbians in British and American culture, and for decades it was the best-known lesbian novel in English, and often the first source of information about lesbianism that young people could find.

Read on Project Gutenberg and Faded Page Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front First published in late 1928 in the German newspaper Vossische Zeitung, Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front was published in book form the following year. This classic anti-war novel is a poignant and powerful depiction of the horrors of World War I. Narrated by the soldier Paul Bäumer, the story describes the German soldiers’ extreme physical and mental trauma during the war as well as the detachment from civilian life felt by many upon returning home from the war. Remarque’s writing is marked by its stark realism and emotional depth, conveying the futility and senselessness of war. The book and its sequel, The Road Back (1930), were among the books banned and burned in Nazi Germany. It sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first 18 months in print. Three film adaptations of the book have been made, each of which was lauded. The 1930 American adaptation, directed by Lewis Milestone, won two Academy Awards. The 1979 British-American adaptation, a television film by Delbert Mann, won a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award. The 2022 German adaptation, directed by Edward Berger, won four Academy Awards.

Siegfried Sassoon’s Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man is a novel by Siegfried Sassoon, first published in 1928 by Faber and Faber. Prior to its publication, Sassoon’s reputation rested entirely on his poetry, mostly written during and about World War I. Only ten years after the war ended, after some experience of journalism, did he feel ready to branch out into prose. So uncertain was he of the wisdom of this move that he elected to publish Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man anonymously. It is a depiction of his early years presented in the form of an autobiographical novel, with false names being given to the central characters, including Sassoon himself, who appears as “George Sherston”. Sassoon was motivated to write the work by a war incident, when a fox was loose in the trenches and one of his friends shot and killed it, though it also draws heavily on his pre-war life, with riding and hunting being among the favourite pastimes of the author. Much of the material for the novel came from Sassoon’s own diaries and he said he was inspired by the work of Marcel Proust: “A few pages of Proust have made me wonder whether insignificant episodes aren’t the most significant”.

Set in the Scottish Highlands, *The Quarry Wood* tells the story of Martha Ironside, a young woman who longs for independence and a life beyond the constraints of her rural upbringing. It’s a lyrical and introspective work that explores themes of self-discovery, feminism, and the human connection to the environment. (Wikipedia) Evelyn Waugh’s Decline and Fall Decline and Fall is the debut novel by the English author Evelyn Waugh, first published in 1928. Based, in part, on Waugh’s schooldays at Lancing College, undergraduate years at Hertford College, Oxford, and his experience as a teacher at Arnold House in north Wales, the book is a social satire that employs the author’s characteristic black humour in lampooning various features of British society in the 1920s. While the title is a contraction of Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, it also alludes to the German philosopher Oswald Spengler’s The Decline of the West (1918–1922), which first appeared in an English translation in 1926 and which argued, among other things, that the rise of nations and cultures is inevitably followed by their eclipse. Waugh read both Gibbons and Spengler while writing the book. Indeed, Waugh’s satire is unambiguously hostile to much that was in vogue in the late 1920s, and “themes of cultural confusion, moral disorientation and social bedlam...both drive the novel forward and fuel its humour.” Waugh himself stated in his ‘Author’s Note’ to the first edition: ‘Please bear in mind throughout that IT IS MEANT TO BE FUNNY.’ (Wikipedia) Already public domain in countries with a “life plus 50 years” copyright. Read on Project Gutenberg The Passion of Joan of Arc directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc is a 1928 French silent historical film based on the actual record of the trial of Joan of Arc. The film was directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer and stars Renée Jeanne Falconetti as Joan. It is widely regarded as a landmark of cinema, especially for its production, Dreyer’s direction, and Falconetti’s performance, which is often listed as one of the finest in cinema history. Dreyer spent over a year researching Joan of Arc and the transcripts of her trial before writing the script. The performance and devotion to the role of the stage actress Falconetti, in her only major film role, have become legendary among film scholars. The film — shot on one huge concrete set modeled on medieval architecture in order to realistically portray the Rouen prison — is known for its cinematography and use of close-ups. Dreyer did not allow the actors to wear make-up and used lighting designs that made the actors look more grotesque. Despite the objections and cutting of the film by clerical and government authorities, it was a major critical success when first released and has consistently been considered one of the greatest films ever made. It has been praised and referenced by many film directors and musicians. In 1958, the film was voted number 4 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo.

Virginia Woolf’s Orlando: A Biography Virginia Woolf’s Orlando: A Biography has been described as a history of English literature in satiric form. Arguably one of Woolf’s most popular novels, it was inspired by the tumultuous family history of the aristocratic poet and novelist Vita Sackville-West, Woolf’s lover and close friend. The book describes the adventures of a poet who changes sex from man to woman and lives for centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history. Considered a feminist classic, the book has been written about extensively by scholars of women’s writing and gender and transgender studies.

Read on Project Gutenberg and Faded Page Margaret Mead’s Coming of Age in Samoa Coming of Age in Samoa: A Psychological Study of Primitive Youth for Western Civilisation is a 1928 book by American anthropologist Margaret Mead based upon her research and study of youth – primarily adolescent girls – on the island of Taʻū in the Samoan Islands. The book details the sexual life of teenagers in Samoan society in the early 20th century, and theorizes that culture has a leading influence on psychosexual development. The book launched Mead as a pioneering researcher and as the most famous anthropologist in the world. The book has sparked years of ongoing and intense debate and controversy on questions pertaining to society, culture, and science. It is a key text in the nature versus nurture debate, as well as in discussions on issues relating to family, adolescence, gender, social norms, and attitudes. Mead’s field work for “Coming of Age” has been scrutinized, and major discrepancies were found between her published statements and her field data. Samoans themselves tend to be critical of what Mead wrote of their culture, especially her claim that adolescent promiscuity was socially acceptable in Samoa in the 1920s. (Wikipedia) A. A. Milne’s The House at Pooh Corner The House at Pooh Corner is a 1928 children’s book by A. A. Milne and illustrated by E. H. Shepard. This book is the second novel, and final one by Milne, to feature Winnie-the-Pooh and his world. The book is also notable for introducing the character, Tigger, a bouncy and energetic tiger. The collection of tales include Eeyore’s birthday celebration, Pooh’s attempt to catch a Heffalump, and an “expotition” to the North Pole. Amidst the lighthearted moments, the book takes a poignant turn in the final chapter as Christopher Robin and Pooh share a heartfelt conversation about the inevitability of growing up.

Selma Lagerlöf’s Anna Svärd Selma Lagerlöf’s Anna Svärd (1928) tells the story of a young woman who finds herself torn between duty and love. Set in 19th-century Sweden, the novel portrays the societal norms and constraints that restrict women’s choices. Many lives are interwoven in the book: Karl-Arthur, the preacher with his self-defeating ideals of self-denial and sacrifice, the practical valley girl Anna Svärd, who holds on to her own to the very end and does not want to share with anyone in heaven or on earth, Charlotte Schagerström who lives happily with her husband but still cannot forget Karl-Arthur, the obnoxious Thea Sundler, the “baron of jokes” Göran Löwensköld, a cavalier figure, and the entire Löwensköld family in Karlstad and at Hedeby Farm. The story also weaves in many episodes alongside the plot, fairy tales and folk tales, in Lagerlöf’s characteristic narrative style. It is the last book in the so-called Ring trilogy, published together in English in 1931 as The Ring of the Löwenskölds.

October: Ten Days That Shook the World directed by Sergei Eisenstein October: Ten Days That Shook the World (in Russian: Октябрь (Десять дней, которые потрясли мир) is a 1928 Soviet silent historical film written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov. It is a celebratory dramatization of the 1917 October Revolution, one of two films commissioned by the Soviet government to honour the tenth anniversary of the event. Eisenstein used the film to further develop his theories of film structure, using a concept he described as “intellectual montage”, the editing together of shots of apparently unconnected objects in order to create and encourage intellectual comparisons between them. One of the film’s most celebrated examples of this technique is a baroque image of Jesus that is compared, through a series of shots, to Hindu deities, the Buddha, Aztec gods, and finally a primitive idol in order to suggest the sameness of all religions; the idol is then compared with military regalia to suggest the linking of patriotism and religious fervour by the state. In another sequence Alexander Kerensky, head of the pre-Bolshevik revolutionary Provisional Government, is compared to a preening mechanical peacock. Eisenstein’s montage experiments met with official disapproval; the authorities complained that *October* was unintelligible to the masses, and Eisenstein was attacked—for neither the first time nor the last—for excessive “formalism”. He was also required to re-edit the work to expurgate references to Leon Trotsky, who had recently been purged by Joseph Stalin. (Wikipedia) Watch the film on Internet Archive with English subtitles. Entering the public domain in countries with a ‘life plus 70 year’ copyright term Rudolf Bauer Rudolf Bauer (1889–1953) was a prominent German-born painter who made significant contributions to abstract art. He played a central role in the avant-garde group Der Sturm, which would become the most important artistic center in Berlin through the 1910s and 20s, and in the 1930s his work became a cornerstone of the Solomon R. Guggenheim’s non-objective art collection. Known for his abstract compositions, characterized by vibrant colors, geometric shapes, and a focus on the interplay of form and color, Bauer’s best-known paintings include Composition VII and Construction in Space. (Wikipedia) Francis Picabia Francis Picabia (1879–1953) was a notable French avant-garde painter, writer, filmmaker, and poet closely associated with the Dada movement. Considering the many styles that Picabia painted in, observers have described his career as “shape-shifting” or “kaleidoscopic”. After experimenting with Impressionism and Pointillism, Picabia became associated with Cubism. His highly abstract planar compositions were colourful and rich in contrasts. He was one of the early major figures of the Dada movement in the United States and in France before denouncing it in 1921. He was later briefly associated with Surrealism, but would soon turn his back on the art establishment. Some of his significant works include I See Again in Memory My Dear Udnie and Dances at the Spring. (Wikipedia) Works by Francis Picabia on Wikimedia Commons Dylan Thomas Dylan Thomas (1914–1953) was a celebrated Welsh poet and writer, known for his iconic poems “Do not go gentle into that good night”, “And death shall have no dominion”, and the “play for voices” called Under Milk Wood. He also wrote stories and radio broadcasts such as A Child’s Christmas in Wales and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog. He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his death at the age of 39 in New York City. Although Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century, noted for his original, rhythmic, and ingenious use of words and imagery. (Wikipedia) Works by Dylan Thomas at Project Gutenberg Cecil Hepworth Cecil Hepworth (1874–1953) was a pioneer in the British film industry, known for his contributions as a film director, producer, and screenwriter. He played a significant role in the early development of the British film industry and continued making films into the 1920s through his company Hepworth Picture Plays. His notable works include Alice in Wonderland (1903), the first film adaptation of Lewis Carroll’s children’s book, and Rescued by Rover (1905), an early example of narrative cinema. By 1910, Hepworth was also the inventor of Vivaphone, an early sound on disk system for adding sound to motion pictures.

He gained renown for his satirical poetry, with works like Cautionary Tales that offered humorous and moralistic narratives. Belloc was also an accomplished historian, exploring topics such as The Servile State and The Path to Rome. His oratory skills, political activism, and extensive literary contributions left an enduring mark on both literature and socio-political discourse. (Wikipedia) Django Reinhardt Jean Reinhardt (1910–1953), known by his Romani nickname Django, was a Romani-French jazz guitarist and composer. He was one of the first major jazz talents to emerge in Europe and has been hailed as one of its most significant exponents. With violinist Stéphane Grappelli, Reinhardt formed the Paris-based Quintette du Hot Club de France in 1934. The group was among the first to play jazz that featured the guitar as a lead instrument. Reinhardt recorded in France with many visiting American musicians, including Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter, and briefly toured the United States with Duke Ellington’s orchestra in 1946. Reinhardt’s most popular compositions have become standards within gypsy jazz, including “Minor Swing”, “Daphne”, “Belleville”, “Djangology”, “Swing ’42”, and “Nuages”. Jazz guitarist Frank Vignola says that nearly every major popular-music guitarist in the world has been influenced by Reinhardt. He died suddenly of a stroke in 1953 at the age of 43. (Wikipedia) Works by Django Reinhardt on Internet Archive Edmund Dulac Edmund Dulac (1882–1953) was a French-British illustrator celebrated for his highly detailed magazine and book illustrations. Born in Toulouse, he studied law but later turned to the study of art at the École des Beaux-Arts. He moved to London early in the 20th century and in 1905 received his first commission to illustrate the novels of the Brontë Sisters. During World War I, Dulac produced relief books, but after the war, the deluxe children’s book market shrank, and he turned to magazine illustrations among other ventures, including designing banknotes and postage stamps, most notably those that heralded the beginning of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign. His unique artistic style, characterized by intricate details, imaginative landscapes, and a focus on the fantastical, made him one of the most prominent figures in the world of illustration in the 20th century. Some of his notable works include illustrations for The Arabian Nights and The Little Mermaid. (Wikipedia) Works by Edmund Dulac on Wikimedia commons Hank Williams Hank Williams (1923–1953) was a legendary American singer-songwriter, known for recording 55 singles that reached the top 10 of the Billboard Country & Western Best Sellers chart. Despite his relatively brief career – he died at age 29 from heart failure after many years of alcohol and drug abuse – he is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century, especially in country music. Many artists have covered his songs and he has influenced Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, and the Rolling Stones, among others. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame in 1999, and gained a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2010 he was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize Special Citation for his “craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.” (Wikipedia) Works by Hank Williams on Internet Archive Entering the public domain in countries with a ‘life plus 50 year’ copyright term Pablo Picasso Pablo Picasso (1881–1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (1907) and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War. Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art. (Wikipedia) J. R. R. Tolkien J.R.R. Tolkien (1892–1973) was an English writer and philologist, renowned as the author of high fantasy works, including The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within the same university to become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, and held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972. After Tolkien’s death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father’s extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it, Middle-earth. While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of his books led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused him to be popularly identified as the “father” of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy.

So for example a UK citizen may wish to put Tolkien&#x27;s works on the internet now that they are in the public domain there, but Tolkien&#x27;s estate might decide to sue from the United States, or from many countries in Europe. Individuals and small entities are likely unwilling to bear the legal risk.So the effective public domain date, from the viewpoint of the internet, is set by the countries with the longest protection terms, which appear to be Spain (80 years) and the US (95 years for works made for hire). reply bombcar 10 hours agoparentGutenberg has been doing this for years.

Simple to calculate too! reply grishka 5 hours agorootparentprevNothing but greed will break if it becomes 3 years.

You either go to a cinema to see the hot new movie right now, or you see it legally for free in 3 years. reply dahart 3 hours agorootparentprevMy fear is that shortening copyright now won’t do anything to stem corporate greed at all, but it would let the corporations pillage all the modern works of the massive sea of independent artists and individual creators while they’re still alive and trying to make a living. reply shmerl 11 hours agoparentprevFor sure.

These people would probably argue that the ability to sell your idea in a market with some amount of anti-competitor protection is what spurs people to make these advancements at all.Or you believe that it is more valuable for humans to collaborate and build off of each other&#x27;s ideas, which copyrights and similar legal protection concepts stifle. These people probably believe that their argument prevails over the previous camp&#x27;s argument, or they may even believe that people would ultimately advance technology without copyright protections anyway.Looking at it in one of those two ways, it seems pretty clear how one could draw the conclusion that copyrighting holds back humanity. reply sjfjsjdjwvwvc 11 hours agorootparentprevLearning materials are under lock and key and people need education.

There are explicit carve outs in the DMCA for anyone who is legitimately doing any of those things to break DRM to make copies.You just need to actually pay for the material. reply hn_acker 9 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not just about payment. It&#x27;s about licensing. Preserving&#x2F;archiving legally-obtained copyrighted works without a license is in a grey area even if you never share the archive with anyone until the term is over. Grey area means \"do at your own risk\". Preservation without distribution is not fair use, since fair use can only be decided on a case-by-case basis in court. What if the copyright holder charges an unaffordable amount for a license for archival? (Don&#x27;t forget, the preservationist is the one doing the preservation work.) What if the copyright holder doesn&#x27;t offer a license to archive their works for any price? What if the copyright holder wants their work to go away forever, even though that completely flies against the stated purpose of the Copyright Clause [1]? (You can&#x27;t have progress of knowledge if the knowledge disappears.) What if the US Copyright Office didn&#x27;t grant an exception for archival in the current three-year round of DMCA 1201 rule-making? (Why do these crucial exceptions to DMCA 1201 have to expire every three years?) What if you can&#x27;t find the copyright holder, especially in the case of orphan works?Copyright is a real, not hypothetical, obstacle to preservation [2]:> Films have disintegrated because preservationists can’t digitize them. The works of historians and journalists are incomplete. Artists find their cultural heritage off limits. (See studies like the Hargreaves Review commissioned by the UK ns of the availability of copyrighted works and public domain works, and economic studies of the effects of copyright.)I&#x27;m not arguing about whether copyright \"holds back humanity\". I&#x27;m just pointing out that \"you just need to pay for the material\" is a fundamental misunderstanding in the context of preserving copyrighted works. And personally, I think the US Congress should add a bright-line exception to copyright for preservation&#x2F;archival without distribution by anyone.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Copyright_Clause#Effect[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.law.duke.edu&#x2F;cspd&#x2F;publicdomainday&#x2F;2024&#x2F; reply c0pium 8 hours agorootparentArchiving doesn’t mean what you think it means; ripping a disc and then preserving the file so you can watch it on your phone is not “archiving”.The congress has added a process for the rule-making authority to draw bright-line distinctions for actual archivists to archive things, and they have done so. It’s just that it only applies to people who are actually archiving, not people who want to violate the terms of a license because they think they’re entitled to for some nebulous hand-wavy reason.The rest is just being mad that people who own a thing, in this instance copyright to a work, are allowed to do whatever they want with their thing. Rights holders are not people who are temporarily holding something which belongs to mankind, quite the opposite. It’s their thing, they can do whatever they please with it. If you don’t like it you can kick rocks. reply CaptainFever 4 hours agorootparentIntellectual property doesn&#x27;t actually exist. Physical property does, though.When people own their hard drives, they are allowed to do whatever they want with it, including ripping it and backing it up.

If copyright monopolists don&#x27;t like it they can kick rocks; not like they can find out anyway.In other words, keep your hands off my hard drive.

Chances are, unless you are already in the orbit of the Eventide community the first commit message style is what you are used to. It's likely what your team uses, as it is the commit message style that is typically recommended as a \"best practice\". The second style likely feels foreign, and possibly uncomfortable. It's passive voice and indicative mood, rather than the more common active voice and imperative mood. So why do the Eventide project and many teams that use Eventide choose to use this subject-first style of commit messages? Because it is more scannable. It is optimized for human cognition. Humans don't tend to read when looking at lists unless they absolutely need to. We scan. And when we scan, we want to see the most important things come first. Furthermore, the subject-first commit message style makes the commit about the change, rather than it being about what the person did that made the change. It's not about the self. It's about the code. Check Your Own Repository Try this in one of your repositories: git log --onelinegrep -v Mergecut -d' ' -f2head -50 What do you see? Imagine that's all you see when you scan. That's not a perfect simulation, as when we scan we may pattern match further into the string, we may read two words or so, we may teach ourselves that the first word is unimportant and try to skip it, but all of that requires additional effort. Our job is hard enough as it is, so we want to take every chance we can to make it easier on ourselves. Personal Experience When I first encountered the subject-first naming style that the Eventide project uses, I didn't like it. I didn't like it because of my own bias and my preference to conform to what is \"common\". It didn't look like what I was used to and I argued against it initially. I eventually recognized the benefit of scannability and decided to try it on my current team. It took some time to get used to writing messages in that style, and every new team member requires some amount of training and reinforcement. We are now three years in to using this style and our team now has a strong preference for it. I would recommend trying this style out in one of your projects. You might be surprised once you get over the initial reaction to it and you get accustomed to writing and reading messages in this style. Guidelines Here are some guidelines that we follow: You don't always need a verb if you are introducing something new. For example, \"Widget tests\" is preferred over \"Widget tests are added\". We prefer to use \"is corrected,\" rather than \"is fixed\". E.g., \"Widget reconciliation is corrected\" When something is refactored or improved in some way, we tend to use \"is clarified\". E.g., \"Widget creation is clarified\" When describing a rename, use \"rather than\". E.g., \"Widget, rather than sprocket\" When describing a version increase, be explicit about both the old and the new version. E.g., \"Package version is increased from 1.1.1 to 1.2.0\" Don't bother with the 50 character subject rule, make the first line as long as it needs to be. Brevity is useful, but 50 characters is too limiting in my experience. Comments Subscribe to be notified of new articles All Articles Copyright Aaron Jensen 2023-present",

The biggest benefit of this is that these commits can then be automatically linked to the ticket which often has a lot more detail and conversation.99% of the time when I&#x27;m looking at commit history, I&#x27;m not just generically scanning. I&#x27;m usually looking for a particular change, or when something touched a particular file, etc. Even the example given in the linked page isn&#x27;t really relevant to me, because I&#x27;m rarely \"quickly scanning\" a whole commit log for something in particular - I&#x27;d always just use a search feature (in GitHub or some git IDE plugin) for that. reply kelnos 12 hours agoparentTo me, the ticket id is extra info and goes at the end of the message body, not in the title at all.I&#x27;ve seen far too many people think that putting the ticket id into the commit message can be a replacement for writing a good commit message. I&#x27;ve even seen people think that \"Fix #123\" is all they need to put in there.The commit history should be the primary source of truth for what changes have happened.I&#x27;ve also been at orgs where they&#x27;ve switched from one ticket tracking software to another, and haven&#x27;t maintained history, or even when they do, the ticket ids and up changing afterward. reply hn_throwaway_99 10 hours agorootparentWhile I agree the commit message should summarize what happened in the commit, I pretty strongly disagree that the linkage between git and the ticketing system should not be considered an absolute \"first class relationship\". There is simply too much information&#x2F;history to consider that linkage just a \"nice to have\".Regarding migrating to new issue tracking systems, \"not maintaining history\" is absolutely a critical fail at that org. Every decent tracking system I can think of has ways to import issues from other systems - skipping that step is pretty inexcusable for all but the earliest stage projects. And the vast majority of them have ways to transparently map ticket IDs. E.g. in Jira if you migrate a project and give it a new project ID, the old IDs can still be used and they will transparently redirect to the new ID. reply kelnos 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve found that there are mainly two kinds of tickets:1. The perfunctory kind, where you make the ticket just to track the work, when the work is already obvious and well-known. There&#x27;s no discussion in the ticket; you just create it, do the work, and close it.2. The kind where you end up with a lot of back and forth between various stakeholders about what the requirement&#x2F;feature&#x2F;whatever is, or about how to reproduce a bug that needs to be fixed, or something like that. In this case, there&#x27;s a lot to wade through, and while the history can be an interesting artifact as to how everyone got to the end state of the git commit that closed the issue, it&#x27;s overly wordy.And sure, there are tickets that are somewhere in between.But ultimately I think the kinds of tickets that are closer to #1 don&#x27;t even need a reference in the git commit, because pretty much all of the ticket&#x27;s text should be in the commit message anyway. And for #2, there&#x27;s way too much information in the ticket anyway; it should be distilled down to the important details for the commit message. And yes, a reference to the ticket should be provided as well, for people who want or need to wade in to get the full context. But that goes at the end of the commit message, after the change has been adequately described.> \"not maintaining history\" is absolutely a critical fail at that orgAbsolutely agree! But that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t happen (and often!), and when it does, all your ticket references become useless, so you&#x27;d better have a good, thorough description in the commit message, or all context is lost.> Every decent tracking system I can think of has ways to import issues from other systemsBut almost universally you end up with new ticket IDs when that happens, so the references in the commit messages become useless. Sure, many of those importers will start off the description in the imported ticket with something like \"Imported from JIRA ID FOO-123\", but that requires extra effort to search. Sure, if you migrate from one instance of JIRA to another instance of JIRA, there are ways to keep those links intact&#x2F;redirected, but I&#x27;m not aware of any ticketing system that somehow preserves URLs&#x2F;IDs from completely different ticketing systems. reply hmeh 4 hours agorootparentWhat if there was another way to handle things like #2? What if you got everyone that needed to be there in the same \"room\" and had a synchronous conversation in order to resolve all ambiguity?We don&#x27;t call them tickets, because we aren&#x27;t \"ticket takers\" and we don&#x27;t expect them to contain all of the information -- how could they, it&#x27;s our job as implementers to discover and understand. They are work items, and they are placeholders for conversations. We use high-bandwidth communication to reduce, and often eliminate, the \"back and forth\" that is so common on many teams.We keep logs of our work both on a personal and project level, which includes decisions from these high-bandwidth conferences. When we have stakeholders that are hard to get meetings with we schedule a regular cadence with them so we can get their time at least once a day&#x2F;week&#x2F;whatever. reply owl57 4 hours agorootparentprev> I think the kinds of tickets that are closer to #1 don&#x27;t even need a reference in the git commit, because pretty much all of the ticket&#x27;s text should be in the commit message anywayNot really, because even tickets without body or comments have links. At the minimum, a decently configured tracker must have links to all the other commits involved. And even when there is only one commit, it&#x27;s useful information unless all tickets in your project are done in exactly one commit. reply pletnes 5 hours agorootparentprevI’ve never seen a ticket system migration keep links alive. I’m sure there are professional IT centric orgs out there that prioritize this, but in my experience, the version history (master branch) is what’s kept in practice, to keep migration cost down. Git blame is the best you can hope for, long-term. reply brian_cunnie 4 hours agorootparentprev> Regarding migrating to new issue tracking systems, \"not maintaining history\" is absolutely a critical fail at that orgSometimes it&#x27;s not a critical fail; sometimes it&#x27;s a permissions issue: only a small subset of developers have access to the original ticket.The fix is simple: write good commit messages. Don&#x27;t assume the person reading the commit message has access to the ticket. reply heads 9 hours agorootparentprevColour me old fashioned, but these tickets are usually web documents that can be located by a URL. It’s ok to use URLs for links!They are too long to fit into a title but fit nicely into the body text… See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.com&#x2F;8765309…with the advantage that many tools already know how to make these magic strings into clickable links. No need to rely on parsing # or ! or whatever. reply grogenaut 7 hours agorootparenthaving worked at several places for a while, you end up changing the tracking system url over time. This has happened to me at the job I worked at for 8 years, the one for 3 years (actually more than the others), and the recent 10 year tenure.The first place was pre-jira popularity and we maintained our own system, or used systems from our clients.The second place was a game studio and had many more bugs than any other place I&#x27;ve worked. One game title we had, we had around 29k tickets, and cleared out 7k in our biggest week. The speed of the UI actually impacted the effectiveness of our throughput at one point. We started with Traq, then hansoft. But I think jira won out over hansoft due to the ability to customize it and then sony just maintaining a jira for us that their teams used to coordinate with us, so kinda a no brainer.The last one is interesting as Amazon has many tracking systems, and even if you use jira, over time the jiras were so crowded they had several, we used jira-4 (out of 7 or 8) before I setup one for our org. At twitch we&#x27;ve been consistent on our use of one jira instance since i&#x27;ve been there, but we&#x27;ve changed the url I think 4 times since during my tenure.In all of these places we&#x27;ve had many codebases that outlasted the urls. All of those places I&#x27;ve been we just use the short numbers like AND-3421.In the cases I needed to click them I could just use alfred or a tampermonkey script. It&#x27;s a lot shorter as well. reply sghill 6 hours agorootparentThe old URLs aren’t kept around to redirect to the new location? reply danmur 5 hours agorootparentMy work isn&#x27;t what I would call highly professional in terms of infra, but for us the old URL from our Jira move is dead and gone (including the parent domain) but the ticket references work in the new instance (redirecting to a new project name also). I think you just have to pick your poison, nothing&#x27;s going to work all the time without small amounts of effort from IT. reply sghill 3 hours agorootparentDefinitely - we recently moved issue tracking to another system after 15+ years and found there were too many links to abandon, so we run a service that just redirects old URLs. reply mjcarden 8 hours agorootparentprevYou won&#x27;t be able to call Jenny with a typo&#x27;d number like that. reply The_Colonel 10 hours agorootparentprev> The commit history should be the primary source of truth for what changes have happened.It&#x27;s just super impractical.

I&#x27;m usually looking for a particular change, or when something touched a particular file,Exactly this! In our company&#x27;s commit messages, I start with the component or file I&#x27;ve touched, such as &#x27;Config: update year in example value&#x27; or &#x27;make check: reduce false positives for erroneous backslash detector&#x27; (context: we clone the repository for short-lived projects which result in a document, so having an up-to-date year value is handy and we check the PDF build for common issues)Not only does it help others find when a particular change was made, it also gives context when they&#x27;re scratching their head \"what do you mean updated year value, where do we hardcode year values? ... Oooh, in the config file where we keep example values, right that makes sense!\"This also incorporates what u&#x2F;twodave said in a sibling thread (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38832441):> when I&#x27;m looking at blame&#x2F;history I&#x27;m usually very aware of what the code is doing already. My question at those times is less about \"what\" and more about \"why\".By saying the change intends to reduce false positives, the regex change makes a lot more sense. Commit messages are often in the style of \"improved backslash detector\". You might wonder why the old version was broken, or how it is an improvement if it detects fewer instances of the problem. By knowing the why (false positive issues), things click into place. reply hmeh 9 hours agoparentprevAuthor here. We have actually managed to use the same task tracking tool for the three years our project has been running: Linear. We don&#x27;t do pull requests, and we don&#x27;t put our work item number in our commit messages.I can count on zero fingers the number of times I have ever wished I had this.We do, however, keep daily work logs (each person submits them) so we have a log of everything that everyone worked on. We have Slack history, which is sometimes referred to.I&#x27;m curious what folks find this useful for. What are the scenarios where one has to refer back to an issue from a commit?By the way, I also have the experience of inheriting a code base where the commit messages were mostly (or just) issue numbers. Guess what I didn&#x27;t inherit? The issue tracker.

As I suspected, we just don&#x27;t have these problems. Rather, we have other things that cover these needs when they arise that we have full ownership of (i.e., it won&#x27;t matter if our issue tracker is replaced).Specifically those are work logs (individual daily logs), project logs (logs for larger projects which may consist of a work cell of a few people and several work items), material logs (logs for specific equipment, virtual or otherwise), work in progress notes (notes for ongoing initiatives, including checklists, etc.), etc. They are all text files contained in git repositories that are always available for reference. We can also refer to Slack conversations, but most of our conversations are done live so as to avoid hand-offs, so we must rely on recording of decisions by folks on the team.We use our work tracking system just to track work -- placeholders for conversation.My colleague wrote in more detail about what goes into our work and why issue numbers don&#x27;t even enter our airspace: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38836919 reply AceyMan 7 hours agorootparentprevRelying on Slack history is living dangerously.

Put the commit ID(s) and&#x2F;or links in the ticketing system as part of ticket comments. Now if the ticket system changes or is exported to another system the commit ID(s) will still be in the record. They are much less likely to change plus you can have multiple commits for an issue. reply geraldwhen 12 hours agoparentprevWait until corporate drops jira, or migrates prem to cloud or vice versa with data loss, or revokes your access to an old project id the app was run on.Git commit info needs to live in git.

If a board gets archived, for example, those issues need to remain available. You&#x27;re also just tied to that tool like you mentioned. It would probably be good practice then to also include a blurb in the PR description so that never gets lost. reply hmeh 4 hours agorootparentPoint of order, PRs get lost too. Git repositories can be moved from GitHub to GitLab, or tar&#x27;d up and sent in an email when a project gets handed off to its new maintainers. We try to keep things that matter in text files in repositories. We will always own those. Tools are just tools for transient activities (work items in our task tracker are just placeholders for conversations). reply twodave 18 hours agoprevI look at commit messages every day. I actually don&#x27;t love a message that just describes the code change (I can figure that out on my own if I look at it long enough). That&#x27;s fine for bigger or more misleading changes, but when I&#x27;m looking at blame&#x2F;history I&#x27;m usually very aware of what the code is doing already. My question at those times is less about \"what\" and more about \"why\". Why was this change made? Sometimes that can be found by looking at accompanying tests (if the original author was so gracious), but if it&#x27;s not in the commit (or only obtusely so, as many developers I know tend to commit in what I&#x27;ll call \"stream-of-consciousness\" style) then I&#x27;ve got to go outside the codebase to research by interviewing people (assuming they&#x27;re still around and remember) or trawling through our project management system to try and line up released features&#x2F;fixes with the change. It quickly becomes an inexact science.That said, in my experience, the larger an organization, the more commit messages get looked at. On my side projects where only 1-3 people are involved, commit messages only really show up on the PRs as things are going in. Sometimes we complete our own PRs to keep up the velocity since we&#x27;re all working async part-time. Rarely if ever do we look back to figure out why we did something because the project is so small. reply masklinn 18 hours agoparentI agree with your first paragraph, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s super relevant to the article: the why of a commit usually takes some time to explain, and the subject line is nowhere near sufficient, so that usually goes into the first paragraphs. For non-trivial commits I try to follow the \"why, what, how\" template: first explain the issue &#x2F; concern &#x2F; background for the change, then clarify the change if the diff is not super obvious or is a bit large, and finally explain the implementation changes if there were options.In my experience the former and latter are the most important when blame-diving, I want to know the context &#x2F; driving force &#x2F; use case for a change, but I also want to know the scope of consideration, because e.g. sometimes I&#x27;m thinking of a fix which was considered and rejected for still-valid reasons, while at other times it was just considered unnecessary back then (YAGNI) or the blockers have since been removed.Either way the subject needs to be snappy, so that it can quickly be selected for consideration or not e.g. if I&#x27;m blame diving and I see a commit which just does indenting &#x2F; formatting, I probably can skip over it without looking at the actual change. reply twodave 17 hours agorootparentI mostly agree, though if I could only have “what” or “why” I would choose “why” every time. To me this is similar to describing the problem in product design. I wish the “why” was more often concise enough to be the prominent feature in a commit, because commits are difficult&#x2F;annoying to amend (I’d be surprised if more than a couple people where I work knew how) and if something is going to be left out, it is the “why”. reply masklinn 15 hours agorootparentCan&#x27;t disagree with that. I think the order of importance is why > how > what, because the first two are the least likely &#x2F; possible to infer from the commit contents. So an explicit record is most crucial. reply BoxFour 18 hours agoparentprev> My question at those times is less about \"what\" and more about \"why\". Why was this change made?Isn&#x27;t the essence of the commit message body to delve into the &#x27;why&#x27;?The ability to swiftly glean the &#x27;what&#x27; from the commit subject line aids in identifying the appropriate commit for review. The commit message body can then have a detailed explanation of the reasons behind the change. reply jbverschoor 18 hours agorootparentThe diff is the what. Putting what in the message is fluff to make gatekeepers happy reply masklinn 18 hours agorootparentDisagree.Putting \"what\" in the message can be fluff, in the same way repeating the code in a comment is fluff. But the broad strokes or considerations of the what may not be obvious from the diff. Expressing what the commit intends as prose can help with understanding, with discarding irrelevant change data, with post-mortem analysis, ... reply vitus 18 hours agorootparentIt is also useful for conveying intent. If the commit message describes one thing, and the code does the opposite (or doesn&#x27;t do it at all), that&#x27;s something the \"gatekeeper\" can and should call out.I&#x27;ve certainly sent out changes for review where I forgot to include a crucial file (or subdirectory). reply withinboredom 13 hours agorootparentAbout to say this as well, but would like to add. When I have a bug dealing with Foo in Bar, seeing a commit message like “Updated Foo to support BazSee issue #123 for additional context. Also discussed in chat (link).” When looking for a recent bug, I’m going to review that commit immediately without having to do any bisecting&#x2F;blaming. Easy peasy.Mostly though, I tend to see just “support baz” as a commit message, which drives me bonkers. reply hmeh 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll offer a perhaps controversial perspective.What if only people that had context did reviewing? As in, what if when someone needed a review, it was their job to ensure that the reviewer had the context necessary. That is, it was \"push\" rather than \"pull\".What if a team&#x27;s process was set up in such a way that separate phase-gate reviews were not typically necessary. That is, the team tended to work in pairs where there was constant reviewing going on, and the team was practiced at pulling people in when necessary to review specific parts, e.g., things they had never done before or needed additional guidance on.Do we all remember waterfall development? Where PMs would write specs, then they would throw those specs over the wall to devs, who would then throw code over the wall to testers? Does anyone feel like, perhaps, we&#x27;ve done it again with pull requests and we&#x27;ve started favoring asynchronous hand-offs, rather than one-piece-flow? reply ordu 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are different levels of \"what\".1. I&#x27;m moving value from this address to that address through %rax register.2. I&#x27;m copying this value from that place to that.3. I&#x27;m making sure that this values are equal.4. An invariant was broken and I need to restore it.If you look at it, each next like is an answer to \"why\" question applied to a previous line. Answers to \"why\" questions becomes new \"what\" and then \"why\" applied to them again.The point I want to make is it is easier to move back (in descending order) through this than forward. When you know (4) you can easily figure out what is needed to be done. But if you have (1) you need to infer next points one by one. One who just wrote the patch is probably unaware of differences, because he knows all the answers and can easily move from one to another. He&#x2F;she do not feel difficulties. But the person who reads patch starts with (1) and needs to climb the ladder in opposite direction than the person who wrote the patch. reply BoxFour 17 hours agorootparentprevIn bigger teams, scanning every diff instead of just the commit subject lines is significantly more time-consuming (a frequent activity in my experience).I often decline proposed commits that lack concise, informative subject lines, and I hope other larger teams also do for efficiency and clarity. If that&#x27;s considered gatekeeping, then I&#x27;m content to be one. reply g-b-r 15 hours agorootparentprevUnderstanding a diff usually requires knowing and remembering the codebase well, having a very clear code, the diff being reasonably short and atomic and time.Commit messages, if good, are extremely helpful to check what changed e.g. in an open-source application you&#x27;re using. Of course the commit messages can lie, so you should also check the diffs, but it&#x27;s much easier to confirm what a diff does than deducing it.Not to mention that for many changes you can only make a guess at what the intention was; if you have a message saying what was meant to be done, you can check that it really was done correctly. reply o11c 12 hours agoparentprev> when I&#x27;m looking at blame&#x2F;historyThose are two very different things when it comes to commit messages.For history, the linked argument is arguing that subject-first is better. Personally I&#x27;d prefer `[component] verb details` though, which should fix the skippability issues mentioned elsewhere. And of course you can enable diffstat to get a bit of an idea of the structure.For blame, you have the full file context in front of you. Some blame frontends only show author, but assuming you have the commit message, what you really want out of it is a rough idea of the historical significance of that line.

In testing, I’ve observed builds drop from 2m to 30s when scheduled on a node with a primed cache.It also forces me to keep my commits focused.

You want the commit linked to the issue so that you can see the entire history behind the commit, including the business decisions, the designer making a call, the back and forth with QA etc. That can all be useful a year or two down the road if you want to understand why something was done a certain way.Now there is some info about the change that perhaps only the devs would ever care about, and probably that can sit in the commit messages. That sort of happens naturally but there&#x27;s not really a lot of it for us. But that seems to me to be the relevant thing from an organizational perspective, no one writes commit messages except for devs, and almost nobody except the devs reads them. reply Scubabear68 18 hours agorootparentThis is what I came here to say. Assuming the team is working from JIRA or something, put the ticket number in the commit message. The ticket itself is where your “why” goes. reply mook 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s really nice to have the actual reasoning in the commit history though. But maybe I was just scarred by the project that switched project management software like 5 times over its lifetime (but kept all of the commits) though. reply aaronbrethorst 12 hours agorootparentI’ve been through this in a job. The commit messages were borderline worthless, ostensibly the context was in a JIRA ticket that hadn’t existed in a decade, and I couldn’t figure out if a change was a mistake or something clever and poorly documented. It’s frustrating, a huge waste of time, and runs the risk of introducing subtle defects into the code today. reply davidjfelix 12 hours agorootparentprevI can&#x27;t stand the ticket number in the message. It&#x27;s an immediate waste of 6-10 characters on meaningless metadata that GitHub can pull from the body and link for you. Further, the numbers are sequential, so frequently VERY similar, and highly prone to typos, which is harmful to anyone even minorly dyslexic. reply Spivak 9 hours agorootparent> that GitHub can pull from the bodyI think that breaks the thing that people want which is being able to `git commit -m \"Fix #234353\"` without a body at all. reply davidjfelix 9 hours agorootparentUse multiple messages.`git commit -m \"Fix actual words that humans read\" -m \"Fixes: #234353\"`You could probably script this based on branch if you&#x27;re one of those people who names branches after ticket numbers.But my actual advice is that I think -m is a bad pattern that leads to bad commit messages, and omitting the message argument opens your EDITOR, and you should use that. replyazornathogron 18 hours agoparentprevI look at past commits probably every week or two to track down why something is the way it currently is.Having said that, I care very little about style and grammar of commit messages. Ideally I want them to say why the change was made, what the intended effect was, and where I can look for related work (bugs that tracked the work and have related commits or investigation attached to them, docs, whatever)Hit rate on the information I&#x27;d like is not great, but if I get at least one of the three things then it&#x27;s something I can work with. reply w0m 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d say I look at commits ~weekly, especially when trying to understand &#x27;WTF did he do that?&#x27; - context of tracing the commits (and offtimes back to individual PR when commit is poorly formatted) is valuable. reply bob1029 18 hours agoparentprevBlame & diffs are much more useful to me in the context of GitHub. I don&#x27;t care about someone&#x27;s subjective ~50 char description of a change. The important part is the pull request itself and that it references whatever issue prompted the change.Commit messages have only ever been useful in tracking my own intermediate work products. Often times, I will leave helpful bread crumbs in my commit notes if I know I won&#x27;t be working on something for a few days. We strictly do squash+merge, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about these things causing trouble for others. All of our commits into master have some standardized \"Issue #1234\" note as automatically copied from the PR title (which we do have ~standardized).If we didnt have some git wrapper like GitHub available, then I suspect we&#x27;d be significantly more aggressive with policy around our commit messages. reply g-b-r 15 hours agorootparentIf your process requires trashing the commit messages it&#x27;s not surprising you don&#x27;t find them useful. reply naavis 18 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know, I do it almost daily.

Yes, the diff should tell you more, but you shouldn&#x27;t need to look at the diff until you have an idea what the contents of that diff are about. It&#x27;s like the links on the hacker news home page -- clicking them will always tell you more, but the index should be geared for the use case, which is scanning, typically. reply sverhagen 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure that suits everyone&#x27;s most common use case. (I&#x27;m not arguing that it may well suit yours.) I guess on paper it makes sense that commit messages are the top-level entry point to changes. But since we&#x27;re packaging up a lot of our work in merge requests, the commit messages already get snowed under. Folks arrive in a merge request, and often can&#x27;t care less about the commit messages that make up the merge request, they may read the message on the merge request, familiarize themselves (ideally) with the story in (ugh) Jira, and then jump to the diff for the review they came there to do. It&#x27;s the later version of you that is browsing through the code base and wants to understand how a certain current piece of code came about, who then clicks on the gutter in, let&#x27;s say, IntelliJ, and clicks through to the commit, where both the diff and the commit message are shown. reply hmeh 6 hours agorootparentIndeed, and since we don’t do pull requests (we pair, mob, and&#x2F;or do live code reviews), the after-the-fact git blame or the git log to see what has changed recently is what tends to matter.I agree that when I did PRs I didn’t tend to care about the commit messages when I was reviewing them, but even when I did do PRs I cared about them later any time I was trying to understand how, why, or who forensically. reply madeofpalk 13 hours agorootparentprevWhat I do find useful is the subject&#x2F;area, and the author. reply rco8786 18 hours agorootparentprevExactly.

Im basically always looking for a change in a specific file or set of files, and then I just pull up the diffs. reply mewpmewp2 18 hours agorootparentprevIt is so odd to me as I don&#x27;t remember a single instance during my 10 years of experience having done that. Only if I was asked by someone else in the org why something is the way it is have I gone to history to see what the ticket number is for the referred change to get an explanation and this is more related to the product.I wonder what is so different about our workflows, that some people do it all the time and others almost never.Are we working on somehow very different things.To me I find that code is the source of truth and current state, it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me as much why or how something came to be as I look more into how I can make the current thing work with what I am to do. reply g-b-r 15 hours agorootparentMaybe you don&#x27;t debug bugs? Work on recent and clean codebases?Or simply the projects you work with have poor commit messages? reply mewpmewp2 14 hours agorootparentI do, and I also work on legacy systems. It just never occurs to me that commit history would somehow help me instead of just looking at the current state of the code.I would say however that the commit messages mostly are just squashed pull requests with ticket names and single sentence so I&#x27;d agree that they wouldn&#x27;t be very good for that purpose, but I don&#x27;t see anyone at the org complaining about this.It&#x27;s mostly on the Internet I read how others use the git history, but I haven&#x27;t seen anyone really doing a lot of that in real life. reply usrusr 9 hours agorootparentFor me it&#x27;s usually blame, look for a line that hasn&#x27;t been touched by some triviality, then from that commit message either to a ticket reference, or, if absent or unavailable, to history shortly before and after. So yes, I do look at old history. In a codebase that has seen a lot of squash rewriting that won&#x27;t be of much help of course. replytsimionescu 18 hours agoparentprevI personally look more often at past commits, but I&#x27;ve still never really had a need to scan a list of changes like this. I really don&#x27;t see the point of the advantage they&#x27;re claiming, even if it&#x27;s real.What I normally do is, while investigating a tricky bug and finding some lines that don&#x27;t make sense, look through history to see why those lines were introduced (to see if they fix something else), and perhaps when (to see which versions may be affected by a hard-to-reproduce bug). But that typically pinpoint a commit already, and I just need the commit message to explain why it was there. reply marginalia_nu 18 hours agoparentprevIt does sort of feel a bit cargo culty sometimes. I expect commit messages are situationally important, as a function of the size and maturity of the project, the size of the development team (esp. the amount of developer churn).That said, there&#x27;s probably some fringe benefit to describing what you do in some fashion.

I agree that there can be plenty of bike shedding about them, which is why we have an approach that is based on human psychology and can be backed up in that way. We don&#x27;t often put too much more in the content of a commit message -- the diff, plus the repo it&#x27;s in (we have many repos) tell you most what what you need to know.If you want more context, every team member has a daily work log that is available to the entire team, so you can see more about what they worked on and why in that work log. reply pseudalopex 9 hours agorootparent> I agree that there can be plenty of bike shedding about them, which is why we have an approach that is based on human psychology and can be backed up in that way.You optimized for a micro benchmark and presented no data. reply hmeh 8 hours agorootparentIt was a design decision, and like most design decisions, it was based on first principles and a-priori knowledge.

I thought it was the same commits rewritten to be more scannable, but they are from a different project.(I scanned, naturally, the article itself!)Or more generally, I thought the point of the article would be that the function &#x2F; variable names from the first list would be moved to the beginning of sentences. But in the 2nd example they are completely absent, favoring much vaguer &#x2F; high level descriptions. So we are unable to see the before&#x2F;after effect for the same list of commits, I think most of the potential impact of the author&#x27;s intended point is lost.(Also, the first half extolls the virtues of being able to read quickly, while the second half tells you to use longer sentences for everything for apparently no reason?) reply hmeh 4 hours agoparentAuthor here. I chose two real sets of commit messages rather than to fabricate one. Fabricating one may have made the second list easier to scan -- you&#x27;d already know what you were looking for and you would have some familiarity with the content. In any case, it&#x27;s certainly not a perfect experiment or demonstration.The specific function&#x2F;variable names do not often make appearances in our commit messages (though they do sometimes, as do class names). They do, however, make very clear appearances in diffs. Commit messages stand on their own for their own purpose -- it&#x27;s an index, and indexes are for scanning. If you need to read further, you zoom in.Also, I wasn&#x27;t trying to say to \"use longer sentences for everything,\" where did you get that from? I offered some specific clarifications on how we write some common commit messages, and they may be longer than some alternatives, but our reasons are for clarity and consistency. We don&#x27;t mind slightly longer commit messages, in large part because the first few words tend to be the most important. reply minimaul 18 hours agoprevI like a style like:codebase section: short summarylonger description if necessaryeg: cocoaui: fix images being incorrectly aligned on high dpi displaysWe were calculating the position of the image in logical pixels, but not converting that to actual display pixels for rendering.I think it&#x27;s a really nice style that makes commit messages really easy to scan in a short log, and lets you ignore commits easily that don&#x27;t touch the area you&#x27;re interested in reply tahnyall 18 hours agoprevI prefer the first version, I didn&#x27;t find the second version to be more \"scannable\" and it seems to me to be more esoteric requiring study to realize what was recorded.

It&#x27;s passive voice and present tense — all the things that we aren&#x27;t supposed to make our commit messages.Nitpick: it&#x27;s passive voice and indicative mood (and sometimes subjunctive) -- there&#x27;s nothing wrong with present tense. \"Fix typo\" is active voice, present tense, and imperative mood. (The Rails commits that dip into past tense bother me slightly, but whatever.)Broadly, I have a few opinions on commit messages. The style doesn&#x27;t really matter as much to me, although I&#x27;m a relatively strong adherent to \"one-line summary, followed by paragraph(s) of additional context\" (as is standard in the Linux kernel, and supposed best practice at Google even if it isn&#x27;t universal by a long shot).One is that the commit message should be useful for anchoring a search for potentially relevant changes, and for providing broader context re: why the change was made.At the same time, I waffle between putting more description in the commit message, versus just commenting the code (or making the code clearer).The last is more pragmatic: when I&#x27;m searching for a specific change, I&#x27;m often looking at the history of a particular file (blame or otherwise). I can quickly filter out all the \"fix typo\" messages or \"[LSC]\" (large-scale change, term used at Google for various company-wide code health refactors). Or if I&#x27;m trying to figure out which change introduced a bug, I&#x27;ll probably bisect it one way or another (I often try to short-circuit that bisection toward the end to save the last few iterations). Either way, I don&#x27;t actually spend that much time reading through commit messages until I&#x27;ve identified a potentially problematic change. reply hmeh 4 hours agoparentAuthor here. Thank you, updated.We don&#x27;t tend to put much in the commit messages themselves. The code often speaks for itself (and if it doesn&#x27;t, it isn&#x27;t likely that the author would have had much more to say about it at the time, as our norm is to comment \"why\" when necessary).

Like other commenters, there are exceptionally few situations when I find myself just reading the commit log, so the claimed psychological advantage appears moot in the context of the common&#x2F;standard software development process (which is very much not what author’s team does, so I acknowledge this approach brings specific measurable advantages for them).When I do need to read the commit log, it’s typically for a third party component and I look for broad categories I need to pay attention to (security fix? Behaviour change?) — this aligns well with the conventional commits standard and well managed release notes.

Contributors are expected to be socially capable and fully engaged in the inter-personal, realtime communication that supports high-performance, low-handoff work.- The ticketing system is NOT the primary means of communication between team members. It&#x27;s merely a catalog of work items with only high-level supporting notes. A work item, as the old saying goes, is a \"placeholder for a conversation\", rather than a work order that can be executed upon by a contributor operating in isolation.- The original author is describing an exceptional software product organization. He&#x27;s not debating the merits of various subjective perspectives on what kind of personal flair might drive the content of commit messages. Instead, he&#x27;s describing one small piece of a methodology that explicitly discourages personal flair and explicitly encourages (and provides supports for) direct communication, and rigorous attention to the team&#x27;s well-considered, proven, and communicated norms.- Contributors on the team are expected to maintain their own work logs in the spirit of engineer&#x27;s logs from engineering industries. If the \"why\" of a change is important, it will be recorded in the work log. Senior technical leaders (at a minimum) keep up with the individual work logs looking for hazards and maintaining an understanding of the learning that&#x27;s taking place in the team.- Contributors on the team are expected to maintain equipment logs for the components that they&#x27;re making changes to. This isn&#x27;t the same thing as a SCM log, as an SCM log is for the SCM, not the product under development.- The reason that the \"subject-first\" approach is used is to get contributors to talk specifically to the impacts made to the software itself, rather than talk about themselves and their labors. It&#x27;s about training developers (and designers, and operators, etc) to be more objective about the work they do, and to communicate it in an objective way. Mentions of \"changed\", \"fixed\", etc, are records from the perspective of the worker, not the product. When scanning the list of changes made to a work product, the team members are primarily interested in the impacts to that piece of equipment first and foremost. The work product change logs are voiced in terms of the work product, and not the worker. Again, the reflections, learning, questions, observations, etc, of the humans involved in the work go into the human&#x27;s own logs, and are supported by the person-to-person processes that are beyond the scope of the article on commit messages.- These 15 people with their 400 repos and 8 live products was winning industry awards within a couple months of go-live within the first year of the team&#x27;s charter. There&#x27;s nothing average about the team, the product, and the methods in-play. The commit messages are just one detail of the finely-honed process and culture that were intentionally designed, socialized, and painstakingly-supported to achieve its objectives.- The author of the article is describing one facet of an overall product development system for a high-performance software organization. He&#x27;s not trying to spark a dialog about the myriad opinions of how commit messages are written across the breadth of software development within processes and cultures that may not go much beyond the cross-referencing of items between ticketing systems with an SCM system, which is arguably a higher-ceremony approach from an artifacts perspective, but also a \"bare minimum\" from a process and culture perspective.It&#x27;s not entirely pertinent, but just in case there&#x27;s some question as to whether this work is being done in a business of some scale or other at some particular time or other in a business&#x27;s lifecycle that accounts for how the development system works, and whether it&#x27;s a special case: the business context of team&#x27;s work is a $1B multi-national with about 2,000 employees working in the regulatory side of corporate law, finance, and venture capital.The business context isn&#x27;t the enabling factor or the deciding factor. The product development system in-effect is the key factor, and it was shaped explicitly for its outcomes irrespective of the business context. The development system has been used at various companies up-and-down the axis of business scale and scope.The single greatest contributing factor of the team and its work is that they carry very little technical debt, and the methodology required to work this way touches every molecule of process, organization, and culture. It would not be recognizable from the perspective of typical mid-curve software development, and it would not be understood by examining any single process element in isolation. reply atoav 19 hours agoprevBottom line first. I like it. reply jes5199 5 hours agoprevcommit messages are a code smell. If you need to commit code, then you’ve already made a mistake reply IshKebab 17 hours agoprevI prefer the first style. It reads way less weirdly. I spend way more time reading commit messages than \"manually searching\" by scanning them. I either arrive at the commit from git blame, or I use this really cool feature of computers called \"ctrl-F\". reply asylteltine 18 hours agoprevThis doesn’t work with conventional commits which is flat out awesome.
