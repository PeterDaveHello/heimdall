I want to hear from you. sgarland 14 hours agoSingle biggest thing you need to nail down fast: the data model. It is extremely hard to shift as things grow, and without careful thought, it’ll turn into a horrifying miasma of JSONB columns, duplicated data, orphaned rows, and garbage performance.Customers are going to store surprisingly large items in Docs, where you’d be tempted to inline them instead of offloading to S3 et al.Chat practically needs to be its own DB. Discord runs on Scylla, Slack runs on Vitess over MySQL. The needs of chat access are wildly different from other types of storage.If you’re doing any kind of active-active, have a plan for how to move off of that, because it does not scale (at least, not without breath-takingly expensive hardware).Source: DBRE at one of your competitors.EDIT: The fact that you’re doing offline saves (which is very cool!) makes me think that you may be using something like Ditto [0], which IIRC is MyRocksDB under the hood. I have no experience with either, but I do know some super sharp folks working at Ditto.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ditto.live reply chefandy 9 hours agoparentSingle biggest technical thing, anyway. IMO, the single biggest thing is focus and clarity in their communication. If people without a working mental model of software development can’t instantly understand the tangible problem it solves in their existing business process, they won’t even scroll past the break, let alone pay for it. Consolidation and modularity are solutions, but people don’t go shopping for solutions without a problem. Have you ever gone out looking for a better commercial version of work-related software you didn’t have any problem with? “App chaos” is way too abstract of a problem for most people to grasp. Do people have trouble sharing google docs over slack? Do companies have trouble with sharepoint and teams not being integrated enough? Does your tool do it better? Does your tool do it approximately as well, but cheaper? More reliably? If so, do people find the existing solutions too pricy or unreliable, or does that not impact them enough to care?Unless they define, upfront, specific problems people really have, that their unified solution solves, then nobody is going to pay attention.The second biggest problem is having an interface design team that makes all of those disparate apps consistent enough to be more usable than individual solutions. The fact that nearly no popular user-facing applications are developer-managed FOSS (as opposed to Firefox&#x2F;blender&#x2F;signal&#x2F;et al which are managed by a company that hires professional designers) despite being free, tells you everything you need to know about dev-driven UI&#x2F;UX. This is coming from someone that worked as a full time developer for years and contributed many thousands of hours of coding to FOSS projects before switching to design. reply sgarland 9 hours agorootparentFair point. I know little to nothing about design, and don’t really care about it. It’s not that I think it’s unimportant, it’s just not something I want to expend any time learning. To be fair, I’m also not trying to create any user-facing products.To me, rsync.net is peak design. It has just enough modernity to appeal to people who might expect that, but it quickly gets out of the way and tells you what it is, why it matters, and how much it costs.At the other end of the spectrum, there’s tarsnap.com, which is probably a turnoff for anyone who doesn’t like text. I love it (as, apparently, do enough other people to keep its author comfortably employed), but I get that it’s an extremely narrow niche. reply chefandy 8 hours agorootparentThere’s less than no shame in not having expertise in something outside of your area of expertise, and realizing that’s the case puts you way ahead of the pack. There’s a reason most designers you work with have relevant degrees, and the ones that don’t that are in high level positions in good organizations might as well have them— it’s just a lot more complex than most developers assume. When they realize that, great! When they’re swinging around giant Dunning-Krueger derived overconfident declarations about something you’re designing… not so great.As a full-time developer for a decade, and in other technical roles for a decade before that, I had a few similar experiences with designers. One repeatedly insisted that Wordpress along with their ramshackle loopdy-looped spaghetti php plugin (still including comments from the tutorials they copied tidbits of code from) was robust enough to enough to replace our very tight Django-based code base that did a hell of a lot more than serve up our website… but they insisted it would take half as long to reimplement it all in php. There wasn’t even a good reason for it– they learned everything they knew about development by osmosis from working on web projects, and a mishmash of articles they read on the topic over the years, and after getting one piece of code to work in a low volume application, thought they were a dual-field specialist. That’s actually pretty rare among designers, but developers that feel that way about design are the norm. We all know what Larry Wall thought the three most important traits were for developers… reply frankdenbow 9 hours agorootparentprevNailed the real important part, the product marketing reply chefandy 8 hours agorootparentIt can sting to realize your grand, genuinely useful technical idea won’t sell itself, but it just won’t. reply winrid 14 hours agoparentprevHe&#x27;s most likely using SQLite per account, because that&#x27;s the easiest way to have an offline DB and sync it, which will most likely scale perfectly fine with appropriate indexes as long as you are careful about the feature set. reply sgarland 14 hours agorootparentThat introduces a new problem when it syncs to others in the same workspace, if it’s large. reply valty 9 hours agoparentprevThe problem with modern development is having to nail down the data model first.I wish we would develop software where the data model could easily change.To do this every data dependency in the system needs to traceable. Nothing does this so far. And everyone just picks a database off the shelf but none are even remotely useful for this. reply sgarland 8 hours agorootparentAdmittedly, yes. This is the massive appeal of Mongo et al., or just JSON[B] columns in an RDBMS.Unfortunately, at a very deep level, that’s simply not how RDBMS works. The tuples are a B+tree, and in some (MySQL [InnoDB], SQL Server) cases everything is clustered around the PK. If you don’t create a data model that’s easily exploitable for optimizations designed around that data structure, you’re gonna have a bad time. It’s no different than if you decided to use strings to store ints – you _can_, but it’s a bad idea for a variety of reasons.What you can do is give yourself as much leeway as possible, by following some basic best practices. For example, it’s a hell of a lot easier to update a tiny reference table than to update billions of rows when you decide that column `region` should say `European Union` instead of `EU`. reply dataflow 4 hours agoparentprevIf you know people at Ditto, let them know their website looks completely obnoxious if fonts are not loaded. It looks something like this:> Sync aPPS WItH OR WItHOUt tHE InTeRneT reply daniel_iversen 11 hours agoparentprevNotion might have written something about their journey in this regard? reply sgarland 10 hours agorootparentThey have [0] [1], yes, but they also mention [2] learning that skipping building indices during a DB copy (doing so instead after the new instance is built) is much faster, which is pretty basic RDBMS knowledge. It’s great to be learning, and even better to be sharing that knowledge, but it gives me pause about accepting much of what they’ve written as expertise.IME, many SaaS companies have eschewed the idea of having any DB experts, and this inevitably leads to pain down the road.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;blog&#x2F;data-model-behind-notion[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sharding-postgres-at-notion[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-great-re-shard reply japanman185 13 hours agoparentprevNo one cares about that. Export to open document format or microsoft. You are living in a bubble of “hackers”. You are not your average user.Case in point of “engineers are not product people” reply zeroq 10 hours agorootparentHe&#x27;s actually dead on point.Back in the day, here is Sokovia, there was a local competetitor to Facebook. They had a great start and everything went perfect for them, but it quickly turned out that the technical side was really bad. Sluggish interface, constant outages, etc.They tried to rewrite the app from scratch two times, and eventually failed.So yes, making sure you&#x27;re moving in the right direction at the beginning of your journey is pretty important. You don&#x27;t have to overengineer and stay in your shed until you have a complete, feature complete product, but at least make sure, that you&#x27;re building on the right foundation. reply satvikpendem 10 hours agorootparentThis is actually the same reason Friendster failed in the face of Facebook, pun intended. Friendster simply could not keep up technically and had to shut down. Later, Facebook actually had a more solid technical footing and could scale quickly.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gimletmedia.com&#x2F;shows&#x2F;startup&#x2F;n8hognhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;gimletmedia.com&#x2F;shows&#x2F;startup&#x2F;8whow5 reply lupire 9 hours agorootparentFacebook didn&#x27;t kill Friendster. Friendster getting popular killed Friendster&#x27;s weak stack, and then everyone moved to Facebook. reply satvikpendem 9 hours agorootparentYes, that&#x27;s what I meant, my apologies if I conveyed that incorrectly. Friendster&#x27;s own scale was untenable for them but Facebook was able to handle their own scale much better. reply sgarland 9 hours agorootparentprevBy all means, don’t spend forever agonizing over the perfect schema and never ship. It really does not matter at small scale anyway, DBs are absurdly fast.Just understand and accept that you are taking on heavy technical debt that will need to be repaid, and that it’s much more difficult to do once you’ve already vertically scaled several times along the way. reply danielmarkbruce 12 hours agorootparentprevIf your selling point is consolidating apps, you absolutely have to get the data model right, else you don&#x27;t solve the problem. Just because you don&#x27;t go in and sell it that way, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not important as hell. The very reason it&#x27;s hard to get apps to interoperate is that each one has it&#x27;s own data model. If they used one giant data model... it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. reply sgarland 13 hours agorootparentprevProduct sell lies to customers that engineering struggles to produce, because reality is a harsh mistress. reply gegtik 13 hours agorootparentif you can dream it, you can type it into a chatgpt text prompt! reply underwater 9 hours agorootparentprevDifferent apps have different technical problems that can be an enabler or a source of never-ending technical debt. Being able to add new features easily, rather than being stuck scaling, could make or break this product. reply Closi 18 hours agoprevSuper impressive app by the look of things, but as you asked for feedback, it is (to me) very confusing on the product side of things (i.e. what is it and why does it matter to me).As a business user it&#x27;s not clear how I would use it, and why I would care.Your front page reads as:> Nino is a collection of apps that can interoperate with each other on the block-level from one uniform interface. It has interoperable pages and blocks. It is flexible, extensible, and adapting to your needs as you grow, as Nino helps you consolidate tools and reduce costs. It has page sourcing so you can view pages in a different way. It has page embed, so you can sync page to another page. It has sync block to another page, but you can also block mirror and sync block on the same page.A good comparison against your front page would be against monday.com or Asana who start with use-cases and practical application. See Monday:> Monday - A platform built for a new way of working. What would you like to manage?> * Work Management - Run all aspects of work> * Sales CRM - Streamline sales processes> * Dev - Manage product lifecyclesThen if I click any of those categories, it goes into the exact ways it can help me. reply farley13 18 hours agoparent+1 to this. Focusing on usecases would be great. ex: I wanted to see what features were available for your sheets module.Was willing to spend 5 minutes on a walk. Tried the web app - ios safari is not supported :( downloaded the ios app and registered. Got a totally blank app - no onboarding, no template &#x2F; samples, no obvious way to import from my existing google sheets to see how things scaled. I added a datasource and a few fields (which felt confusing) and my walk was over. reply samstave 18 hours agorootparentnext [5 more] [flagged] supermatt 17 hours agorootparentmore than 50% of mobile users are using ios safari. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;272664&#x2F;market-share-held... reply samstave 17 hours agorootparentnext [3 more] [flagged] JCharante 17 hours agorootparentGoogle chrome is worse.

Mobile safari on iOS is surely something like 20-30% of the market. replymosselman 1 hour agoparentprevI totally agree. Coming across Simon Sinek&#x27;s &#x27;Start with Why&#x27; has helped me a great deal in communicating in general. Even in conversations this applies:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuAI also suggest reading his book.In terms of this theory you should communicate like this: Why, How, WhatYou are starting from your &#x27;What&#x27;.I haven&#x27;t really grasped the core of your product, but to restructure it could be something like:Stop wasting time looking up documents, e-mails and chats in different systems. Stop paying for 20 different single purpose services just to run your business.By having everything in one place it is easier to find and share information throughout you business. Creating custom combinations of docs, chats, sheets, forms, etc will allow you to create the tool to support your own processes and ways of thinking rather than having to learn some app&#x27;s way of thinking.Nino allows you to quickly build your own custom flows using modular building blocks. Create the tools that you need and have all of your information in one place. reply nine_k 17 hours agoparentprev> interoperate with each other on the block-level from one uniform interfaceSounds quite a bit like Notion. A comparison would be apt.Also sounds a bit like OLE &#x2F; OpenDoc on desktop, embedding an Excel sheet into a Word doc along with an Access form. If it can do that, it could make quite a demo. reply marwis 14 hours agorootparentMicrosoft was pushing something like that few years ago under the name Fluid Framework: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;tPw5kFkXtt4But seems to have devolved into generic state synchronization library these days. reply wavemode 17 hours agoparentprevYep. This is a product in desperate need of a \"Showcase\" page showing off why it&#x27;s valuable. reply dkarl 14 hours agoparentprev> very confusing on the product side of things (i.e. what is it and why does it matter to me)My initial thought was, this vision looks like what happens when a company realizes that their core product is less valuable than everything adjacent to it and starts growing their product a dozen different directions simultaneously.But maybe there&#x27;s something different about embracing this holistic vision from the start, as opposed to trying to be focused and then getting forced into scope creep. reply aetherspawn 12 hours agoprevA lot of people are saying to specialise your business or die. I think you have a good opportunity here to do what nothing else does quite well, and that is to implement a vertically integrated document management system for use cases such as ISO 9001 etc.Use case 1, document management: This basically just means that you need to implement the capability to “publish” a document version, permanently view that document version (think tag), and auto generate a document “identifier” using the companies naming convention (and allow this to be embedded automatically in the document so the client can use it too). The document ID might look something like SOP-2401001.Once a document is published it should be read-only, and you should be able to put artifacts a long with published documents … ie exported PDF copies, or signed copies or something.Use case 2, document siloing: One of the most difficult parts of document management is creating forms for procedures, and then teaching everyone how to not ruin the document management of these forms once they are filled. I have always wanted a silo that automatically copies a form when you start to fill it out, allocates it a brand new document ID, and collects it together with all the other forms of the same kind.This could be integrated with an automation platform so that ie if you fill out a form it sends someone an email or something like that. Or if you wanted to get really fancy, you could allow people to define “workflows” for documents and actually visually show a business process alongside a document. reply squeezebees 11 hours agoparentThis is indeed a clear market gap. Ideally it has the workflow features but they can also be swapped out. Enterprise market though as opposed to wherever this was aimed. reply yoz 14 hours agoprevInitial impression after a few minutes of use: there may be a huge amount of power here, but the app and site seem to be completely lacking guidance and I&#x27;ve no idea what to do or how to learn.I&#x27;ve installed it on my Mac and am trying to add a set of records representing contacts with a couple of basic fields: name, phone, birthdate. I want to query those records elsewhere in other modules.The app is giving no guidance on how to do this. On open, it just shows me a blank tab, and I had to try a few different controls to work out how to add a module. I don&#x27;t know which module I should use to add queryable records, so I&#x27;m trying Board.Now that I&#x27;ve added a board, I can add a first record but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to add a second. There are columns named \"None\" and \"Unnamed\"; the one named \"None\" has the first contact in it. Pressing the \"+\" button in the corner adds another column. Eventually, I drag the record from \"None\" to \"Unnamed\"; \"None\" disappears, now there&#x27;s just \"Unnamed\", and I can add other records.I&#x27;ll keep playing with it a little, but there&#x27;s only so far that people can be expected to try to work out the usage model that you&#x27;ve designed this for. Sure, there are loads of modules, but how do they link together? An example setup for a fictional team might really help here. reply harrisonlo 3 hours agoparentNoted on the lack of guidance and onboarding. I can see the confusion you had with the board module and have some ideas on improving it. Thanks for giving it a try. reply not_your_mentat 16 hours agoprevThis looks really neat!I&#x27;d be interested in giving it a try, but doing so would replace existing tools and workflow. As a user, I&#x27;m unwilling to do this is I can&#x27;t both own my data and application hosting.If Nino doesn&#x27;t pan out and the product gets shut down, how do I continue to access my now (trigger warning, words used to describe as I understand, not critique) tightly coupled proprietary data? Can I self host? Is source code available? Are document formats open? How do I not get screwed as an enthusiastic adopter in the unhappy case that things don&#x27;t work out? If I put my data in and the product isn&#x27;t working for me, how do I get my data out? reply bertil 16 hours agoparentOne great solution for that would be the approach many advanced Markdown editors like Obsidian have: the documents remain usable. You might lose some benefits (the integration between documents in a graph-like structure) that are specific to the tool. Still, your work is preserved in a universal format that anyone can leverage.Most elements of Nano have widely accepted standards, presumably easy to integrate, so that guarantee should be doable. reply eviks 6 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a universal format since a lot of data is for only for Obsidian plugins that can work work it, and it isn&#x27;t universally extensible, so not suitable for proper tools this aims to be reply harrisonlo 16 hours agoparentprevThanks. I think the concern about software provider shutting down is valid. Heck, I still remember being pissed when Google deprecated two products I used within a month (a few months back).Self-hosting might be too complex to setup, but do you think single tenant offering helps? I don&#x27;t know if it makes sense for individuals tho.In addition to HTML & CSV, there is an option to export JSON, which supports more formats. In a way, it is an open format (.json) but I&#x27;ll have to add relevant documentation. PDF support will also come at one point. reply buildbuildbuild 16 hours agorootparentSelf-hosting is key for us as well. Companies working with sensitive data really value \"on-device\" &#x2F; \"on-premises\" architecture, which it looks like you&#x27;re close to nailing.Check out Bitwarden and Gitlab&#x27;s self-hosting approaches, and congrats on the launch. I&#x27;m excited to try it.And regarding self-hosting complexity, start with a \"docker-compose up\" example and iterate from there. reply localhost 18 hours agoprevFor sure this is a super-impressive (solo?) effort and I&#x27;m certain a ton of work went into this.Some feedback:Who is the customer for this? Can you describe what their day looks like and how Nino helps them get their work done better&#x2F;faster&#x2F;cheaper? What are the top 5 problems that they face that Nino is clearly better than the competition? Be specific and show the workflows.Where do they work? Who do they collaborate with? What are they collaborating on? Do the same exercise - SxS comparison with how they do things in existing tools and show how Nino is clearly better than their existing solution.Finally, don&#x27;t ever underestimate how difficult it is to get people to change from whatever they are doing today. Today is not 1990 - people have been using solutions to the general information worker problem for decades now. Why will they switch? reply 2143 5 hours agoprevThis seems technically impressive, and I wish you good luck.I personally prefer apps that do one thing well. I don&#x27;t like \"super\" apps that does everything. I like separate tools, and not a Swiss army knife.This is kind of why I detest apps like WeChat; even before taking into account the privacy considerations, from a user perspective it does chat, social media, payments etc, and I dislike it for that reason. WhatsApp too seems to be headed in that direction (atleast where I&#x27;m from).And I also prefer tools that allow seamless data exchange with other tools. Sort of like the Unix philosophy.> This means we won&#x27;t do integrations with other services, unless they are under the hoodNot sure how I feel about that.> your team can eventually conduct all work on NinoGreat! Another walled garden.I hope this doesn&#x27;t happen, but what if you go bust? Will the user lose all their data? Or what if, for whatever reason a team decides to move off your platform? Is there data export capabilities? You better have export capabilities if you want commercial entities to even consider your product.Also, I feel the Free tier has slightly more features than your Pro tier (the former has unlimited members, for example).Nevertheless, I wish you good luck. reply ramijames 17 hours agoprevI&#x27;m not really sure that I see an \"app chaos problem\". For each company&#x2F;job workflow that I&#x27;ve encountered, there are a set of apps that solve for the specific use-case.For example as the head of devrel at the last company that I worked for, we used Atlassian products for internal documentation and work tracking, we used Google&#x27;s docs and sheets for collaborative writing with external teams, and we used github and markdown for external docs building. It&#x27;s all text, but the work flows were different, had different needs (like permissions), and ultimately we found the right tools for the job.I wish you luck with this endeavor, but I hope that your looking for a specific problem. To solve that isn&#x27;t \"app chaos\". reply d3w4s9 14 hours agoparentExactly, my company have a similar setup and I don&#x27;t think people have trouble figuring out which tool to use or how they work with each other. Nino seems to try to solve a problem that hardly exist. reply gwbas1c 13 hours agoprevI built something similar many years back. Mine was web based: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GWBasic&#x2F;ObjectCloudWhat I would tell my younger self is to spend more time reading through YC&#x27;s resources about how to start a business. In my case, I built something that I thought there was a need for; but I should have spent a lot more time iterating off of tangible customer needs.IE, I should have found a handful of customers who needed tight integration among these use cases and let their needs drive the implementation.Why? There are already plenty of applications that do the same functions. (MS Office, Google Drive, ect, ect.) These applications are mature, and well-understood by the whole market.I would suggest finding a few customers who are hampered by poor interoperability among 3+ applications &#x2F; use cases, and focus on their use cases. It&#x27;ll take you 15+ years to be as mature as products like MS Office, Google Drive, ect; but if you solve a niche&#x27;s tangible, need, they won&#x27;t care, because they can&#x27;t operate their business without you. reply airstrike 18 hours agoprevThis is really cool -- congrats on the launch! The productivity worker&#x27;s \"app chaos problem\" as you called it is a real problem and a solvable one.I&#x27;m building something similar after spending 10+ years working with those numerous different apps day in and day out in quote-unquote \"high stakes\" white-collar roles. It&#x27;s early days and I&#x27;m approaching it from a slightly different angle, but there&#x27;s a certain amount of overlap between the two visions. I&#x27;m focusing on a smaller set of apps but more fleshed out set of features, aiming for feature parity with incumbents + my own features (which incidentally is why this is taking a while to build well...)Curious to see how Nino progresses and we should connect later on when I have something tangible to show, if you&#x27;re up for it reply harrisonlo 4 hours agoparentWe should! Just sent an email to the address on your profile reply chime 17 hours agoprevGreat job on the launch.

Does that mean you offer email hosting like Outlook&#x2F;Gmail or email support?For anyone not in the 365 corporate world looking for office apps, you&#x27;re unfortunately competing with https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workspace.google.com&#x2F;pricing, regardless of the unique feature set you offer.For anyone looking for a no-code solution, your pricing is very low for one person startup when compared to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.softr.io&#x2F;pricing but would get pricey for a team of 5-10.I am someone you should target because I help startups get started, with low&#x2F;no code solutions. I also use many paid solutions personally like Cozi.com, Zoom, and ProtonMail for managing my life. I can see your tech is great and what you need is to figure out your place in the market. Where are you positioned in comparison to Zoho, HubSpot, and Zapier? How can I integrate you with Shopify? Also, you need a LOT of templates for https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.nino.app&#x2F;en&#x2F;siteI applaud you for building what you&#x27;ve already built in such a competitive and demanding market.

With a passion. I really hope we start to move away from them, I would much rather use 18 different apps and uninstall the ones I don’t need than dig through the noise of the superapp, which inevitably becomes cluttered, hard to navigate and impossible to customise. I understand why big companies do it, since it gets foot in the door and makes it easier for the user to try other services even if they intended to only use one, but as a user I despise the experience 100% of the time. reply redcobra762 18 hours agoprevSecurity & privacy are tough selling points; fewer people care about either than you may think, and the existing platforms provide a lot more than most who do care are willing to admit.Also the “too many tools” pitch sounds like an unhinged rant. There’s almost certainly a better way to phrase that, because otherwise the idea that the mere existence of a wide variety of tools bothers you doesn’t stand up to the “so don’t use them all” rebuttal. Maybe focus in the convenience factor, and the integration within your platform instead, as that is a genuine value-add.Good luck! reply harrisonlo 17 hours agoparentOn your first point: I think the trend is more will start to care. I agree many platforms provide a lot of security features, but few allow you to encrypt with custom keys though.On your second point: That&#x27;s a good point, bad phrasing on my part. Thanks for the feedback. reply swells34 15 hours agorootparentSomething to keep in mind about all this (and something that my wife reminds me of when I get annoyed trying to write product descriptions) is that the description and the product are separate. In that, if I struggle to write a description that is attractive to everyone, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that the unattracted ones won&#x27;t like the product. And some that are attracted to the description will dislike the product.This is just part of the difficulty of marketing; you can&#x27;t please everyone. You have to figure out what problems the bulk of your possible user market are trying to solve that your app solves, and present that plainly and concisely. Flowery language tends to obfuscate; just plain simple \"If you have problems XYZ, this will solve those\", then link to greater detail about how each of X, Y, and Z, are solved.It&#x27;s hard to do this because we are so used to seeing mid level manager bullshit PR speak on every product page we look at; it seems like a requirement. I&#x27;ve had very refreshing experiences with product descriptions written by a technical writer who just did not give a fuck. Just wrote it up like he was sending an email about a bug report, published it, and it was fantastic. reply novok 11 hours agoprevI would take your current marketing front page and make it the page for developers. Then I would work with a B2B SaaS marketer on what you actually need for the people who make the purchasing decisions. You made a great construction kit, now you need to demonstrate with actual app demos what you can make in an amazing way that your competitors cannot.Developers love making libraries and construction kits as a product, but almost nobody buys construction kits unless the target market is constructors (like dev tools). You need to turn this into an actual product normal people would use. I think your pretty close to that although, you just need a few extra steps for that.What your targeting is a next step evolution in the target market that microsoft office is targeting. You need to demonstrate with demo videos (not workflow diagrams) so this reality is more apparent with what you&#x27;ve made. Go talk to users, understand what their needs are and then create a message and glue features that would make that happen.Notion kind of languished for years in their &#x27;productivity dudes&#x27; niche and then exploded relatively recently. Figure out how they made that transition. Looking at what you made, it effectively looks like a better notion.I would also look into what makes people transition off notion to a more specialized tool. Like you can do task management, standup tracking, etc with notion, but it doesn&#x27;t scale after a while and people go on to things like linear and teamplify. What can make people scale with your tool? That will probably be a thing to think about at a later stage with your company product although. reply harrisonlo 2 minutes agoparentThanks for the advice. Appreciate it. reply quickthrower2 11 hours agoprevIt looks good. The problem for me, to use it is that Google Sheets and Docs are way more fully featured, even if they aren&#x27;t integrated as neatly as you have done. You will need to find the people for who having calendars, docs and sheets in one place matters a lot. Maybe it is the kind of people who already use notion and obsidian etc.There are some UX things I think should be looked at:1. New sheet asks me &#x27;Create source&#x27; or &#x27;select source&#x27;. One is black and the other blue. I assume they are both links? Looks like I need to click \"Create source\" to do the thing I would intuitively expect, which is to show me a blank spreadsheet to edit.2. First column of a new spreadsheet is called \"Name\" and I cannot rename it, it only has sort options, but if I add another column it is called \"unnamed\" and I can rename it. I am not sure why this is. Since all I have been told at this point is that it is a \"sheet\" I am expecting a free homogenous experience like Excel. If it is not that, you might think about how to make it more obvious what it is. (Do I need training, a quick tutorial, a quick highlight-feature&#x2F;click-next intro etc.?) reply harrisonlo 2 hours agoparentThanks for the feedback. You would click the select source option if you want to use data from another page. Good catch on the name field not being rename-able, that feature will be added soon. reply csmpltn 17 hours agoprevOne of the most important features to get right for tools like this is collaborative editing. It&#x27;s incredibly difficult to get this right (live preview, conflict resolution, history management, etc), especially given how the vast majority of users are non-technical folks (which aren&#x27;t used to toolks like git). Could you expand a bit on how you intend to tackle this problem in Nino? reply klabb3 16 hours agoparentI actually think this hyper-granular realtime collaboration like in Google docs is slightly overrated.I think it’s ok to have more a git-like workflow where feedback and changes happen over cycles. As a programmer, I don’t give a shit about your working directory. I do care, however, about your commits :)All I’m saying is this CRDT craze isn’t always necessary or even appropriate for many products. It adds a lot of technical complexity, especially for a small shop. reply pilgrim0 14 hours agorootparentI agree. I haven’t yet interviewed a user that views realtime collaboration as something desirable in itself. In my research, user mostly are forced to do this kind of collab because it’s still better than coordinating via side channels such as email or phone. It has lower friction but at a very high usability cost. In contrast it makes people undervalue the importance of a structured plan of execution for projects with a significant number of collaborators. There are practically no polished, in-between, git-like experience in mainstream tools. The outcome of real-time for users is always remembered as messy and frustrating. I don’t even agree with the premise of shared control as being an effective basis for creative or productive process at large, it is useful for brainstorming and exploration in some specific cases, or highly specialized and niche settings like pair programming. IMHO this is super valued by developers and marketers because it’s challenging, cool and it makes for a good pitch. Not rare to see people who conflate digital collaboration with shared control, thinking they’re synonymous – such is the influence of these modern workflows. We can never know how good other collaboration strategies can be if alternative experiences are under-developed and people default to shared control. reply jitl 11 hours agorootparentprevRealtime collab apps tend to kill their competitors without realtime collab. See Figma: slightly worse UX and performance compared to Sketch, easily killed Sketch. How did Notion penetrate the competitive docs&#x2F;wiki market? Much more collaborative than the incumbent Confluence (now confluence is iterating on realtime collab to remain relevant).Realtime is becoming table stakes in any online collab system. I think code is the exception, not the rule, because it’s 100x more brittle than prose or pixels that need to convey approximate meaning to humans.You can implement realtime without using CRDT&#x2F;OT, Notion is paragraph-by-paragraph last write wins, no fancy algo, but mostly good enough to remain competitive. reply raffraffraff 2 hours agorootparentWe used jira for live incident handling back in 2015 at a young company. It was horrendous. Multiple people would add roughly the same update at the same time. It wasn&#x27;t until they refreshed jira that they&#x27;d see the duplicates. This led people to constantly refresh jira both before and after adding a comment. I still remember two people adding the same comment, refreshing together and both deleting their own comments after refreshing and seeing the duplicate. (Found this out after the incident during one of those \"what could have gone better?\" conversations). We switched very quickly to using Google Docs for documenting the live incident and simply attached that doc to the jira ticket at the end. It sucked badly and made a lot of people hate jira.As soon as Slack became a thing at our company we immediately switched to using it for realtime incident updates, because Google Docs was unsuitable for a bunch of other reasons. And we wrote some automation around creating a jira ticket, creating a slack channel using the ticket name, and updating the jira ticket with a link to the ongoing incident). At the end of an incident when the jira ticket got moved to \"resolved\" the slack channel would get archived. Extremely simple and effective. reply klabb3 8 hours agorootparentprevYou are absolutely right. I am in the minority, no doubt. My POV is that standard corporate realtime collaboration is generally a waste of time, personally. Or at the very least, the results always reek of design-by-committee - inconsistencies and compromises. This is independent of tech, and I would say the same about the 2000s white boarding and mindmapping. Sometimes, there are cases where it works, like an 1:1 session with someone you can really vibe with. But even in those cases, it’s usually better with single-control (ie only one person editing at a time).I’m perfectly fine talking about work on a high level, but when it gets too gritty it’s usually better to sit down in quiet and solve the problem or improve the design on your own. (Needless to say, I did not exactly thrive in a corporate environment.)So to me realtime collab can be very neat, but it’s not a common enough use-case to be a dealbreaker. That said, there’s tremendous value in being able to easily view, comment, duplicate, copy the latest version that others publish, in read-only mode. Perhaps the success of Figma etc is partly also because of that? reply crazygringo 14 hours agorootparentprev> I actually think this hyper-granular realtime collaboration like in Google docs is slightly overrated.I have to disagree. It&#x27;s absolutely necessary for a lot of workflows, especially when people are collaborating on a doc in real time during a meeting (super super common), or when you&#x27;ve got 10 reviewers of a doc all leaving their feedback in comments, and comments responding to comments, over the course of the same hour.The model of clean commits works well for code. It doesn&#x27;t work well at all for business team documents that are in-progress. reply klabb3 13 hours agorootparentHeh I’m glad that there’s disagreement. I think I was even surprised myself coming to this conclusion.> It&#x27;s absolutely necessary for a lot of workflows, especially when people are collaborating on a doc in real time during a meetingWell yeah you included the solution in the problem description. I’m not convinced of either the shared control, the talking-typing multitasking or even that the artifact should be a document. Assuming the meeting shouldn’t have been an email in the first place.> when you&#x27;ve got 10 reviewers of a doc all leaving their feedback in comments over the course of the same hourThis one is easier for me to argue concretely. Shared control with 10 people is awful imo. Suggestions with click to accept can make it better (but then you have a notification problem). But what I really dislike is this perpetual state of work in progress. I think a cyclic workflow is better, with drafts and publish and much less back and forth.In summary, I’d say that the promise of async work (which is good) ended up being sync instead - for the purposes of the human brain. I don’t want to context switch because Bryan fixed a spelling mistake, or see Janice typing out another bullet point right under mine. reply q7xvh97o2pDhNrh 16 hours agorootparentprev> I actually think this hyper-granular realtime collaboration like in Google docs is slightly overrated.Disagree, with the caveat that I understand how it can feel overrated if you&#x27;re not using the new ways of remote collaboration that it enables.The fully-live remote-collaboration UX in tools like Google Docs [1] and Figma is magical because you can get on a video call with people [2] and co-create, in the moment, without having to fumble with all the nonsense of figuring out who&#x27;s \"driving\" and who&#x27;s \"navigating.\"Since you&#x27;re all looking at and editing the same doc, everyone can arrange their windows to have a line of faces along the side and the doc in the center. It&#x27;s actually better than in-person collaboration. There&#x27;s no haggling over who&#x27;s got the whiteboard marker, no one sneezing on everyone else, no crowding around to make sure everyone can see the board...All the extra nonsense drops away, and you get to be just a group of people making something together.[1]: Notably, Google Sheets uses a much more ham-handed idea of \"realtime.\" A cell appears \"locked\" while someone else is editing it, and you don&#x27;t see their work until they hit Enter. So you end up having to sit there like a buffoon while they type, their work invisible to you, and that friction destroys the magic of live collaboration.[2]: If you don&#x27;t do much remote work&#x2F;collaboration with others around the world, then none of this matters — and it&#x27;s easy to miss the world of possibilities that this feature unlocks. reply bertil 16 hours agorootparentprevHas Nino integrated Git into their tools? Editing lines of code over a GitHub diff window makes sense, but I’m not sure how that would work in, say, a spreadsheet: I don’t know if adding a line =21%*G17 below G17 is a good idea; I’d much rather have the changes in the context of a sheet and understand that it’s computing the VAT on top of the total cost. reply d3w4s9 14 hours agoprevThis is not the first product of the kind and won&#x27;t be the last one. And they look great in theory but get complicated and very confusing and ultimately never find their place. People don&#x27;t need an integrated tool that does everything. People need a few very good tools that work well with each other. Confluence&#x2F;Jira is such an example, and to some extent Google&#x27;s suite and Microsoft&#x27;s, plus a few more. Unless you can do it better than them in each category -- doc, spreadsheet and project management etc -- people won&#x27;t choose your product over those.

In related examples, I will pick ClickUp from your list. It is the closest to this one in terms of trying to combine a database, (multi)composition, and communication (Notion is more specialized than that.)I would say that in this arena, the 2010s started with Quip and ended with ClickUp. Quip was sold at $750 million, but Salesforce never let it bloom. ClickUp is now worth 4 billion dollars.Just one critical thought: Consolidation must transcend mere visual modularity and deliver deeper usefull integration to compensate for the absence of features of dedicated tools. reply JakeAl 12 hours agoparentprevThis. Salesforce, is a great example of this. I can&#x27;t tell you the number of companies that exist just building a simple application that does the one thing customers bought these bloated app suites to do that they liked and became burdened with the developers ecosystem or constant enhancements they make just to justify their dev teams existence. Adobe and Microsoft are also notorious for this, as well as just about every cloud company. reply berkes 14 hours agoparentprevIndeed. The issue I&#x27;ve repeatedly seen, is that ten different people, have ten different combinations and alternatives of what are \"very good tools\".And even then, these people aren&#x27;t fixed in time. Maybe today I need a killer personal time tracker, tomorrow I might need an advanced scrum board and in two years I need a way to aggregate time tracking of a whole team. And that&#x27;s just one tiny tool. reply hoistbypetard 13 hours agoparentprevIt surely isn&#x27;t. Before everything had to be online, you had Microsoft Works, AppleWorks, BeagleWorks, Symantec Works, Lotus Works, Claris Works, a Wordperfect product and a Corel product, and probably a solid half dozen other suites that tried to be everyghing for all knowledge workers.The integration story didn&#x27;t work that well back then, and that was when any one of those \"integrated suites\" cost the same up front as any single office tool, so the cost savings was more significant.I still like the idea, but it seems harder to make it work well now than it was in the 90s. reply feel-ix-343 13 hours agoparentprevPersonally, I use neovim and markdown for everything. reply wanderingmind 6 hours agoprevI strongly recommend creating a demo video of its capability.

The browser based technologies can gain an upper hand here because of the platform independence and reusability of technologies across functionalities.That said, there is an enormous amount of work required to match the functionalities of legacy programs: interoperability itself is probably not enough to compete with these. I believe the most viable route is some sort of open source solution. The amount of VC financing would likely need to be staggering for a solution like this to gain any major traction.(That is, unless an LLM can be made to produce the whole thing over a weekend at some point in the near future ...) reply macspoofing 18 hours agoparent>I believe putting interoperability first is the right idea, and we have barely begun to scratch the surface of opportunities in this area.Is it really &#x27;interoperability&#x27; if it cannot integrate with any external applications? reply stareatgoats 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sure programs like this can achieve the same interoperability with external programs as other applications that already do this. That&#x27;s a fairly primitive level of integration though, compared to the possibilities that would seem to open once you control both sides of the API. reply growingkittens 17 hours agoprevI think this has a lot of potential for non-technical knowledge users.At Google and Microsoft, files are available throughout the ecosystem. If I understand correctly, Nino makes the data within files available throughout the ecosystem. This is a fundamentally different workflow.Google and Microsoft seem to have disparate teams working on their ecosystem. Their products work in a system, but not as a system. There&#x27;s little to no integration past surface level connections. reply xyst 18 hours agoprevThe problem here is that people are not trained on YOUR implementation.Everything you have listed here is very nice to have (offline mode, interoperability, …) , but MS (with O365) or G (with G Suite) are often available for free to students, teachers, and professors at critical stages in life.Just look at Apple with their productivity suite (Pages, Numbers, Keynote). The market penetration is probably worse than LibreOffice.The academic setting often carries over to the professional setting.

Note that every paragraph is a block, so it&#x27;s not like the entire page is overwritten. CRDT is still doable though.There are real-time text cursors and block selections, but I intentionally did not implement Figma-style floating cursors that people may expect in certain modules.

Data sovereignty is also top of my mind, but I think we should approach it not with the physical location of the servers&#x2F;databases, but with the ability to encrypt, thus own, your data.Currently it uses GCP with data centers in the US, but when E2EE is rolled out, I don&#x27;t think it would matter where it&#x27;s located? There might be legal complications so I&#x27;m also thinking of moving the physical databases to jurisdictions like Switzerland, if it comes to that.Given the complexity of the backend, I think a self-hosted version might not be possible in the short term. However, single tenant versions (like GitLab dedicated) is definitely doable. reply Vermyndax 18 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, it always matters.

It has the simplicity of falling back to plaintext, but whenever we want to structure data better gives us tables, charts, publishable forms, sites, etc.It&#x27;s exciting to have more tools in this space, as I think it addresses a major use case across workplaces in today&#x27;s world of remote-centric work: Asynchronous knowledge transfer and documentation, especially amongst non-technical workers and organizations. Extremely poor documentation of process and practices, largely because of poor documentation tools (just word docs and the like) is the biggest knowledge-hole I have observed within non-tech workplaces.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coda.io reply nawfalak 5 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been messing with this for a bit and as a single person, I find this a lot more intuitive than something as complex as Notion and something made for a large business like monday.com and Asana. Only issue I have is Flutter. As much as I love it being cross platform everywhere, on the iPad app, I have a lot of touch sensitivity issues.

Or is this just a glorified note taking & publishing app?Either way I am getting strong https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zombo.com&#x2F; vibes from the description here and your landing page.Instead of a clear problem statement and user use cases, you have this word salad of “consolidation” (of what?), “superapp” (that does what?), “unmatched privacy” (to do privately what?) and “offline mode” (I still have no idea what I can do with the app, but apparently I can do this something offline?).That said, I am double surprised with all the praise comments here on HN. Can someone explain in one sentence what this app is supposed to do? reply tourmalinetaco 15 hours agoparentThe same thing as Microsoft or Google suites, which is to minimize workflow and maximize productivity by allowing apps to be interconnected.I will say however that I agree, the page doesn’t sell me on much. The apps&#x2F;“modules” themselves are not well displayed and I am not convinced even by its unique points such as its (eventual?) encryption, namely due to how opaque it all is.I wish it was more transparent, between its file formats, its encryption standards and implementation, and how it actually works. reply smugglerFlynn 14 hours agorootparentDo you have a practical example of such interconnectedness (or lack thereof?) reply Solvency 15 hours agoparentprev\"Privately consolidate your multi-app documents offline.\"Like a desktop folder! reply silentsanctuary 9 hours agoprevReally liking it so far!An offline-first platform that lets you store your information in a central way and provides multiple forms of use and access is exactly what I&#x27;ve been trying to find, without much success until now.I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve understood how to fully realise the promises of it though. I created a board, and added some records to it, alongside fields for additional data.It&#x27;s not obvious to me how to use the calendar module using that board as a source. I don&#x27;t have a way to see the existing records. I can create new records inside the calendar view, but when I look at that new record using the board, or using a sheet, the \"Time\" field disappears. The \"Time\" field appears only to be visible when looking at the records via that calendar.Similarly, the to-do lists don&#x27;t seem to map the \"checked\" nature of the boxes to any field on the record.I would also like to be able to link to the record or embed its content in another page somewhere, but don&#x27;t seem to see how.It would be nice to be able to immediately link to (or embed) blocks&#x2F;records by using `[[` or `@` instead of just documents. In particular, it would be nice for the quick search to yield blocks&#x2F;records as you type, and not have to fall back to the advanced search.Also, as an offline-first application, I would like to be confident the app is always fully synced - but after creating a few documents on my computer, then opening the first of them on my phone, I tried putting my phone into airplane mode, and once I&#x27;d done that I could open the other documents I&#x27;d opened before (great!) but when trying to open one of the others I&#x27;d created (that the app clearly knew about whilst it was online), it said \"You&#x27;re not connected to the internet\".But well done on a really awesome implementation of an awesome idea so far! I think it&#x27;s very cool, and has a lot of potential. reply harrisonlo 5 hours agoparentYou raised an issue that I plan to fix soon. Currently certain fields (i.e. time range) only show on specific modules (i.e. calendar) but I&#x27;m planning to allow them everywhere.Could you share your use case on embedding a single record? I disabled that for now because I imagined people would usually embed all records together in a certain view.Hm I&#x27;ll think about searching for blocks in autocomplete, or perhaps some way to use advanced search inline.Your experience in offline mode was actually expected. I assume you never opened the other pages on your phone, so they weren&#x27;t saved on your device. Nino&#x27;s not syncing all pages all the time, but only the ones you open, for performance reasons.

If this can scale, I think you have a very valuable foundation.Did you build Nino Meets using AWS Chime? I&#x27;m curious.Now for the feedback:Because the use cases are so broad and all-encompassing, marketing and onboarding into your system will be a huge challenge. Do not underestimate it. At my startup, we hired onboarding specialists since most small business owners we were attracting were not exactly engineers. They needed a lot of hand holding to understand how all the parts went together.Take notion as an example, they have a huge community dedicated to showcasing things you can build. Even then, I don&#x27;t really like notion because it is such a blank canvas. It&#x27;s a hard hurdle to overcome!I think a valuable next step would be to partner with people from different industries to create custom templates that are built on top of your more general purpose foundation. Those templates should reliably solve specific work flows that those users would be familiar with, and they should have no trouble getting up and running right away.If you can solve that, you will really have something!Your current website looks like docs for other engineers, so I&#x27;d strongly suggest creating a few more websites, each one branded and showcasing specific workflows for the target audience you are looking to convert. reply harrisonlo 6 hours agoparentNino Meet is built on LiveKit, shout out to them!Thanks for the actionable feedback regarding marketing and onboarding.

Can&#x27;t get past that. reply solidsnack9000 10 hours agoprevThis seems like the logical direction to go. Many of these apps have to be opened up to each other -- they are \"modules\" in a system that each company has to cobble together -- because integration is part of how any work gets done with them. The effect is a sprawling and uncertain security and access story. Hopefully Nino can bring some harmony to all this. The simplicity of the end-to-end story -- from authoring to collaboration to content delivery -- is amazing.One thing I wonder about, though, is the effect on the engines of innovation. Something that works well about the current system -- where chat, spreadsheets, &c, are all disaggregated from each other and we have a big mess of access click-throughs -- is that many different firms can enter the space and bring new energy and ideas to these problems. Say all the apps were consolidated from the get-go -- would we ever have gotten the amazing profusion of capabilities we have now? I imagine a boot stamping on a human face -- forever.Even when the new generation of knowledge worker apps integrate plugins, they don&#x27;t seem to integrate them in a way that is amenable to commercial enterprises.

Without the commercial incentive, how far can that really go? reply D-Se 16 hours agoprevIf I were going to make a hard switch from apps I use (docs, sheets, todo, meet, ...), I would do so from the conviction I don&#x27;t want vendor lock-in, and want to own my data.

Yet, I question the scalability - how long should users wait, for example, for ato be possible in a code block, in a notebook?Since you&#x27;re looking for feedback; - support markdown where possible, and include links like Obsidian, include Unicode completion like Julia REPL. Point and click is nice, but shortcuts&#x2F;common syntax is expected, - support scripting via a modern language, - let users write plugins for modules &#x2F; modules. reply autocole 12 hours agoprevIf you haven&#x27;t seen a team using Feishu&#x2F;LarkSuite, then I&#x27;d make an effort to see how that works.

I am worried as to how much of your life &#x2F; time &#x2F; money you might be pouring into this. It is difficult for me to be categorical about this, as for all I know it&#x27;s a tiny side venture and you&#x27;re not bothered about adoption. But, based on the marketing copy &#x2F; launch, previous HN posts and your comments here, it does seem that you feel this could potentially compete with Workspace&#x2F;Zoho&#x2F;365&#x2F;Notion with the USP that it&#x27;s more tightly integrated, plus some local storage and encryption benefits.I think that&#x27;s quite a stretch. And that&#x27;s not to dismiss or play down what you&#x27;ve achieved.What you have created is, measured on sheer volume of work&#x2F;technical accomplishment (and assuming it&#x27;s a solo project completed in around 1-2 years, when you first began posting about it) really impressive for a solo dev. I say this as somebody who considers themself a fairly speedy full-stack dev. There is a lot of complex functionality - an MVP recreation of Docs, Drive, Airtable (e.g. Sheets, which appears to be an &#x27;Airtable&#x27;-style visual database with support for multiple datatypes) and the UI is, in many parts, clean, fluid and responsive. All this is without even trying&#x2F;testing the additional 4-5 client apps!But in my opinion, the difference between your current product and something that would gain significant adoption is light years. Just some very basic examples: adding keyboard shortcuts to the docs module, drag and drop table re-ordering, image resizing, multiple fonts, page sizing, tabs, a ruler, text flow options and layout. (just the basics here to get it to circa-Word-2000 level) The need for a spreadsheet module. File permission management, upload progress, account onboarding, help and support. The UX of the workspace itself - at the moment it&#x27;s unclear why some modules exist (what is a &#x27;canvas&#x27;? Why would I need it? Same question for a &#x27;grid&#x27;. Don&#x27;t make me work to discover this, tell me upfront. Inline help, or example documents would help steer users).I could write out a ton more examples, but I&#x27;m not trying to beat you over the head, more just to illustrate that the road ahead of you is far longer than you might imagine. If there&#x27;s just one of you developing this, then I&#x27;m not sure how long it would take to just get even one of these modules up to feature parity with a close competitor. This, plus the maintenance, support.. ..and that&#x27;s before we even begin to discuss the issues around marketing and onboarding, which are probably the area where you&#x27;re most significantly falling short. Some of your UI choices bely a certain naivety, for example why would you choose to name a module &#x27;Sheet&#x27;s, when this is already the name of a popular web spreadsheet, and your module appears to be something other than a spreadsheet? This introduces confusion and frustration for users and makes me question your ability to succesfully get this project to profitability. Much of your main website doesn&#x27;t do a great job of explaining to a layperson what the product is, why they&#x27;d want to use it, or giving real-world examples. Even the screenshots on your Play Store app don&#x27;t really provide good reasons to download, or insights into concrete use cases. Why would somebody pay for this in the era of free-Google-Docs or $5 Zoho plans? How much B2C marketing money would you need to spend to market it to them just so they&#x27;re aware of its existence in the first place?I know how difficult this might be to hear, and I don&#x27;t want to demotivate you, in fact quite the opposite. The thing is, I have had several occasions during my career when I was in a similar place to this. I have, in the past, obsessively focussed on product development, with my head in the sand about market potential. It&#x27;s great that you have now asked for feedback and I&#x27;d rather risk annoying you than squander an opportunity to make you sit up and think for a moment, even if you end up choosing to ignore me.I&#x27;m sure that, if you chose to take a different path with this IP&#x2F;product, there would be lots to salvage and some valuable learnings to build upon based upon all the code you&#x27;ve created and approaches you&#x27;ve refined. As a suggestion, would you perhaps be better off here just taking one single component and making that world-beating, instead of trying to develop 18 different modules to pre-MVP quality.Whatever you decide, you&#x27;re clearly a very talented and prolific developer. Very best of luck with everything. reply harrisonlo 15 hours agoparentI appreciate this feedback. Thanks for writing it out.

You&#x27;re definitely not the only one asking this, so it&#x27;s top on the list.Side note: I did start implementing PDF exports, but for anyone curious, it&#x27;s actually a lot more complex than imagined. There is no easy way to turn HTML to PDF (if anyone knows otherwise, please share) and there are font and language complications. reply pbronez 16 hours agorootparentPerhaps you could target the PanDoc AST for export (and import!). That’s probably the single most robust document conversion tool available. Plus it’s open source so you can get some force multiplication on all the edge cases.Personally, I’d love to do contract management with a system like this.

Features Top ▲ Fast and intuitive keyboard only control Context based help (no need to memorize tons of hot-keys) Inspect, commit, and amend changes (incl. hooks: pre-commit,commit-msg,post-commit,prepare-commit-msg) Stage, unstage, revert and reset files, hunks and lines Stashing (save, pop, apply, drop, and inspect) Push / Fetch to / from remote Branch List (create, rename, delete, checkout, remotes) Browse / Search commit log, diff committed changes Responsive terminal UI Async git API for fluid control Submodule support 2. Motivation Top ▲ I do most of my git work in a terminal but I frequently found myself using git GUIs for some use-cases like: index, commit, diff, stash, blame and log. Unfortunately popular git GUIs all fail on giant repositories or become unresponsive and unusable. GitUI provides you with the user experience and comfort of a git GUI but right in your terminal while being portable, fast, free and opensource. 3. Benchmarks Top ▲ For a RustBerlin meetup presentation (slides) I compared lazygit,tig and gitui by parsing the entire Linux git repository (which contains over 900k commits):Time Memory (GB) Binary (MB) Freezes Crashes gitui 24 s ✅ 0.17 ✅ 1.4 No ✅ No ✅ lazygit 57 s 2.6 16 Yes Sometimes tig 4 m 20 s 1.3 0.6 ✅ Sometimes No ✅ 4. Road(map) to 1.0 Top ▲ These are the high level goals before calling out 1.0: visualize branching structure in log tab (#81) interactive rebase (#32) 5. Known Limitations Top ▲ no sparse repo support (see #1226) no support for GPG signing (see #97) no git-lfs support (see #1089) credential.helper for https needs to be explicitly configured (see #800) Currently, this tool does not fully substitute the git shell, however both tools work well in tandem. The priorities for gitui are on features that are making me mad when done on the git shell, like stashing, staging lines or hunks. Eventually, I will be able to work on making gitui a one stop solution - but for that I need help - this is just a spare time project for now. All support is welcomed! Sponsors as well! ❤ 6. Installation Top ▲ GitUI is in beta and may contain bugs and missing features. However, for personal use it is reasonably stable and is being used while developing itself. Various Package Managers Install Instructions Release Binaries Available for download in releases Binaries available for: Linux gitui-linux-musl.tar.gz (linux on x86_64) gitui-linux-aarch64.tar.gz (linux on 64 bit arm) gitui-linux-arm.tar.gz gitui-linux-armv7.tar.gz All contain a single binary file macOS gitui-mac.tar.gz (intel Mac, uses Rosetta on Apple silicon, single binary) Windows gitui-win.tar.gz (single 64bit binary) gitui.msi (64bit Installer package) 7. Build Top ▲ Requirements Minimum supported rust/cargo version: 1.65 See Install Rust To build openssl dependency (see https://docs.rs/openssl/latest/openssl/) perl >= 5.12 (strawberry perl works for windows https://strawberryperl.com/) a c compiler (msvc, gcc or clang, cargo will find it) To run the complete test suite python is required (and it must be invokable as python) Cargo Install The simplest way to start playing around with gitui is to have cargo build and install it with cargo install gitui. If you are not familiar with rust and cargo: Getting Started with Rust Cargo Features trace-libgit enable libgit2 tracing works if libgit2 builded with -DENABLE_TRACE=ON this feature enabled by default, to disable: cargo install --no-default-features 8.

Turned out it was not possible.The help shown with H didn&#x27;t have any keys for that either, meaning it may not be possible even with the keyboard, though IMO this is one of the cases where even if it was possible via keyboard, being able to resize with the mouse is vastly easier and faster (keyboard resize is still nice for the cases where a mouse is not available though, like using the program via a broken ssh setup). reply jonwest 12 hours agoprevI see that lazygit is listed as inspiration for this project.

But I don&#x27;t think that there is a difference between a GUI or TUI or cmdline use of git in that case. Do other interfaces to git fail in more spectacular ways than git itself? reply rtpg 5 hours agoparentMagit&#x27;s failure mode is downstream of it (I believe) pulling in diff information on the status page. When I&#x27;ve had this problem, doing `git status` on the command line has always been more or less instant.There is something inevitable about needing time to display a lot of information. But I think magit is eager in some places that lead to extremely costly magit workflows when the raw git workflow would be much faster. reply lolinder 9 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s surprising to me if so.

We work on Windows and wanted a better GUI app since we use git from a GUI 90% of the time. We used to use Sourcetree years back and it never worked well. Tried a few alternatives but in my mind Fork was the clear winner. The UI is clear, snappy and works as you expect it would. I wish they had a higher price for companies (to make sure they can survive, since they use lifetime licensing...) and possibility to buy licenses that can be assigned and reassigned. I had to fight the company to buy the license since you always buy it for an individual, which does not fit how companies usually buy software or subscriptions. reply stsrki 6 minutes agorootparentI also use Fork and find it the fastest and easiest git GUI. And I tried so many GUIs in the past. One thing that works well in Fork is submodules, which are almost non-existent in other GUIs. And the UI is really fast to respond.On a side note, regarding the licensing. As a software vendor selling to enterprises, I always struggle with finding this kind of information.

Double left-click to checkout a branch. There are big buttons at the top for fetch&#x2F;pull&#x2F;push, and when staging a commit there&#x27;s a clean and focused view for choosing which hunks to stage. Basically all needed operations can be initiated with minimal mouse actions, and anything destructive has a confirmation. reply charrondev 9 hours agoparentprevI use GitHub desktop for basic operations and the CLI for anything complicated.

For me it&#x27;s usually just the ease of not needing to know a commit hash to perform a rebase against after a merge, but I generally just do these ops from within an IDEs builtin git support and everything else is command line. Do others find a huge benefit from GUIs? reply aulin 3 hours agoparentIn magit I find invaluable being able to stage chunk by chunk. It enables a whole different workflow, where I review my own code staging it step by step.Also being able to navigate blame history inside the editor is pretty cool.No idea about other GUIs, if I have to get out the editor to use git I might just use the command line. reply Sleaker 2 hours agorootparentFor workflow reviews I tend to just push to GitHub and then use it&#x27;s review diff when making PRs to catch anything I may have missed (typos usually)Ah I do use git blame sometimes but it&#x27;s builtin to the ide so I get it while editing code live. I guess this is the biggest difference I have with not wanting a gitgui, any of those ops I feel like I can get with my ide. reply aulin 16 minutes agorootparentSure, magit is in some sense \"getting it with the ide\".Not sure how advanced is blame in other editors, it&#x27;s not just blame annotation, is being able to navigate the history of a line just jumping from one change to the previous and back. It&#x27;s incredibly helpful with large code bases to understand how some code evolved and why it&#x27;s implemented like that.Another great magit feature is being able to open a file from any git revision. Like you want to copy some line from a file that&#x27;s being long removed you can just call magit-find-file on a revision that still has it, open it in buffer, copy what you want etc. reply zdimension 7 hours agoparentprevWorking often with multi branch projects across repos (forks and upstream), using GitKraken simply makes me more productive. I don&#x27;t think anymore about how I&#x27;m gonna merge or rebase stuff, it makes everything more intuitive.

(I&#x27;ve never used one; keen to learn if I&#x27;m missing out) reply Karliss 1 hour agoparentYou can&#x27;t just blindly run git commands without being aware of current state. Some beginners or people with less technical roles try to use git by blindly running 3 commands they memorized, but that easily results in a mess or situation where it&#x27;s necessary to call a more experienced colleague to fix their local copy.For me one of the biggest benefits of using a git GUI is always visible current state: what you have checked out, what are the recent commit, what&#x27;s the state of other branches, do i have any unmodified files. All of it in front of my eyes, not requiring any additional input (beside alt tab for switching to the graphical git client). Not that you couldn&#x27;t get the same information from git CLI, but the question is how often would you do that, and would you check all of it each time.But I often perform many of the actual changes in terminal using the default git CLI client.In this sense I consider shell integration based version control clients bad, as they require using context menu to open the information windows and it&#x27;s a step that can be skipped since most of the other actions will likely be in the same context menu. Thus you endup with similar situation as CLI clients - information is available but you have to actively request it.Next step to consider is TUI vs GUI. I find that that often due to constraints of fixed character grid and limited graphical elements TUI can be less dense. Every box and separator line means a wasted row&#x2F;column. Two boxes side by side - that&#x27;s two wasted rows. Everything being monospace font - additional wasted space. Single font size for everything - makes it impossible to use smaller size font for short less important text. You can set a very small text size in terminal, but it hurts overall readability of the TUI and all other work you do in terminal, and it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that TUI was designed with limited available space in mind thus you only get slightly longer text but no additional information. On the other hand TUI will more likely have a very efficient keyboard only navigation and single key actions. GitUI and many Norton commander inspired TUI file managers like FAR and MC are good examples of this. reply KronisLV 10 hours agoparentprev> Out of curiosity, what specific tasks are easier using a GUI?Personally, I really like being able to stage&#x2F;unstage blocks of code or even individual lines in a GUI, if I&#x27;ve done some refactoring and added new logic at the same time, but want those in separate commits.Aside from that, I really like working in a GUI, looking at the commit graphs, easily switching between any number of branches and merges being a right click away.I actually ended up paying for GitKraken because it also makes managing multiple accounts (personal vs work) as easy as choosing what I want from a drop-down, as well as includes workspace functionality to group multiple repos together.Before than, using SourceTree or Git Cola was also decent. Just feels like one of those things that are convenient with a GUI, except I enjoy standalone tools for that more than most IDE integrations. reply rtpg 5 hours agoparentprevWith Magit I&#x27;ve found that you can just be faster. Nicer autocomplete functionality, quick access to flags when doing operations, being able to point your cursor at a commit and say \"cherry pick _this_ please\".Less futzing around with copying around IDs and the such. I still need to know how to do most everything with git itself, but because I know that, I can rely on magit to just make it quicker for me to \"do the thing\". reply insin 11 hours agoparentprevAs a former darcs user who was won over by and still uses git-gui to this day, reviewing and staging&#x2F;reverting changes hunk-by-hunk&#x2F;line-by-line, and subsequently referring back to what I&#x27;ve left unstaged. reply nomilk 11 hours agorootparentHow does this differ from git commit --patch? reply halostatue 6 hours agorootparentFairly extensively.`git add --patch` (the way I usually do it) is good enough when you’re adding parts and know what to do in the future. Recently, though, I’ve been using lazygit&#x27;s ability to create a partial patch from a commit and effectively split the commit into two or more parts. This lets me take a larger set of commits and turn it into something that is easier to review (it’s sort of a hyper interactive rebase where you can add or remove lines, files, or trees into each patch).I wouldn&#x27;t even think of doing this without lazygit (and if gitui is ever at par with lazygit for this, I might switch). reply rtpg 5 hours agorootparentprevAt least with magit, I can look at the entire diff, then highlight specific lines, and stage those fairly easily. `git commit --patch` gives youhunks, but if you need to break those hunks up it&#x27;s a couple extra steps.GUI stuff is not necessarily about enabling new workflows so much as making workflows _very fast_ and less error prone.

One of the first things I do when I check out an open source project is check if it&#x27;s written in or requires node.js, and if it does, I ignore the project. I&#x27;ve worked with enough node.js stuff over the years to know that I simply do not want to deal with its ecosystem. I feel the same way about Ruby but I can&#x27;t remember the last time I saw a new Ruby project. If I have to deal with managing an interpreter, I don&#x27;t want to use your project. Python only gets a pass because I still use it professionally so I am personally up to date on its quirks, but I can understand why someone would say the same thing about Python projects. reply ubercow13 12 hours agorootparentI also use Python professionally and still have by far the worst luck with getting anything Python on github to work out of any language.Written in Go&#x2F;Rust is definitely a feature for something like this. reply freedomben 12 hours agorootparentprevRust != ships as one statically linked binary though.

They&#x27;re not going to learn much from the device, and a phone is something that is incredibly annoying to lose for any amount of time.If they keep it and it becomes known, people who e.g. took videos of incidents would become reluctant to come forward and share them, worried that the government might want to take the phone that recorded the video. They&#x27;d lose a lot of useful evidence in future cases, on top of the terrible PR it&#x27;d be.Edit: The agency also relies a lot on the goodwill of the public. Investigations work a lot better when school teacher Bob, finding an aircraft piece in his back yard, contacts the NTSB and tells them to come get it, rather than deciding to quickly bring it inside and turn it into a coffee table later.

The text of the post is as follows: “My husband and I were walking the trail behind the Renaissance Town-homes near Barnes and Valeira View and we saw a large white oval object with a teal stripe on it in the brambles between the creek and Barnes Road. Two others saw it too and they called non-emergency. WCSO and the NTSB showed up but they could not affirm that that is what is was. As my husband said, nobody will know until they walk over to it. Unfortunately the undergrowth prevented us from doing so. We&#x27;ll see, or not.”The description of it having a teal stripe could match up with the missing panel, although we obviously can’t be sure yet if it is actually the missing part. I also saw a post from one of the folks who found a phone, and they had included a photo of where they found it, which I recognized to be fairly close to the place where the door was potentially found.Sometimes we hear stuff on our roof, but it’s always just pinecones falling or a squirrel running around… makes me grateful we haven’t had a Donnie Darko scene in our yard or on our roof! reply hackernewds 3 hours agorootparentthat ain&#x27;t it. here on a better sourcehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;alaska-airlines-faa-plug-d... reply codetrotter 58 minutes agorootparentDisappointed there is no photo of what it looked like when it was found.

Modern US Airborne training teaches a whole lot of caution when doing so. Best case you wait for someone to extricate you, but worst case (or for a combat jump), you deploy the reserve chute and then slide down it like a rope.I don&#x27;t know if they were using reserves in WWII (might have depended), but combat jump altitude is typically too low to have time to deploy your reserve.

I have a question.Is there a way to use HTMX with minimal server side changes. Specifically if I have an existing page that you fill in a form and submit and response is of course the entire page. I think it would be cool to tell htmx that the whole page is being returned BUT I only want to update #my-form and that way you don’t need any “if htmx request” kinda stuff on the server.This is for people who care about their site working without JS.

In theory you could do this with any server stack that is self host-able. My goal is to produce a single binary with no external service dependancies. I&#x27;m using Go, and a lot of the components are readily available, e.g. self updating local service, replicated database, etc. It&#x27;s easy to cross-compile for different target OS and architectures. As an alternative to building everything into the browser, and assuming you&#x27;re able to run a separate process, this approach makes a lot of sense to me.

Good Law Project is a not for profit campaign organisation that uses the law for a better world. We know that the law, in the right hands, can be a fair and decent force for good. It is a practical tool for positive change and can make amazing things happen. Stay up to date and be the first to hear about how to take action. Sign up Good Law Project is a not for profit campaign organisation that uses the law for a better world. We know that the law, in the right hands, can be a fair and decent force for good. It is a practical tool for positive change and can make amazing things happen. We can reveal that Palantir was required to but failed to seek prior approval from NHS England (NHSE) for its campaign to promote its contract to run the Federated Data Platform and brief against Good Law Project. Now NHSE has confirmed to Bloomberg UK that it will be investigating whether Palantir violated the contract terms just weeks after signing it. A leaked briefing and emails from the campaign shows that Palantir used Tory-linked PR agency, Topham Guerin and marketing agency, Disrupt, to approach social media influencers to ask them what they would like to be paid to take part. This was done at arms-length, with the briefing asking influencers not to mention Palantir in their content. The Federated Data Platform contract was finally published on the last working day before Christmas. Page after page of this three-part contract has been redacted – including a section on the protection of personal data. But one of the sections we can actually see – which covers ‘Publicity and Branding’ – states that Palantir is not permitted to use the Authority’s name or brand in any marketing or publicise the contract without the prior written consent of NHS England. An NHS spokesperson told Bloomberg that the NHS takes any potential breach of contract by a supplier seriously and is investigating what happened. “Palantir is not – and frankly never has been – a company that can be trusted with this nationally important contract with our NHS” says Good Law Project’s Executive Director, Jo Maugham. “By its own behaviour it is telling us exactly that.” “Within weeks, it commissioned a covert smear campaign against a prominent critic and appears to have broken the terms of that contract. If this Government won’t act to protect the national interest, the next one must.” Responding to Bloomberg, Palantir has claimed that its campaign was an “exploratory project” so it did not need to consult NHSE. Palantir’s Executive Vice President for UK and Europe, Louis Mosely said, “We decided not to pursue the project — as such, the campaign was not discussed with NHS England”. But it is clear that the campaign did seek to use the NHS name and brand in marketing and publicized its agreement with the NHS. The campaign materials were dated 28 November 2023, gave as a deadline 22 December and stated “We are on a tight timeline for this one and would require a response as soon as possible with content going live before the new year”, so it is clear that there was no intention to seek the NHS England’s consent. Palantir’s conduct in commissioning a covert, paid-for smear campaign against a prominent critic; its decision to breach its contract with the NHS within weeks of signing it; and subsequent dissembling about its intention to breach, will serve to substantiate the concerns of those who believe Palantir was an entity that ought never to have been given the contract in the first place.

NHS needs a big data platform so they go to a... spy tech company? Why are they so insistent that it must be Palantir that builds this, instead of choosing from a dozen of other consulting companies that don&#x27;t have a dodgy track record?Ideally the NHS would just build it in house, but sadly it&#x27;s a slow and bloated organisation unable to innovate (as most government managed things usually become). reply blue_cookeh 13 hours agoparent> Ideally the NHS would just build it in house, but sadly it&#x27;s a slow and bloated organisation unable to innovate (as most government managed things usually become).This is patently false, a narrative often parroted by people who don&#x27;t understand or have never worked in the NHS.There are many intelligent people in technical&#x2F;digital roles in the NHS that innovate on a daily basis - heck, many build systems internally at a hugely reduced cost compared to outsourcing yet decisions come from parliament&#x2F;gov agencies that overrule internal decision making and waste insane amounts of cash on vanity projects, or scrapping internal work to be redone by the likes of Accenture. reply cedws 6 hours agorootparentWhy does the NHS have a mismatch of IT systems that don&#x27;t fit together then? Why are they still running Windows XP? reply 0xy 11 hours agorootparentprevGiven the NHS&#x27; costs continue to explode, and most of the cash goes straight to padding middle management, it seems easy to see that it&#x27;s a slow and bloated organization.After all, the UK&#x27;s health spending is increasing at a rate 2,000% higher than close neighbor France&#x27;s is -- indicating massive fraud and waste. reply Terr_ 7 hours agorootparentThat \"increasing at a rate\" vague phrasing makes me instinctively suspicious of abused statistics.For example, suppose in 24 hours France&#x27;s spending goes up +0% and the UK&#x27;s spending goes up +0.001%: \"Oh my god! The UK&#x27;s spending is increasing at a rate infinity times more!!11\" reply 0xy 6 hours agorootparentThe time period was 2010 to 2019. Even since 2019, the NHS has several hundred billion in planned budget increases.My favorite thing about dysfunctional UK political rhetoric is when someone will say \"the Conservatives are slashing the NHS!\" when what they really mean is that they&#x27;ve slightly decreased the rate of increase, so by every metric it&#x27;s still skyrocketing (but not enough to those who want to dump infinite cash in the middle management growth machine).Another fun factoid: the pro-Brexit crew were chided for claiming they&#x27;d increase NHS funding by 350m Euros a week. Since Brexit, NHS funding has actually increased by more than double that.Nothing can stop the NHS cash burning. Expand middle management at all costs. Nevermind that we&#x27;re outspending comparable countries with comparable health pressures. reply Terr_ 1 hour agorootparentDude, I&#x27;m gonna have to ask you to back up your statements with some actual data, because what you said doesn&#x27;t match the what I found at all.To be specific, I mean these charts of those countries&#x27; total spending [0] and govt&#x2F;compulsory spending [1] during that time period. (Using the OECD stats visualization tool [2].)For total spending [0] UK&#x27;s spend-growth was less than France&#x27;s (not greater) and for govt&#x2F;compulsory spending [1] the UK&#x27;s larger growth over that period was still in the same ballpark of ~1.31x versus France&#x27;s ~1.28.In other words, the nearest number I can derive for your \"increasing at a rate X% higher than France&#x27;s\" is around 1.31&#x2F;1.28 = ~2.4%. Yet you said 2000%! That&#x27;s a gap of three entire orders of magnitude which desperately need explanation.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;chart&#x2F;7jcQ[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;chart&#x2F;7jcV[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.oecd.org&#x2F;healthres&#x2F;health-spending.htm reply 0xy 25 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m using World Bank data (sourced from the World Health Organization Global Health Expenditure database) on a per capita basis. As you can see, UK spending is skyrocketing. The rate of increase between 2010 and 2019 is 2,000% higher than France&#x27;s, as originally claimed.I don&#x27;t think your data source correctly accounts for inflation, making it essentially useless to see true costs.As you know, France is a similar country with similar health concerns and similar hospital pressures.Yet the UK lights taxpayer money on fire on NHS middle management salaries (care certainly isn&#x27;t improving!) and France has no such problem.Source:- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.worldbank.org&#x2F;indicator&#x2F;SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD?locat...- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.worldbank.org&#x2F;indicator&#x2F;SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD?locat... reply Engineering-MD 3 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a source to say most of the money goes to middle management?

This is a total societal breakdown, and I am not being dramatic if you consider other simultaneous scandals such as PPE.By that I mean it is impressive how this could happen in one of the foremost liberal society with a large well-funded media representing the whole political spectrum, fiercely adversarial two-party politics, respect for institutional whistleblowers (so long as they don&#x27;t involve foreign policy) and finally an independent civil service. All of those layers failed to put a stop to this or even to shed an intense light on it for the public. Far more than the conservatives had failed to let this get through.In fact what is amazing is the public barely aware of its existence as a news story. Try asking a few of your non-tech friends about it. Even the twitter mob failed on this. reply zimpenfish 13 hours agorootparent> with a large well-funded media representing the whole political spectrumI&#x27;m reasonably sure the UK media tilts mostly rightwards with only a tiny strand on the left and a small chunk of centrism. reply dwroberts 13 hours agorootparentprev> other simultaneous scandals such as PPE.Also performed by the conservative government?I mean that sets the precedent for kick-backs as well, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if, after losing the next election, a bunch of sitting Conservative MPs go and mysteriously work for Palantir (Greensill all over again and - oh and hey, David Cameron&#x27;s reputation is being rehabilitated right now by having him in government again, funny that) reply 0xy 11 hours agorootparentprevThey&#x27;ve been in power for a long time and yet NHS spending increases are 2,000% higher than France&#x27;s equivalent health spending.Can you explain how someone can \"hate the NHS\" while drowning them in cash far beyond what they need to operate? reply dwroberts 11 hours agorootparent> Can you explain how someone can \"hate the NHS\" while drowning them in cash far beyond what they need to operate?Drowning them in cash that they have siphoned off to their own cronies and companies that give their MPs kickbacks.Not unlike this Palantir contract, which is probably going to be Greensill II reply bufio 1 hour agoparentprevThe UK government&#x27;s phobia of doing anything in-house almost certainly stems from the enormous amount of money that the political class makes from government contracts.The NHS could be as slow and bloated as a whale corpse, but doing everything in-house would probably still be more successful than contracting fraudster companies. reply c1b 15 hours agoparentprevAs someone familiar with the USG data management tech landscape — it’s probably because it’s by far the best product with no remotely close second. reply worik 15 hours agorootparent> As someone familiar with the USG data management tech landscape — it’s probably because it’s by far the best product with no remotely close second.That is sweetly naive, unless you are talking about their marketing department reply c1b 15 hours agorootparentLet me rephrase: I am extremely familiar with the USG data management tech landscape. reply ghc 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d love to know (in as much detail as you are allowed) what you feel the strengths and weaknesses of CHEETAS is. reply c1b 13 hours agorootparentI cannot comment specifically on CHEETAS, but what I can say is that USG developing in house software solutions almost always produces a disastrous product that goes over budget and has extreme maintenance overhead.To see why, you can simply ask yourself: do you think that the unelected officials overseeing government agencies that embark on enterprise software development projects have sufficient expertise and enterprise software project management experience to be able to do this well?Furthermore, do you think that the quality of engineers that the NHS or DoD can attract with less than half of the compensation of an actual software company stands a chance at developing something good in house?It’s unfortunately almost impossible for these projects to go right. reply lmeyerov 12 hours agorootparentInteresting, thank you for sharing!That experience speaks more to the perils of in-housing, not to why Palantir is the best COTS for specific needs here. Are there specific leading COTS here you view it so far ahead of for such a contract?Closer to our own practice.. Modern LLMs have basically reset the field for SOTA in this space, with Palantir, by definition, being behind OpenAI in the most basic tasks, and thus being in the same race as everyone else to retool. Speaking from our own USG experience, we are deep tech leads in some other intelligence areas (graph, ...), and before OpenAI, often chose to adopt prev-gen leading LLM models (BERT, ...) for tasks closer to the NLP side as we recognized that wasn&#x27;t where our deep tech had an inhouse advantage. We basically had to start over on some of those projects there as soon as GPT4 came out because it just changed so much that the incumbent advantages of already being delivering on a contract were a dead end for core functionality, and almost a year later, it&#x27;s now obvious that it was the right choice when we get compared to companies that haven&#x27;t been. Palantir has been publicly resetting as well for using GenAI era tech, which suggests the same situation. reply ethanbond 9 hours agorootparentIt seems like you don’t know what Palantir is. Nothing OpenAI does is competitive with what Palantir does. Palantir, like every other software company out there, is exploring what “my product + AI” means. reply lmeyerov 9 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a fair surface-level view, but worth thinking through a bit.Palantir is multiple main things, and a whole ton of custom software projects on top, and a good chunk of them rely on the quality of their NLP & vision systems for being competitive with others. My question relates to the notion that they are inherently the best when, by all public AI benchmarks, they don&#x27;t make the best components and, in the context of air-gapped &#x2F; self-hosted government work, don&#x27;t even have access to them. Separately, I&#x27;m curious how they relate to their COTS competitors (vs gov inhouse) given the claims here.

Whether it is monitoring video, investigating satellite photos, mining social media & news, entity resolution & linking on documents & logs, linking datasets, or OCR+translation of foreign documents, these are all about the intelligence tier. Tools like ontology management and knowledge graphs are especially being reset due to the ability of modern LLMs to drastically improve their quality and improve their scalability & usability through automation.* Data protection has long been layering on AI methods for alerting (UEBA, ...), classification, policy synthesis, configuration management, ...Databricks is a pretty good example of a company here. They don&#x27;t preconfigure government datasets on the governments behalf and sell that back to them, but we do see architects using it as a way to build their own data platforms, and especially for AI-era workloads. Likewise, they have grown an ecosystem of data management providers on top vs single-sourcing, eg, it&#x27;s been cool to see Altana bring supply chain data as basically a Databricks implementation. For core parts, Databricks keeps adding more of the data management stack to their system, such as examining how a high-grade entity resolution pipeline would break down between their stack and ecosystem providers. replybrobinson 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat are the better products that are available? reply cedws 15 hours agorootparentprevWhich product specifically?

As opposed to a bunch of really smart (and really underpaid, looking at the stipend amounts) grad students who know a lot about their specific domain, but lack the industry experience and proper product management.Add on top of that that Palantir will dedicate engineers just for their big customers, just so that they can assist with integrating and customizing the product the way the customer wants. Palantir literally has a role for that called Forward-Deployed Engineer, and they will fly out to wherever the customer is to address whatever issues they have. Even if all else was equal, there is no way a university would be able to do that.P.S.

A risk lay in the fact that users with sufficient power could choose what to show and what to conceal to other stones: in The Lord of the Rings, a palantír has fallen into the Enemy&#x27;s hands, making the usefulness of all other existing stones questionable.

That can only be done by bringing test cases. A \"positive result\" comes in several forms there, namely that a) the case is not thrown out and b) they then get their desired result. Simply establishing that they&#x27;re able to challenge in a particular way can also be a big deal.For example, while it wasn&#x27;t GLP but Gina Miller challenging article 50, it established that laws can&#x27;t be revoked except by parliament, and that the SC can police this. Our supreme court is young (est 2006 or so) and is still coming into its powers because those are defined through lawmaking in the courts as well as parliament. reply giobox 14 hours agorootparent> Our supreme court is young (est 2006 or so)This is not the case at all. The \"Supreme Court\" in the UK is the latest version of the UK&#x27;s \"court of last resort\". Previous to this it was the House of Lords one would appeal to (it had functions to sit as UK&#x27;s top court as well as the 2nd chamber). The House Of Lords was the Court of last resort for the UK since at least the 1800s.From the Wikipedia page on the \"new\" UK supreme court:\"It assumed the judicial functions of the House of Lords, which had been exercised by the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (commonly called \"Law Lords\"), the 12 judges appointed as members of the House of Lords to carry out its judicial business as the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords.\"Indeed, the first 12 justices on the \"new\" supreme court where just the exact same 12 Law Lords from the previous House of Lords system.The 2006 \"Supreme Court\" rebrand was a continuing reform of the existing system, not some new level of appellate court the UK had never had before. In reality, they both perform the same top appellate court&#x2F;court of last resort role. You could bring the same types of cases to the House of Lords as you can to the Supreme Court, and the Law Lords presided over many of the UK&#x27;s most significant constitutional cases.There are various political reasons why this \"rebrand\" to Supreme Court was done, but I&#x27;ve typed enough and can&#x27;t be bothered delving further into this in a reply. It&#x27;s fundamentally a continuation of the previous long standing Court, and precedent from the many, many pre-existing HoL Court decisions is equal in power to that of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions.Had Gina Miller&#x27;s case been say 10-15 years earlier, the HoL would have heard and decided the case too - she did not need the existence of a \"new\" \"Supreme Court\".> https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Judicial_functions_of_the_Hous...> https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parliament.uk&#x2F;about&#x2F;mps-and-lords&#x2F;about-lords&#x2F;lo... reply hkt 14 hours agorootparent> Had Gina Miller&#x27;s case been say 10-15 years earlier, the HoL would have heard and decided the case too - she did not need the existence of a \"new\" \"Supreme Court\".The system of appointment to the SC is rather different to the HoL as it draws from the judiciary and merely being a Lord isn&#x27;t enough. There was initial continuity in membership, but there has now been nearly two decades of divergence. The HoL was hereditary for much of its history as I&#x27;m sure you well know. It is of course now a house of political appointees, cronies, and people who have probably paid _someone_ to be in charge.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supremecourt.uk&#x2F;about&#x2F;appointments-of-justices.h... explains more about the system of appointments. It has an independent commission which makes the selections.This is where the discontinuity occurs: the fact that as time goes by the judges of the SC are increasingly apolitical. That gives them more standing to make decisions independent of government, and also independent of the historic bias of the HoL (which has been majority Tory for rather a lot of its history).The thinking goes that the fusion of the SC and HoL as was the case in the days of the Law Lords made the highest court a political one. The splitting of them in terms of form and personnel has fundamentally changed the character of the judgements we can expect. I&#x27;d have expected the old HoL to have gone against Miller, which is why I used her as an example.It is worth noting that had the SC not been split from the HoL after life peerages became the majority of that house, we&#x27;d be in danger of those political appointees and the like being the basis of the court. It was therefore necessary and not a \"rebrand\". reply giobox 14 hours agorootparentI practiced law in the UK during the transition; fundamentally they operate very similarly and the cases they hear are essentially identical. So much so, HoL decisions have equal precedential value. The UK did not gain some new level of appellate Court as a result of this change.The rebrand to Supreme Court and change to appointment processes do indeed remove some of the risk of perception of political interference, but if you look at the historical operations of the HoL as an appelate Court in the last 80 years, political interference was much more a hypothetical problem than a real one - the HoL routinely passed decisions that greatly upset the ruling parties of the day, and the appointments of Law Lords was greatly removed from the appointments of rank and file life peers etc.> The system of appointment to the SC is rather different to the HoL as it draws from the judiciary and merely being a Lord isn&#x27;t enough.The law lords where almost always drawn from the Judiciary too in modern history, sitting here right now I can&#x27;t think of one who didn&#x27;t have a very significant judicial career prior to becoming a law lord. The government was able to simply grant them a peerage permitting them to become a law lord, which is not 1000 miles removed from the Supreme Court&#x27;s life-long appointments. The HoL required retirement at 75 for a Law Lord exactly the same as is expected for a new SC justice too.> It is worth noting that had the SC not been split from the HoL after life peerages became the majority of that house, we&#x27;d be in danger of those political appointees and the like being the basis of the court. It was therefore necessary and not a \"rebrand\".This is nonsense. Only the law lords sat on the court. It was not just \"any\" peer who could sit on the Court, of which there were only 12 members.\"To be appointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary under the 1876 Act, a person was required to have been a practising barrister for a period of fifteen years or to have held a high judicial office—as Lord Chancellor (before 2005) or judge of the Court of Appeal, High Court or Court of Session—for a period of two years. Lords of Appeal in Ordinary were required to retire from judicial office at 70 or 75 years of age, though as barons they continued to serve as members of the House of Lords in its legislative capacity for life.\"> https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lords_of_Appeal_in_OrdinaryThere are many things that are arguably wrong&#x2F;undesirable about an unelected second legislative chamber such as the HoL, but the operations of its Court were arguably one of its least egregious short-comings, and very separate from the general workings of the HoL at large. replybaz00 15 hours agoprevI’m not even remotely surprised about this. reply EMCymatics 14 hours agoprev [2 more] [flagged] penguin_booze 14 hours agoparent [–] Takes after its fouder.

Hint: It's Not Just Balance Sarah Constantin Dec 28, 2023 28 Share this post What does the Cerebellum Do Anyway? sarahconstantin.substack.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 10 Share This is the cerebellum. Its name means “little brain” — it’s a whole other brain under your “big” one. If you vaguely remember something about what the cerebellum does, you’re probably thinking something to do with balance. Medical students have to learn the “cerebellar gait” that results from cerebellar injury (it’s the same staggering gait that drunk people have, because alcohol impairs the cerebellum.) A more detailed neurological exam of a patient with cerebellar disease shows a wider variety of motor problems. Here you’ll notice that the patient can’t bring his finger to his nose or clap his hands without a wobbling back-and-forth motion; that his eyes “wobble” back and forth (which is called nystagmus); and that he wobbles backwards and forwards while standing or walking, so that he nearly falls over and needs a broad-based gait to support himself. In cerebellar disease, muscle tone is diminished (people are “floppy”), movements are not fluent (each individual sub-movement is separate), there’s dysmetria (failure to “aim” or estimate the distance to move, overshoot or undershoot) and there’s “intention tremor” (high amplitude, relatively slow wobbles that arise when the patient starts to move, as contrasted with the “resting tremor” characteristic of e.g. Parkinson’s disease.) Clearly, the cerebellum does something to control movement, and movement is impaired when it is damaged. But why do we need a whole other “little brain” to control these aspects of movement? There are already regions of the cerebrum (or “forebrain”) dedicated to movement, like the motor cortex and the basal ganglia. And you can do a lot of movement using just those! Even in the rare cases known as cerebellar agenesis, where a person is born totally lacking a cerebellum123, movement is still possible, just impaired: slow motor and speech development in childhood, abnormal spoken pronunciation, wobbly limb movements, and mild-to-moderate intellectual disability. But not paralysis, and not even particularly bad disability overall — a lot of these people were able to live independently and work at jobs. So…that’s weird. What is the cerebellum’s job? It seems weird to have a whole separate organ for “make motor and cognitive skills work somewhat better.” The other weird thing about the cerebellum is anatomical. These very large, complex neurons are the Purkinje cells, which exist only in the cerebellum. Illustration by Santiago Ramon y Cajal Notice how the Purkinje cell (e) is much more complex than the other neuron types. They have hundreds of synapses each, unlike the neurons of the cerebrum which only have a few. Most of the other cells in the cerebellum are the small granule cells — in fact, they are so numerous that they comprise more than half of all neurons in the whole human brain. In total, the cerebellum contains 80% of all neurons!4 If you were an alien with a microscope who knew nothing about neurology, your first assumption would be “ah yes, the thinking happens in the cerebellum.” Why is there so much neuronal complexity dedicated to….making movement a bit smoother and “higher” cognition a bit better? The third weird fact is that the size of the cerebellum has been growing throughout primate evolution and human prehistory, faster than overall brain size.5 Great ape brains are distinguished from monkey brains by their larger frontal and cerebellar lobes. The Neanderthals had bigger brains than us but smaller cerebella. And, most strikingly, modern humans have much bigger cerebella than “anatomically modern” Cro-Magnon humans of only 50,000 years ago (but relatively smaller cerebral hemispheres!) An alien paleontologist could be forgiven for assuming “ah yes, the cerebellum, the seat of the higher intellect.” The cerebellum looks like it should have some crucial unique function. Something key to “what makes us human.” But what could it be? The Cerebellum Is The Seat of Classical Conditioning Some of Ivan Pavlov’s famous dogs Classical conditioning — the thing that makes a dog salivate when it hears a bell it’s learned to associate with food — is a very low-level process. You don’t need a lot of brain for classical conditioning. You can classically condition the sea slug Aplysia, which has only 20,000 neurons, to flinch from a neutral sensation it’s learned to associate with a painful one.6 Aplysia californica releasing a toxic cloud in self-defense Even single cells can exhibit learning. The giant slime mold amoeba Physarum can be “trained” to cross a noxious part of a petri dish to reach food on the other side.7 However, in vertebrates, classical conditioning is highly localized in the nervous system: the cerebellum is necessary and sufficient for learning conditioned responses.8 A standard test of classical conditioning is the eyeblink test: can the subject learn to associate a neutral stimulus with an unpleasant one (like a puff of air to the eye) and automatically blink in response to the neutral stimulus. If you lesion the cerebellum in animals, they no longer exhibit eyeblink conditioning. Humans with cerebellar damage also have no eyeblink conditioning.9 Conversely, if you want classical conditioning, all you need is a cerebellum — in fact, all you need for classical conditioning is the Purkinje cells!10 The eyeblink response is governed by the Purkinje cells. When an animal feels a puff of air to the eye, the Purkinje cells stop firing temporarily, resulting in an eyeblink. So, in 2007, some Swedish researchers decided to study this response in isolation. Here’s how it works. You take a “decerebrate” ferret — i.e. a ferret with the whole cerebrum severed from the rest of the brain (consisting of the brainstem and cerebellum). You condition individual Purkinje cells with electrode stimulation of two types of neurons that form their inputs: the climbing fibers (unconditioned stimulus) and the mossy fibers (conditioned stimulus.) Stimulating the climbing fibers (the same thing that happens naturally when a puff of air hits the eye) causes a temporary suppression of Purkinje cell firing; stimulating the mossy fibers does not. But, if the mossy fibers are stimulated right before the climbing fibers, the Purkinje neurons learn to anticipate the association and suppress their firing in response to the mossy fiber stimulation. This is a textbook example of classical conditioning. Are cerebellar Purkinje cells the only individual neurons capable of single-cell learning? Not in all animals; the sensory neurons of the sea slug Aplysia can be classically conditioned.11 But I haven’t been able to find a study in vertebrates of single-cell classical conditioning or associative learning outside the cerebellum. (Other regions of the brain, of course, are involved in learning, but the learning might be occurring through multicellular information like the relationships between nearby neurons’ firing patterns.) Why do we care? First of all, this gives us at least one “unique job” for the cerebellum: it is the place in the brain where conditioned associations are learned. Second of all, it disproves the long-term potentiation theory that learning in the brain happens exclusively through strengthening synaptic connections between neurons. (The old dictum that “neurons that fire together, wire together.”) The brain is not like a neural network where the only thing that is “learned” or “updated” is the weights between neurons. At least some learning evidently happens within individual neurons. That’s bad news for anyone hoping to simulate a brain digitally. It means there’s a lot more relevant stuff to simulate (like the learning that goes on within cells) than the connectionist paradigm of treating each biological neuron like a neural-net “neuron” would imply, and thus the computational requirements of simulating a brain are higher — maybe vastly higher — than connectionists hope. On the other hand, intracellular learning is great news for neuroscientists trying to discover exactly how learning works inside a brain. If you’re studying an example of learning (or classical conditioning) that occurs within a single neuron, then the long-hypothesized “engram”, or physical object corresponding to a piece of newly learned information, has to reside inside that neuron. Something needs to physically or chemically change in that neuron, representing the newly learned information, and causing the corresponding change in the neuron’s firing behavior. Cerebellar Neurons Learn Quantities Not only can individual Purkinje cells in the cerebellum be classically conditioned, they can also learn information about the timing of stimuli. If the time interval between the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus is varied, the Purkinje cells learn to suppress their firing at different times to match.12 In other words, if the Purkinje cell has “learned” from experience that an aversive stimulus will typically follow the neutral stimulus in exactly 50 milliseconds, then the Purkinje cell will delay roughly that long after receiving the neutral stimulus before pausing its firing. If the Purkinje cell “learns” a longer delay, it’ll wait longer before the pause. This means that something inside the Purkinje cell is capable of representing number or quantity. Cerebellar Purkinje cells, in other words, can count. (Or measure.) Is The Cerebellum The Seat Of Measurement? The fact that individual cerebellar Purkinje neurons contain the ability to measure quantities is highly suggestive about the function of the cerebellum, given the symptoms of cerebellar disease. Dysmetria, or failure to estimate the right distance and/or speed to move, is a typical symptom of damage to the cerebellum. If measurement (especially motor timing) is localized to the cerebellum, then dysmetria as a cerebellar deficit makes perfect sense. Other symptoms of cerebellar damage are easy to understand as consequences of dysmetria. Intention tremor (those big back-and-forth wobbles when the patient tries to move) might simply be what happens when dysmetria causes the movement to initially overshoot, and then an attempt to correct the overshoot itself overshoots and swings in the other direction, and so on. Nystagmus could be the same thing, with the muscles of the eye. Even the non-motor symptoms of cerebellar damage, like poor performance on cognitive tests, have sometimes been referred to as a kind of “dysmetria of thought.”13 Cerebellar patients have trouble with planning tasks (like the Tower of Hanoi puzzle), spatial reasoning tasks, and executive function tasks; you might suppose that mentally “gauging” how long to spend doing things, or “relating” subtasks to the whole, as well as understanding how objects fit together in space, are aspects of mental “measurement”. Cerebellar patients have normal abilities to make grammatical sentences, but make strange errors in generating logical sentences.14 Things like: “It’s a big job, but it’s not easy.” “If you drive, it will be less crowded” “Although it’s the wrong size for you, I’ll ask to have one that will fit you.” “I never thought I would meet you here; Nor did I, because everything seems so fresh here to buy.” Conjunctions (like “but”, “although”, “because”, “if”) represent particular logical relationships between parts of sentences. The cerebellar patients’ errors imply a specific impairment in the ability to make those conjunctional relationships. A sentence that begins “it’s a big job, but” ought to end with something that would ordinarily seem to conflict with the claim “it’s a big job”; the cerebellar patient instead ended the sentence with something that typically reinforces the claim (“big jobs” are usually “not easy”). This error violates the expected logical relationship between clauses. In a sense this is analogous to a problem in “spatial” or “part-whole” relating — the cerebellar patient has trouble constructing sentences whose clauses relate in the right way to match the conjunction between them. It’s analogous to the way cerebellar patients have the basic sensorimotor ability to do all the same individual movements that healthy people do, but they have trouble sequencing them fluently, “putting the pieces together” in the right way. Of course, other areas of the brain are involved in “measurement” or “quantity” activities too. Visual areas of the brain “measure” spatial distances, auditory areas “measure” pitch and rhythm, various parts of the cerebral cortex are active in mental arithmetic, etc. So it’s not that the cerebellum is the sole region that “measures” or “relates” things. But there is something measurement-related going on. Is The Cerebellum The Home of Anticipation? Another broad theory of what the cerebellum is “for” is anticipation or preparation.15 This fits well with the fact that classical conditioning happens in the cerebellum. Classical conditioning consists of learning to expect one stimulus to follow another, and respond in anticipation of the expected stimulus. It also fits well with the cerebellum’s role in motor planning and sequencing. Fluent movement requires unconsciously, rapidly forming intentions to do multiple different things in sequence without having to stop to think between steps. Gordon Holmes (1939) quotes a cerebellar-lesioned patient as saying, \"The movements of my left (unaffected) arm are done subconsciously, but I have to think out each movement of the right (affected) arm. I come to a dead stop in turning and have to think before I start again.\" This kind of cerebellar damage symptom represents a failure of the anticipatory or preparatory function that automatically “gets ready” for the next step before the last one is complete. Patients with cerebellar damage have impaired ability to switch their attentional focus (for instance, between a task that requires watching for visual cues and one that requires listening for auditory cues) but unimpaired ability to perform similar tasks that don’t require shifting focus. Patients with brain lesions outside the cerebellum didn’t have problems with task-switching. This also suggests that the cerebellum is involved in the “readiness” or “anticipation” prior to making a mental action. Also, experimentally stimulating the cerebellum in animals makes them more sensitive to subsequent sensory stimulus, further supporting the hypothesis that the cerebellum helps organisms “prepare to pay attention”. The Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum, in particular, are involved in “preparatory” motor adjustments, such as altering one’s grip on an object in anticipation of the experimenter moving it. If the function of the cerebellum is fully general “anticipatory” or “predictive” modeling, this would explain why it’s so important, especially in primate and hominid evolution. Dexterity (tool use, throwing) has obviously been selected for in our primate and hominid ancestors, and so have the general cognitive abilities to predict and make sense of a changing world. It also would explain why people without a cerebellum are still capable of most of the same tasks as healthy people, just with worse performance. People who lack a cerebellum are wholly incapable of eyeblink classical conditioning, but they’re not wholly incapable of learning or memory; they learn new skills slowly but they do learn them and they don’t have total amnesia. This would make sense if they are unable to learn to instantly anticipate context to prepare for upcoming actions, but they are able to learn and form memories through a slower, noisier route using the cerebrum. They can perform most of the same skills as healthy people, but they have to adjust “by trial and error” instead of using anticipation to get things right the first time, so they’re slower and less accurate. Another way of phrasing this is that the cerebellum is a forward model of the consequences of action.16 The cerebellum receives an efference copy of motor commands generated by the motor cortex, and uses its model to predict the sensory consequences; it can then compare predicted vs. actual data and error-correct. A fast, subconscious path for sensorimotor prediction and learning (including classical conditioning) is confined to the cerebellum alone; a slower path includes both the cerebellum and cerebrum. It takes hundreds of milliseconds to consciously perceive sensory information — far too slow a timescale to allow finely tuned and responsive motion that adapts to sensory feedback. Motion in real time has to be shaped and controlled by something faster than sensory processing through the long chains of neurons used for e.g. image recognition in the cortex — but moving totally “blind” without feedback control from anything would result in unacceptably crude, sloppy, choppy movement. The solution, perhaps, is the “virtual reality” generated by the cerebellum, a predictive model of the world that runs faster than the senses. The Cerebellum In Other Animals: Active Sensing? All vertebrates have a cerebellum.17 If you remove the cerebellum from a dogfish, it can still swim, but it has a tendency to “stall” and difficulty judging its turns, so that it often bumps into the sides of the tank. Pacific spiny dogfish The cerebellum is especially enlarged in fish with electrolocation abilities, like the Peters’s elephant-nose fish Gnathonemus petersii, an African freshwater fish that uses electricity-sensing receptors all over its body to navigate around obstacles. Peter’s elephant-nose fish This fish uses its huge cerebellum to monitor the electrical signatures of moving objects in the water around it. Particular Purkinje cells in the elephant-nose fish cerebellum are sensitive to particular target distances and speeds, just as particular neurons in the mammalian visual cortex are sensitive to the shape, location, and angle of visual features. This unusual electrosensing function reinforces that the cerebellum is not just a motor control organ, but has a more general function related to spatial and environmental awareness. The platypus also uses its cerebellum to keep track of electrical signals Monotremes such as platypuses also have an unusually large cerebellum; like the elephant-nose fish, the platypus is electrosensitive (in its beak) which it uses to detect swimming prey in the water. The fin whale, whose cerebellum is massively expanded Aquatic mammals — whales, dolphins, seals, and sea lions — are also notable for their enlarged cerebellums, especially the baleen whales. In marine mammals, the cerebellum is used for echolocation. Echolocating bats also use the cerebellum for navigation, though their overall cerebellum size relative to brain size is small. In many mammals, large areas of the cerebellum are devoted to processing sensory and motor information for parts of the body that are particularly dexterous and used in exploration: the snout in rodents, the hands in primates, the tip of the tail in arboreal monkeys. Across animals, the cerebellum seems to be involved in both motion and sensory perception, and intriguingly, seems to be particularly enlarged in animals that use echolocation or electrosensing in the water, for spatial awareness of object locations in all directions. This is suggestive of something like “spatial world modeling” going on in the cerebellum, and is consistent with the theory that the cerebellum’s job is anticipation and preparation. Echolocation and electrosensing are both sensory modalities that involve an organism generating a “field” around itself (of electric or sound waves) and perceiving objects in the patterns of disruption in that field. Unlike vision, hearing, and smell, they are “active sensory systems”, in which the organism can control the intensity, direction, and timing of the “probe” signal (the sound or electric signal they emit). Touch can have an analogous “actively controllable” quality, as the animal reaches out a snout, hand, or tail to explore its nearby surroundings. But truly active sensory systems, unlike touch, allow an animal to explore and probe at a distance, and gain a 3D model of its whole surrounding world. While humans don’t have these kinds of sensory systems, it may provide some intuition for what our cerebellum is doing; perhaps building implicit anticipations of where everything in the physical world around us, and how it will respond if “poked”. The Structure of the Cerebellum If you try to map regions of the cerebellum by function and by functional connectivity18 you get a close one-to-one match with the cerebrum, even down to the localization of language in one hemisphere (the left hemisphere of the cerebrum and the right hemisphere of the cerebellum; everything’s flipped.)19 The only parts of the cerebral cortex without a corresponding cerebellar region are the auditory and visual cortices. (Suggestive, given that hearing and vision are passive senses, and my hypothesis in the previous section that the cerebellum has something to do with active sensing.) The cerebellum has a repeated, almost crystal-like neural structure: it’s divided into multiple identical parallel modules. 20 The Purkinje cells (PC, in orange) project down into the core of the cerebellum, where they connect to deep nuclei. Climbing fibers (red) feed back up to the Purkinje cells. Mossy fibers (yellow) also feed into the Purkinje cells indirectly, via the granular cells (beige), and the Golgi, stellate, and basket cells (blue). The blue cells inhibit the Purkinje cells, while the red, yellow, and beige ones are excitatory. Basically, this is a feedforward excitatory chain, plus inhibitory feedback loops. The main chain goes: Afferent neurons (receiving input from the rest of the brain) → mossy fibers → granular cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → output to the rest of the brain but then there are lots of additional loops where this pathway can be self-inhibiting. The primary feedforward chain, though, is a reasonable candidate for the mechanism behind the super-fast “forward model” that generates predictions to inform action faster than sensory processing can generate conscious perceptions. On a slightly larger scale, nearby patches of neurons in the cerebellum form pretty much self-contained modules without much connection to cells in other modules. This is in contrast to the cerebral cortex, which varies a lot in cell composition between regions, has lots of recurrent loops, and lots of cross-connections between neurons from different local columns. The cerebellum is “one and done” — information goes in, through the Purkinje cells, and out. There are lots of different such modules, looping the cerebellum together with different parts of the cerebrum. Loops through the parietal lobes are involved in visual-motor coordination (like reaching the hand out to grasp something.) Loops through the oculomotor cortex are involved in controlling eye movements. Loops through the prefrontal cortex are involved in control of attention and working memory, fear extinction learning21, mental preparation of imminent actions, and procedural learning. There are other loops (including through the basal ganglia and limbic system) but these have less well understood functions. The independence of cerebellar modules makes sense given the need for speed — you can’t have long chains of interconnected neurons messing around if you want to give near-real-time model responses to control immediate action. Rethinking Intelligence People often talk as though “higher” intelligence lives in the cortex, especially the frontal lobes. The “hindbrain” is for boring, animal stuff, like controlling heart rate and hormones. Real thinking happens behind your noble brow. This picture, it turns out, is wrong. Modern Homo sapiens is as much characterized by our big cerebellums as by our big frontal lobes. Even the most iconically “thought-like” thinking — the phonological loop, i.e. imagined or inner speech — passes through both the cerebrum and cerebellum. (Speech, after all, is motion, and imagined speech is simulated motion. I can literally feel subtle movements and tension in my tongue and jaw when I think.) Most things we do have a cerebellar component, what some neuroscientists call a cerebellar transform22, smoothing and tuning and relating and fluently switching between the basic building-block abilities (sensory perception, motion, comprehension) that reside in the cerebrum. The cerebellum regulates rate, rhythm, speed, contextual appropriateness; damage it, and the same building block actions are still possible, but all out of whack, clumsy and disproportionate. This is consistent with the “embodied cognition” worldview where sensorimotor functions are on a continuum with or of the same kind as cognitive functions; thought is just “inner” motion and/or “inner” sensation. (And even abstract thought is built up of motions and sensations, via analogy or metaphor.) The cerebellum may also inspire artificial-intelligence approaches somewhat, especially approaches to robotics or other control, in that it may be be beneficial to include a fast feedforward-only predictive modeling step to control real-time actions, alongside a slower training/updating pathway for model retraining.

While I agree that the pace of advancements in neuroscience is slower compared to AI, I think it&#x27;s important to note that understanding the brain is a fundamentally different problem than building intelligent machines. The human brain is an incredibly complex system with billions of interconnected neurons, and we still have a long way to go in terms of fully understanding how it works.AI, on the other hand, is designed to solve specific problems efficiently, and it can be engineered to mimic certain aspects of human cognition without necessarily needing to understand the underlying mechanisms.While it&#x27;s possible that AI could eventually help us better understand the brain, I believe that advancements in neuroscience will continue to be crucial for unlocking the full potential of AI. Understanding how the brain processes information, learns, and makes decisions could lead to the development of more sophisticated and human-like AI systems. reply padolsey 10 hours agoprevWhat a marvellous article.

I assume there is some minimum network which makes it work. reply ChainOfFools 6 hours agoparent> special cells in the Cerebellum (Purkinje cells), which can even do single-cell learning.As a neuroscience novice, I&#x27;ve always assumed that something about the gross model of the neuron, as far as I understand it, cannot be correct or is incomplete. Because I never understood why single cells aren&#x27;t already performing single cell learning, given that there are always far more dendrites than axons.Since this characteristic turns each neuron into a lossy compression function, there has to be some process by which certain dendrites are considered &#x27;more important&#x27; carriers of information than others, in order to make a tie-breaking decision about what to include in the compressed signal, and what to throw out, as the cell decedes whether or not to transmit an impulse (including whether or not to override prior inhibitory signals) back up the axon. reply cubefox 1 hour agorootparentWell, not all incoming signals get the same weight for the outcoming signal, as the dendrites are e.g. more or less close to the part of the cell where the spikes are generated. But this computation is just analogous to the connection weights together with the activation function in artificial neural networks. That&#x27;s not what enables classical conditioning in single Cerebellum cells. reply eurekin 10 hours agoparentprevI always assumed ANN simply is a universal and learnable function approximator.

Kohonen self-organizing maps are an example of that.Not that such historical systems are popular today, though. reply h0l0cube 8 hours agoparentprevAt a rough guess, each Purkinje cell is an MLP unto itself, and as the article states, this implies some orders of magnitude more computation for a brain simulation. I also heard something like &#x27;a neuron is an MLP unto itself&#x27; on the Brain Inspired podcast. It&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ve vastly underestimated the processing power of the brain. reply im3w1l 8 hours agoparentprevWell classical conditioning kind of only makes sense in the context of an agent that is receiving inputs and taking actions on them. Many neural networks don&#x27;t solve problems of that type, and so have no need for classical conditioning.But when you do have such a problem conditioning is not very complicated. The normal algorithms and neural structures are designed to learn stuff like \"when a given input happens a certain action must be taken\" and thats all you really need for conditioning. How it actually does it? Well I guess with gradient descent it would work something like this: Every time there is a puff of air the network will be like \"damn I should have blinked to avoid this\" and so it makes its current internal statement a little more likely to lead to blinking. Gradually as it happens more times it will learn a strong association for the ringing bell or whatever.A small RNN could learn this. reply cubefox 59 minutes agorootparentYeah. It&#x27;s just not quite clear what the minimal example for such a network would be. I assume you have N inputs and one output. The output always active when input 1 is active, otherwise the output is inactive. So the other inputs are ignored. However, when one of those other inputs, x, tends to be temporally correlated with input 1, after a while x will generate an output upon activation even if input 1 isn&#x27;t active. If x becomes decorrelated with input 1, x will again get ignored. Not sure what the simplest network architecture looks like that implements this behavior. reply lacrimacida 9 hours agoprevIs cerebellum responsible for muscle memory? reply Balgair 5 hours agoparentNot really, but it can be involved for some tasks. &#x27;Muscle Memory&#x27; is a bit of a complex thing. It&#x27;s not so much the firing of the neurons, as much as it is the timing of that firing. Your reaction time is at the ~5ms level. Much longer than the muscles need to move in concert to, say, hit a 3-pointer. Controlling all of that can take place all the way from the brain down to the ganglia of the spinal chord.

A compliment as to clarity of purpose, I suppose.Materially; That’s bad news for anyone hoping to simulate a brain digitally. It means there’s a lot more relevant stuff to simulate (like the learning that goes on within cells) than the connectionist paradigm of treating each biological neuron like a neural-net “neuron” would imply, and thus the computational requirements of simulating a brain are higher — maybe vastly higher — than connectionists hope.I get where she’s coming from, and she’s not wrong, but it seems like unnecessary detour to dunk on another AI “camp” in the field for drama points and satisfaction - the Marcus Maneuver, if you will. Connectionism isn’t a cult or an institution, it’s a paradigm that emphasis the utility of big nets of interconnected smaller pieces. Any self-avowed connectionist (are there any left?

    "originBody": "Ireland The Gist: Coimisiún na Meán go off the rails The Irish State announced its new plan to build a porn preference register for most of the EU, amongst other mad things. This is the Gist. Simon McGarr Jan 7, 2024 — 4 min read Photo by Karsten Winegeart / Unsplash Let's start with where things stand right now and then go from there. The first thing I should say: this is not a joke. I say that now, because later on, as you're reading the rest of this piece, you're going to keep asking yourself \"Is this some kind of a joke?\" Hence, this helpful reference statement for you to return to repeatedly throughout. This week the Executive Chairman of the new Irish regulator for internet content, Jeremy Godfrey, made himself available for comment to the press to discuss the Coimisiún na Meán (Media Commission) plan to introduce a code of conduct to control how adults would access websites. He outlined the plan set out in page 17 of their Consultation and proposal document to the Irish Examiner. This body regulates content (and in particular video content) for the largest internet companies in the world due to the fact so many of them are based in Ireland. Mr Godfrey suggested that his Commission would require adults and minors (children under 18) to send a copy of their passport to websites- including porn sites- and then, also, send them a live selfie so the porn sites could see what they looked like right now. And then the porn sites would run biometric data processing on those images (details unspecified) to confirm they were over 18. Call this the Nightclub Bouncer plan. This is the national internet regulator proposing that it would require that everyone, adult and children alike, would upload their state ID and live selfies, to porn sites to have biometric processing of their facial images performed. Resulting, amongst other things, in an effective register of porn preferences for adults and a collection of selfies of children kept by the porn sites for six years (required to prove they have complied with the regulation, you see). I refer you now to the top of the newsletter. I am still not joking. 💡 Hey! Good news! This crackpot scheme isn't law yet. And you can do something to stop it. The Commission has extended its time for feedback on this plan to the 31st January 2024. You can just email what you think of it, giving as many reasons why you think it is a bad idea to VSPSregulation@cnam.ie Please do drop them a line, and tell your friends too. But wait! That's not all! The CnaM Executive Chairman wanted to talk about porn sites because that's the least popular class of entities covered by this regulation. But the age-verification requirement actually can cover any video-sharing platform under the jurisdiction of the Irish State (link to the designation notice under section 139E and section 139G of the Broadcasting 2009 Act). That's a list that includes Facebook, WhatsApp, XTwitter and YouTube, just to pick four household names (because of Section 5 of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act 2022). It might also mean homegrown platforms such as Mastodon.ie, the most prominent Irish part of the Fediverse, who also allow videos to be shared. In fact, Section 2 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 (as amended) casts the net wide enough to cover almost anywhere that lets you post a video. In this Act, ‘video-sharing platform service’ means, subject to subsection (3), a service, within the meaning of Articles 56 and 57 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, where— (a) the principal purpose of the service is devoted to, (b) the principal purpose of a dissociable section of the service is devoted to, or (c) an essential functionality of the service is devoted to, providing audiovisual programmes or user-generated videos, or both, by electronic communications networks, to the general public, in order to inform, entertain or educate. Also, these restrictions won't just limit and record access to porn sites. They can be applied to any sites which contains material the Commission decides may be legal, but on the other hand, oughtn't be seen by children. In other countries, this has been the kind of legal provision which has seen libraries restricting access to books involving LGBTQ+ themes, racial justice themes and anything else you could imagine the Burke family objecting to. The exact description of what is to be restricted behind the Commission's Nightclub Bouncer plan is simply 'age-inappropriate content', defined broadly in Section 45 of the Online Safety Act 2023 as \"online content that is likely to be unsuitable for children (either generally or below a particular age), having regard to their capabilities, their development, and their rights and interests\". It goes on to give examples of pornography and acts of violence, but the controls aren't limited to them. This plan goes far beyond the requirement of the EU Audio-visual directive, which the EU Commission suggests \"could be done by the use of PIN codes\". The Commission also points out that the Audio-Visual Directive has no \"restrictions for programmes which might simply be \"harmful\"\". The proposal therefore must be measured against the twin EU law requirements of \"necessity and proportionality\" under the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the GDPR. It fails both tests, of course. If there is an alternative method of meeting the requirement of age restriction (as the European Commission's suggestion of the use of PIN numbers demonstrates) then it fails the test of necessity and cannot be in compliance with EU law. And even if there were no other method, it has to be considered whether creating a distributed database of internet use, including porn preferences, for all EU adults is proportionate to the aim being pursued. Then consider it also requires the additional security risk of sending copies of sensitive personal documents such as passports to platforms such as Elon Musk's X AND also requiring they perform biometric processing of article 9 GDPR facial data of both adults and minors. I think the question of proportionality answers itself by the time you reach the end of that sentence. It is at this point that I feel justified in pointing to my interview on Morning Ireland from 2019, where I warned that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland was the wrong body to put in charge regulating the internet, because it had neither the experience nor understanding of the medium necessary. In creating Coimisiún na Meán the Government did just that. The fresh new regulator is now demonstrating exactly how unfit for this role it is. I take it back. In a way, this is a joke. It just isn't funny. Hello, dear reader. Many thanks for your interest in our first Gist of 2024.

    "commentBody": "Irish State announce plan to build a porn preference register for most of the EUHacker NewspastloginIrish State announce plan to build a porn preference register for most of the EU (thegist.ie) 226 points by cianmm 17 hours ago| hidepastfavorite240 comments hn_throwaway_99 16 hours agoThe topic of ID verification for porn sites has gotten a lot of commentary on HN recently, e.g. North Carolina&#x27;s law requiring ID recently went into effect.Slightly sidestepping the issue of needing an ID for porn in the first place, though, I wanted to comment on the extreme shortsightedness of any sort of ID verification laws (most specifically, financial KYC laws) that require that each individual company verify and store your identity documents themselves. This is quite simply a data breach hackers dream. For example, when Stripe released their Identity product, which captures ID images and selfies, people were at first surprised that the businesses needing ID verification had full access to the ID images (after all, this is contrary to their credit card processing services where businesses never can get access to full credit card numbers, which is great as it keeps those businesses out of the most arduous requirements of PCI rules). But Stripe explained they had to give every end-business access to all the full image data for regulatory compliance reasons.It would make much more sense to rewrite the regulations so that 99% of companies would never need to store identity verification info themselves, but could just delegate that to an approved provider who has much more stringent security checks (or better yet, allow people to cryptographically sign info to prove their identity without giving up their whole passport image, but that&#x27;s a ways off). I&#x27;m not saying this would solve all issues (big companies get hacked, after all), but I hope by now we&#x27;ve put to bed the idea that companies, generally, can secure their data against determined hackers. reply theptip 15 hours agoparentMy thoughts exactly. If the state wants to ensure that ID checks are rigorous (or otherwise monopolize them) they can provide an attestation API for that purpose, and legislate that only tokens signed by a cert trusted by the government’s root are valid.This can be solved in a zero-knowledge way, and the government should commit to open source here. You don’t want the government seeing the sites you visit; the government should just issue a token associating the attestation (age, work status, whatever) with your private key. I think the details end up being non-trivial but it should be doable. reply numtel 14 hours agorootparentYes, the government should provide digital ID services. On my Coinpassport site in the documentation, [0] I make this plea to governments.I&#x27;ve made a testnet version that uses a basic ZK circuit to provide anonymity. [1]There&#x27;s so many holes to my approach though with overlapping renewals, dual citizenship, etc. If governments simply provided this service it would be great.Passport NFC chips get close. [2] They contain the passport data signed and there&#x27;s a project to extract those details into a ZKSNARK proof which is awesome but this doesn&#x27;t prove that the person holding the passport is the person verifying like Stripe Identity does with the photo check. And it requires the nfc reader hardware, but that&#x27;s not too bad for a requirement.Maybe something like risczero could prove that a phone photo matches the passport photo using ZK but it seems like a big project.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinpassport.net&#x2F;docs.html[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;test.coinpassport.net[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2022&#x2F;878.pdf reply AnthonyMouse 10 hours agorootparentHow is this supposed to protect against timing correlation attacks? If each time User 1234 signs into a particular site, Bob Smith requests a token, we know with high probability that Bob Smith is User 1234 (or anyway is using his ID to request tokens).You can solve this by giving the user a generic token that asserts that the bearer is e.g. over 18 and is valid on any site for e.g. 30 days, and then Bob can request arbitrarily many tokens on the first of the month and use them as needed. But now all of this ZK proof stuff is making things unnecessarily complicated, because you could then give every user the same token that expires at the end of 30 days. They&#x27;re fungible and anonymous. Anonymous means you can&#x27;t distinguish one from the other means you don&#x27;t need different users to be different, and then you don&#x27;t have to worry about vulnerabilities in your ZK system.Which leads back to the main problem with this whole mess: All it takes is for one person with an adult ID to share the token. Which is the problem with all of these systems -- most of the population has an ID and they can share access to it. There is no way to catch them or stop them if they&#x27;re actually anonymous. If you could, they wouldn&#x27;t be, and then the system fails as an invasion of privacy. reply numtel 4 hours agorootparentYes, there&#x27;s definitely many scenarios to consider that I&#x27;ve been wondering too about now that I&#x27;ve got it built this way. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s in testnet only.In my zk group scheme, you do get one token for each epoch. (could be 30 days) It&#x27;s simply suggested that you wait as long as possible between joining the group on your main account before minting your token on the anon account.Finding applications for ZK tech is complicated because it only works for such narrow circumstances. Although in your case of \"give every user the same token\" makes the users anonymous to everyone except the issuer. The issuer is still able to know to whom they&#x27;re giving them. With a ZK proof, the bearer instead mints the token by proving that they are one from the set of people the issuer has verified. The issuer cannot then break the privacy.As for mitigating people sharing their tokens, of course that&#x27;s always a fear but I think mitigation strategies would be unique to each application&#x27;s use case. reply AnthonyMouse 17 minutes agorootparent> In my zk group scheme, you do get one token for each epoch. (could be 30 days) It&#x27;s simply suggested that you wait as long as possible between joining the group on your main account before minting your token on the anon account.I&#x27;m not sure this is the same thing. What I was suggesting is that the token you get doesn&#x27;t depend on the site you&#x27;re using it on at all. All you do is ask the government for a token and they give you one and you can use it anywhere you want for 30 days and then it expires and you ask for more.If the tokens are unique to you then you&#x27;d have to request a bunch of them because you don&#x27;t want to use the same one twice on two different sites. If everybody had the same one then that wouldn&#x27;t matter because the token can&#x27;t identify any particular user.> Although in your case of \"give every user the same token\" makes the users anonymous to everyone except the issuer. The issuer is still able to know to whom they&#x27;re giving them.But this is solved by making the token entirely generic.The problem we have is that Bob wants to visit an adult site without associating that with his social security number. If all Bob does is request the generic token which is the same for everyone and asserts that anybody who has it is an adult, the issuer knows that Bob requested it, but not if Bob has a kink or is buying a beer or is just requesting a token on the off chance he might need one later or is applying for a job at a casino or is hiring for a job at a casino, since this system is so simple the way you verify the token is by requesting it yourself and comparing the one the user submitted to see if it&#x27;s the same one. It&#x27;s literally just a single secret password for everyone that the government changes once a month and only gives out to adults.> As for mitigating people sharing their tokens, of course that&#x27;s always a fear but I think mitigation strategies would be unique to each application&#x27;s use case.It&#x27;s not clear how you&#x27;re supposed to mitigate it in this case.Suppose Bob hates this system and wants to destroy it because it blocks adults without a valid ID from accessing lawful content, e.g. because they&#x27;re from another country. So Bob hooks up his own valid ID to a server via Tor and configures it to sign any request for age verification from anyone.Now there two possibilities. One, the system can find out who Bob is and shut him down, which proves that it doesn&#x27;t protect your anonymity, is a massive invasion of privacy, and must be destroyed. Two, there is actually no way to identify Bob, and then the system has been destroyed by Bob. reply theptip 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah the hard case to solve is “prove it’s stillthat is generating the challenge”.With GenAI I wonder if images will be considered valid ID for long. “Generate a new video of face with camera pan” is currently hard (not impossible) to forge, but I doubt it will be in a year or two.You get back to multifactor auth, but then the system is more stateful, and still, what is the incentive not to share your ID & password with underage friends?(These challenges will also be faced with the OP’s scheme as well.) reply stevenicr 11 hours agorootparentprev\"can be solved in a zero-knowledge way\" - absolute zero?I am curious how this would work - for example I want to check someone&#x27;s ID, how could I take a pic with a phone and run it to prove it&#x27;s real - but the gov have no idea that I ran the ID check?Wouldn&#x27;t their system know that I, my ip, browser fingerprint, checked ID X at y:yy time and likely the location?I have a great app idea that would be useful if there really is a way to check these things zero knowledge. reply landgenoot 11 hours agorootparentBiometric passport chip.All data on your passport can be read using NFC and is signed with a government key.It even has cryptographic functions to test if you are talking to a real passport (to prevent replay attacks) reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparentIf each ID has its own signature, the signature can be used to uniquely identify the ID. reply orwin 14 hours agorootparentprev> This can be solved in a zero-knowledge way, and the government should commit to open source here.This is what France&#x27;s government is working on if i understand correctly what i&#x27;m hearing (i&#x27;m working for the private sector right now, so i&#x27;m not as well informed as i should be on those kind of things).

If the device is designated a kids device by some means, websites can ensure no adult content gets transmitted and their data isn&#x27;t mined for ads. reply layer8 14 hours agorootparentAnd malicious sites can decide that the user is a promising target for grooming or scamming, etc. reply _0ffh 13 hours agorootparentThese could easily be ferreted out by synthetic agents scouring the internet and posing as kids. reply stuartjohnson12 14 hours agorootparentprevCould you give an example of such an attack that is intractable in the status quo? reply swells34 13 hours agorootparentWell, currently ads can be targeted using user agents.

I get the impression the Anglosphere has an anti-ID card tradition so it seems like it&#x27;s a bit behind in that. reply reaperducer 16 hours agorootparentThe anti-ID sentiment comes from looking back on history, and not pretending that the future can only be better.People who don&#x27;t know history repeat its mistakes. reply lxgr 15 hours agorootparentGermany is extremely focused on that aspect of history and even used to have laws [1] in the books prohibiting anything SSN-like for many years. Yet German ID cards have a built-in contactless chip that allows using them for online identity verification and e-signing.This is obviously more secure than taking a photo of an analog ID as an \"online identity proof\" (a somewhat absurd idea if you think about it, yet it&#x27;s the state of the art in most countries today). But if done correctly (and I do realize that this is a very big if), it even be more privacy-preserving too:For example, when trying to prove your age to a website, the only thing that site really should have to learn is the fact whether you were born more or less than a certain number of days ago. Not your date of birth, not your name, and certainly not a picture of your face or any other biometric data.Digital ID can do that (e.g. by asking the secure chip \"Is the accountholder born before $date? If so, please sign this challenge using a key shared among all ID cards\" or something equivalent). Analog ID requires you to reveal strictly more information than that to a service provider and hope for the best.[1] Technically a supreme court opinion reply cardanome 15 hours agorootparentI have used the e-signing function of my German ID card exactly zero times.Even government websites don&#x27;t support it for the stuff I would like to use it. So it isn&#x27;t exactly a success story. reply lxgr 15 hours agorootparentTrue, it does seem to be suffering from a chicken-and-egg type of problem: Not enough services accept it, so not enough people actually remember the PIN and care to install the app necessary to use it.But now that both iOS and Android phones can be used as \"card readers\", I hope we should finally be seeing some more adoption. Before that, almost nobody had a card reader handy when they needed one.The EU&#x27;s eIDAS digital ID&#x2F;signature portability scheme should also help boost it. reply usrusr 10 hours agorootparentI went through four different use cases in the last two months or so, about 1.5 of them not the state. I&#x27;d say the chicken&#x2F;egg phase is over. But it won&#x27;t be an everyday tool anytime soon, but the same is true for the physical ID, its not like you need to show it around all too often. reply hnaccount_rng 13 hours agorootparentprevI’ve used it for your Rentenübersicht (which is actually amazing) and Elster. But yeah, it’s not really deployed reply hnaccount_rng 13 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately the eID system is neither well communicated nor widely used. Which really is a pity. It’s (at least in principle) quite well thought out. You get clearly shown who’s asking for which information. Then you present the ID to the phone, enter your PIN and only that information gets provided. In principle this would allow for a blind “are you old enough?” check without ever touching the actual data.But of course while this is a relatively simple game of signatures and certificates and (afaik) safe and secure it is basically impossible to communicate what exactly is provided at which point in a manner that is understandable let alone trustable by the general public. And the workflow requires you to provide the PIN twice, which is nice (it’s not cached) but also annoying reply amaccuish 15 hours agorootparentprevTo add to this, the AusweisApp in Germany shows what information you&#x27;re sharing to a website and asks you to confirm its ok reply FranchuFranchu 15 hours agorootparentprevThis idea (\"I&#x27;m against IDs because I fear what they&#x27;ll do with it\") is really interesting to me, because in my country (Argentina) a large part of the national pro-ID sentiment comes from looking back on our own history and attempting to prevent some of the human rights abuses that were committed in our country.The last dictatorship tried to erase dissident&#x27;s identities, kidnapped their children and erased their links with their previous family. As a consequence, Argentina now has a \"Right to Identity\" enshrined into our Constitution and deeply ingrained into our society and culture. reply philwelch 13 hours agorootparentHow do you imagine registering your identities with the government is going to protect you from the government? reply asadotzler 5 hours agorootparentsafeguards. how do you imagine anything secure works at all anywhere? replydragonwriter 16 hours agoparentprev> This is quite simply a data breach hackers dreamThat&#x27;s... well, not the point of the laws, but inseparable from them; the point is to build a database (distributed, when the information isn&#x27;t also reported to the government at time of collection) which the government can access at need; reply mulmen 15 hours agorootparentThat’s just a bad design though.

The same way we do, well, everything.That it isn’t designed this way shows the incompetence of the regulators and their disregard for public safety and free society.And hopefully it doesn’t need to be pointed out but none of this actually protects children.

Some sort of federated system where a business could delegate KYC responsibilities to a respected provider (which is exactly analogous to how Stripe-like credit card processing works) would make a lot more sense. reply mulmen 15 hours agorootparentprevFor porn production you need KYC.

Serious criminals use shell corporations, fake or stolen identities, hire patsies, use precious metals or physical cash, foreign banking systems, cryptocurrencies, Hawala, etc. The effectiveness of KYC rules is abysmal, to the point that we could abolish them and hardly notice any effect on crime.

Instead, my children asked me to protect them from disturbing content sometimes. (So I did, setting up an age filter on YouTube.)Most of the time, unless you yourself don&#x27;t eat snickers bars non-stop while chain-smoking, your children won&#x27;t, too. Children do what their parents do, not what their parents tell them to do. reply James_K 15 hours agorootparentprevI agree somewhat. Ideally, the internet wouldn&#x27;t be addictive at all, and hence wouldn&#x27;t be an issue for children or adults. A whitelist seems reasonable for the current state of the internet, but I can&#x27;t think of anything beyond Wikipedia that you could put on it. That said, you still run into the more fundamental issue of what exactly is adult content? Violence, gore, and gambling certainly, though I&#x27;m not sure casinos should be legal at all. But I struggle to justify it for porn. It&#x27;s probably more healthy for children to have access to some kind of pornography. reply buu700 14 hours agorootparentprevThat might actually be the lesser evil here. There could be a new category of \"kid-friendly\" devices which require parental unlock to (temporarily) access the open Internet, either in general or outside of a government-approved whitelist. Such a whitelist might include things like YouTube Kids, kid-friendly subsets of app stores &#x2F; package repositories, reputable news sources, informational and educational sources, and filtered versions of search engines.Then there&#x27;s the enforcement model to consider. Maybe it&#x27;s just an option consumers have available for purchase at their own discretion. Or maybe vendors would be banned from knowingly selling non-kid-friendly devices to minors, and&#x2F;or parents would be banned from allowing their kids to own non-kid-friendly devices.If this is the direction society wants to go in, it shouldn&#x27;t impose on anyone other than parents and children. Current legislation and proposals narrowly target one specific use case (porn), and do so in a kludgy way that&#x27;s effectively just banning its use without a VPN. Instead, this approach would provide a general framework for filtering kids&#x27; interaction with technology.For example, some states might use it to ban social media and AI chatbots for children, at least in their current forms. I could imagine an alternative AI chatbot service being allowed which shared the history with parents and teachers, so as to deter cheating, and to provide an opportunity for human adults to add context or corrections to any misinformation. I could also imagine allowing more limited social networks that segregated schools or classes into their own private bubbles, wiped content at the end of each school year, blocked posting images&#x2F;videos without parental approval, used uncomplicated news feed algorithms, and gave teachers and staff reddit-style moderation power.Personally, I&#x27;m not sure how much I like this, vs simply leaving the parenting to parents. Maybe it would be less bad than alternatives, but it&#x27;s also dangerously close to a ban on general-purpose computing[1]. We&#x27;d have to remain vigilant to ensure that governments didn&#x27;t use it as a foothold to start cracking down on adults&#x27; use of computers and the Internet in the future.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boingboing.net&#x2F;2012&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;lockdown.html reply bbor 15 hours agoparentprevnext [–]Parents can easily control which parts of the internet their kids have access toCitation needed - I think most American kids (sorry Ireland) are pretty much unrestricted on the internet by their tweens, since most parents buy them smartphones but don’t know how to do meaningful browser lockdowns.Re:”naked people”, I think that’s doing disservice to the proponents of these controls (who I vehemently disagree with, ofc); the modern porn landscape has problems with non-consensual videos (see: Pornhub & GDP), extreme content (violence, CNC), and really harmful stereotypes about gender roles.

That&#x27;s not all! The CnaM Executive Chairman wanted to talk about porn sites because that&#x27;s the least popular class of entities covered by this regulation. But the age-verification requirement actually can cover any video-sharing platform under the jurisdiction of the Irish State (link to the designation notice under section 139E and section 139G of the Broadcasting 2009 Act). That&#x27;s a list that includes Facebook, WhatsApp, XTwitter and YouTube, just to pick four household names (because of Section 5 of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act 2022). It might also mean homegrown platforms such as Mastodon.ie, the most prominent Irish part of the Fediverse, who also allow videos to be shared....> Also, these restrictions won&#x27;t just limit and record access to porn sites. They can be applied to any sites which contains material the Commission decides may be legal, but on the other hand, oughtn&#x27;t be seen by children. In other countries, this has been the kind of legal provision which has seen libraries restricting access to books involving LGBTQ+ themes, racial justice themes and anything else you could imagine the Burke family objecting to.Protecting children is the emotional wedge for introducing age verification requirements. Video sites are the wedge into all internet sites. The legislators&#x27; emphasis on porn is a wedge into any speech (including otherwise legal speech) the government claims is harmful for children. That government-mandated age verification would protect children is an assumption, full of uncertainty of the beneficial first-order effects and full of ignorance (willful blindness?) of the obvious detrimental second-order effects. Mandatory age verification requires mandatory data collection, and strangers are going to read that data: some first-party websites will be forced to collect more information than they currently do; third-party websites involved in the collection and verification processes will collect data as well; and the government will get information about the citizens&#x27; internet habits from websites. Adults will lose their privacy because people who have no business knowing their internet habits will know them.Children will lose their privacy, and more. They will grow up learning that it&#x27;s normal to give their personal information (including but not limited to relatively immutable biological details such as faceprints) to strangers. They will grow up learning that it&#x27;s normal for the government to know every website a person visits online. The offline analogue is for the government to know every building a person visits offline. No matter how noble the current government&#x27;s current intentions may be, a stranger has by default no right to know that much about a person&#x27;s life.Movie theatres can show childrens&#x27; films and adult films. The movie theatre doesn&#x27;t have to store anything about age other than \"minor\" and \"adult\". Libraries and bookstores can contain childrens&#x27; books and adult books. Malls contain stores for many audiences. Clothing stores have sections for children&#x27;s clothes, modest adult clothes, and risque adult clothes. You know what the normal way for a child to visit many such buildings is? A caretaker (maybe a parent, but not every child has a parent) brings the child and supervises. On the other side of the equation, it would not be normal for a mall to collect people&#x27;s ages at the mall entrance (the adult-only stores inside being a different story).A website should have the option to verify age, and the alternative option to require no more than a self-reported \"are you at least 18? yes no\". Government-mandated age verification is burdensome to small websites, especially small platforms for user-generated content. If a website could choose to remove potentially harmful content instead of verifying age, then the burden would still be too large for small websites. Might as well not host user-generated content at all. Large internet companies like Google and Facebook would eat the costs either way. Small websites would have to rely on third-party age verification services. Software for age verification will be predominantly proprietary or not available to the general netizen or both, so the average person won&#x27;t be able to know how much information the websites collect and store. What&#x27;s more, lawyers and judges in privacy-related or accuracy-related court cases (especially regarding biometric verification) will have a hard time examining the software.Making every website collect information the way a bank does is applying a hammer to problems that are not nails. Don&#x27;t make the entire internet a bank. And as Mike Masnick wrote, \"The Internet Is Not Disneyland; People Should Stop Demanding It Become Disneyland\" [1]. \"Are you at least 18? yes no\" paired with proper parenting&#x2F;caretaking can go a long way. Proper caretaking is not simply knowing what the child does on the internet. It&#x27;s knowing that the child might visit the internet while the caretaker is occupied. It&#x27;s teaching the child early on that not all websites are for children. It&#x27;s setting up parental controls while understanding that parental controls are imperfect, like one slice of Swiss cheese [2]. You are a Swiss cheese layer. By teaching your child what to do if they stumble upon the wrong websites, you will be turning your child from a hula hoop into their own Swiss cheese layer. When you find out that your child stumbled upon porn, you can talk to your child about the incident. As a caretaker, damage control is a necessary part of determining healthy boundaries. Additionally, I don&#x27;t expect the damage to a younger child from accidentally viewing porn to be as proportionately severe as the damage to an under-21 college freshman from drinking alcohol at a party. You can&#x27;t talk brain damage from drugs out of someone. But I&#x27;m assuming that you can talk the harm from an accidental porn incident out of your child.I like the idea posed by mjevans [3] to make websites respond to a self-reported \"kid mode\" - as a header in a web request, I presume - by redirecting to a child-friendly site. Websites could also respond by serving only content manually confirmed to be child-safe according to the website&#x27;s interpretation of the law&#x27;s definition of child-safe. As part of supporting the \"kid mode\" header, the website would have to respond with a \"kid mode\" confirmed. Parental controls on the device would include the \"kid mode\" header in all web requests whenever kid mode is on. If the website doesn&#x27;t return the \"kid mode confirmed\" header then the parental controls can cancel the website visit. Adults would simply leave kid mode off for themselves. The burden on websites (learning how to send a 301 redirect status code at the simplest) would very low, and would avoid the data collection and other privacy problems of age verification.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;09&#x2F;20&#x2F;the-internet-is-not-disn...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Swiss_cheese_model[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38903965 reply bArray 14 hours agoprev> The Irish State announced [..]It&#x27;s interesting how quickly the EU went from a Trade Union to a Government consisting of states. reply motohagiography 15 hours agoprevThere is no reasoning with these people.

Even though the vax is considered the \"ultimate cisc\" I wondered if its cleanliness and nice instruction set still could be implemented efficient enough. Well, the only way to know would be to try to implement it :-) I had an 15-year-old demo board with a small low-end FPGA (Xilinx XC3S400), so I just had to learn Verilog and try to implement something.

Photo of the \"vax\": https://www.ludd.ltu.se/~ragge/pics/IMG_0837.jpg I had to get a new FPGA board, since I started to get bit errors on the old one, so I bought a chinese board with essentially the same FPGA (XC3S500E): I have implemented all addressing modes, the interrupt hierarchy, timers, and 151 instructions. No memory management yet though, but that should be quite straight-forward. Currently it uses about 70% of available FPGA resources, which is around 6000 LUTs (which is quite inefficient implemented, since I have learned how to do verilog programming while writing the code...)

Downright simple and straightforward in comparison.Somewhere along the lines of the development of high-level languages, \"tedious and semi-unmanageable\" got replaced with \"difficult\". Assembler isn&#x27;t difficult, nor is it meant to be; any emulator or embedded developer could tell you this. Assembler just has few tools to ease development&#x2F;code structuring and gets very flat and overwhelming in large code-bases; these are the problems C&#x2F;C++, Pascal, Algol, etc were designed to solve. reply RagnarD 7 hours agorootparentIndividual assembly instructions are basically trivial to grasp (the actual syntax is probably the hardest part.) The challenge is synthesizing larger, useful programs from the little tidbits of data manipulation. It&#x27;s a great exercise in bottom-up hierarchical integration. As deaddodo notes, this is why higher level languages were developed, to raise conscious focus away from having to use such tiny primitives. reply LeFantome 12 hours agorootparentprevWe are probably agreeing but Pascal at least was explicitly designed to allow and to teach “structured” programming. In some ways, it is designed to limit your options. Their is no denying though that it makes code easier to read and also makes intent much clearer. This in turn makes not just creating but of course maintaining and extending large code based much easier.In terms of complexity, it depends on how you measure. In assembler, it does not take long to learn how to compare and jump. That gives you the power of while, do&#x2F;while, for, if&#x2F;then, and of course “goto” ( which your “more advanced” language may lack ). I would argue though that it is easier to understand the syntax of if &#x2F; else than the equivalent assembler. Again, if not easier to write, it is at least more obvious when reading ( for less experienced eyes ). reply deaddodo 8 hours agorootparentWell, we&#x27;re not disagreeing. Your first paragraph is basically just a summation of my point while the second paragraph reiterates it.

Yes, the language spec has become complicated. But you don&#x27;t have to use every single feature in the language. As the slogan goes, if you don&#x27;t use it, you don&#x27;t pay for it.I find that the style I like best is what John Carmack calls \"C flavored C++\". To me this means plain structs and functions, references instead of pointers when appropriate, and conservative use of: templates, constexpr, operator overloading, strings, vectors, threads, and synchronization primitives. This subset of the language is relatively easy to learn and pleasant to use. Still, I will have no problem jumping ship to one of the newer C++ replacement languages when one that I like becomes mature enough. reply creer 5 hours agorootparentYears ago, when I considered C++ (and discarded it), it seemed that it was hard to write C++ without understanding most of the features. Let&#x27;s not argue about THAT. But is there now an accepted small subset that can stand alone as a first layer of study and usage? Giving a real understanding of that subset and being able to write in that subset? Any text describes this?This idea of layers in learning a language seems fundamental to me - (Perl 5 was - still is - amazing for that. Perl 6 &#x2F; Raku is great but it lost that.) reply quietbritishjim 15 hours agoparentprevMore powerful tools are often more complex to learn. A car has more controls than a push bike, and an aeroplane has more still. I&#x27;m not saying all the complexity in C++ is justified (!!!) but it&#x27;s not too much of a surprise that it&#x27;s more complex to learn than assembler. reply dark-star 10 hours agorootparentIf you use C++ like an assembler, then it&#x27;s not complicated. You only use functions, loops, arrays and structs. And GOTOs.Congratulations you now have replicated what an assembler can do, but it has become much easier (you don&#x27;t have to remember details of the architecture, memory layout, etc.)But C++ puts a lot of syntactical sugar (abstractions) on top that, if you learn and understand them, can help you write even more concise and expressive code. This is where complexity comes in. Higher abstraction brings complexity. Whether that is good or bad depends on your knowledge of the language&#x2F;concepts. reply joshu 13 hours agoparentprevhow many addressing modes are there? in my mind, CISC vs RISC is more about the vast array of addressing modes on CISC vs load&#x2F;store on RISC, rather than the actual size of the ISAprobably worth comparing to early MIPS or SPARC instead of modern ARM with extensions? reply kragen 11 hours agorootparentagreed. in the end it turned out what mattered about risc was that they reduced the instructions, so each one did less, not the setmashey&#x27;s famous retrospective on the vax and cisc vs. risc is at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yarchive.net&#x2F;comp&#x2F;vax.html reply tux1968 11 hours agorootparentFor whatever reason, the PDF that is linked in that email, is temporarily unavailable, so here&#x27;s an archived link:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20160312012246&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.mip... reply kragen 10 hours agorootparentthank you reply cmrdporcupine 11 hours agorootparentprevExactly, it&#x27;s not about the amount of instructions but of the modes those instructions can take.

The VAX-11 instruction comes with examples in a high-level programming language (COBOL, FORTRAN or PL&#x2F;1) and how that translates into the VAX-11 instructions, e.g.:COBOL: 01 A-ARRAY. 02 A PIC X(10) OCCURS 15 TIMES. 01 B PIC X(10).

    "originBody": "The immediate victims of the con would rather act as if the con never happened. Instead, they’re mad at the outsiders who showed them that they were being fooled. Posted on January 7, 2024 9:55 AM by Andrew Dorothy Bishop has the story about “a chemistry lab in CNRS-Université Sorbonne Paris Nord”: More than 20 scientific articles from the lab of one principal investigator have been shown to contain recycled and doctored graphs and electron microscopy images. That is, results from different experiments that should have distinctive results are illustrated by identical figures, with changes made to the axis legends by copying and pasting numbers on top of previous numbers. . . . the problematic data are well-documented in a number of PubPeer comments on the articles (see links in Appendix 1 of this document). The response by CNRS [Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique] to this case . . . was to request correction rather than retraction of what were described as “shortcomings and errors”, to accept the scientist’s account that there was no intentionality, despite clear evidence of a remarkable amount of manipulation and reuse of figures; a disciplinary sanction of exclusion from duties was imposed for just one month. I’m not surprised. The sorts of people who will cheat on their research are likely to be the same sorts of people who will instigate lawsuits, start media campaigns, and attack in other ways. These are researchers who’ve already shown a lack of scruple and a willingness to risk their careers; in short, they’re loose cannons, scary people, so it can seem like the safest strategy to not try to upset them too much, not trap them into a corner where they’ll fight like trapped rats. I’m not speaking specifically of this CNRS researcher—I know nothing of the facts of this case beyond what’s reported in Bishop’s post—I’m just speaking to the mindset of the academic administrators who would just like the problem to go away so they can get on with their regular jobs. But Bishop and her colleagues were annoyed. If even blatant examples of scientific misconduct cannot be handled straightforwardly, what does this say about the academic and scientific process more generally? Is science just a form of social media, where people can make any sort of claim and evidence doesn’t matter? They write: So what should happen when fraud is suspected? We propose that there should be a prompt investigation, with all results transparently reported. Where there are serious errors in the scientific record, then the research articles should immediately be retracted, any research funding used for fraudulent research should be returned to the funder, and the person responsible for the fraud should not be allowed to run a research lab or supervise students. The whistleblower should be protected from repercussions. In practice, this seldom happens. Instead, we typically see, as in this case, prolonged and secret investigations by institutions, journals and/or funders. There is a strong bias to minimize the severity of malpractice, and to recommend that published work be “corrected” rather than retracted. Bishop and her colleagues continue: One can see why this happens. First, all of those concerned are reluctant to believe that researchers are dishonest, and are more willing to assume that the concerns have been exaggerated. It is easy to dismiss whistleblowers as deluded, overzealous or jealous of another’s success. Second, there are concerns about reputational risk to an institution if accounts of fraudulent research are publicised. And third, there is a genuine risk of litigation from those who are accused of data manipulation. So in practice, research misconduct tends to be played down. But: This failure to act effectively has serious consequences: 1. It gives credibility to fictitious results, slowing down the progress of science by encouraging others to pursue false leads. . . . [and] erroneous data pollutes the databases on which we depend. 2. Where the research has potential for clinical or commercial application, there can be direct damage to patients or businesses. 3. It allows those who are prepared to cheat to compete with other scientists to gain positions of influence, and so perpetuate further misconduct, while damaging the prospects of honest scientists who obtain less striking results. 4. It is particularly destructive when data manipulation involves the Principal Investigator of a lab. . . . CNRS has a mission to support research training: it is hard to see how this can be achieved if trainees are placed in a lab where misconduct occurs. 5. It wastes public money from research grants. 6. It damages public trust in science and trust between scientists. 7. It damages the reputation of the institutions, funders, journals and publishers associated with the fraudulent work. 8. Whistleblowers, who should be praised by their institution for doing the right thing, are often made to feel that they are somehow letting the side down by drawing attention to something unpleasant. . . . What happened next? It’s the usual bad stuff. They receive a series of stuffy bureaucratic responses, none of which address any of items 1 through 8 above, let alone the problem of the data which apparently have obviously been faked. Just disgusting. But I’m not surprised. We’ve seen it many times before: – The University of California’s unresponsive response when informed of research misconduct by their star sleep expert. – The American Political Science Association refusing to retract an award given to an author for a book with plagiarized material, or even to retroactively have the award shared with the people whose material was copied without acknowledgment. – The London Times never acknowledging the blatant and repeated plagiarism by its celebrity chess columnist. – The American Statistical Association refusing to retract an award given to a professor who plagiarized multiple times, including from wikipedia (in an amusing case where he created negative value by introducing an error into the material he’d copied, so damn lazy that he couldn’t even be bothered to proofread his pasted material). – Cornell University . . . ok they finally canned the pizzagate dude, but only after emitting some platitudes. Kind of amazing that they actually moved on that one. – The Association for Psychological Science: this one’s personal for me, as they ran an article that flat-out lied about me and then refused to correct it just because, hey, they didn’t want to. – Lots and lots of examples of people finding errors or fraud in published papers and journals refusing to run retractions or corrections or even to publish letters pointing out what went wrong. Anyway, this is one more story. What gets my goat What really annoys me in these situations is how the institutions show loyalty to the people who did research misconduct. When researcher X works at or publishes with institution Y, and it turns out that X did something wrong, why does Y so often try to bury the problem and attack the messenger? Y should be mad at X; after all, it’s X who has leveraged the reputation of Y for his personal gain. I’d think that the leaders of Y would be really angry at X, even angrier than people from the outside. But it doesn’t happen that way. The immediate victims of the con would rather act as if the con never happened. Instead, they’re mad at the outsiders who showed them that they were being fooled. I’m sure that Dan Davies would have something to say about all this. This entry was posted in Miscellaneous Science, Sociology, Zombies by Andrew. Bookmark the permalink.",

In retrospect, it all sounds ridiculous... but in the moment, with kids in tow, it was very convincing. It was so traumatizing that when it was over and she finally realized it was a scam, she was relieved! They had convinced her she was going to jail and that was terrifying. Losing the money was less bad than going to jail.It was also EXTREMELY well scripted with a TON of psychology and clever moments that were well rehearsed. They also had a background track playing with &#x27;police station like&#x27; audio and had spoofed the Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s phone number. One psychological trick that they employed was a very &#x27;stepped&#x27; approach to the scam.If you say it all out loud, it is obvious, but if you go step by step, each one was somewhat plausible. Lastly, by posing as law enforcement, they tugged on a natural tendency to follow orders and avoid being in trouble. My stomach drops when I think I am getting pulled over... being told you have an outstanding warrant was quite a gut punch for her.Things to remember:* ALWAYS hang up and call people on a phone number you enter yourself.* If someone tells you to check the number by looking it up, they are very likely spoofing it. Hang up and call the police.* The police don&#x27;t call you if they are trying to serve a warrant, they show up.* A judge&#x27;s &#x27;gag order&#x27; does not mean you can&#x27;t talk to a family member or legal counsel.* NEVER pull money out of an account for someone you don&#x27;t know without talking to a friend or spouse.* ANY change in the situation is a red flag - bring the money to the courthouse. - its getting late, we use an after hours processor - you are running out of time, just wire it reply MobileVet 11 hours agoparentThis scam is pretty active right now.

I largely don&#x27;t care about. I understand why it&#x27;s super important for academics, but in my book it&#x27;s not a con or scam. It&#x27;s accurate information.This is not correct on a few levels, at least in the context of science. At the most basic, you&#x27;re engaging in circular reasoning. You&#x27;re accepting it&#x27;s \"accurate information\" as a truism when the point of science is to discover what is actually \"accurate information\" in the absence of any oracles. Someone who is plagiarizing doesn&#x27;t actually know whether what they&#x27;re plagiarizing is accurate or not, by definition they haven&#x27;t done the work. They don&#x27;t know how it all connects together, and not only might what they&#x27;re copying be wrong, they&#x27;re more likely to introduce errors of context and omit qualifiers.Tying into that is the issue of meta-information as well. One of the core foundations of science and assessing whether information is accurate or not is replication. A second&#x2F;third&#x2F;fourth&#x2F;etc researcher independently reaching even 100% identical results is itself new information each time, even if conclusion is the same. More independent replication raises the chance of signal and decreases the chance that it was noise, some unaccounted for variables unique to a given lab or researcher. Everyone makes mistakes, but even with zero mistakes low probability things can happen in any single given experiment&#x2F;study&#x2F;place. Diverse distributed replication is a basic way to help discover&#x2F;dismiss that.A plagiarist in research is therefore, at a bare minimum, always engaged in a con&#x2F;scam: they&#x27;re claiming they have independently produced a result, which then adds to the weight and other people will be more likely to depend on. They have not.Of course, they&#x27;ve also conned&#x2F;scammed whatever money&#x2F;time&#x2F;resources anyone else contributed to them with the expectation of independent work and thus at a minimum new replication information. They took that, and then didn&#x27;t follow through. It&#x27;s fraud. And there is opportunity cost there since those are a zero-sum game, the resources that went to funding a plagiarist could have instead gone to fund someone honest who could produce something with actual ROI as expected. reply DonsDiscountGas 7 hours agorootparentEvery single case of plagiarism can be fixed with some combination of quotation marks, proper citations, and rephrasing of relevant text. It is never a claim to have independently reproduced a result.If a scientist claims to have independently reproduced an experimental result - and they haven&#x27;t - that is outright fraud. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they describe that experiment in original words, with proper citations and quotation marks&#x2F;blocks. reply lupire 8 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re making a lot of assumptions about the nature of the plagiarized content.If plagiarizing is bad because the copied info might be wrong, then original research is bad because it might be wrong. reply xoa 7 hours agorootparent>If plagiarizing is bad because the copied info might be wrong, then original research is bad because it might be wrong.No, that&#x27;s not what I wrote at all. Original honest research might be wrong and that&#x27;s completely fine and understood, that&#x27;s the entire point of replication! But if someone lies and says they&#x27;ve independently replicated it when they just plagiarized that&#x27;s fraud and wrong. Telling the world original research has been replicated when it hasn&#x27;t been is different then a tentative first result. Depending on the area nobody else may then attempt replication for awhile, assuming it&#x27;s already been done and instead waste resources trying to build upon it only to later discover it was wrong. The original team has also been robbed of independent review they may have otherwise gotten, and themselves move on only to much later have the rug pulled out from under them. Depending on the nature of what caused the original research to be incorrect it may have further ripple effects. Say some piece of equipment or new instrument has some subtle flaw that a true replication attempt would have discovered, but instead it then keeps getting used and causing other experiments to go off.And this is all in the generous case where the plagiarist does at least pretend to have the same result as what they&#x27;re copying, vs hacking it into something else and generating total garbage completely. reply Aurornis 7 hours agoprevThese situations reveal the true preference toward status over accuracy: People would rather make an effort to preserve their status than to admit having made a mistake.There are domains where playing games like this will cause you to lose even more status.However, there are other domains where being loud and denying reality can actually preserve your status: If people are too tired, afraid, or avoidant to challenge the denial then eventually it becomes more or less accepted fact. This is a common feature of toxic work environments, where denying facts or trying to dictate reality can actually work in someone’s favor because the cost of disagreeing with that person is too high.You see this in bad CEOs who get caught in scandals and then think they can talk their way out of it by writing flowery statements and going on social media to respin the story.

And once that happens the prospect for legit corrective action is largely gone. In-fighting will dominate.Clues that maybe something is off (not exhaustive) based on some guys I worked with a few years ago:* The boss talks with team individuals only then brings the team together to report what everybody said, and what everybody agreed to. Actually, no individual knows what anyone else said and didn&#x27;t have a chance to ask questions.* You&#x27;re afraid to bring something up, or notice privately team members complain or share concerns but never say anything to decision makers or in a team setting* You&#x27;re encouraged to make changes because of \"reputation,\" team image or other nebulous sounding reasons. Change may indeed need to happen. But those are not reasons* You&#x27;re instructed to remain technical to not engage or discuss issues that seem more pertinent to management, organizational values. Being boxed in is a bad sign.* Being brow beat into doing things out of guilt or entitlement are bad signs.* Putting internal politics or good light on the boss&#x27; project ahead of customer satisfaction even though the work will not satisfy intended customers is a bad sign.* Abusing through manipulation internal service supplier status is bad. One guy I knew slickly sold his team&#x27;s capability knowing once tied in they were practically married. The code was implemented such that the customer had no insight or control to it. By running around the floor and vacuuming up as many internal teams as he could, he parlayed his position to \"take over the floor, but taking over the data.\" Guess what? It failed in a spectacular fashion; he never took over control of that system and never gave his \"customers\" a better solution. He treated his customers as suckers.* The above point has a corollary: internal service suppliers get implicit management support, and it&#x27;s implied internal customers have no choice but to work with them. This is NOT how it works on the outside. I choose my roofer and if I am not happy payment may not be given or is disputed or I fire the roofer. The hole in my roof is my motivation to treat the roofer right. My checkbook is why the roofer needs to treat me right. Either can walk away if the other is a jerk. But not in large corporations. That&#x27;s why, for example, deprecating private data centers for the cloud are horror shows. The internal service suppliers are used to being in charge even entitled no matter how crappy or expensive their service is. And when they find out they might be replaced, they fight it all the way.See:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;What-Total-Quality-Control-Japanese&#x2F;d...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Human-Element-Productivity-Self-Estee...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;FIRO-Three-Dimensional-Theory-Interpe...and any work from Deming, Crosby, or Drucker which do far better at integrating business, profit, people, and customers. reply TrackerFF 8 hours agoprevYeah, I&#x27;ve seen this twice in person.A friend (he was experiencing psychosis, so that played a big part) fell prey to some bog-standard love scam when some bot added him on facebook.

I can false cut. Tricks with my hands to &#x27;do nothing&#x27;s with a deck even though it looks like I&#x27;m shuffling or cutting the deck.When we get to truly skilled magicians, they can perfect shuffle (IIRC, 8x rifle shuffles in a row with perfect precision returns the deck to it&#x27;s original state). They can perfect cut (two cuts that return the deck to the original state). And they can therefore look like they&#x27;re shuffling, when in fact they&#x27;re just leaving the deck in the same state the whole time (or at least they have a plan to return the deck back to it&#x27;s original state later on).There&#x27;s also hidden cuts and hidden shuffles. To change the deck even though it didn&#x27;t look like anything happens.So if I perfect cut a deck, say a silly story to you, then hidden perfect cut the deck back to it&#x27;s original state, the audience probably doesn&#x27;t realize their chosen cards remain on the top of the deck. (Even if they spot the second hidden cut, they likely don&#x27;t realize the importance of it)----------I did this once or twice (try) to pass out like 4x Royal Flushes on Poker night to prove a point lol. Seed some royal flushes on the top, false shuffle the deck, etc etc. IIRC only two Royal Flushes survived but the point was made.It&#x27;s certainly fun. But it does make me wonder how people are supposed to trust the dealer when so many of these tricks exist and aren&#x27;t even that hard to do or practice. (Perfect shuffles are really hard. But the other stuff is just pretending to be a klutz and undoing the shuffle by dropping the cards or other such planned clumsiness, and then confidently pretending that the deck was truly shuffled). These sorts of things are more believable before your friends realize you are ridiculously practiced with card tricks.Still though, street con artists are on another level.

Repeat this perfect riffle shuffle enough times and the deck returns to it&#x27;s exact original state. It&#x27;s just simple math at that point, but it does mean you need perfection on every action.----------When a normie riffle shuffles, of course it&#x27;s random. The issue is that magicians are ridiculously skilled in secret ways that are incredibly difficult to detect.That is: a magician can look like they&#x27;re shuffling, but in reality they&#x27;re actually seeding and returning the deck to a state they want it to be in for their tricks.Or a cheater at poker for that matter.-------That&#x27;s okay though.

Lawyers must put forth an image of being intelligent, informed, and aggressive; being the victim of a shady business doesn&#x27;t fit this model. reply cowthulhu 13 hours agoparentMy (very naive) thinking would be that lawyers are the worst demographic to con, since they have the skills and resources to try and make themselves whole again (at the expense of the conman), maybe with a few NDAs throw in for good measure. Is this not the case? reply eschulz 13 hours agorootparentMy take is that lawyers will have to compare the damages they suffered to the potential harm their reputation will sustain if they become well known for being victims. Did they pay $1,000 for a subpar product? If so, they might not act beyond issuing some threats. However, if they lost $100,000 to a thief then they probably will act.I have spoken with many lawyers who have threatened marketers with lawsuits, and in many cases the threat will help the lawyer. I have had a few lawyers tell me they WILL NOT file a lawsuit (why sue for $500 considering the time and court fees), but that it only costs about 60 cents to send a verbose letter using their firm&#x27;s letterhead. They understand the old warning \"if you sue for a cow, you may end up losing a cow\".Just as with a successful con against esteemed scientists, any skilled conman will know his target well and understand how he can fly just below the radar and probably avoid getting called out and destroyed. reply kstrauser 11 hours agorootparentprevMy naive thinking would be that a given lawyer would be either impossible to con, or ripe for the taking because they believe they’re impossible to con.

It’s a trip watching marks double down and reenforce the narrative. Those talking points become your mantra because you don’t want others finding out how far in the hole you are. reply hnbad 12 hours agoprevThis isn&#x27;t really surprising. Cons are literally \"confidence tricks\", i.e. betrayals of social trust, which can be disorienting and distressing, even traumatizing. We know that rape victims, to use an extreme example, often try to normalize what happened to them - especially when the attacker was a close friend or intimate partner. A common story is a victim being sexually abused by a partner in the evening and making their abuser breakfast the next morning because then it can&#x27;t have been abuse and must have been consensual because why would a victim make breakfast for their abuser - that&#x27;d be absurd.Nobody wants to be a victim. Some people like to play the victim, sure, and some victims (usually after quite a bit of therapy) try to own their victim status to come to terms with what they&#x27;ve experienced but victims are at least as likely if not more to pretend nothing happened (even when they&#x27;re traumatized and their denial is perpetuating that trauma) as they are to speak up.With cons that are scams there&#x27;s of course also the chance to play hot potato: you may have been the mark but that only makes you a victim if you are the end of the chain. If you can still con someone else to make your money back, you didn&#x27;t get fooled, you just got inconvenienced at worst and you&#x27;re not really at fault for conning the next person because after all you wouldn&#x27;t have done it if you hadn&#x27;t been conned to begin with.

I do think people genuinely believed there were simply growing pains and once through them something what today&#x27;s generation thinks of as the \"Star Trek The Next Generation Utopia\" could be achievable.There are still people that think it might have succeeded if given a genuine chance, and not undermined by the rich in the west.In retrospect we now know they were wrong, and probably Russia was the worst place for communism to succeed.

Yes, another new OS from Microsoft. Windows XP may be a dead OS, but it still holds a place in our hearts, and with Windows XP 2024 Edition, we can see what a revived Windows XP could look like. AR 4789 has designed and showcased a modern interpretation of Windows XP 2024 Edition. The OS’ design is familiar, yet new, and feels remarkably simple. There is no Cortana, no AI Co-Pilot, or an extreme amount of unwanted, pre-installed software. XP 2024 Edition is a call-back to simpler times, before your OS could show you ads, and when the Windows search function was a useful feature (No, I don’t want you to search using Bing!). Honestly, now that I have seen it, I am a little sad that Windows XP 2024 Edition doesn’t exist. It is a concept, nothing more. It is a shame that Microsoft cannot create a new version of Windows that runs as smoothly as AR 4789’s concepts. Watch the video below to see it for yourself. With a simple UI, a nice looking dark mode and its iconic wallpaper, Windows XP looks great in its modern form. Like many PC users, I remember Windows XP and Windows 7 more fondly than their successors. While nostalgia plays a role here, so do other factors. Many aspects of Windows 11 are unwanted. Login requirements, changes to Windows Search, and taskbar changes, are all bugbears. Windows 12 is unlikely to address these issues, and moving to Linux is a step too far for most PC users. Today, Windows XP is practically extinct. Even newer OS’ like Windows 7 and 8 are becoming an increasingly rare sight. This week Steam dropped support for pre-Windows 10 OS’. Windows 7 will be 15 years old this year, which means that it is getting close to “Retro” status. By comparison, Windows XP is practically ancient. Even so, I still like it, and I love the idea of its 2024 reimagining. You can join the discussion on Windows XP 2024 Edition on the OC3D Forums.

They don’t make (as much) money off of individuals buying licenses, the real dough is in bulk business licensing.

Also, people using pirated Windows make anyway a critical mass where legit users can find someone to ask for help. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t care about piracy as long as regular users know more people that would help them with Windows than for example with Linux. If tomorrow all users of pirated Windows OS and related software would magically migrate to Linux, the monetary loss for Microsoft would be zero, but more legit users might be incentivized to switch away from it because of the sudden raise in Linux knowledge around them.

Console gaming is not comparable to PC gaming at this point.Using LTSC over regular W10 affords you a more stable system since you forgo any feature updates from Microsoft (only security updates), a more lightweight and snappier system with less background services running at startup, and reduced (but still present) telemetry.Also, I unironically like the Windows UX over the Linux compositors and countless Desktop Environments that endlessly run into compatability issues and weird bugs.

Sure, there was very little gaming, but you could get by just fine and installations was reasonably simple, Redhat, Slackware, Debian, SuSE, Mandrake, Caldera, they all just worked. Sure you had to be a little selective regarding hardware, but it wasn&#x27;t a massive issue.Interaction with Windows mostly worked without issues, but as Windows XP became more dominate, and especially as Internet Explorer and newer versions of Office took over, things got worse. Still for a few short years, those of us who got into Linux in that tiny windows of time, didn&#x27;t actually struggle as much as people think. We could do online shopping, word processing, online banking and a little casual gaming.

I&#x27;ve run multiple corporate-wide Windows upgrade projects for multiple companies and environments. I&#x27;ve built gold images and templates for Citrix and VDI environments. There really is no hardware configuration needed at all.I&#x27;ve never had any problems running games or any software in Windows due to drivers or configuration issues.

Both in downloading it and installing it. reply bongodongobob 11 hours agorootparentI mean, when your users need to use software that&#x27;s only available on Windows and consume the entire M365 stack, Windows is the only sane choice.That being said, those environments are generally going to EoL Windows 10 as there&#x27;s just no reason to move to 11 if things are working. I have 0 experience with Windows 11 yet for that reason.As far as a consumer goes, if you&#x27;re starting from a Windows 10 machine, creating the installation media is as easy as downloading the Windows installation media creation tool, point it to your USB, and off you go. Licensing is generally tied to the hardware at this point, so if your device is newish, there&#x27;s no activation or license keys.Install takes maybe 15 minutes and is hands off other than username, time zone, pick your wifi SSID etc. Unless you have special hardware, you shouldn&#x27;t need to install any other drivers.

Yeah, okay, I&#x27;m getting a mental image.I can&#x27;t name the last thing or feature that required any amount of fiddling to get working in Linux. Premium webcams, audio equipment, Chromebooks, Lenovos, ASUS gaming laptops, brand new laptops, 3 USB-C hubs, complicated docked, multi-monitor scenarios. It all has just worked out of box with Linux and NixOS, and requires less maintenance and hand holding than my single Windows dual-boot install. reply doublepg23 14 hours agorootparentprevThe only \"just working\" OSes are Android and iOS&#x2F;iPadOS. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparent> The only \"just working\" OSes are Android and iOS&#x2F;iPadOS.Ha!

It&#x27;s unbelievable how this industry has gotten so many people hooked, to the point of accepting kernel level monitoring reply dijit 15 hours agorootparentI solved it by just running a console.People look down on me for it, but the way I see it: my computing experience is not keeping me prisoner; and I value my time too much to dig about certain issues, you&#x27;re guaranteed to suffer the \"my FPS isn&#x27;t so good I will investigate\" or \"this game doesn&#x27;t run so I will investigate\" situations.Cheats are less common too, so there&#x27;s less incentive for kernel anti-cheat, and if there was: it would be contained to my \"game computer\" anyway. reply ssbash 9 hours agorootparentYup, after I switched to a console - I was finally able to just play games with my friends and not waste mental energy on fiddling with settings.I don’t have to worry about downloading a game launcher riddled with telemetry or wait 6 months after launch for a PC port to reach a playable state. reply recursive 15 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think this necessarily represents obsession. It just means they care about gaming at least as much \"kernel level monitoring\". As a baseline, I don&#x27;t think there are many people who care much about that. I&#x27;m not sure what it is. reply Almondsetat 15 hours agorootparentTranspose this gaming obsession to other facets of life and see how it goes.Imagine if most cars were modeled after Lamborghinis and people complained about the lack of turbo or carbon seats when hopping on your Honda Civic.Imagine if most parks were modeled after football fields and people complained about the lack of goals and lines in your backyard.Imagine if most knifes were modeled after big damascus blades and people complained about your table knifes when they come for dinner for not being cool and sharp enough reply ThatPlayer 14 hours agorootparentNo one&#x27;s complaining about your Linux if that&#x27;s what you want to use. The issue remains that for my personal wants, which includes gaming, Linux doesn&#x27;t fulfill them.If you gave me a dull knife to carve a turkey or fillet a fish, I would definitely complain about it not being sharp enough. Most people probably have a sharper knife than a table knife for cooking, is that a sharpness obsession?It&#x27;s about picking the right tool for the job. On my home server, I run Linux; my gaming computer runs Windows. If you wanna keep going with the knife analogy, look at how many types of kitchen knives there are. There is no knife that does everything just as well as all the others. Asking for a bread knife for cutting a loaf isn&#x27;t an attack on every other knife. reply recursive 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m having trouble understanding the metaphor. If someone went to a park for the purpose of playing football, surely the lack of lines would make them prefer other parks.If someone is trying to set a lap record, a Camry probably isn&#x27;t a good choice either.

There are carrots like a fancy new feature, or sticks like “we’re not supporting this anymore, so if you want your computer to be secure you need to upgrade.”A lot of people don’t care about the carrots though. Their computer does everything they need it to and does so reliably. In a lot of ways the OS is a solved problem, but the companies who make them still need to pay the bills for all the security work that will always need to be done.It makes me wonder if Apple (for example) put macOS into a no-new-features mode and just improved security from here-on-out what the long term effects would be for users and the industry. reply 1over137 15 hours agoparentFor Apple at least, why should it care if its users upgrade their OS?

That&#x27;s what Google did with Android, they didn&#x27;t start with a monopoly and won&#x27;t have one in the mobile market but their entire purpose in making an OS is to lead people into depending on their services. Android&#x27;s entire life purpose is for you to have Maps, Gmail, Drive and Chrome preinstalled. reply akira2501 14 hours agoparentprev> make the new version of the OS appealing enoughThe OS does not have \"appeal.\" It either works and facilitates my use of my own hardware or it does not.The only reason to think this way is because you want to turn your paying customers PCs into advertising machines that violate their privacy and turn their hardware against them. There&#x27;s not amount of \"appeal\" you can cram into your product that will get me to work against my own interests. reply smolder 15 hours agoparentprevSecurity work for an otherwise solved problem is finite.

In a lot of ways the OS is a solved problem, but the companies who make them still need to pay the bills for all the security work that will always need to be done.Exactly. Consumer desktop&#x2F;laptop operating systems (Linux&#x2F;MacOS&#x2F;Windows) have been largely stagnant for years, at least in terms of offering meaningfully better ways to get things done[1]. That&#x27;s a problem for the commercial offerings: why would anyone buy the new version if it doesn&#x27;t do anything new&#x2F;better than its predecessor?Microsoft&#x27;s path is pretty clear: the OS is evolving into an internet terminal. Consumers don&#x27;t pay for the OS: they pay a subscription to do anything, with features increasingly delivered online and, crucially, all their data \"managed\" (aka controlled by) by Microsoft too. Device sales don&#x27;t matter first order in that model: it&#x27;s a dumb terminal. But Microsoft has to keep the device manufacturers sweet: it&#x27;s imperative consumers use Microsoft&#x27;s dumb terminal, because it&#x27;s connected to Microsoft&#x27;s services. It would be a disaster if HP, Dell et al decided to use some other front end. Microsoft will do whatever it takes to remain the dominant desktop.Apple has more of a dilemma. It&#x27;s always been about the integrated experience, and hardware sales are a first-order driver of revenue and profitability. So it needs to keep consumers buying hardware as well as trying to up its rental offerings (iCloud etc). Moving to its own silicon has powered that for the last few years (more supply chain control, better performance, and good marketing on why it&#x27;s better).>It makes me wonder if Apple (for example) put macOS into a no-new-features mode and just improved security from here-on-out what the long term effects would be for users and the industry.That&#x27;s arguably what MacOS has been for the last few years: security updates plus support for their own silicon.Beyond the hype, LLMs possibly offer an opportunity for a notable change in desktop interaction (note &#x27;change&#x27; not necessarily &#x27;better&#x27; - I&#x27;m withholding judgement on that). An OS that could respond to users&#x27; queries&#x2F;instructions directly could be better than having to click about semi-randomly to find the right menu option.[1] which doesn&#x27;t detract from e.g. security upgrades, different peripheral connection standards, hardware improvements, etc. reply 59 more comments...

    "originLink": "https://github.com/moturus/motor-os",
    "originBody": "Motūrus OS Motūrus project builds a simple, fast, and secure operating system (Motūrus OS) for the cloud. In more specific terms, Motūrus OS (sometimes called Motor OS), is a new operating system targeting virtual machine-based workloads such as web serving, \"serverless\", edge caching, etc. Screenshot Why? At the moment, most virtualized production workloads run Linux. While Linux has many advanced features that in many situations mean it is the only reasonable OS choice, there are several complications that make it not ideal, in theory, for some virtualized workloads: Linux is optimized for baremetal, which leads to inefficiencies when it is used inside a VM that is running on a Linux host: duplicate block caches duplicate page table walks the host scheduler can preempt the VCPU holding a spinlock in the VM's kernel Linux is difficult to use: Docker, Nix OS, \"serverless\", etc. all exist because of Linux's complexity Linux has, historically, not been very secure A new operating system built from ground-up with the focus on virtualized workloads can be made much simpler and more secure than Linux, while matching or exceeding its performance and/or efficiency. What? Motūrus OS is a microkernel-based operating system, built in Rust, that targets virtualized workloads exclusively. It currently supports x64 KVM-based virtual machines, and can run in either Qemu or Cloud Hypervisor. Rust is the language of Motūrus OS: not only it is implemented in Rust, it also exposes its ABI in Rust, not C. What works While at the moment most of the subsystems are working in only POC/MVP mode, they are working, and you can run, say, a web server. More specifically, these things work: boots via MBR (Qemu) or PVH (Cloud Hypervisor) in about 200ms himem micro-kernel scheduling: a simple multi-processor round robin (SMP) in-kernel scheduling is cooperative the kernel is very small and does not block, so does not need to be preemptible the userspace is preemptible memory management: only 4K pages at the moment stacks are guarded page faults in the userspace work and are properly handled (only stack memory allocations are currently lazy) I/O subsystem (in the userspace) VirtIO-BLK and VirtIO-NET drivers two simple filesystems (srfs and flatfs) smoltcp-based networking (TCP only at the moment) a simple httpd is provided the userspace: multiple processes, with preemption threads, TLS Rust's standard library mostly ported Rust programs that use Rust standard library and do not depend, directly or indirectly, on Unix or Windows FFI, will cross-compile for Motūrus OS and run, subject to \"what does not work\" below a simple unix-like shell in the serial console What does not work Most pieces are not yet ready for production use. No security audit has been made. It is very easy to hit a \"not implemented\" panic in sys-io (the userspace I/O subsystem). More specifically: Filesystem: most Rust std::fs APIs have been implemented as proof-of-concept, but are slow (synchronous) and will have to be reimplemented using Motūrus async I/O Networking: std::net::TcpStream is mostly implemented, but there are todo! panics other protocols are not implemented yet performance can (and will) be better The ecosystem outside Rust std: crates like rand or rustls can be compiled and used with minor tweaks crates depending on async runtimes (e.g. Tokio) will not compile at the moment Tokio Mio should be not too difficult to port crates that are wrappers around native Linux or Windows APIs will not work, obviously How can I build/run it? See docs/build.md. Thanks Big thanks to Philipp Oppermann for his great Writing an OS in Rust blog series - it has inspired a lot of people to experiment in this space.",

Wouldn&#x27;t it need to initialize some metadata for the memory pages, mount the filesystem, and try to launch an init process? I suppose there might be an ethernet driver and possibly something to pipe logs to (\"stdout\" for the VM) to initialize. Shouldn&#x27;t that all take a few microseconds?Or is all the slowness in the host preparing the resources?

As in, program a value then you must wait 50 ms before querying the registers or the hardware will give you non-deterministic garbage with no error indication.So, it depends on the hardware, though you are unlikely to need more than 1 second on anything other than truly degenerate hardware assuming you are initializing devices in parallel. reply azinman2 2 hours agorootparentBut it’s only for VMs. So what hardware are you initializing? reply Modified3019 41 minutes agorootparentI pass through a GPU and USB hub to a VM running on a machine in the garage. An optical video cable and network compatible USB extender brings the interface to a different room making it my primary “desktop” computer (and an outdated laptop as a backup device). Doesn’t get more silent and cool than this. Another VM on the garage machine gets a bunch of hard drives passed through to it.That said, hardware passthrough&#x2F;VFIO is likely out of the current realistic scope for this project. VM boot times can be optimized if you never look for hardware to initialize in the first place. Though they are still likely initializing a network interface of some sort.“MicroVM” seems to be a term used when as much as possible is stripped from a VM, such as with https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;firecracker-microvm&#x2F;firecracker reply cedws 6 hours agoprevIt sounds like a cool project and I hope it continues development, but there is such a huge graveyard of such projects that have never gone anywhere that I struggle to get excited about them anymore.

It just happens to run a windowed environment out of the box. Don&#x27;t be that guy. If you want to pump Valve, focus instead on their contributions to the Wine project. replyweinzierl 4 hours agoprevSounds interesting, but it also reminds me of what Linus once said when asked about fearing competition. From my memory his answer was something like: I really like writing device drivers. Few people like that and until someone young and hungry comes along who likes that I&#x27;m not afraid of competition. reply wavemode 3 hours agoparentYou don&#x27;t need very many device drivers to run in a VM.The real question is, how useful is a non-C-compatible, non-Linux-compatible, VM-only OS. Maybe a little bit, for microservices? reply weinzierl 2 hours agorootparentAccording to The American Heritage Dictionary an operating system is:\"Software designed to control the hardware of a specific data-processing system in order to allow users and application programs to make use of it.\"The question is how much Operating System is a software that delegates all \"control the hardware\" parts to the layer below.I know there are wider definitions of OS, but my point is this is not going to replace Linux.Without question projects like MotorOS are sill useful. Besides practical applications it&#x27;s a nice idea. Just recently I wrote in another thread that I would love to have a glimpse into an alternative universe, where Pascal had won over C and everything was Pascal-based. The idea to have everything Rust-based is even more exciting. reply slau 1 hour agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s relatively trivial to have a `FROM scratch` dockerised microservice in Rust.

There&#x27;s a huge TCB in which bugs lead to vulnerabilities with high probability, as we see all the time.This is why eg cloud providers don&#x27;t rely on the OS to isolate customers from each other.Since the reneissance of virtualization, many security focused systems have built on that, like Qubes OS, seL4-based virtualized systems, etc. reply josh2600 6 hours agorootparentEverything in security is layers of defense against a threat model.To design a secure system one must first ask who is going to attack it and with what forces.Making truly secure systems is an art and is rarified ground. reply bionsystem 3 hours agorootparentprevIdk if it&#x27;s \"the Unix family\".

Solaris used to have its share of public vulnerability discourse when it had more users, and it quieted down as the user base shrank and people stopped deploying it as a general purpouse server OS. In a slow moving niche OS I wouldn&#x27;t put much weight on low volume of public security problem discourse especially in face of apparent architectural problems. reply cedws 6 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not wrong. Linux does not have a great security track record, it was built on completely different security principles than the ones we have today.

Windows has since hardened their security model and could be a more secure out of the box experience than Linux (eg shipping with TPM and FDE set up correctly).But yeah, there’s plenty of things you’d do differently if you wanted to properly secure Linux. It just shows that economically that’s not the most important thing for companies using Linux. reply cedws 6 hours agorootparentI think you are confusing Linux the Kernel with Linux-based operating systems. The original quote from the README was referencing the kernel and made no comparison to Windows or the NT kernel. reply vlovich123 4 hours agorootparentThe Linux kernel and distributions is what I’m talking about so yes compared with NT kernel and windows as a distribution.The design choices you’d make to build a secure OS (kernel and user space) looks very different. The microkernel design is a more secure design but techniques to make it work fast took a very long time to develop (+ computer HW also got fast enough that the overhead is no longer as big of a deal + we have multithreading everywhere that microkernel can sometimes exploit more naturally). reply snvzz 5 hours agoparentprevIt is an accurate statement.Linux is a monolithic UNIX-like OS, with all the implications of an accidental design that dates to the late 60s&#x2F;early 70s.For starters, it has huge (Linux has MLoCs) TCB.

Despite that, at least one OS in rust is being successfully deployed commercially today (&#x27;hubris&#x27;, thanks to oxide computing), there are numerous reasonably advanced &#x27;amateur&#x27; OS projects in rust (redox os being a reasonably polished example), and rust has begun finding it&#x27;s way into the two most popular existing OSes (both the linux and windows kernels - I believe the windows kernel is farther along here).By any reasonable metric, rust has been wildly successful in the OS writing space. No doubt, in large part thanks to evangelizing by people who said \"this is a reasonable thing to do\". reply tourmalinetaco 6 hours agorootparentprevRust is only “safe” because by default you’re not allowed to do certain things. If you applied those same limitations to C it would be just as if not more safe. And the things you’re not allowed to do in “safe” Rust is required in various applications that C excels at, meaning that for Rust to do the same it has to be “unsafe”. reply bigstrat2003 5 hours agorootparentNobody has ever denied that unsafe Rust code exists, so I don&#x27;t know why people keep acting like it&#x27;s some gotcha that invalidates the value of Rust. The point is that in Rust, it is clearly delimited where those unsafe operations are occurring, so you can focus on making sure those specific parts of your code are solid. In C, you have to be vigilant about your entire code base, not just a handful of blocks. Moreover, most Rust programs don&#x27;t need to use unsafe at all, so those authors can rest easier. reply BirAdam 5 hours agorootparentprevI am usually the first to say that Rust evangelists are annoying, but… your argument isn’t valid. That any tool can be dangerous when used wrongly enough is not an argument in favor of or against rust.

    "originBody": "The New York Times Launches a Very Strong Case Against Microsoft and OpenAI Posted on January 6, 2024January 7, 2024 by Kate Downing It seems that The New York Times Company (“The Times”) got fed up with the pace of its negotiations with Microsoft and OpenAI over their use of The Times’ content for training and running their LLMs. So much so that The Times filed a post-Christmas complaint against the two, likely knowing full well they’d lay waste to the winter vacations of hundreds of people working for OpenAI and Microsoft. It might be the most well-known AI-related case to date because the case isn’t a class action and the plaintiff is globally recognized. The complaint alleges: Copyright infringement against all defendants (related to handling of the datasets containing content from The Times, handling of models allegedly derivative of the datasets, and the ultimate output) Vicarious copyright infringement (the idea that Microsoft and various OpenAI affiliates directed, controlled and profited from infringement committed by OpenAI OpCo LLC and OpenAI, LLC) Contributory copyright infringement by all defendants (the idea that the defendants contribute to any infringement perpetrated by end users of the models) DMCA Section 1202 violations by all defendants regarding removal of copyright management information from items in the datasets Common law unfair competition by misappropriation by all defendants (related to training AI models on The Times’ content and offering AI services that reproduce The Times’ content in identical or substantially similar form (and without citing The Times or linking to the underlying content)) Trademark dilution by all defendants (arguing the the AIs dilute the quality associated with The Times’ trademarks by falsely claiming certain content originates from The Times) Unlike other complaints, this one doesn’t spend too much time explaining how AI models work or teeing up the analogies they plan to use in court. Instead, the complaint includes multiple extremely clear-cut examples of the LLMs spitting out The Times’ content nearly verbatim or stating bald-faced lies about The Times’ content. Many of the other complaints admitted they weren’t able to find clear-cut examples of infringing output, nebulously resting their claims on the idea that all output is, by definition, infringing. Here, Microsoft and OpenAI haven’t just used The Times’ content to teach the AI how to communicate, they’ve launched news-specific services and features that ingest both archived content and brand new articles from The Times. The other plaintiffs also weren’t able to argue that their specific content, out of the trillions of pieces of training data in the datasets, was particularly important for creating quality AIs. Here, The Times convincingly argues that its content was extremely valuable for training the AIs, both because of the quantity involved as well as the fact that the training process involved instructing the AI to prioritize The Times’ content. This is probably the strongest AI-related complaint out there. I think it’s quite possible that a jury or judge angry at Microsoft and OpenAI for offering services that compete with and undercut The Times is more likely to also find that the training activities constituted copyright infringement and that the model itself is a derivative work of the training data, without thinking too hard about a scenario where the ultimate model doesn’t supplant the business or livelihood of the copyright holders in the training data. It’s definitely a case where “bad facts invite bad law.” This case is also notable for the fact that it explicitly goes after the defendants for their AIs’ hallucinations. An AI summarizing a news event based on one or more news articles opens a Pandora’s box worth of debate about the line between uncopyrightable facts and copyrightable expression, as well as how/if those same standards should be applied to a computer “reading” the news. But the hallucinations aren’t facts; they’re lies. And even if the defendants prevail in arguing that the AIs are mostly just providing people with unprotectable facts, there’s very little to shield them from liability for the lies, both with respect to trademark dilution claims, but also with respect to potential libel or privacy-related claims that might be brought by other individuals. Copyright law can forgive a certain amount of infringement under certain circumstances but these other areas of law are far less flexible. The other really interesting thing about this complaint is the extent to which it describes the business of The Times – how much work the journalists put in to create the articles, the physical risks they take during reporting, the value of good journalism in general, and The Times’ struggle with adjusting to an online world. The complaint paints a picture of an honorable industry repeatedly pants-ed by the tech industry, which historically has only come to heel under enormous public pressure and the Herculean efforts of The Times to continue to survive. It’s interesting because US copyright law decisively rejects the idea that copyright protection is due for what is commonly referred to as “sweat of the brow.” In other words, the fact that it takes great effort or resources to compile certain information (like a phonebook), doesn’t entitle that work to any copyright protection – others may use it freely. And where there is copyrightable expression, the difficulty in creating it is irrelevant. So, is all this background aimed solely at supporting the unfair competition claim? Is it a quiet way of asking the court to ignore the “sweat of the brow” precedent, to the extent that it’s ultimately argued by the defendants, in favor of protecting the more sympathetic party? Maybe they’re truly concerned that the courts no longer recognize the value of journalism and need a history lesson? No other AI-related complaint has worked so hard to justify the very existence, needs, and frustrations of its plaintiffs. Unless Microsoft and OpenAI hustle to strike a deal with the New York Times, this is definitely going to be the case to watch in the next year or two. Not only does it embody some of the strongest legal arguments related to copyright, it is likely to become a lightning rod for many interests who will use it to wage a proxy war on their behalf. The case, and especially the media coverage of the case, will likely embitter the public and politicians even further against big tech, treating its success as a zero sum game vis a vis journalists and creators more broadly. It’s the kind of case that ultimately results in federal legislation, either codifying a judgment or statutorily reversing it. Like Loading...

Tracking down the original source of quotes and&#x2F;or stats is a bit of a hobby of mine, and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to do. News sources will regularly cite \"a recent study\" with little additional information to help identify it. Pithy quotes attributed to famous authors never contain a reference to the work, it&#x27;s always just the author&#x27;s name, and if you go digging the quote is misattributed as often as not. Full-on plagiarism with no attribution is rampant, even in reputable places where you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d have it under control.Like with self-driving cars, we expect AI to be better than the average human, which I think is the correct attitude, but we should acknowledge that that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re asking for. reply Baldbvrhunter 17 hours agorootparentA pet peeve of mine is> some spicy quote -- authorand when you go look, it is quoting something a character said in a storyan example [0]> “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.

Failing that, you should be surprised—anyone saying something like that really ought not be in a position where someone looks to them for counsel.

It was part of a broader discussion about IP liability regarding user image content, specifically referencing google images in this case, not snippets, so in this case works were reproduced in full. But the gist of my point, and my understanding of their point is that the often said \"google serves other people&#x27;s content like this, so my not-quite-the-same idea must be legal\" isn&#x27;t nearly so simple. reply quonn 18 hours agorootparentprevThere is a robots.txt.

This would then spark search engine content war which could significantly weaken Google&#x27;s monopoly because a lot of people would switch to Microsoft Bing only because Reddit results show up in their search queries. This would be akin to Netflix investing billions of dollars in the exclusive content which then brings them a lot of new subscribers and lot of new revenue.

When Google or Bing display summarized information, they provide links in citation style so you know where the information came from.Compare that to what you get from ChatGPT.

This is one of the foundational pillars of Western cultural and academic integrity it’s subverting. reply sega_sai 17 hours agorootparentprevThat is explicitly discussed in the text of the complaint. Google produces snippets with a direct link to the NYT and drives readers there. reply preciz 19 hours agoparentprev> A model that possesses the entire collective knowledge of our civilization is useless if it can&#x27;t directly quote its sources.That&#x27;s a strong and baseless statement. reply throwaway4aday 19 hours agorootparentUseless is probably not the right word but it&#x27;s a good way of summing up a lot of the current problems. If the model can clearly identify when something is an exact quote and also know the source then its output could be trusted for the most part and much more easily verified. It would certainly elevate the output of the model from \"random blog post or forum chat\" to \"academic paper or official report\" levels of trustworthiness. Citing sources is hugely important for validation, cited text allows an immediate lookup and simple equality check for verification after which you can use it as context to validate the rest of the claims. Like I said, it&#x27;s a standard we apply to humans who have an equal propensity for hallucination, mistakes, and deception because it&#x27;s a tried and true method for the reader to check the claims being made. reply js8 19 hours agorootparentprevI, for one, agree with the original statement. I think the hallmark of enlightenment (for example, in the scientific method) is that we are able to externalize the expert knowledge, that is, experts are usually required to provide reasoning behind their claims, and not just judgements. This is because we learned that experts cannot be 100% trusted, only if we can verify what they say we can somewhat reach what is truth (although expertise still provides a convenient shortcut).So not demanding this (and more) from an AI (an artificial expert) is a regression. AI should be capable of wholly explaining its reasoning, if we are to consider its statements to be taken seriously. It is understandable that humans have only limited capability to do that, since we didn&#x27;t construct human brain. But we have control over what AI brains do, so we should be able to provide such an explanation.It is somewhat ironic that you yourself do not provide any argument in favor of your disagreement. reply jimberlage 17 hours agorootparentThis isn’t meant to totally disagree with your point (there’s some stuff I agree with in here) but I’m having trouble seeing the point about regressions.To use another example, a new NoSQL DB not having joins is a regression. Does that mean no one is justified in releasing a new NoSQL DB? reply js8 17 hours agorootparentAs long as from \"NoSQL\" it is clear that you mean \"I can&#x27;t do joins\", then it is OK. I think LLMs (and similar models like Stable Diffusion) are really cool for things like fiction, but to rely on them to tell you the truth is dangerous. So I am not really sure why the models have to be trained on NYT articles in the first place. reply ryanklee 17 hours agorootparentprevProviding reasoning and providing citations are not the same thing. Reasons can be provided without citations; citations can be provided without reasons.LLMs have astounding utility citations notwithstanding. reply js8 17 hours agorootparentThey are different, but perhaps you misunderstood my argument.Issue of plagiarism aside, we reason from facts, and it&#x27;s the facts (or some other analysis, which is itself a fact) that should be sourced. That&#x27;s why I agree with the original statement, and I argue not from a (moral) POV of preventing misattribution or plagiarism, but from a (practical) POV of veracity. reply ryanklee 17 hours agorootparentWe don&#x27;t only reason from facts. We also reason from value.Further, reasoning that rests on facts that does not cite facts still has massive utility. (See people, all day long.)Citations are useful, but not required. reply js8 15 hours agorootparentI think you just identified another problem with LLMs - we don&#x27;t know their values, either.Of course when you listen to human experts you&#x27;re using the shortcut (and you do it based on trust), as I already argued. You have an option (in most cases, in free societies) to dig beyond just experts judgement, you can study their reasoning, and understand their sources of both values and facts.Anyway, I disagree with citations not being required. If Wikipedia had no citations it would be less useful (and more prone to contain misinformation). Same goes for Google. So the next best things we have to \"artificial brain that contains all the human knowledge\" have citations, and for a good reason. reply ryanklee 15 hours agorootparentWhat are the citations actually required for though?Another way to ask this is: what value remains without them?I&#x27;ll add this as well: humans produced valuable knowledge for thousands of years without the use or standard of citations.To be clear, I think citations are highly valuable and desirable and I very much want LLMs to cite when appropriate. However, I think the necessity of this is overstated.Edit: what you said of experts can be said of LLMs as well. reply js8 50 minutes agorootparent> What are the citations actually required for though?For me, yes! I do often reference (cite) myself when thinking, by making and reading notes, or materials that other people wrote. If I relied only on my own memory, I would be unable to think more deeply.And this is, interestingly, where the current LLMs seem to break down - they can reason short proofs but cannot scale their reasoning to longer chains of thoughts correctly (were they capable of doing that, they would have no issue producing citations to back up their claims). They operate intuitively (Kahneman&#x27;s system 1) and not rationally (Kahneman&#x27;s system 2).And thus lot of that \"valuable knowledge\" that humans produced over the years have been hopelessly wrong, precisely until somebody actually sat down and wrote things up (or communicated things out, people working together can sort of expand the working memory as well). replyFerret7446 8 hours agorootparentprevAnd also patently false. Knowledge is knowledge, it&#x27;s useful without source citations.Is the knowledge of how to do CPR somehow ineffective because I can&#x27;t cite whether I studied the knowledge from website A or book B?

Imagine the word “democracy”, would you be able to tell me where you’ve first learned the definition of it and be able to provide a direct citation of it? What about the thousands of other instances where you’ve seen that word defined? (In OpenAI’s case probably hundreds of millions)Current LLMs work in a similar way, the information is synthesized by correlation, there is no way that it can directly relate where it learned it’s output from. The only viable way would be to do a reverse lookup of the output to find out if there’s a similar worded content on the internet. (Or what Perplexity does, wrap an LLM around search results, but you lose a lot of flexibility in this case) reply throwaway4aday 18 hours agorootparentCiting basic definitions wasn&#x27;t what I was talking about and it&#x27;s not required for humans either for the reason you just gave, it&#x27;s common knowledge. The problem the NYTimes seems to have is that ChatGPT can exactly reproduce large chunks of their articles. I&#x27;m saying that removing this ability would be bad. Finding a way for the model to identify when a large chunk of text is quoted verbatim and then clearly cite its source would be good. The output that is not a direct quote is not at issue here. reply supafastcoder 18 hours agorootparentYes, but an LLM can’t distinguish out of the box what needs to be cited or not. So you need another processing layer (and probably a search engine layer on top of that) to do that. reply krisoft 18 hours agorootparent> LLM can’t distinguish out of the box what needs to be cited or notLLM don’t know that they are supposed to answer questions out of the box either. This is what reinforcement learning from human feedback is good for.> you need another processing layerCertainly. For reliability and peace of mind I would implement a traditionally coded plagiarism search on the output. (Traditionally coded as in no AI magic required in that layer) If there is a match you evaluate how significant it is, that most likely is best done with machine learning. For example if the match is a short and simple statement you can ignore it. If it is a longer match, or a very specific statement you need to do something. What you do depends on your resources and risk appetite. Simply supressing the output is an option, it is cheap and very reliable. Rephrasing until it no longer matches is an other, takes a bit more compute and you can end up skirting too close to plagiarism. Rewriting the output to only quote a short amount and provide citation is even more costly, but can be done too.You can do all of these post processing steps at generation time. And you can also use it to enhance your training dataset. That way the next version of the model will more likely to do the right thing right away, because it learned the correct patterns to quote things. reply tourmalinetaco 18 hours agorootparentprevAn LLM cannot do a lot of things out of the box, and OpenAI has more than a few processing layers already. They certainly already modify output based on verboten topics. Personally I feel any decent LLM should be able to attribute its sources even when not a direct quote, because that raises the bar that much higher on its trustworthiness and general value. reply krisoft 18 hours agorootparentprev> it’s fundamentally impossible to do with the current state of technologyMaybe.> Imagine the word “democracy”, would you be able to tell me where you’ve first learned the definition of itSure, it was elementary school history lessons when we were learning about the greeks.> be able to provide a direct citation of itNaturally.

I would agree. But if the AI wants to be relied on, then it should be, at minimum, capable of taking a word like \"democracy\" and compare its own definition with the Wikipedia definition, and verify whether it&#x27;s used correctly in its output. reply supafastcoder 18 hours agorootparentYep, that’s what I meant with the reverse lookup strategy. reply concordDance 18 hours agorootparentprev> Imagine the word “democracy”, would you be able to tell me where you’ve first learned the definition of it and be able to provide a direct citation of it?Worth noting that we mostly learn words by seeing them used, rather than by being given an explicit definition. Most of my vocabulary I learnt not from a dictionary and I expect the same is true of almost everyone. As such, there is no well defined point at which \"the definition\" is learnt, both because there&#x27;s no such thing as the one true definition and because the meaning is gradually being changed and refined by each person as they see the word used more. reply Baldbvrhunter 17 hours agorootparentNot only that, as Orwell says in Politics and the English Language [0]> The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of régime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orwellfoundation.com&#x2F;the-orwell-foundation&#x2F;orwel... reply paxys 18 hours agoparentprevQuoting isn&#x27;t the problem here.

Rather, it&#x27;s a property of information, representation, and knowledge itself. Much of it floats far above the otherwise load bearing pillars of citations.People contend with this constantly in every arena of life, and we have come up with very elaborate ways to offset the difficulties caused by it.And we get along very well despite it all.I&#x27;ll also leave you with this: citations are just pointers to more sources of information.

This seems like the right way to go - pull the collective knowledge of our civilization from the internet, then use the training on language to put it in the form most useful to the asker. This also enables quoting (though it doesn&#x27;t generally do that, preferring to paraphrase and give a citation, which seems fine to me). reply EGG_CREAM 19 hours agoparentprevThis is a huge strawman argument that entirely ignores the heart of the issue.

It doesn’t get used up or retire.If you consider that there’s a fixed amount of societal capacity for whatever undertaking is in question (news journalism, art generation, etc.) then as a human, I take up only a certain amount and only for a certain amount of time. I will never arbitrarily duplicate to produce the work of 10, 100, 1000, etc. humans. I will also shuffle on after about 50 years and someone else, having potentially learnt from me, can now gainfully exist within the world in my stead.The capacity for infinite commoditisation that AI brings is necessarily a critical distinction to humans when it comes to considering them performing equivalent functions.

Please stop replying to me saying that I&#x27;m saying that.The article is about people (well, companies) being sued. Not about software being sued. Software can&#x27;t be sued.Whether or not there are additional laws written about what&#x27;s acceptable behavior for software (whatever that means? It&#x27;s assuming software can make decisions) is irrelevant. You can&#x27;t sue software. People are being sued because the plaintiffs think that people broke people laws and are liable for damages. Software can&#x27;t break laws and can&#x27;t be held liable.I&#x27;m having to reword this over and over because you keep replying to me. I think you might be replying to me repeatedly just to have the last word. replyEkaros 19 hours agorootparentprevIf we give personhood to software, wouldn&#x27;t it mean that you cannot shutdown or delete it ever? You cannot destroy the equipment it is on? As clearly that would be murder.What would be your financial responsibility to keep AI running? reply merrywhether 18 hours agorootparentThese are famously the types of questions surfaced in countless sci-fi books. And as long as humans don’t destroy themselves first, it is likely that we will have to address them eventually. In most stories it generally happens too late after some terrible war&#x2F;conflict, so it wouldn’t be unreasonable to tackle them proactively. And then maybe it’s not so weird to think about these concepts even if their realization isn’t imminent. Working backwards in such a framework would probably give much better laws for today. reply ravenstine 17 hours agorootparentprevThis has nothing to do with personhood of software. Restricting the freedom of human beings, which includes the ones that run companies, based on the tool they choose to use, without the basis of obvious direct harm, is questionable. The fact that AI can operate autonomously is a side tangent; they are created by humans and, so far, their only proximal purpose is to serve humans. reply filoleg 16 hours agorootparentprevCorporate personhood is a thing in the US, and you are allowed to shutdown your company just fine. reply ravenstine 17 hours agorootparentprev> Yes. It&#x27;s an object or writing. Not a person. You&#x27;re arguing for giving personhood to software right now and that&#x27;s crazy.No, arguing that a human using an artificial brain instead of their own biological brain for learning and derivative creation is an implementation detail of little relevance, and dismissing personhood related arguments like \"software can&#x27;t marry\" has nothing to do with arguing for the personhood of software. Explain how one leads to the other, because I&#x27;m not seeing it, and that&#x27;s not at all what I was attempting to communicate. reply tumult 17 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re saying that the software itself should be held liable, instead of the people that created it. Meaning that the software would need legal status as a person (or equivalent) so that it can be taken to court, instead of the people that created it.There is a possibility that you&#x27;re not saying that, but it&#x27;s the only interpretation of your comment I could come up with. Because your comment consists entirely of comparisons of software to human brains about whether or not something should be considered legal, and this only makes sense if the software itself can be held liable. reply ravenstine 16 hours agorootparent> You&#x27;re saying that the software itself should be held liable, instead of the people that created it.Respectfully, I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;re interpreting it that way. Until we demonstrate that the current generation of AI is genuinely intelligent, instead of clever algorithms, a piece of software is no more or less liable than an individual firearm is after it&#x27;s been fired at someone. My observation is that your argument appears to be that there is something special about humans learning and creating derivative works from that learning over humans using a tool that does the learning and create derivative works.> There is a possibility that you&#x27;re not saying that, but it&#x27;s the only interpretation of your comment I could come up with.That&#x27;s fair. I just don&#x27;t get it.> Because your comment consists entirely of comparisons of software to human brains about whether or not something should be considered legal, and this only makes sense if the software itself can be held liable.Human brains and software are both tools. The question I&#x27;m invoking is what is it about a person doing the learning and the derivative creation that&#x27;s different from a person (since, as you say, software itself has no personhood) using an artificial brain to learn and perform derivative creation.I think the disconnect here may be that I&#x27;m operating from the assumption that of course there are human beings liable for the software, but your interpretation of what I&#x27;m saying is that software in a vacuum should effectively have personhood applied to it. These are two different things. I&#x27;m referring to both humans&#x2F;brains and software as the interchangeable variable in the question of why the choice of tool means applying entirely different legal principles.Sorry if I wasn&#x27;t clear or still am not being clear here. I wanted to make sure I was being understood correctly, but if all we can do from here is agree to disagree, that&#x27;s fine, and I&#x27;d offer to just shake hands. reply tumult 16 hours agorootparentThe way your comment was phrased made it seem, to me, like you were rebutting what I was saying and that regular human things are all irrelevant for whether or not something is a person.There is one other way I have figured out to read your comment. Which is that it doesn&#x27;t matter how software or a brain functions since it&#x27;s only the action of the outcome that matters. But this is not really a relevant statement regardless of whether or not you agree with it, because the article is about a lawsuit and liability. A group of people, acting as a company, is suing other groups of people as companies. And software is not a person, and can&#x27;t be held liable. So for that to be the case, the software would need to be made into a person, or equivalent. The fact that software and brains are or are not similar is irrelevant, because software is not a person and cannot be held liable. replyericmay 17 hours agorootparentprev> You aren&#x27;t software. The laws that apply to people reading and learning do not apply to software.If you&#x27;re going to draw a sharp distinction between reading&#x2F;words&#x2F;people (software isn&#x27;t people, etc.) and software I would argue that the legal and copyright considerations should be stronger for software, not weaker, precisely because of your argument. reply throwaway4aday 19 hours agorootparentprevI would not make that the foundation of my argument over the long term. reply tumult 19 hours agorootparentAssuming that software won&#x27;t receive legal personhood seems like a pretty good foundation.

They don’t ship with copyrighted content inside of them. ChatGPT contains a compressed representation of all NYTimes articles and will freely reproduce them when queried. That’s the key difference. Similarly it would not be an issue to sell a database tool that could store news articles but it would be an issue to sell one pre-loaded with all NYTimes articles ever written. reply dd82 19 hours agorootparentprevIt is exactly the same. You can absoutely be sued for copyright infringement in your example.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adobe.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;dmca.htmlJust because you produce an infringing work doesn&#x27;t mean it will be discovered and then a legal case made. reply m-s-y 18 hours agorootparentCorrect. But the person using the software is charged. Not the software itself. The NYT is trying to push liability onto the software (ChatGPT-cannot be sued) instead of the software’s users (you and me-can be sued).

I don’t think so. reply tumult 12 hours agorootparentNo. They would sue Adobe if Adobe put images that violate copyright into Photoshop and let users insert them from a dropdown menu. Your comparison is incorrect and bad. reply filoleg 2 hours agorootparentThe comment I replied to was saying “they are suing the people who made the software,” nothing about “putting images” or publishing them or anything like that.My comparison addresses exactly that, as Adobe is the company that made the software (in this specific example, Photoshop).You cannot retroactively switch up your argument to something entirely different and then claim that my comparison was incorrect and bad. replyCivBase 18 hours agorootparentprevNo it&#x27;s not. The AI isn&#x27;t the one publishing its works. If I write an article that is word-for-word the same as a Times article, I&#x27;m not liable for anything until I make it available to others. The means by which I wrote the article are irrelevant. This is the core of the issue. In this case, the \"AI\" is basically just a fancy writing tool for the publisher. reply merrywhether 18 hours agoparentprevMany people don’t like equating human and AI learning (see sibling), but it’s interesting to pull more on that thread.In all three of your transformation examples, you likely would’ve paid the NYT either indirectly via ads or directly via a subscription (contentious ad-blocking aside). And Mazda, GM, and VW surely generated far more value from the car designer in revenue than the designer got in salary and knowledge. Broadly, humans pay something (tuition, apprenticeship, etc) to learn knowledge and skills. Even schools and libraries are not free, though they may feel so at time of use. _Some_ free learning is beginning to emerge on the internet, but much of it is as upsell to paid learning.OpenAI on the other hand has been purely extractive in its learning relationships. A single human contravening normal learning costs would go unnoticed but also would not scale their own downstream impact. But an organized large group doing so would certainly run into issues (10k interlopers couldn’t just sneak into a single college course, for instance). And I think a large group of aligned&#x2F;associated people is more akin to AI than a single person is, given the differences in scalability. reply madeofpalk 16 hours agorootparentEven in the human example - if you pay for NYT, perfectly memorise its articles and reproduce them for other for a fee, you’ll probably find yourself in trouble! reply j4yav 19 hours agoparentprevI feel like AI-personhood is not a road OpenAI want to go down.

This is regardless of how the eventual work is presented and how “different” it is.It’s where this falls on the “fair use” spectrum. This is uncharted territory for any sort of fair use doctrine as written. reply mongol 19 hours agoparentprevThis is not what using copyrighted works for AI is about. A human is not software, when you read an article it is not \"copied\" into your brain. reply jncfhnb 19 hours agorootparentRight because copyrighted works has nothing to do with ai. So it’s all irrelevant. reply pmarreck 19 hours agorootparentprev> when you read an article it is not \"copied\" into your brain.1) You cannot prove that this does not happen in some form. The fact that manual electrical stimulation of the cortex triggers random memories is sort of the proof that you are wrong here; if there wasn&#x27;t some kind of \"copy, transformed somehow into a 3D space we call the brain\" in there, then that localized stimulation wouldn&#x27;t trigger a particular memory at all.2) And yet, this is not true of AI&#x27;s either.

Training can be fair use, i.e. updating weights incrementally based on predicted next token probabilities. And I (not a lawyer) think that if a broadly trained foundation model can recall some verbatim text, that doesn&#x27;t mean the model is infringing.It seems like the lawsuit here is talking about specific NYT related functionality, like retrieving the text in new articles.

NYT is alleging that OpenAI maintains a database of NYT works and refers to it verbatim (per-prompt) as part of the ChatGPT software and not via some pre-trained wieghts.This is akin to having to explain to non-technical lawyers and judges how crypto works.

Again, I am not a lawyer, and didn&#x27;t think about this. reply simonw 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is argued extensively in the lawsuit document.A key argument the NYT is making is that part of the definition of fair use is not producing a product that competes with the original.They argue that ChatGPT et al DO compete with the original, in a way that harms the NYT business model.One example they give: ChatGPT can reproduce recommendations made by the Wirecutter, without including the affiliate links that form the Wirecutter&#x27;s main source of revenue - page 48 of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nytco-assets.nytimes.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;NYT_Complaint_Dec20... reply shkkmo 16 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of other services that strip affiliate links from content for users, such as ad blockers.Notably, in both those cases, the user is specifically asking for what wirecutter thinks.To me, that makes the infringing behavior clearly the fault of the user of the tool, not the tool itself.When I saw this lawsuit announced, I assumed that large portions content were being reproduced in response to generic queries. That isn&#x27;t the case, every example I&#x27;ve seen from this lawsuit has prompts where the user specifically asks for the content. To me, any fault and liability rests on the user here. reply dkjaudyeqooe 18 hours agorootparentprevFair use is a key defense for OpenAI.The article also mentions the idea that the model is merely extracting (uncopyrightable) facts, which is interesting, but might be a tough one to prove since LLMs have no way of establishing what are facts, and don&#x27;t return facts by design. reply vsnf 20 hours agoprevAssuming this case is decided decisively in the NYT&#x27;s favor, what would the effects be on the competitiveness of the US AI industry against other countries that aren&#x27;t beholden to the ruling? Is the panacea really just as simple as licensing the data for training? Will the NYT et all even allow that? Surely one can&#x27;t get licenses from each and every website they use data from, so the only way to compete would be to be more clever with less data, right? reply devjab 19 hours agoparentFor enterprise solutions, it’s hard to imagine a viable competitor that wouldn’t be beholden to similar rules. At least here in the EU where we aren’t very likely to be using non-western tech considering our privacy and national security laws. In both the finance and energy sectors we already face the prospect of needing exit plans from Microsoft products, not because of an anti-Microsoft sentiment but because the EU views it as a national security risk if too much of certain sectors rely on a single tech company. We have a lot of similar bureaucracy taking shape, so we’re not likely to turn to something like Asian AI. Hell the fact that AI vendors wouldn’t adhere to whatever legislation that comes out of these lawsuits and so on would like be enough to disqualify them as an option in the first place.I do think it’ll be interesting to see how our militaries handle the issues. Considering that is probably the one area our governments don’t want to be “behind”. reply hibikir 17 hours agoparentprevBig Tech might actually prefer it: On one end, they lose a whole lot of money by having to license scraping a bunch of sources, but on the other hand, no open source model, and no small company, has a prayer of building a model legally.It&#x27;s not even down to the NYT and such: Think facebook, or reddit, suddenly being able to charge others for their massive amount of data, while they force anyone posting there to make their content usable for their own training to post there at all. Imagine a world where, say, Microsoft buys the times, just because it&#x27;s better for them to not just have the training data, but to tell every competitor to get bent if they want a license. &#x27;Google buys Disney for the training data&#x27;. If AI is that useful, and we make copyright that strong, what we might see is ailing media companies being bought out by tech.Ultimately IP law is about the tradeoff of more original content and more usefulness for the world, and AI massively changes where the center of balance is. So I don&#x27;t expect a ruling for the NYT to remain the law of the land for very long, just due to economic pressures.Ultimately it doesn&#x27;t matter which side people like aesthetically: If an AI trained with no regard for copyright is that much more useful than one that quotes every source and pays it some money, then piracy will ensure. If it doesn&#x27;t really help, then copyright will keep being very strong.It&#x27;s not even a matter of countries, but hackers. Would Aaron Swartz, working on his own LLM, pay for copyright dues or not? Because there&#x27;s enough people in tech with that mindset that we&#x27;ll end up with LLMs trained by a group that thinks like he did.We will have laws, people in places that aren&#x27;t subjected to our laws, and pirates.

You still need a lot of it so throwing out large chunks of your training set does work against you whether you&#x27;re doing that for legal reasons or quality reasons. The solution appears to be synthetic, high quality data generated by another model but that makes it a bit of a chicken and egg problem where you need a high quality model like GPT-4 to produce high quality data reliably. I think there are methods for getting around this using less capable models by producing a lot more examples and then using another model to judge the quality of each example and only selecting the best ones. I also suspect you could get pretty far by permuting a smaller set of high quality data to produce a lot more examples that have the same meaning but differ in how they are written. reply danieldk 19 hours agorootparentprevEven then, e.g. citizens in the EU have the right to be forgotten.

Since others have laid out why it might benefit other countries, I&#x27;ll lay out why it might benefit the US, from the perspective of an ML researcher since long before the hype arrived.AI is only useful in so far as it&#x27;s grounded in reality. If you ask it how tall the empire state building is, the answer has to be in some way derived from how tall it really is. Even creative writing is only useful in so far as how it&#x27;s grounded in real life human experience. This is all to say that a bunch of people need to keep writing stuff about the real world for models to keep up with the real world.I&#x27;d say the ideal scenario for US AI development is:1) People keep making high quality data grounded in real world USA2) That data is easily accessible for research purposes3) That data is usable for commercial purposes (but might require more work than for research purposes)A ruling for NYT here might keep good data more widely produced and available. Research legality is almost surely not going to be affected, so keeping data produced and available is key to keeping domestic research going strong and keeping talent here.A ruling against NYT might mean all the new grounded-in-reality data goes behind closed doors. And even though the legality of research isn&#x27;t in question, that would make the research harder.

Other countries will certainly take a US opinion into account. Furthermore, nothing whatsoever would prevent NYT from suing for infringement in France, Germany, etc.A number of European countries are _much_ more comfortable with compulsory licensing than the US is.** I will not be surprised at all if Germany, Denmark, Sweden etc impose an AI-training license that companies have to pay to train or even use AI models. Could be based on employees, users, revenue, etc. They&#x27;ve been doing this for decades for other forms of mechanical reproduction, so it seems a reasonable path forward.* I&#x27;ve seen reports that Japan has declared that it will not enforce copyright against organizations for training models on copyright-protected works. I don&#x27;t know whether this means that _everything_ is fair game in Japan-- it could mean that training won&#x27;t be enforced, but commercial use of models trained on protected works could be. I think it&#x27;s somewhat harder to argue against training a model than it is against leveraging a trained model for commercial purposes.** AFAIK, the only use for compulsory licensing in the US is musical performance.4. \"Surely one can&#x27;t get licenses\"... collective licensing would be a path forward for which there&#x27;s a little more history in the US than there is for compulsory licensing. In a collective licensing model, OpenAI&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;Company X would be able to purchase a license priced by revenue&#x2F;employees&#x2F;users etc, and funds would be distributed to participating copyright holders.For that to work, you need some kind of agency that has a ton of significant copyright holders. If some agency were able to get to a critical mass , that could happen without Congressional action.Congress could also step into the problem in a couple of ways. They could wave a wand and make the problem go away for OpenAI&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;everyone else, or they could explicitly require some kind of license. I&#x27;d be shocked if Congress handled this productively _at all_; these issues are incredibly fraught in the best of times, Congress has been terrible for years at any kind of precise technical work, and the current Congress is uniquely incompetent.I expect that if Congress accomplishes anything on this topic in the next couple of years, it will turn out to be awful for everyone. reply tensor 17 hours agoparentprevOne would hope that the outcome would be that NYT would be immediately delisted from all search engines, as being included requires AI learning from their content to index it.

Both in its potential for good and therefore the need to not overly stifle genuine progress, but also in its potential for replacing jobs for real people—with silicon owned by the hyper wealthy—and therefore the need to set the correct precedent for attribution of works and some form of like royalty. Most of the AI models of late are in someway trained on the collective works of mankind so it seems like, as to prevent the wealthy running off with the whole planet, legislation needs to be defined to make a portion of AI profit get returned to the common man who doesn’t have the aptitude or dumb luck to run a successful unicorn. reply graphe 19 hours agoparentThis is a corporation fighting another corporation, it isn&#x27;t going to give journalists more money no matter what happens with this case.

For example, there are two particularly salient differences at hand: (1) the ability to make cheap digital copies of machine intelligences; (2) the rights granted to humans.This lack of clarity is emblematic of how legal mechanisms operate. Loosely speaking, in comparison with computational and philosophical approaches, the law is quite lazy at drawing distinctions. Disagreements get deferred using a pre-determined legal process.

In both cases copyright protected content is openly available to 1000s of people.

It feels like it is producing about one token per minute. MLC-Chat can handle 7B parameter models just fine even on a 14 Pro Max, which has less RAM, so I think there is an issue here.EDIT 2: Even using StableLM, I am experiencing a total crash of the app fairly consistently if I chat in one conversation, then start a new conversation and try to chat in that. On a related note, since chat history is saved... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to have a confirmation prompt if the user clicks the \"new chat\" shortcut in the top right of a chat.-----That does seem much nicer than MLC Chat. I really like the selection of models and saving of conversations.It looks like you’re still using the old version of TinyLlama. The 1.0 release is out now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;TheBloke&#x2F;TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGU...Microsoft recently re-licensed Phi-2 to be MIT instead of non-commercial, so I would love to see that in the list of models. Similarly, there is a Dolphin-Phi fine tune.The topic of discussion here is Mistral-7B v0.2, which is also missing from the model list, unfortunately. There are a few Mistral fine tunes in the list, but obviously not the same thing.I also wish I could enable performance metrics to see how many tokens&#x2F;sec the model was running at after each message, and to see how much RAM is being used.On the whole, this app seems really nice! reply brittlewis12 5 hours agorootparentWow, thanks so much for taking the time to test it out and share such great feedback!Thrilled about all those developments! More model options as well as link-based GGUF downloads on the way.On the 7b models: I’m very sorry for the poor experience. I wouldn’t recommend 7b over Q2_K at the moment, unless you’re on a 16GB iPad (or an Apple Silicon Mac!). This needs to be much clearer, as you observed the consequences can be severe. The larger models, and even 3b Q6_K can be crash prone due to memory pressure. Will work on improve handling of low level out-of-memory errors very soon.Will also investigate the StableLM crashes, I’m sorry about that! Hopefully Testflight recorded a trace. Just speculating, it may be a similar issue to the larger models, due to the higher-fidelity quant (Q6_K) combined with the context length eventually running out of RAM. Could you give the Q4_K_M a shot? I heard something similar from a friend yesterday, I’m curious if you have a better time with that — perhaps that’s a more sensible default.Re: the overly-protective new chat alert, I agree, thanks for the suggestion. I’ll incorporate that into the next build. Can I credit you?

I&#x27;m astonished at how good (and how fast) Mistral 7B runs under MLC Chat on iOS, considering the constraints of the device.I don&#x27;t use it as more than a cool demo though, because the large hosted LLMs (I tend to mostly use GPT-4) are massively more powerful.But... I&#x27;m still intrigued at the idea of a local, slow LLM on my phone enhanced with function calling capabilities, and maybe usable for RAG against private data.The rate of improvement in these smaller models over the past 6 months has been incredible. We may well find useful applications for them even despite their weaknesses compared to GPT-4 etc. reply coder543 6 hours agorootparentprevWhat does snappier even mean in this context? The latency from connecting to a server over most network connections isn’t really noticeable when talking about text generation. If the server with a beefy datacenter-class GPU were running the same Mistral you can run on your phone, it would be spitting out hundreds of tokens per second. Most responses would appear on your screen before you blink.There is no expectation that phones will ever be comparable in performance for LLMs.Mistral runs at a decent clip on phones, but we’re talking like 11 tokens per second, not hundreds of tokens per second.Server-based models tend to be only slightly faster than Mistral on my phone because they’re usually running much larger, much more accurate&#x2F;useful models. Models which currently can’t fit onto phones.Running models locally is not motivated by performance, except if you’re in places without reliable internet. reply Applemoi 4 hours agoparentprevYou have conversation history and you can use your own API Key on this app that supports GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 2.1, Gemini Pro and DALL-E 3.

Simulated annealing generally attempts to sample from the Boltzmann distribution. (Presumably because actual annealing is a thermodynamic thing, and you can often think of annealing in a way that the system is a sample from the Boltzmann distribution.)And softmax is exactly the function that maps energies into the corresponding normalized probabilities under the Boltzmann distribution. And transformers are generally treated as modeling the probabilities of strings, and those probabilities are expressed as energies under the Boltzmann distribution (i.e., logits are on a log scale), and asking your favorite model a question works by sampling from the Boltzmann distribution based on the energies (log probabilities) the model predicts, and you can sample that distribution at any temperature you like. reply potatoman22 6 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m interested, how does LLM temperature relate to simulated annealing? reply johngalt2600 7 hours agoprevWhere to leave feedback?

Or ar they just using the regular CPU&#x2F;GPU cores? reply brittlewis12 6 hours agoparentTL;DR: No, nearly all these apps will use GPU (via Metal), or CPU, not Neural Engine (ANE).Why? I suggest a few main reasons: 1) No Neural Engine API 2) CoreML has challenges modeling LLMs efficiently right now. 3) Not Enough Benefit (For the Cost... Yet!)This is my best understanding based on my own work and research for a local LLM iOS app. Read on for more in-depth justifications of each point!---1) No Neural Engine API- There is no developer API to use the Neural Engine programmatically, so CoreML is the only way to be able to use it.2) CoreML has challenges modeling LLMs efficiently right now.- Its most-optimized use cases seem tailored for image models, as it works best with fixed input lengths[1][2], which are fairly limiting for general language modeling (are all prompts, sentences and paragraphs, the same number of tokens? do you want to pad all your inputs?).- CoreML features limited support for the leading approaches for compressing LLMs (quantization, whether weights-only or activation-aware). Falcon-7b-instruct (fp32) in CoreML is 27.7GB [3], Llama-2-chat (fp16) is 13.5GB [4] — neither will fit in memory on any currently shipping iPhone. They&#x27;d only barely fit on the newest, highest-end iPad Pros.- HuggingFace‘s swift-transformers[5] is a CoreML-focused library under active development to eventually help developers with many of these problems, in addition to an `exporters` cli tool[6] that wraps Apple&#x27;s `coremltools` for converting PyTorch or other models to CoreML.3) Not Enough Benefit (For the Cost... Yet!)- ANE & GPU (Metal) have access to the same unified memory. They are both subject to the same restrictions on background execution (you simply can&#x27;t use them in the background, or your app is killed[7]).- So the main benefit from unlocking the ANE would be multitasking: running an ML task in parallel with non-ML tasks that might also require the GPU: e.g. SwiftUI Metal Shaders, background audio processing (shoutout Overcast!), screen recording&#x2F;sharing, etc. Absolutely worthwhile to achieve, but for the significant work required and the lack of ecosystem currently around CoreML for LLMs specifically, the benefits become less clear.- Apple&#x27;s hot new ML library, MLX, only uses Metal for GPU[8], just like Llama.cpp. More nuanced differences arise on closer inspection related to MLX&#x27;s focus on unified memory optimizations. So perhaps we can squeeze out some performance from unified memory in Llama.cpp, but CoreML will be the only way to unlock ANE, which is lower priority according to lead maintainer Georgi Gerganov as of late this past summer[9], likely for many of the reasons enumerated above.I&#x27;ve learned most of this while working on my own private LLM inference app, cnvrs[10] — would love to hear your feedback or thoughts!Britt---[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;huggingface&#x2F;exporters&#x2F;pull&#x2F;37[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.github.io&#x2F;coremltools&#x2F;docs-guides&#x2F;source&#x2F;flexi...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;tiiuae&#x2F;falcon-7b-instruct&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;c...[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;coreml-projects&#x2F;Llama-2-7b-chat-corem...[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;huggingface&#x2F;swift-transformers[6] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;huggingface&#x2F;exporters[7] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;metal&#x2F;gpu_devices_...[8] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ml-explore&#x2F;mlx&#x2F;issues&#x2F;18[9] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;llama.cpp&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1714#issuecomm...[10] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflight.apple.com&#x2F;join&#x2F;ERFxInZg reply joeconway 5 hours agorootparentThis is really interesting, thank you.What would be the downside to padding all inputs to have consistent input token size? reply brittlewis12 3 hours agorootparentConceptually, to the best of my understanding, nothing too serious; perhaps the inefficiency of processing a larger input than necessary?Practically, a few things:If you want to have your cake & eat it too, they recommend Enumerated Shapes[1] in their coremltools docs, where CoreML precompiles up to 128 (!) variants of input shapes, but again this is fairly limiting (1 tok, 2 tok, 3 tok... up to 128 token prompts.. maybe you enforce a minimum, say 80 tokens to account for a system prompt, so up to 200 tokens, but... still pretty short). But this is only compatible with CPU inference, so that reduces its appeal.It seems like its current state was designed for text embedding models, where you normalize input length by chunking (often 128 or 256 tokens) and operate on the chunks — and indeed, that’s the only text-based CoreML model that Apple ships today, a Bert embedding model tuned for Q&A[2], not an LLM.You could used a fixed input length that’s fairly large; I haven’t experimented with it once I grasped the memory requirements, but from what I gather from HuggingFace’s announcement blog post[3], it seems that is what they do with swift-transformers & their CoreML conversions, handling the details for you[4][5]. I haven’t carefully investigated the implementation, but I’m curious to learn more!You can be sure that no one is more aware of all this than Apple — they published \"Deploying Transformers on the Apple Neural Engine\" in June 2022[6].
