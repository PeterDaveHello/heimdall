    "originBody": "This is Willis, aka “Blue Scuti” setting a new world record for the longest game of NES Tetris by getting the first ever level 157. But something unexpected is about to happen. “Oh…oh…oh…oh my god” He just became the first person ever to trigger a game crash, reaching the “True” Killscreen which is by far the biggest milestone in the 34 year old history of the pro classic tetris scene. So why is this such a big deal, and can a record like this ever be broken? To answer both those questions, we need to go back and start with the first “unbeatable” barrier in the game. In NES Tetris, released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989, the goal is to assemble falling blocks to clear complete lines. For every 10 lines cleared, you move up a level and the speed gets a little bit faster. The fastest speed is reached at level 29, and at this point the pieces can no longer reliably get to the sides by holding down the side to side buttons. For decades, this was considered the end of the game, and level 29 got dubbed the “killscreen” because it always killed your run. Except, it wasn’t a killscreen in the traditional sense. In retro games, a killscreen normally refers to when it’s impossible to get any further due to a glitch in the game’s code. For example, in Pac-Man, the killscreen is reached at level 256, where a glitch garbles the entire right side of the screen and you aren’t able to eat enough white dots to clear the level. NES Tetris doesn’t actually have a glitch at level 29. The level is clearable if you can somehow figure out a way to move the pieces faster. And in 2011, Thor Aackerlund became the first person to reach level 30 on video by vibrating his fingers to mash the controller faster than the game’s built in speed, a technique known as hypertapping. And because level 29 is the maximum speed in the game, all the levels afterwards don’t get any faster, so it was theoretically possible to go even higher. Thor’s Level world record would stand for 7 years, until a teenage hypertapping prodigy Joseph Saelee broke it in 2018 by becoming the first player to reach level 31. Joseph’s skill would allow him to win two tetris world championship titles in 2018 and 2019 and he slowly kept pushing the level world record upwards all the way to level 35 until an even faster hypertapper EricICX came along and became the first to reach levels 37 and 38. Now this was light years ahead of what anyone would have expected when the game first came out but overall progress on the record was still slow because hypertapping only barely made level 29 speed possible. Deep runs into the 30s still required getting good luck with the pieces and near perfect placements with almost zero margin for error. In order to truly push things a lot further, some kind of breakthrough was needed. But then a new technique came along that would change everything. In 2020, a tetris player named cheez watched a video on various button mashing strategies and had the epiphany to combine a multi-finger technique by Hector Fly done on arcade cabinets and another technique that used a finger on the bottom of the controller to push it into another finger on the top. He called this new technique rolling and it allowed him to easily reach button mashing speeds over twice as fast as the quickest hypertappers. He became the first player to ever reach level 40, and although a hypertapper named Alex Thach would end up taking the record back, he would be the last tapper ever to do so. Over the next few months there was a flurry of new records as most of the top players in the scene switched over to the new rolling technique culminating in EricICX, now a roller, shattering the record in 2021 by making it all the way to level 95. With the fastest speed in the game now fully mastered, it seemed like the sky was the limit for how far players could go. But as it turns out, an even bigger challenge was looming on the horizon. NES Tetris was originally designed with 10 normal looking color palettes for levels 0 to 9 that were bright, colorful, and easily visible. Every time you go up 10 levels, the game loops then loops around back to the first color scheme. But because this game was coded in the 1980s, everything is written to try and be extremely memory efficient so the line of code that’s supposed to determine the level color glitches out starting at level 138 and starts pulling data from outside the color table resulting in a bunch of random bizarre color palettes that can be difficult to see. If you’re into code and wondering exactly how and why this happens HydrantDude has made a great 2 minute explainer video on the subject that I’ll link in the description. Obviously the colors glitch wasn’t a problem when the game first came out because making it to level 138 would have been a pipe dream but now players were actually on the verge of getting there. Technically the first player to reach the glitched colors was Fractal161 but he opted to go for it on the lesser played PAL version of the game which runs 20% slower than the much more common NTSC version that is used in the World Championships and most of the main leaderboards, including this one. EricICX became the first person to achieve glitched colors on the NTSC version impressively managing to achieve it in an actual tournament match and making it all the way to level 146 before a particularly dim level caused him to top out. He ended up winning the 2022 world championships a few months later. But now the combination of challenges with visibility and sheer endurance were starting to seriously slow down people’s progress again as Eric’s world record game had lasted nearly 40 minutes. It took over a year before anyone was able to get past the dim level that had taken out Eric and when a player named PixelAndy finally managed to beat it, he got taken out by an even more difficult level featuring pieces that were nearly pitch black. “Where are the colors? I can’t see it! Nooooo I could - I couldn’t see it. I couldn’t see it on my screen. It’s just - it just went dark.” So what was the future of the record? Slow incremental progress at increasingly difficult to see levels? Well, it turns out the most significant achievement yet was closer than anyone thought. Back in 2021, a programmer Greg Cannon had made a Tetris playing AI called stackrabbit in order to push the game far beyond what was possible for a human. Not limited by stamina or eyesight, stackrabbit was able to fly past the most difficult glitched color levels with ease, and Greg ended up coining names for each of the color schemes as they passed such as calling the dim level that took out Eric “Dusk”, and the black level that took out Andy “charcoal”. Stackrabbit would continue to play through even more bizarre glitches that happened later on, such as level 235 which lasts for 800 lines instead of the typical 10. But eventually, the game just can’t function anymore. “And there’s the long bar, and it’s gonna crash the game with that tetris into level 237. Its final score is 102 million” So what’s going on here? In the simplest possible terms, the game is running on code which is instructions on what to do next and RAM which is its workspace where it calculates things and keeps track of what it’s doing. The game’s code starts to become really inefficient on very high levels, because no one was expected to get this far, and eventually a glitch happens where the game switches from reading instructions from the code to reading the RAM as if it were code. If the resulting garble generates a stop command, it completely breaks the game, leading to it being called the true killscreen. If you want the full technical breakdown, again HydrantDude has a great video on the topic that I’ll link in the description. But here’s the thing. The game crash doesn’t always happen in the same spot, because the glitch can get triggered by very specific things depending on the level, such as what piece you have or how many lines you clear at once. And stackrabbit was actually playing on a modified version of the game that has 7 digits in the score counter instead of six, so it didn’t have the same crash points as an unmodified version. In 2022 there was a massive effort put into researching the mechanics of the crash, and Hydrantdude made a spreadsheet tallying up every possible situation that could cause the crash to be triggered. Yeah, I know, the same guy again, this guy’s the mvp of documenting all this stuff. And it turns out that the earliest possible trigger for the crash on the unmodified original version of the game was a single at the transition into level 155. That actually wasn’t too far off from the world record! A human might actually be able to do that - provided they could get through dusk and charcoal. In 2023, after Fractal won the world championships and firmly established himself as the best current player in the scene, he decided to start livestreaming daily attempts to get the crash. But on the very first night of his grind, a player named Blue Scuti shocked the scene by being the first player to ever beat charcoal and make it all the way to level 153. Not only did this set a new level world record and score world record to boot, it was only 18 lines away from the first crash. Scuti was a newer player in the scene who’d recently been on a meteoric rise, achieving a surprise semifinals finish in the 2023 world championships. And after the record he decided to challenge Fractal and start grinding for the game crash himself, and later said in an interview, “You know, I just thought if I was so close I might as well race him for it and try and beat him to the crash.” But Fractal looked like he could be getting it any moment. Less than 24 hours later on day 2 of the grind, he had a game early on that went all the way to the level right before the glitched colors. “Are you ready? Oooohhh - oh okay. Hahaha! Ahahaha!” Later on in the night he succeeded in getting to the glitched colors but disaster struck when he hit dusk. “Oh my god. No I got completely blindsided.” Despite not getting the game crash, this game would actually end up taking back the score world record from blue scuti. On day 3, Fractal started up again, ready for another evening of attempts. But just 20 minutes into the stream, the chat alerted him that blue scuti was currently on a big run. “Wait, what is Scuti - what is Scuti at right now? Hooooo my god” Blue Scuti was on a roll, having reached the glitched colors and easily coasted through dusk with a low board. Next up was charcoal. He had a little bit of trouble at the beginning but managed to clutch a line piece to the left to get the stack down to complete the level. Now it was just a matter of carrying the game to the finish line. He slowly kept downing levels, passing his old record and making it to 154. This was it - he just needed a single on the final line clear to get it. But then, 4 lines in, he misdropped. Now in dig mode, he started optimizing his stack for survival instead of singles. He managed to open his board just in time to fill a long bar dependency but oh no! *gasp* “I missed it.” He’d accidentally passed by the crash trigger by clearing a triple instead of a single! Scuti marched onward, unsure of when he’d get another chance. “Oh my god. Just please crash.” The next available target was on level 157, where every one line clear would have a 73% chance of triggering the crash. But as Scuti entered the level, he suddenly started to misdrop again. Nothing was clearing any lines. His chances were slipping away. But in a last ditch effort with a J piece to the left - it happened. “Oh…oh…oh…oh my god” Immediately reactions poured in from the rest of the community. “Ohohhh he did it? He did it?” “Wait! He got it! Oh my god! Let’s go!’ The truly crazy thing about this achievement is that NES tetris had always been considered an unbeatable game. No matter how good you played, eventually your board would reach the top of the screen and the game would be over. This was the first time ever where instead of the game beating the player, the player had beaten the game. And this really feels like a turning point for the scene as a whole. At the time cheez invented the new rolling playstyle, he expressed concern that it was too OP and would eventually destroy the scene. But instead, it’s caused the scene to have a complete renaissance. Concerns about tournament games going too long due to endless lineouts have instead been replaced by rom patches adding a new, faster speed at level 39 that resulted in exciting battles for bigger line clears that are worth more points. The level and score world records, once thought to be getting stale as they turned into a mere endurance challenge, had suddenly given us the most exciting record chase the community had ever seen, with the world records changing hands multiple times in a single week. And now that the game crash has officially happened, there’s a ton of possibilities of where the record chasing can go from here. Players could go for speedrunning the crash or trying to get the highest possible score before it. “I know fractal, he said that he was interested in going for an efficient game crash so I think he’s definitely gonna be coming back for the world record.” “If he’s gonna go for an efficient game crash then I might as well too.” And Blue Scuti as a person feels like a representation of the very best of what the community is. At live events, he’s always been a cheerful and gracious competitor. And he’s shown that hard work really can pay off, as he’s said that he practices around 3-5 hours a day. “Do you have anything to say to the young players out there that may get inspired to play because of this historic game?” “If you set your mind to something and you put work into it, most likely you will get it if you try hard enough.” His first place finish at the Kansas City regional championship this past month was his first live tournament victory and if you’d like to see him play live again, his next appearance will be at the Heart of Texas Regional championship in just a few weeks. But one final question remains - after the game crash, is there any major milestone left to achieve in the game? As it turns out, the answer is yes. What if, instead of intentionally trying to get to the crash as quickly as possible, you instead try to avoid it? Just how far could you possibly get? In order to push the game further beyond what humans and even AIs can currently do, some people in the community have constructed tool assisted speedruns aka TASes, where instead of being played in real time, every move is manually entered in. This allows them to simulate what it would look like if a player was able to avoid all the potential traps that could trigger the crash. This would become almost a fundamentally different type of challenge than any previous one in the game. Instead of being rivals, the player and the game would be working together as a team, with the player doing everything they can to ease the burden of the game’s ancient code limping along keeping them both alive. If both the player and the game survived every pitfall, the final level they would reach is level 255, with a glitched color scheme of pure red. This is the last level that can be stored in the game’s memory. And things are so unstable that 5 of the 7 pieces in the game could trigger the crash when falling normally so the player basically has to push down on every piece to survive. So what happens when the level clears? It loops right back around to level 0. The game officially resets back to the beginning. If the original killscreen was the game’s way of beating the player, and the true killscreen was the player’s way of beating the game, beating level 255 is the rebirth screen, with both the player and the game emerging triumphant together. If it can be done someday, it will be the ultimate final achievement of the original game. Thanks so much to the patrons on patreon who make videos like this one and future videos possible, with an extra special thanks to channel sponsors Scott Gray and SuperAnthony, the creator of Joltzsi. Joltzsi is a game that Anthony originally conceived of when he thought about what Tetris would look like if you played it in 3d. You arrange blocks to clear complete lines on a grid - but with a twist. If you block lands on top of another one, it adds to the number on the block and then you need to make all the numbers in that line the same value to clear it. But if a number goes above 4, you top out and the game is over. The biggest possible move is a giant grid of 4, known as a Joltzsi. I beta tested the game and got the top score on the leaderboard other than Anthony himself, and I can genuinely say it was a really fun take on the puzzle game genre and I can't even imagine how high a top tetris player would be able to score on this. The game is available for early access play on February 13, so if you'd like to play, you can either add it to your steam wishlist or follow Anthony on twitter for future updates through the links in the description. Thanks to Joltszi for being a sponsor, and see you in the next video.",

Once rolling came out a few years ago I totally abandoned trying to keep up. My highest score was almost a maxout on 29Something you&#x27;ll notice too is that the younger players are crushing the traditional players by changing the rules. So, NOBODY at CTWC is playing DAS anymore and I think Jonas was the last big DAS player, before moving to Tapping. I attribute this to anyone over 30 learning in the DAS style while younger players can START with rolling.RIP Jonas Neubauer (NubbinsGoody https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;nubbinsgoody) he was the guy that kind of lead the explosion of Tetris after the movie came out and Thor more or less retired. He and his wife were very helpful to me trying to get to maxout with some tips back in 2018 to get a CRT monitor as that was a limiting factor back then.[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tetris.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DAS reply hannofcart 17 hours agoparentI thought I knew Tetris. I guess I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m just humbled by how little I understood of the comment above. reply crdrost 16 hours agorootparentQuick glossary:DAS - \"Delayed autoshift,\" the delay is between when you press the button and when the long keypress starts to register as multiple clicks, auto-shifting the piece to the sides. So this is kind of a software-based \"convention\" that everyone knows, you open your word processor, you press the down arrow, it goes \"down\" one line and then waits for a quarter-second and then starts going in a more fluid motion steadily downwards as the software converts the continuous keypress to effectively be a stream of down-button-presses. Tetris has this too, if you hold down left&#x2F;right you&#x27;ll move once then after a delay it&#x27;ll start shifting constantly to the edges.tapping, hypertapping - tapping a NES controller very quickly by using pressure in your grip to create a \"springy\" system where you can rapidly flip up&#x2F;down across the actuation point, so that you don&#x27;t wait for the delay and the computer-auto-button-presses but communicate each button-press yourselfCTWC - Classic Tetris World Championship, hosted by the Portland Retro Gaming Expo.Rolling - strategies where you flip tapping&#x2F;hypertapping \"upside down\", so that the hand holding the button in tension is actually pressing on the D-pad while the hand actuating the button rapidly is pressing on the traditional bottom of the controller. I don&#x27;t know what styles are popular but the controller itself might be held upside down to facilitate this. This is something like pressing on your mouse button with two or more fingers in an alternating rhythm in clicky-style games, normally the directional pad is too small to hit with multiple fingers but this technique allows multiple fingers to each register a separate keypress.Maxout - I believe this refers to when the score overflows the digits available for display and the game just tells you that you have 999,999 points and you have to use independent means to confirm how much you actually scoredCRT monitor - hopefully I don&#x27;t have to explain this to folks here but a big bulky sort of display that was used before LCDs became ubiquitous, short for \"cathode ray tube,\" which is a big electron gun that we would eagerly point at our own faces hoping that the electrons all got 100% absorbed by little phosphors on the actual screen, which could be reliably triggered to emit red, green, or blue light. reply rkagerer 13 hours agorootparentAdding one more thing about CRT monitors for younger folks here... they had better refresh characteristics than early LCD monitors (which had lag due to their more complicated electronics&#x2F;processing). reply Retr0id 13 hours agorootparentThey still have better refresh characteristics than LCDs, on paper, although the practical difference becomes negligible. reply mrob 12 hours agorootparentCRTs have better refresh characteristics at the same refresh rate, which is relevant to NES Tetris because it runs at a fixed 60.1Hz (slightly faster than NTSC). But LCDs are available with higher refresh rate than CRTs, so if the software supports it you can get lower average latency on an LCD. reply charcircuit 12 hours agorootparentDo the display controllers for LCDs not wait for an entire frame to be written, so it can display it at once? reply mrob 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s possible to buffer whole frames, but there&#x27;s no technical requirement to do so. Gaming LCDs update line by line. reply shawnz 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are LCDs with a refresh rate more than double 60Hz, so even with entire frames worth of latency they could still be faster than a 60Hz CRT reply Retr0id 12 hours agorootparentThe CRT&#x27;s electron beam gets to \"write\" the video data onto the phosphor in real-time, as the analog signal comes off the wire. reply shawnz 11 hours agorootparentBut only once every 60 Hz (for a 60 Hz display). So, if you have an LCD display with higher latency but also higher refresh rate, you could on average be spending less time waiting for new information. reply Retr0id 11 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re talking about the NES here, the physical output is analog, and locked to ~60.whatever fps reply jonhohle 6 hours agorootparentprevI’m not sure if the NES can, but by the 16-bit era the console can modify what’s being output between scan lines. Obviously that’s only beneficial if the action affects what is below the current scanline, but the way images were drawn allows for techniques that aren’t possible when the entire frame is buffered at a fixed refresh rate.There is also a lot more to latency than just refresh rate. Retro RGB, My Life in Gaming, Digital Foundry and more have volumes on digital signal latency, and it is not as simple as getting a high refresh rate monitor or television. The TV itself can add latency. If going through a receiver, it can add latency. Need to scale a signal from 720p or 1080p to 4K? Maybe you’ll add latency, maybe you won’t. If the display doesn’t have a fast scaler, external devices can be used which will reduce the total latency, even though they may add some of their own (10-33ms). replyjameshart 12 hours agorootparentprevI must be missing something because it doesn’t seem like ‘DAS’ needs such a technical name. Isn’t it just ‘pushing the D pad the direction you want the piece to go, then letting go when it gets there’? reply gorjusborg 12 hours agorootparentDAS is probably shorter than anything most people could come up with to describe the style. Do you think your own description: &#x27;pushing the D pad direction you want the piece to go, then letting go when it gets there&#x27; is a better way to communicate?Almost any sufficiently advanced community will develop jargon that those outside it find confusing or lackluster. reply jameshart 9 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not even a &#x27;style&#x27; though, is it? It&#x27;s just using the controls as designed.Hyperclicking I get - it&#x27;s pushing the button faster than the inbuilt repeat rate. DAS seems to just be.. what people must have been doing before hyper clicking got invented? Were people calling it DAS before hyper clicking became a thing? Or was it a retronym introduced to describe the disadvantages of that technique compared to hyper clicking? reply gorjusborg 6 hours agorootparentThe latter, and that happens all the time. I didn&#x27;t hear ICE vehicle until EV was really on the scene. reply brianpan 11 hours agorootparentprevWell, considering Windows and MacOS have system settings to tune this (key repeat rate and key repeat delay), and considering the modern Tetris innovations are about how you can physically press a button faster, it doesn&#x27;t seem that strange. reply Dwedit 9 hours agorootparentprevDAS was basically a name people came up for to describe how keyboards repeat keys. Initial keystroke, a short delay, then repeated presses afterwards. reply recursive 11 hours agorootparentprevThe selling point isn&#x27;t being \"technical\". It&#x27;s the 20x reduction in syllables. reply shadefinale 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s cool is a lot of the above terms are specific to NES tetris too. Tetris has a lot of depth and there&#x27;s a ton of variants out there depending on what you want to get out of playing.

You would have no idea what you do to a mouse to accomplish such a thing, so you&#x27;re none-the-wiser what &#x27;tapping&#x27; or &#x27;hyper tapping&#x27; actually are (or what the nuanced distinction between them might be).Can you see how they might be confused?Then they were told that &#x27;rolling&#x27; is> The equivalent of putting sharpied electrical tape on your mouse and rubbing it.Again, not having ever considered sharpieing electrical tap, nor what effect it might have if one were to put it on a mouse and rub it (static buildup and a loud squeak possibly?) what is our poor non-elite-gamer to make of this explanation?Now you&#x27;re telling them that it doesn&#x27;t matter how this input rate speed is accomplished.

Years later, I was looking at the Guiness Book of World Records and noticed that the record for the expert minesweeper is something like 25 seconds.Of course, I&#x27;d have to dig up my old computer from a landfill to try and prove it, so I just have to live out the rest of my days knowing that I&#x27;m an unrecognized world record holder. reply itchyouch 13 hours agorootparentFunny story. When my friend started playing minesweeper, I would go to his computer and clear out all of his scores by editing in my scores as \"beating\" him.Being super competitive, in order not to lose to me, he became a fiend at minesweeper, being able to do solve the beginner series in under 20 seconds. As he would get better and better, I would continue to beat his high score until he had the beginner down to somewhere around 7 seconds.I changed it to 6 seconds.He beat it to 5 seconds.I changed it to 4 seconds.At that point he was like, WHAT IS GOING ON?

NES Tetris will give you more points for clearing lines the higher the level is. For example, on level 0 clearing one line gives you 40 points but on level 9 clearing one line gives you 400 points.

NES Tetris is written with the assumption that its main game code won&#x27;t run for more than one frame.

If the game crashes at a certain point, then reaching that crash is a viable state that fits that definition. reply vidarh 14 hours agorootparentprevIf it was just happening randomly and fairly commonly, I doubt anyone would care. The reason people care here is because 1) it&#x27;s a game people have been playing for so long without triggering this state before, 2) the condition was known (from an AI playing, and subsequent analysis) and people had been actively chasing it and were pushing the limits on the number of levels completed at the same time.Pushing limits in games is fun.I&#x27;ve never played competitively, but I remember well my own excitement as a child whenever I managed to trigger a glitch (such as getting enough bonus lives to overflow the lives counter on Commando on C64, which was pretty simple but still was very exciting the first time it happened). reply ImPostingOnHN 17 hours agorootparentprevI guess that&#x27;s the difference between playing a game to the end, and exploiting a game to jump to the end or crash it.

This is therefore the first time someone&#x27;s ever hit the obstacle, and the first time someone&#x27;s ever passed it (since he missed his first chance at glitching and had to take the second).All that said, I feel a bit weird telling a community I don&#x27;t belong to that they&#x27;re incorrectly enjoying a game I don&#x27;t play. reply tedunangst 11 hours agorootparentThe game is man vs machine.

In games it most often refers to a bug that allows for some unintended behavior that may be advantageous for certain desired outcomes, although it also can be just a visual artifact or it could get you stuck.

Standard USB keyboards have a limit on the number of keys you can hold down at once but otherwise the limits are your physical speed rather than the protocol. Similarly, these techniques for fast clicking are still under what even the NES hardware is capable of; this rolling technique allows clicking buttons much more quickly than you normally can but they&#x27;re still a long way from the 30Hz strobe the hardware itself will accept, as used by Tool Assisted Speedruns on real hardware.

I would have though more \"modern\" games , particularly multiplayer, would have software limits even as the hardware got more capable. reply kroltan 16 hours agorootparentQuite the contrary, actually. Some games check for inputs every frame, and computers nowadays can run modern games at up to hundreds of frames per second.The simulation rate is often lower than the draw rate though. Minecraft is as low as 20 updates per second, while something like Counter Strike 2 handles events immediately and sends precise timestamps to the server, not discretized to any sampling rate beyond your hardware. reply Karliss 12 hours agorootparentprevOnline multiplayer games are more likely have proper timers for all the ability cooldowns if anything to allow game designers to finetune the balance between various abilities. Otherwise they would be very quickly exploited by autoclickers (software and hardware). Although stuff like \"rapid fire\"&#x2F;turbo buttons for console controllers with \"100% UNDETECTABLE\" in the marketing materials are very much a thing, so there are probably plenty of exceptions.As for single player games there are barely any reasons for game developers to have improved in this regard over the years. \"OnKeyDown\" is still a standard API in many input libraries and the simplest thing to do is to have this mistake. Unless it&#x27;s an ability with multiple second cooldown where the mistake would be obvious. And that&#x27;s not unique to small games made by beginners or indie devs, AAA games have the same problems. Just few years ago DOOM Eternal had an exploit where mapping jump to a scrollwheel (even better if you have freely spinning scrolwheel), in combination with a few other quirks allowed you to do game breaking jumps skipping large parts of levels by quickly doing a bunch of them in a row and accumulating speed before game noticed that you are above ground and shouldn&#x27;t be able to jump again.

Their business model seems to be selling parts for repairing window blinds, but the site is a treasure trove of information on the topic of window blinds, and the design of the site, organization and presentation of information regarding this specialized topic are beautiful. Just wanted to share it, no affiliation.NB: despite the richness of information, the site fails to help me because it&#x27;s missing info on the specific type of blinds I was interested in ;)EDIT: relevant Wikipedia pages:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Window_blindhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roller_shutterhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Window_shutterhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Window_shutter_hardwareWindow shutters are often used as&#x2F;instead of window blinds in Europe. The linked site sadly doesn&#x27;t seem to cover shutters yet, presumably because they&#x27;re not popular in the USA currently. EDIT: possible explanation by another commenter - \"They&#x27;re hella illegal in America because of weird fire code rules\": https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38845794 reply jsmith45 14 hours agoparentShutters are complicated, as they are really are several different things.For example, interior venetian shutters are closely related to blinds, but are not especially common in the US. Blinds with slats (venetian blinds) can perform a similar function, but can be raised to prevent any blocking of view, while interior venetian style shutters usually swing open and require additional wall-space. such shutters might win on maximum amount of light blocking (even vs wooden slat blinds) but that will vary by shutter design. Cost is certainly a major factor of them being uncommon (but far from unheard of, we even have multiple different names for them) in much of the US.Roller shutters could be considered an exterior equivalent to roller blinds (or roller shades), although roller shutters are often designed with proper blackout capability, which most blinds and shades lack. I presume cost is one of the major reasons these are rare in the US. reply gambiting 1 hour agorootparentThe main reason for using external blinds is heat - in Spain in the summer you want the sun to be hitting a blind outside of your window, not inside it. If you only have an inside blind then it still heats up and warms up the room. reply anthomtb 13 hours agoparentprevAre you talking about shutters on the exterior or the interior? I have plantation shutters in my house, as do several of my middle-America neighbors. Exterior shutters in these parts are almost always decorative.I like the look, ease of tilting the louvers up and down and, most importantly, they are dead simple to clean. But they were not cheap and not easy to install. I could have had high quality fabric shades for half the cost and spent one-third the time on installation.Edit: Maybe its particular to what I installed (Veneta) but good luck fix a single louver if one breaks. The frame which contains them is either glued or very tightly press-fit. I&#x27;m not saying it would be impossible but you&#x27;d need to be careful and probably need to build some sort of jig for re-assembly. reply sarchertech 12 hours agorootparentPlantation shutters are very common on older houses in the South. They’re also pretty common on higher end newer houses. I love them and had them installed when we moved into our current house a couple years ago. reply eysquared 15 hours agoprevThis is near and dear to my own lived experience, having dealt with what should have been a minor fix for Hunter Douglas blinds.The cord that was attached to the clutch broke and got caught in the mechanism itself. When I disassembled the clutch to retrieve the cord, an internal spring came dislodged and twisted causing the clutch to never function correctly again.Understanding exactly which part I needed replaced, I contacted Hunter Douglas, who told me to talk to a local rep. My local rep told me they couldn&#x27;t repair this issue, and I would need to box up my entire window shade and sent it in. The cost was something around $200 for a repair.I spent a lot of time scouring the internet and came across this site where I purchased the entire clutch for around $30. 5 minutes of swapping a good part for bad and I was back in action. reply thechao 11 hours agoparentAt least near me, HD repair is usually based on the area of the blinds; I have this unholy-huge 6.5&#x27; x 6&#x27; blind that the local HD shop wants $1000 to fix ... what I think is the clutch? (Just going off the troubleshooting section.) If I can fix it, myself, for $30, I&#x27;ll be pretty stoked. reply danielecook 8 hours agoprevI ordered parts from here after the plastic hunter douglas cradle pieces I had shattered into a million pieces. I didn’t even know what the parts were called but the site had really good technical drawings and pictures of each piece with their names.Anyways, I’m now considering DIYing some new blinds. My current blinds have 3 cords per window - I am hoping to switch to cordless with a tilt wand (child safety first). Has anyone gone about this before and have any tips? reply hammock 6 hours agoparentI thought HD blinds had a lifetime warranty. Did they not cover it? reply danielecook 5 hours agorootparentI wasn&#x27;t aware of this. It&#x27;s a pre-owned home. I plan to switch to cordless anyway. reply JadoJodo 15 hours agoprevMy Hoover carpet cleaner stopped working sometime in the past few months (between uses). The suction would start up, but the \"motor\" part of it would not turn on when I went to use it. I disassembled it (as much as it&#x27;s designed to be disassembled – no unscrewing things) looking for jams or clogs. Nothing. I called Hoover, but gave up after ~45 minutes on hold waiting to talk to a real person.On a lark, I searched for my issue \"Hoover Carpet Cleaner Won&#x27;t Spin\". I found this[0] video. Apparently, the spinning bit can get stuck if moisture get trapped somewhere inside (who would&#x27;ve thought with it being all about moisture?), which causes the main rotary portion to stop working. A simple hex-bit force-turn sorted it out in 20 seconds.I don&#x27;t know what I would&#x27;ve done had I not stumbled on this issue, but the way things are today, I suspect most people would&#x27;ve thought \"I guess it&#x27;s broken\", taken it to a landfill, and simply gone out to buy a new one.It&#x27;s a real shame that there&#x27;s so much focus on \"every person who owns an ICE needs to immediately drop $30,000+ on an electric vehicle\", when there&#x27;s so much opportunity in the \"let&#x27;s try to fix our stuff instead of dumping it\" category. #righttorepair[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;q9UAEwPM91M reply epiccoleman 15 hours agoparentThere is almost nothing as satisfying to me as being able to fix appliances. I&#x27;ve fixed a few issues with my dishwasher, washing machine, and dryer with just a little gumption and willingness to fuck around. In 2 of the last 3 cases I can think of, I didn&#x27;t even need a new part - just had to mess around a bit to discover the issue. I fixed a non-functional agitator on my washing machine by just finding a stuck actuator, fixed a broken pump on my dishwasher by disassembling it and removing a stuck bit of plastic. My last dryer repair needed parts, but those only cost $30, and a dryer is a very simple machine.If I&#x27;d had to call a repairman or buy a new unit every time one of these problems happened, I&#x27;d have spent thousands of dollars. reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentThat last line is the reason everything is disposable, things got too cheap to be worth hiring someone to fix them.A $30k car? You&#x27;ll pay a mechanic to fix that, it&#x27;s too valuable an asset to just throw away (and even then, you see people selling cars with \"something broken\" that is not economical _for them_ to fix, but if you know how to fix it you can get a car cheap).A $500-1k wash machine? Unlikely to be worth the $100-200 to bring out a repairman (because now you&#x27;re looking at a $200 \"discount\" on a new one, which is probably much more \"advanced\" (if that&#x27;s good) than the existing), so it gets tossed. reply m463 13 hours agorootparent> A $30k car? You&#x27;ll pay a mechanic to fix thatAs long as the vehicle is reasonably dependable. Sometimes an older undependable vehicle might not be worth it. (think of stranding a loved one, or dying in winter, etc)That said, brand new cars without spares are a disturbing trend. reply bombcar 11 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s always a tipping point, but the line for \"literally drag the vehicle to the scrapper\" is much lower than it is for most appliances, and mainly because of residual value - even a completely dead car will have companies willing to take it off your hands for you, or even give you a few hundred for.I knew a retired guy years ago whose speciality was fixing microwaves; any dead microwave you could find he&#x27;d get working again. They still exist, but they&#x27;re nearly impossible to find unless you hear about it.I know I&#x27;d love to find someone to offload these old SpeedQueens on (even there, a burnt out motor was $350 to replace, a brand new one was $700 or so). reply munk-a 14 hours agorootparentprevIt depends how old the washer is though - a lot of times the older ones are just plain better than newer models with their planned obsolescence and weird software junk that frequently is the first component to break. reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve noticed that, (and found certain models that have \"almost feels unauthorized\" fill-and-soak modes).Almost any modern refrigerator is quite reliable and energy efficient compared to ancient ones - but wash machines seem to be retrogressing in quality (and only partially can the blame be laid on the energy&#x2F;water saving requirements). reply m463 13 hours agorootparentprev> There is almost nothing as satisfying to me as being able to fix appliances.On the other hand, a broken appliance is a real let-down. I have this thing that was working, and now I have (laundry&#x2F;vacuuming&#x2F;dishes&#x2F;food) piling up and I have to fix this immediately. reply epiccoleman 8 hours agorootparentTotally - this is one of the reasons I had to learn to fix them. When you&#x27;ve got 3 kids, the washing machine or dryer being broken is an emergency, God forbid a couple of days of backlog laundry pile up!At least with the dishwasher you can just switch to hand washing, doing the same with clothes is a much bigger pain. reply dzhiurgis 5 hours agorootparentOr you can let your kids be dirty for few days :| reply abracadaniel 9 hours agorootparentprevI fixed our central AC during a 100f weekend and never felt like more of a hero for the family. YouTube has been extremely helpful with things like that. Also, shoutout to the AC repair dude who let me buy a capacitor off his truck during his lunch break. reply rkuodys 13 hours agorootparentprevMy experience with oven screen repair was that even if I order all parts that could be the reason for wierd behaviour, it would still be cheaper than call technician to come and tell me for sure which part to change. I gotas lucky on first try, but case still stand that sometimes it&#x27;s just cheaper replace all suspicious parts instead of calling expert to say what&#x27;s wrong (and call second time for replacement) reply tdeck 10 hours agorootparentprevEven non-mechanical fixes can be satisfying. My partner&#x27;s backpack strap tore off while we were on a trip to Japan and really needed it. I&#x27;m not good at sewing, but I grabbed the hotel sewing kit and did a quick and ugly repair, telling him not to wear it on one shoulder anymore since it might only last a few days.Months later my quick ugly repair is still holding and I still see him wearing it on one shoulder. It&#x27;s a nice backpack and I&#x27;m glad we didn&#x27;t throw it away. reply tstrimple 12 hours agorootparentprev> There is almost nothing as satisfying to me as being able to fix appliances.I get that. But I also like new shiny things. So it&#x27;s with a bit of disappointment as well that I keep these appliances limping along. I want the time left in the load projected on the floor dammit! reply tdeck 10 hours agorootparentIf you want that time left in load to actually be accurate, stick with an old washing machine. In my experience the newer ones&#x27; wash time changes frequently throughout the wash and is basically useless. reply cfeduke 15 hours agoparentprevI have fixed numerous home appliances over the past two decades almost entirely thanks to YouTube and eBay, and a willingness to apply myself. If the YouTube video has no intro and its subject is about your problem, you can be almost certain you&#x27;re about to find out how to fix the problem. reply wintogreen74 14 hours agorootparentYT is a great resource for fixing things like appliances, but the devices themselves have gotten (1) shittier, (2) harder to repair and (3) more expensive custom parts - that are themselves less durable. Example: the slide-out for the top rack of my dishwasher exploded, sending ball-bearings everywhere. The replacement part (mostly plastic) cost > $50 and to replace required I disconnect the water & power, uninstall the unit and access the 2 screws on the outside. Great for speeding up assembly in a factory, but ridiculous for any other purpose. reply Bluecobra 14 hours agorootparentI think I have watched every video on how to fix my ice maker from freezing on my Samsung refrigerator and still can’t resolve the issue. I haven’t replaced any parts yet but I am dubious that it will solve it long term. It turns out that putting an ice maker inside the door&#x2F;refrigerator compartment is a fundamentally flawed design. reply d0gsg0w00f 3 hours agorootparentSame thing happened to us. Apparently the year model after ours has a defroster.We just bought a standalone GE ice machine. It&#x27;s a pain to clean but I&#x27;m never taking the 2ft flathead screwdriver to the refrigerator ever again. reply secabeen 8 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, all upgrades and additional functions in a fridge&#x2F;freezer are fundamentally flawed. Large partitioned box that gets cold, compressor system to make that so, some seals and a defrost circuit. That&#x27;s all a fridge should be. No ice maker, no water dispenser, no french doors, no drawers. reply theGnuMe 10 hours agorootparentprevThat or they melt if the seals break... reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is the saddest part, a friend has two wash machines, one is an old top loader and one is a newer front loader; the front loader has been replaced three times whereas the top loader keeps running.It had a control knob burn out and it was $50 or so to get a new one, one of the front loaders had a control board fail and it was $450 for a whole new front panel, which of course means nope. reply nsajko 14 hours agorootparentTo play the Devil&#x27;s advocate, this might just be survival bias manifesting. The old top loader might have accidentally had top 0.0001 quality (tighter-than-average tolerances, etc). reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentNah, it broke \"about\" as often as the others (making allowances for complications and design differences), it&#x27;s just that when it broke, it was fixable for a reasonable amount because there was no computer board in it.A similar but later top loader that I had died almost the same way, but required an entire control board replacement similar to the front loader; too expensive to bother with.(Now an enterprising person could likely have repaired the control board itself, but that&#x27;s beyond my \"remove and swap\" competencies.) reply Bluecobra 14 hours agorootparentprevI spent way too much on my LG front door washer&#x2F;dryer combo that when it breaks down I am going to replace it with a laundromat style Speed Queen. reply masto 12 hours agorootparentprevIt was interesting seeing this from the other side as well. I have what I thought was an obsolete motorized awning with an obscure failure.

I glad I ignored the manual, it said there was no user serviceable parts inside. I won’t be buying anything from them again. reply northernman 13 hours agoparentprevFixed a Hayward salt generator by replacing a burnt out thermistor.Cost was $1.00 for two of them, so I now have a spare.Replacing the entire PCB would have been ~$400+ CAD. reply tanseydavid 15 hours agoparentprev^^^ THIS ^^^It is true, \"Durable-Goods\" are very difficult to come by. reply anthomtb 11 hours agoprevI purchased replacement mounts for a couple shades from this site less than a month ago. The blind was \"MyBlinds by Hunter Douglas\" from Home Depot, purchased in 2019, but that branding seemed long gone. Luckily I was able to dig up the installation instructions, figure out the shape, then FixMyBlinds had enough info for me to get my shades up.Interestingly, FixMyBlinds had Bali, not Hunter Douglas as the manufacturer of the shade. I think (can&#x27;t recall exactly), that Hunter Dougles, Levolor, and Bali may all be part of the same company these days. reply tomjakubowski 15 hours agoprevThis site really has it all.

I followed its recommendations ~1.5 years ago when furnishing a new house and was very happy with the results fitting out 3 bedrooms.Big Q: why is this still a niche situation? Why do only a few sites have this trait? I think it has to do with culture, habits, and laws for each language & culture. Does it vary by language or region? Are some industries more manipulable than others?Similar: amazon somehow gets away with defaulting their search result page to \"Featured\" which means \"people pay us to lie to you\". They still do provide the option to sort by \"best selling\" which at least theoretically is better. I&#x27;d expect a mature citizenry to rebel and force them to have a better default, or at least let you configure your default.I&#x27;m very interested in characterizing variation on these axes across the world and time. Is it really zero sum and always identical? Or do some habits and traits of a region, language, culture, education system make \"better\" systems more likely to survive? Can we even actually fairly characterize better systems? It sure feels like we can, but I&#x27;ve also seen people arguing that for example there is no actual difference between rent-seeking and \"productive economic activity\" on a theoretical level. reply yjftsjthsd-h 9 hours agorootparent> Big Q: why is this still a niche situation?Because - at least in the short term - you can make more money by selling your users. reply epivosism 8 hours agorootparentBut I&#x27;m asking why in some markets there are known relatively trustable sites, but not in others. What causes that? I also assume it varies dramatically by culture, language, region, population, period in history. Why? If you deny it varies, what maintains that?

Basically the persianas consist of connected slats that ride in tracks on the outside of the window, and each slat is connected to the other in such a way that when you roll the persianas all the way down then all the slats slot into each other allowing no light to get through, but when you pull the persianas up then the slats separate just enough to allow the whole thing to roll up. Because persianas ride on the outside of the window they also have some weather (temperature) and sound isolation properties.I&#x27;ve never seen persianas in the U.S., or anywhere outside Argentina. Retrofitting them into American houses would definitely not be trivial as either the persianas would have to roll up on the outside of the house or ride on rails on the inside of the house, or the window header would have to be moved up in order to fit the slats passing from the inside roll to the outside rails. reply bckygldstn 8 hours agoparentThey’re pretty commmin in at least France and Germany: I’ve seen manual “belt operated” ones exactly like your video, as well as fancier electric ones with metal slats and the slat storage box mounted outside.As well as giving true darkness, they also have much better sound and thermal insulation than curtains or blinds.

In America, for outside of the window it&#x27;s \"roller shutters\" for inside the window it&#x27;s \"roller shades\".Most budget roller shades, inside of window, aren&#x27;t true blackout as they don&#x27;t come with a track, but the higher end ones do. reply wheels 8 hours agoparentprevThey&#x27;re also common in Germany, particularly on the ground floor of apartments. reply inimino 15 hours agoprevI used to be neighbors with the owner of this business.

The plastic clips that hold the clutch in place cracked on one side so the inner plastic tube had no friction to hold the inner springs in place. Broke a toothpick up into some small pieces and inserted them into the gap of the clip to keep it pried open and my problem was solved.I thought these would be the type of things this site would go over instead of buying replacement parts (based on the site name), but this site will actually help me identify the correct size of a new clutch if my toothpicks ever fail. reply angry_moose 13 hours agoprevWe went with Roman Shades, and despite spending a significant amount of money on them the garbage plastic mechanisms completely disintegrated within about 2 years.While researching repairing them, we found this guide to build your own: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.onlinefabricstore.com&#x2F;makersmill&#x2F;how-to-make-a-r...We were able to salvage the fabric from the old shades (which was still in good condition), remount it to about $20 of wood and assorted hardware per the guide, and they&#x27;ve been perfect for about 5 years now.It&#x27;s one of a few times we&#x27;ve gotten something that&#x27;s so bafflingly bad that the only explanation is planned obsolescence - for a rounding error in extra manufacturing costs they could have built something that would last decades.

As soon as you have to do more than chat (share files, do meetings, etc) they will let you down.- In most corporate environments there is some extra layer of authentication involved I highly doubt these clients are able to handle.The best way I have found to have a lighter teams experience is to simply use the web version as a PWA. This basically offers you all the features without the extended footprint of effectively running a second browser. reply rjzzleep 4 hours agorootparentprevA little reminder from the past eh? I had to sigh when I read that. I guess purple somewhat died when the companies started banning accounts left and right for using third party clients for using their services. In a few cases it also seems like those bans started happening, because companies wanted to shut down third party clients to make sure people can&#x27;t bypass ads, but also unfortunately to keep them from harvesting data.I kinda have to ask, what features can you enforce in rate limiting in a first party client that you can&#x27;t enforce in a third party client? reply akokanka 4 hours agorootparentprevYup.

Even if you remove all the heavy javascript overload modern webpages will be heavier simply due to higher resolution images and other media.It also highly depends on what you want to browse. HN for example will work just fine without much memory. Expecting YouTube to be as light as 90s websites is asking a bit much.Having said that, I do agree that we have overshot, and many websites are way too heavy for their use case.Sticking with YouTube as an example, assuming for a moment that whatever device you are using does have hardware decoding, so video playback isn&#x27;t dragging down performance. It still is an extremely heavy website due to all the tracking shenanigans, interactive elements and the fact that it is an SPA based design. Alternative front-ends like invidious show it is possible and in the past Google did actually provide light versions of many of their web apps specifically for this sort of use case. Sadly that is no longer the case. reply nyanpasu64 1 hour agorootparentOn my Windows 7 throwback computer running an i5 3570K (a damn near top-of-the-line CPU 10 years ago) with iGPU, in Waterfox YouTube stutters when fullscreen in 1080p (even with enhanced-h264ify and hardware video decoding as far as I can tell), both in YouTube and Firefox&#x27;s pop-out player.

I own two ~2009 netbooks with Intel Atom N270 CPUs and 1GB of RAM each - running Firefox on those is ridiculous, whereas dillo will run very well on these.I used to use dillo on my main desktop too, for browsing documentation that wasn&#x27;t too heavy on CSS - having 20 to 40 tabs open would gobble up a lot of RAM in Firefox, whereas dillo happily stayed around 100MB no matter what I threw at it. My current desktop has enough RAM this not a concern any more, but I have fond memories of using dillo on memory-deficient machines and am a current user still.Also, the lack of a Javascript engine makes it a very secure browser. Whenever I try to open a link that I am suspicious of, I do so in dillo.So thanks to everyone who continues to work on this, I really appreciate the work you do! Dillo is a fine piece of software that I have enjoyed using for at least 15 years now, and I hope it will be around for many years to come!Also, the lack of a Javascript engine makes it a very secure browser. Whenever I try to open a link that I am suspicious of, I do so in dillo.I would suggest using a Chromium or Firefox profile with JavaScript and webfonts disabled for this instead of questionably maintained C software that doesn’t have a sandbox for any of the complex and commonly exploited things it does (image decoding, HTML&#x2F;CSS parsing, network protocols, local file access). reply astowaway 8 hours agorootparentI would say there is a chance that there are fewer vulnerabilities in the 60k~ lines of code contained within dillo than the in the however many million lines of code it takes to do anything with firefox or chromium.running dillo in a bubblewrap container would probably be fine and not eat all of your available resources.[i got my 60k loc number from running tokei in the dillo repo, doing the same in the gecko repo took multiple minutes and pegged 8 cores at 100%, might be a bug in tokei or maybe 21 million lines of code is just enormous] reply rodarima 8 hours agorootparentI would recommend not opening suspicious pages in any browser at all.

I used to do that because all I had to run Linux in ~2003-2004 was a 486dx) and reading some of the comments, I think that Dillo could be a nice alternative to what Gemini was supposed to be.If we could agree on some kind of \"low-tech web\" (a subset of html, a subset of css, a subset of javascript -- or maybe no javascript at all?) then Dillo could be the champion of this. reply anthk 15 minutes agoparentIf a 486 can do TLS with mbedtls, you might be able to run cgmnlm as the Gemini client, albeit slowly. reply anthk 11 hours agoprevYou could try importing some changes from DilloNG:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;w00fpack&#x2F;dilloNG reply nu11ptr 11 hours agoprevHow does this do at rendering modern websites? reply rodarima 11 hours agoparentGenerally not great, as Dillo doesn&#x27;t support Javascript and most modern sites are using it to create content. But if the site degrades well without JS it should render reasonably well. reply krylon 11 hours agorootparentI often use it to read Wikipedia articles. The layout is all jambled up, but the article content itself is fine. If a web site is low on layout, heavy on text, it usually works okay-ish. A lot of web sites these days, however, are an empty skeleton with a bit of Javascript code to load the content - these do not work in dillo, it has no Javascript engine; to a degree, I consider this a feature, but it makes large parts of the world wide web inaccessible. reply anthk 14 minutes agorootparentChange the user agent to this one at ~&#x2F;.dillo&#x2F;dillorc: http_user_agent=\"Mozilla&#x2F;5.0 (PSP (PlayStation Portable); 2.00)\"Then a lot of sites will load a compatible version. reply userbinator 10 hours agoparentprevBasically an approximation of reader mode.

Certainly yes, but the most interesting thing is not the fact that it would have taken me longer: the truth is that I wouldn&#x27;t even have tried, because it wouldn&#x27;t have been worth it.This is the true enabling power of LLMs for code assistance -- reducing the activation energy of new tasks enough that they are tackled (and finished) when they otherwise would have been left on the pile of future projects indefinitely.I think the internet and the open source movement had a similar effect, in that if you did not attempt a project that you had some small interest in, it would only be a matter of time before someone else did enough of a similar problem for you to reuse or repurpose their work, and this led to an explosion of (often useful, or at least usable) applications and libraries.I agree with the author that LLMs are not by themselves very capable but provide a force multiplier for those with the basic skills and motivation. reply vidarh 21 hours agoparentI find that even beyond \"activation energy\", a lot of my exploration with ChatGPT is around things I don&#x27;t necessarily initially even intend to take forward, but is just curious about, and then realise I can do with much less effort than I expected.You can often get much of the same effect by bouncing ideas of someone, who doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to know the problem space well enough to solve things but just well enough to give meaningful input. But people with the right skills aren&#x27;t available at the click of a button 24&#x2F;7. reply nerdponx 18 hours agoparentprevI feel very left out of all this LLM hype. It&#x27;s helped me with a couple of things, but usually by the time I&#x27;m at a point where I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing, the model doesn&#x27;t know any better than I do. Otherwise, I have a hard time formulating prompts faster than I can just write the damn code myself.Am I just bad at using these tools? reply pmontra 16 hours agorootparentI give you an example. I took advantage of some free time in these days to finally implement some small services on my home server. ChatGPT (3.5 in my case) has read the documentation of every language, framework, API out there. I asked it to start with Python3 http.server (because I know it&#x27;s already on my little server) and write some code that would respond to a couple of HTTP calls and do this and that. It created an example that customized the do_GET and do_POST methods of http.server, which I didn&#x27;t even know exist (the methods.) It did do well also when I asked it to write some simple web form. It did not so well when things got more complicated but at that point I already knew how to proceed. I finished everything in three hours.What did it save me?First of all the time to discover the do_GET and do_POST methods. I know that I should have read the docs but it&#x27;s like asking a colleague \"how do I do that in Python\" and getting the correct answer. It happens all the time, sometimes it&#x27;s me to ask, sometimes it&#x27;s me to answer.Second, the time to write the first working code. It was by no means complete but it worked and it was good enough to be the first prototype. It&#x27;s easier to build on that code.What it didn&#x27;t save me? All the years spent to recognize what the code written by ChatGPT did and to learn how to go on from there. Without those years on my own I would have been lost anyway and maybe I wouldn&#x27;t been able to ask it the right questions to get the code. reply jay_kyburz 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been learning boring old SQL over the last few months, and I&#x27;ve found the AIs quite helpful at pointing out some things that are perhaps too obvious for the tutorials to call out.I don&#x27;t mind taking suggestions about code from an AI because I can immediately verify the AI&#x27;s suggestion by running the code, make small edits, and testing it. reply calf 9 hours agorootparentBut this is my pet peeve when people claim this; the only reason is because the AI code is small and constrained in scope. Otherwise the very claim that humans can easily verify AI code quickly would, like, violate Rice&#x27;s Theorem. reply simonw 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d reframe that slightly: it&#x27;s not that you are bad at using these tools, it&#x27;s that these tools are deceptively difficult to use effectively and you haven&#x27;t yet achieved the level of mastery required to get great results out of them.The only way to get there is to spend a ton of time playing with them, trying out new things and building an intuition for what they can do and how best to prompt them.Here&#x27;s my most recent example of how I use them for code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;til.simonwillison.net&#x2F;github-actions&#x2F;daily-planner - specifically this transcript: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;simonw&#x2F;d189b737911317c2b9f970342e9fa... reply steppi 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve developed a workflow that&#x27;s working pretty well for me. I treat the LLM as a junior developer that I&#x27;m pair programming with and mentoring. I explain to it what I plan to work on, run ideas by it, show it code snippets I&#x27;m working on and ask it to explain what I&#x27;m doing, and whether it sees any bugs, flaws, or limitations. When I ask it to generate code, I read carefully and try to correct its mistakes. Sometimes it has good advice and helps me figure out something that&#x27;s better than what I would have done on my own. What I end up with is like a living lab notebook that documents the thought processes I go through as I develop something. Like you, for individual tasks, a lot of times I could do it faster if I just wrote the damn code myself, and sometimes I fall back to that. In the longer term I feel like this pair programming approach gives me a higher average velocity. Like others are sharing, it also lowers the activation energy needed for me to get started on something, and has generally been a pretty fun way to work. reply Ldorigo 16 hours agorootparentprevAs the article says, it helps to develop an intuition for what the models are good or bad at answering. I can often copy-paste some logs, tracebacks, and images of the issue and demand a solution without a long manual prompt - but it takes some time to learn when it will likely work and when it&#x27;s doomed to fail. reply okwubodu 16 hours agorootparentThis is likely the biggest disconnect between people that enjoy using them and those that don’t. Recognizing when GPT-4’s about to output nonsense and stopping it in the first few sentences before it wastes your time is a skill that won’t develop until you stop using them as if they’re intended to be infallible.At least for now, you have to treat them like cheap metal detectors and not heat-seeking missiles. reply countWSS 17 hours agorootparentprevIts useful for writing generic code&#x2F;template&#x2F;boilerplate, then customizing it by inserting your own code. For something you already know better, there isn&#x27;t a magic prompt to express it, since the code is not generic enough for LLM to understand as a prompt.Its best usecase is when you&#x27;re not a domain expert, need quickly to run some unknown API&#x2F;library inside your program inserting code like \"write a function for loading X with Y in language Z\" when you barely have an idea what is X,Y,Z. Its possible in theory to break-down everything to \"write me a function for N\" but the quality of such functions is not worth the prompting in most situations and you better ask it to explain how to write a function X,Y,Z step-by-step. reply ithkuil 13 hours agorootparentprevI felt the same every time I tried to get some help in a subject matter where my knowledge was quite advanced and&#x2F;or when the subject matter was obscure&#x2F;niche.Whenever I tried it on something more common and&#x2F;on in some stuff I had absolutely zero familiarity it did help me bootstrap quicker than reading some documentation would haveThat tells a lot about how hard it is to write&#x2F;find documentation that is tailored exactly to you and your needs reply wharvle 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I’m not sure how often these tools will really help me with the things that end up destroying my time when programming, which are stuff like:1) Shit’s broken. Officially supported thing kinda isn’t and should be regarded as alpha-quality, bugs in libraries, server responses not conforming to spec and I can’t change it, major programming language tooling and&#x2F;or whatever CI we’re using is simply bad. About the only thing here I can think of that it might help with is generating tooling config files for the bog standard simplest use case, which can sometimes be weirdly hard to track down.2) Our codebase is bad and trying to do things the “right” way will actually break it. reply x0x0 16 hours agorootparentprevHere&#x27;s what I find extremely useful:1 - very hit or miss -- I need to fidget with the aws api in some way. I use this roughly every other month, and never remember anything about it between sessions. ChatGPT is very confused by the multiple versions of the APIs that exist, but you can normally talk it into giving you a basic working example that is then much easier to modify into exactly what I want than starting from scratch. Because of the multiple versions of the aws api, it is extremely prone to hallucinating endpoints. But if you persist, it will eventually get it right enough.2 - I have a ton of bash automations to do various things. just like aws, I touch these infrequently enough that I can never remember the syntax. chatgpt is amazing and replaces piles of time googling and swearing.3 - snippets of utility python to do various tasks. I could write these, but chatgpt just speeds this up.4 - working first draft examples of various js libs, rails gems, etc.What I&#x27;ve found has extremely poor coverage in chatgpt is stuff where there are basically no stackoverflow articles explaining it &#x2F; github code using it. You&#x27;re likely to be disappointed by the chatgpt results. reply nickpsecurity 15 hours agorootparentprevI had good results by writing my requirements like they were very, high-level code. I told it specifically what to do. Like formal specifications but with no math or logic. I usually defined the classes or data structures, too. I’d also tell it what libraries to use after getting their names from a previous, exploratory question.From there, I’d ask it to do one modification at a time to the code. I’d be very precise. I’d give it only my definitions and just the function I wanted it to modify. It would screw things up whereby I’d tell it that. It would fix its errors, break working code with hallucinations, and so on. You need to be able to spot these problems to know when to stop asking it about a given function.I was able to use ChatGPT 3.5 for most development. GPT 4 was better for work needed high creativity or lower hallucinations. I wrote whole programs with it that were immensely useful, including a HN proxy for mobile. Eventually, ChatGPT got really dumb while outputting less and less code. It even told me to hire someone several times (?!). That GPT-3-Davinci helped a lot suggests it’s their fine-tuning and system prompt causing problems (eg for safety).The original methods I suggested should work, though. You want to use a huge, code-optimized model for creativity or hard stuff, though. Those for iteration, review, etc can be cheaper. reply teaearlgraycold 17 hours agorootparentprevYou can use LLMs as documentation lookups for widely used libraries, eg: the Python stdlib. Just place a one line comment of what you want the AI to do and let it autocomplete the next line. It’s much better than previous documentation tools because it will interpolate your variables and match your function’s return type. reply packetlost 17 hours agorootparentprevNo, you&#x27;re likely just a better programmer than those relying on these tools. reply ParetoOptimal 17 hours agorootparentThat could be the case and likely is in areas where they are strongest, just like the articles example of how its not as useful for systems programming because he is an expert.If you ask it about things you don&#x27;t know it was likely trained on high quality data for and get bad answers, you likely need to improve your writing&#x2F;prompting. reply packetlost 15 hours agorootparentExcept it&#x27;s most dangerous when used in areas that you&#x27;re weakest because it will confidently spit out subtly wrong answers to everything. It is not a fact engine. reply ParetoOptimal 8 hours agorootparentThat only matters if you use it for things where failure actually causes damage. replysomewhereoutth 21 hours agoparentprevHowever could it be that the &#x27;entertainment effect&#x27; of using a new (and trendy) technology like LLMs provides the activation energy for otherwise mundane tasks? reply times_trw 21 hours agorootparentNo. I&#x27;ve completed projects that have been on the back burner for years in hours. They weren&#x27;t on the back burner for lack of interest but mainly for lack of expertise in a specific stupid area.It&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that I now do two weeks of programming a night. Of course a lot of times the result gets thrown away because the fundamental idea was flawed in a non-obvious way. But learning that is also worth while. reply Klathmon 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s revolutionized our in house tooling at work.No longer do I need to give PR feedback more than a couple times, because we can just ask chatgpt to come up with a lint rule that detects and sometimes auto-fixes the issue. I use it to write or change Jenkins jobs, scaffold out tests, diagram ideas from a monologue brain dump, write alerting and monitoring code, write and clean up documentation.Most recently I wanted to get some \"end of year\" stats for the teams, normally it would never have happened because I don&#x27;t have half a day to dedicate to relearning the git commands, and how to count the lines of code and attribute changes to teams and script the whole process to work across 20 repos.20 minutes later with chatgpt I had results I could share within the company.It&#x27;s just allowed me to skip almost all of the boring and time consuming parts of handling small things like that, and instead turns me into a code reviewer who makes a few changes to make it good enough then pushes it out reply datameta 18 hours agorootparentDoes your company have any considerations for feeding chatGPT source code? Would it not be safer to use a local LLM? reply Klathmon 18 hours agorootparentNot any more than feeding source code to Github. (I personally feel \"source code\" is very rarely the \"secret sauce\" of a company anyway). But where I work we not only have the blessing of the company, we are encouraged to use it because they&#x27;ve clearly seen the benefits it brings.A local LLM would be preferrable all things equal, but in my experience for this kind of stuff, GPT-4 is just so much better than anything else available, let alone any local LLMs. reply lifeisstillgood 18 hours agorootparentprevWait what?ChatGPT does diagrams for you? Writes documentation? reply Klathmon 18 hours agorootparentAbsolutely!I found a plugin a while back called \"AI Diagrams\" that generates whimsical.com diagrams for me. Combined with the \"speech to text\" systems in chatgpt means I can just start babbling about some topic and let it write it all down, collect it into documentation, and even spit out a few diagrams from it.I generally have to spend like 10 minutes cleaning them up and rearranging them to look a bit more sane, but it&#x27;s been a godsend!Similarly I sometimes paste a bunch of code in and tell it to write some starter docs for this code, then I can go from there and clean it up manually, or just tell it what changes need to be made. (technically I tend to use editor plugins these days not copy+paste, but the idea is the same)Other times I&#x27;ll paste in docs and have it reformat them into something better. Like I recently took our ~3 year old README in a monorepo that goes over all the build and lint commands and had it rearrange everything into sets of markdown tables which displayed the data in a much easier to understand format. reply Shocka1 14 hours agorootparentprevSame here - I feel as though it&#x27;s turned me into a super programmer. One of my favorite uses is converting a C# model with a bunch of properties into a SQL table along with their corresponding stored procedures. I used to have boilerplate code and would have to copy&#x2F;paste every property, along with their SQL datatypes. One model might take me 10 to 20 minutes to get translated to a table, and the stored procedures would take me another 20 minutes. Now it&#x27;s all done in 5 minutes tops, and I&#x27;m not having to nitpick datatype issues I may have screwed up in the manual process. reply datagram 20 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, it genuinely lowers the activation (and total) energy for certain tasks, since LLMs are great at writing repetitive code that would otherwise be tedious to write by hand. For instance, writing a bunch of similar test cases. reply apwell23 21 hours agorootparentprevThis is true. I write way more documentation now since llm does all the formatting, structure , diagrams ect. I just guide it at a high level. reply robluxus 19 hours agorootparentDo you use a specialized LLM for diagrams? reply danielbln 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not OP, but I just ask GPT to turn code or process or whatever else into a mermaid diagram. Most of the time I don&#x27;t even need to few-shot prompt it with examples. Then you dump the resulting text into something like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mermaid.live&#x2F; and voilà. reply apwell23 18 hours agorootparentprevI just ask chatgpt to generate text diagrams that i can embed in my markdown. reply kodablah 18 hours agoparentprevI had a project recently: building an advanced Java class file analyzer. I knew a lot about ow2 asm libraries, but it saved me a lot of digging time remembering exact descriptor formats. Also it helped me understand why other static analysis libraries weren&#x27;t good enough for me for stateful reasons.For me, ChatGPT is doing two things: 1) saving trivial StackOverflow and library code walking to answer specific question, and 2) helping the initial project research stage to grasp feasibility of approaches I may take before starting. reply michaelbrave 15 hours agoparentprevto add to that I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people who have things like ADHD saying LLM&#x27;s are life changing more than say neurotypical people. For those of us with bad ADHD doing simple things are the hardest, just taking out the trash or opening the mail is nearly impossible, your internal dialog is screaming at you for hours to just do the thing, but your body won&#x27;t listen. They call it executive dysfunction, but it&#x27;s the bane of my lifeLLM&#x27;s helping to just start the thing is actually a huge deal. reply xnorswap 19 hours agoparentprevFirst automation acts as a powerful lever and enabler, then it replaces you.In 5 years time you may well be more productive than ever. In 15 years I doubt there&#x27;ll be many programming jobs in the form they are recognisable today. reply jgilias 19 hours agorootparentHistorically, automation has always made society richer and better off as a result.There are two guys outside of my window at this very moment getting rid of a huge pile of dirt. One is in an excavator, the other in a truck. There’s a bunch of piles that they’ve taken care of today. Two centuries ago this work would’ve taken a dozen people, a few animals of burden, and a lot more time.Where are the other ten hypothetical people? I don’t know, but chances are they’ve been absorbed by the rest of the economy doing something else worthwhile that they are getting paid for. reply atleta 18 hours agorootparentThere are two problems with this argument. The first, and easier to accept one is that while society might be better off, in the long run , as a result the affected individuals will probably not. We tend to generalize from a single historical example, the industrial revolution and, more specifically, the automatic loom, and in that case the displaced workers ended up doing worse. Better jobs and opportunities only got created later.The other problem is, of course, is that all the historical examples (the data) are too few to generalize from while we do see how these examples are different from each other. As technological evolution progresses, automation gets more and more sophisticated, it can replace jobs that require more and more skills and talent. In other words, jobs that fewer and fewer people were able to do in the first place. This means that the bar for successfully competing in the labor market gets higher and higher and it will get to a point where a substantial number of people will just be plain uncompetitive for any job.Or, at least that was one of the morels until LLMs were invented. (Mostly everyone thought that automation would take over the opportunities from the bottom up in general.) Now it seems that indeed white collar jobs are more in danger for now. But I digress.The point here is that past examples are false analogies because AI (and I moslty mean future AI) is funcamentally different from past inventions. It&#x27;s capabilities seem to improve quickly but we&#x27;re mostly stuck with what evolution gave us. (We, as a species, are evolving but it&#x27;s very slow compared to the rate of technological evolution and also we, as individuals, are stuck with whatever we were born with.) reply ElevenLathe 10 hours agorootparentThe other problem with the excavator argument is that all that amazing productivity isn&#x27;t being pulled from thin air by cleverness -- it&#x27;s burning (limited, polluting) fossilized solar power from a million years ago. We haven&#x27;t avoided all the work of moving the dirt around, but only transferred the burden from ourselves and our horses to our unsustainable energy sector. AI (and all software, really) is similar in that it tries to do the same to intellectual activities: instead of requiring a cheese sandwich and an afternoon, some tasks can be instead be done with a few cents worth of electricity and a few hundred milliseconds, but I still eat the cheese sandwich for lunch, so in the final analysis we&#x27;ve saved time but no other resource.We of course wouldn&#x27;t have to make this explicit calculation if we could incorporate all this knowledge about fossil fuels directly into the prices of goods and services, but this is very difficult thing to do, and so far nobody has managed to do it in a global way.It may still make material sense to use ChatGPT to create slides for middle management meetings, but that is not at all certain in a world with a significant price on emissions (though, to be fair, almost no human activity from the past fifty years stands up to this test either). reply Shocka1 13 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t speak for the parent, but what they said seems true - Henry Hazlitt covers this phenomenon pretty well if you are ever interested. Your two points I think are also true. It won&#x27;t be nice to everyone... Such is life. That being said, my practical mind is telling me to get ahead of it, whether that be learning new skills or whatever it takes to stay competitive. If that means picking another industry&#x2F;profession entirely, so be it. You do what you gotta do. reply idopmstuff 17 hours agorootparentprevI think the other thing people miss is the impact of our existing infrastructure on the speed at which these new technologies can be deployed.Society had a lot of time to get used to the printing press, the advances of the Industrial Revolution and the internet. This is because the knowledge had to spread, and it&#x27;s also because a ton of equipment had to be manufactured and&#x2F;or shipped all over the world. We had to make printing presses, design and build factories, and get a critical mass of people internet-capable computers.AI is fundamentally different, in that the knowledge of AI can spread instantly because of the internet and because the vast majority of the world already has access to all of the hardware they need to access the most powerful AI models.Soon we&#x27;ll have humanoid robots coming, and while they obviously have to be built, we are much more capable now than we were 50 years ago at building giant factories.

It&#x27;s something that an LLM feels like it&#x27;s \"tip of the tongue\" capable of, and in more trivial cases you really can tell GPT to \"rewrite this from JS to Python\" and it works.

OP is clearly an experienced engineer, not a novice using GPT to code above their knowledge. I assume OP usually cares about ergonomics and efficiency in their coding workflow and tools. But so many folks put up with cutting and pasting code back and forth between GPT and their local files.This frustrating workflow was what initially led me to create aider. It lets you share your local git repo with GPT, so that new code and edits are applied directly into your files. Aider also shares related code context with GPT, so that it can write code that is integrated with your project. This lets GPT make more sophisticated contributions, not just isolated code that is easy to copy & paste.The result is a seamless “pair programming” workflow, where you and GPT are editing the files together as you chat.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paul-gauthier&#x2F;aider reply adamgordonbell 19 hours agoparentI like aider. But is there a way to use it to just chat about the code?I use LLMs to chat about pros and cons of various approaches or rubber duck out problems. I need to copy code over for that, but I&#x27;ve not found aider good for these kinds of things, because it&#x27;s all about applying changes.I usually have several back and forths about the right way to do things and then maybe apply some change. reply anotherpaulg 19 hours agorootparentGlad to hear you&#x27;re finding aider useful!Sure, there&#x27;s a few things you could keep in mind if you just want to chat about code (not modify it):1. You can tell GPT that at the start of the chat. \"I don&#x27;t want you to change the code, just answer my questions during this conversation.\"2. You can run `aider --dry-run` which will prevent any modification of your files. Even if GPT specifies edits, they will just be displayed in the chat and not applied to your files.3. It&#x27;s safe to interrupt GPT with CONTROL-C during the chat in aider. If you see GPT is going down a wrong path, or starting to specify an edit that you don&#x27;t like... just stop it. The conversation history will reflect that you interrupted GPT with ^C, so it will get the implication that you stopped it.4. You can use the `&#x2F;undo` command inside the chat to revert the last changes that GPT made to your files. So if you decide it did something wrong, it&#x27;s easy to undo.5. You can work on a new git branch, allow GPT to muck with your files during the conversation and then simply discard the branch afterwards. reply spenczar5 18 hours agorootparentCan I recommend an additional option?

If I have to both choose the files to operate on and do surgery on them so GPT doesn&#x27;t barf, am I saving time vs. using Copilot in my IDE? Going into it, I had thought that coping with the \"code size ≫ token limit\" problem was aider&#x27;s main contribution to the solution space but I seem to have been wrong about that.I hope to try aider again but it&#x27;s in the unfortunate category of \"I have to find a problem and a codebase simple enough that aider can handle it\" whereas Copilot and ChatGPT come to me where I am. Copilot and ChatGPT help me with my actual job on my real life codebase, warts and all, every day. reply anotherpaulg 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sorry to hear you had a rough experience trying aider. Have you tried it since GPT-4 Turbo came out with the 128k context window? Running `aider --4-turbo` will use that and be able to handle larger individual source code files.Aider helps a lot when your codebase is larger than the GPT context window, but the files that need to be edited do have to fit into the window. This is a fairly common situation, where your whole git repo is quite large but most&#x2F;all of the individual files are reasonably sized.Aider summarizes the relevant context of the whole repo [0] and shares it along with the files that need to be edited.The plan is absolutely to solve the problem you describe, and allow GPT to work with individual files which won&#x27;t fit into the context window. This is less pressing with 128k context now available in GPT 4 Turbo, but there are other benefits to not \"over sharing\" with GPT. Selective sharing will decrease token costs and likely help GPT focus on the task at hand and not become distracted&#x2F;confused by a mountain of irrelevant code. Aider already does this sort of contextually aware selective sharing with the \"repo map\" [0], so the needed work is to extend that concept to a sub-file granularity.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aider.chat&#x2F;docs&#x2F;repomap.html#using-a-repo-map-to-pro... reply ilaksh 17 hours agorootparentprevTry again since the token limit increased in November by a factor of 16 (128000 now for GPT-4 Turbo 1106 preview instead of 8000 for GPT 4). reply danielbln 12 hours agorootparentMind the cost though!

Checkpoints aren&#x27;t so useful if you have to keep rolling back and re-prompting, especially once it starts making massive (slow token output) changes. I&#x27;m always using `gpt-4` so I feel like there will need to be an upgrade to the model capabilities before it can be reliably useful. I have tried Bloop, Copilot, Cody, and Cursor (w&#x2F; a preference towards the latter two), but inevitably, I end up with a chat window open a fair amount - while I know things will get better, I also find that LLM code generation for me is currently most useful on very specific bounded tasks, and that the pain of giving `gpt-4` free-reign on my codebase is in practice, worse atm. reply anotherpaulg 16 hours agorootparentThere is a bit of learning curve to figuring out the most effective ways to collaboratively code with GPT, either through aider or other UXs. My best piece of advice is taken from aider&#x27;s tips list and applies broadly to coding with LLMs or solo:Large changes are best performed as a sequence of thoughtful bite sized steps, where you plan out the approach and overall design.

I felt like I&#x27;d hit a wall.Then I thought to feed the decompiler babble to GPT-4 and ask for a clean version. The result wasn&#x27;t perfect, but I was able to clean it up. I swizzled the result into the app, and I&#x27;m pretty sure the bug is gone. (I never found reproduction steps, but the problem would usually have occurred by now.)I never could have done this without GPT-4. reply HarHarVeryFunny 18 hours agoparentThis sounds rather like the junior&#x2F;bad developer who makes a bug disappear (at least for time being) by changing the order of functions in a source file or some such.Admittedly a complete rewrite of a piece of code, even without understanding what you are doing (e.g by using an LLM), is unlikely to have the same bugs as the original implementation (but may have different bugs), but hopefully no-one is doing this for code where bugs have any significant consequence (e.g. system downtime, cost to customers). reply Wowfunhappy 18 hours agorootparentJust to be clear, I do understand the new version of the method. I don&#x27;t entirely know how it fits into the larger system, but that&#x27;s to be expected when I literally don&#x27;t have the source code.When I cleaned it up, I took out some complexity which I believe was responsible for the bug, at the cost of some performance. According to GPT-4, the original version was checking file descriptors to decide when to do work. My version just does the work every 5ms. reply ruszki 18 hours agorootparentSo the parent commenter tried to tell you, that they (and I too) heard this story from junior and bad programmers in the past 20 years all the time, and they didn’t use LLMs. It doesn’t matter whether you use generative AIs or not, it’s a bad way of thinking, and long term it’s not beneficial to anybody. The real problem is that you didn’t dig deeper when you figured out that that code change fixed the problem. reply Wowfunhappy 18 hours agorootparentBut I actually think this is a reasonable way to fix a hard-to-pin-down bug in any context, at least temporarily. (In my case, I don&#x27;t intend to go back because it&#x27;s not my app and mostly for personal use, but that&#x27;s beside the point.)There was a tradeoff between performance and complexity. The high-performance, high-complexity version was buggy, so I switched to a simpler option at the cost of some performance.This isn&#x27;t where the LLM was significant. The LLM was able to make sense of unreadable decompiled code, similar to how the author had ChatGPT translate from compiled assembly code back to C. (Giving GPT-4 the actual assembly never occurred to me, in hindsight I should have tried that first.) reply ruszki 17 hours agorootparentMy job is exactly to fix code which was not understood by its creators. And this “I have no idea why, but it works” (until it doesn’t) is the main cause of most of the problems which I work on.For example, at my current company the developer who introduced a “clever” navigation system didn’t know how HTML forms should be used, and why servers still allowed what they did. It worked. Now, 20+ years later that sole developer’s stupid decision, and lack of HTML best practices will cost my company a few million dollars (and by the way already cost probably a few million). A missing day of learning (and by the way a clear sign, that that developer should’ve never trusted with this task).Senior developers learn this, and I’ve never seen that better developers would be satisfied and would say “yeah, I fixed it”, when they don’t understand the what and how completely, even when it’s not strictly necessary. They burned themselves enough times. reply rictic 14 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;ve got me curious, how did the developer&#x27;s misunderstanding of forms cost millions? Was it submitting duplicate orders? Blocking submission of valid orders causing lost business?I think it&#x27;s an error to bring that up here though, where we&#x27;re talking about someone patching a closed source app for their personal use. Is it worth the cost&#x2F;benefit of decompiling and studying the app&#x27;s code sufficiently long to be highly confident of the fix?Sloppiness and \"good enough\" has its place. So does full effort correctness. reply ruszki 47 minutes agorootparentMaybe you’re right. I hardly disagree, but those are just opinions.The main culprit is that the backend is Java EE, and they used a single form for multiple things. This is a 20+ years old software, so they had to used request parameters and attributes everywhere. It’s impossible to locate where a given parameter is used or where attributes are created and used exactly. That’s the first problem. Second, is this single form per page thing. They use that HTML form for everything. Even page navigation, they just discard unnecessary fields on server side. This means that they change that form from JavaScript all the time. Sometime the generated action is not used at all, it’s overwritten with every event. And a single input can be used for multiple things. Third, they used a very flexible framework, which was outdated 10 years ago, so it definitely needs to be replaced.Add these together, you have terrible spaghetti code for 350+ pages with 1000+ endpoints. There is no separation of code even on HTML level. I know where this “use only one form” came from. I found the ancient doc of that framework, where it mentioned. The problem is that they meant a form object on server side per page (and not per endpoints), and not on client side. And they fucked up completely, because they started to use multiple form objects per page, and single client side HTML forms.So now, replacing that old framework starts with a hefty refactoring, creating individual HTML forms for example. It will take at least half a year for a team, just the refactoring, because it’s very difficult to split those forms, since request attributes and parameters used everywhere. reply Shocka1 13 hours agorootparentprevThis web dev?

So of course antirez&#x27;s relative ability in systems programming would relegate the LLM to other progamming tasks.However! We do not exist in isolation. There is a multitude of human beings around us, hungry for technical challenges and food. Many of them have or could obtain skills complimentary to our own. In working together, our cooperative efforts could be more than the sum of their parts.Perhaps the LLM is better at writing PyTorch code than antirez.

Some people work differently than others and would rather headbutt against a wall on their own for hours than work with other people.In the long term, it is beneficial to have experts as your collaborators. From my experience though, true collaboration is unlocked once you have established a personal relationship with someone, which takes time and repeated effort. Until then, the collaboration is no better than searching the internet or asking chatGPT.Establishing relationships with people is hard and takes a lot of work, and frequently doesn&#x27;t work out like you hope. ChatGPT is a close enough approximation for smaller tasks like the OP describes reply couchand 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s hard, and many of us (myself included) and not great at it. That makes it seem easier to reach for the simulacrum. But at what cost?Homo sapiens&#x27;s superpower is social cooperation. My concern is that these systems will abet the existing social forces which seem to be causing unprecendented levels of isolation of adults, which will continue to drive smart people away from collaboration and towards solitude, at a level far beyond simple prefences would suggest.We already have enough trouble hearing each other through the noise, and understanding what each other has to say. I don&#x27;t have the answers but I&#x27;m looking for them and I do hope other humans will, too. reply ilaksh 17 hours agorootparentYou said yourself. They are \"social forces\". In other words, problems that people created. Not technology problems.I think there is an incorrect worldview that tries to blame human problems on technology.It&#x27;s quite true that isolation is an increasing problem. But the idea that instead of using an AI that can spit out a comprehensive answer in seconds, we should all pretend that such tools don&#x27;t exist, and start constantly asking for help with every idea or request instead, while waiting 3-100 times longer for a less thorough response, is ludicrous.It&#x27;s a great idea to collaborate more and try to avoid isolation. But those are societal problems. They are not caused by the latest tools.Also, as far as humanity&#x27;s \"super-power\" as being collaboration, this is quite a shortsighted comment. I believe that well before AI achieves \"super\" level IQ, it will vastly outperform humans due to other advantages. One of those advantages is speed. Another is the ability to communicate and collaborate much, much more rapidly and effectively than humans.One type of digital life that may take over control of the planet (possibly within decades rather than centuries) would be a type of swarm intelligence with the ability to actually \"rsync\" mental models to directly transfer knowledge. reply ativzzz 18 hours agorootparentprevI think people tend to cooperate only when there are tangible benefits such as:- survival- making money- sex- enjoyment via social interactions (like parties, hangouts, etc)It just so happens that for the majority of our civilization, to get those things, we&#x27;ve had to cooperate, but as we develop technology, our ability to get those things increases and our reliance on others decrease (though in a weird way it increases since technology is complexity so society becomes larger, more complex, and more inter-dependent)We are still in an unprecedented technological boom of computing so we are adjusting on the fly to it. Like the OP says, AI can greatly accelerate independent learning, but eventually that learning plateaus. Once it does, we have to go back to collaboration, but until we find that limit, I think it&#x27;s human nature to push on. reply mistrial9 12 hours agorootparentno - predatory behavior in groups is completely missing from this list.

The key to being productive with an LLM for coding is to be able to understand the code being generated, to avoid rather nasty bugs that may crop up if the model hallucinates. The worst part is that an LLM will create these bugs in very subtle ways, since it excels at writing convincing code (whether or not it actually works). reply nuz 19 hours agoparentprevThe funny thing about LLMs is that there&#x27;s no rush in adopting them. They&#x27;re semi useful but not really right now, but you&#x27;re not gonna be &#x27;left behind&#x27; if you don&#x27;t make use of them. Everyone involved is working their hardest to make them more capable so when that day comes, you&#x27;ll just use it to prompt what you want. But there&#x27;s no rush to try to squeeze out anything out of the current generation which mostly lowers productivity rather than increases it. reply fhd2 19 hours agorootparentMy thinking exactly! There&#x27;s FOMO going on (and being fueled by people most of which seem to hope to somehow make money off it), but the barriers to entry for using LLMs are just not that high. When the tools are good enough, I&#x27;ll happily use them. Today, for the work I do, I found that not to be the case yet. I wouldn&#x27;t advocate for not trying them, but I see no reason to force yourself to use them. reply unshavedyak 18 hours agorootparentYea. TBH the tooling is the bigger issue for me, personally. I come across a ton of times where an LLM might work, or could - potentially. Usually refactors. But it requires access to basically all my files, both for context and to find where references to that class&#x2F;struct&#x2F;etc are.Furthermore, i&#x27;d vastly prefer a workflow most of the time where i don&#x27;t even have to ask. Or so i imagine. Ie i think i&#x27;d prefer a Clippy style \"Want me to write a test for this? Want me to write some documentation for this?\" etc helpers. I don&#x27;t want to have to ask, i want it to intuit my needs - just like any programmer could if pair programming with you.And most of all i want it to have access to all files. To know everything about the code possible. Don&#x27;t just look at the func name in isolation, attempt to understand how it&#x27;s used in the project.If i have to baby sit an LLM for a simple function refactor to give it all files where the function is used or w&#x2F;e, i&#x27;d rather do it myself with tools like AST Grep or even my LSP in many cases.I&#x27;m very interested in LLMs for simple tasks today, but the tooling feels like my primary blocker. Also possibly context length, but i think there&#x27;s lots of ways around that. reply thenevermind 17 hours agorootparentJust to throw my 2c here, since I also want the models to access the whole codebase of (at least) the current project.I had great impression of sourcegraph’s cody. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourcegraph.com&#x2F;cody few months ago.At least with the enterprise version of the sourcegraph that had indexed most of the orgs private repos.The web ui (vscode extension was somehow worse, not sure why) was providing damn good responses, be it code generating or QA&#x2F;explanation about code spanning through multiple repos. (e.g. terraform modules living in different repos)Afaiu it was using the sourcegraph index under the hood. But I never really deep dived into the cody’s design internals (not even sure if they are actually public)That being said, I’ve departed from the org months ago and haven’t used cody since then, so take this with a grain of salt, since the whole comment could be outdated a lot. reply madeofpalk 19 hours agoparentprevI think this is an extremely unfavorable interpretation of the article. I wonder if we even read the same thing?He sees a new tool that others have found interesting, and he identifies ways to use that tool that are useful for him, while also acknowledging where it&#x27;s not useful. He backs it up with plenty of examples of where he found it not-useless. This is not a revolutionary insight, especially for a developer. We constantly use a variety of tools, such as programming languages, that have strengths and weaknesses. Why are LLMs so different? It seems foolish to claim they have zero strengths. reply HarHarVeryFunny 18 hours agorootparentYou might be surprised at the number of large companies who think that \"GenAI\" can be used to replace programmers due to non-technical executives having got the impression that a competency of LLMs is writing code ...Of course they do have uses, but more related to discovery of APIs and documentation than actually writing code (esp. where bugs matter) for the most part.I also have to wonder how long until open source code (e.g. GPL&#x27;d) regurgitated by LLMs and incorporated into corporate code bases becomes an issue. The C suite dudes seem concerned about employees using LLMs that may be publicly exposing their own company&#x27;s code base, but illogically unworried about the reverse happening - maybe just due to not fully understanding the tech. reply rolisz 19 hours agoparentprevSo you&#x27;re suggesting that instead of asking an LLM, we should spend time on Fiverr&#x2F;Upwork to find someone to do random coding tasks that might not fall under our expertise?

If you must have one then use training wheels, experts don’t need training wheels beginners do, simple as that. Though the utility of LLMs goes much further as the author points out, it can often make the boring or tedious parts easier so you can add assistive peddling to the metaphor. To carry it to the end, once you have four wheels and a motor it’s not long before someone invents the car. reply antonvs 18 hours agoparentprevThis seems like a very impractical perspective to me. If there really was a \"hardware store\" that we could head off to to get what we need, it might be different. But in general, that&#x27;s not the case.There can also be significant overhead in looking elsewhere for a solution. That&#x27;s a big part of why so many developers reinvent things. This is often dismissed as NIH syndrome, but there&#x27;s more to it than that.You raised \"introductory macroeconomics\". The economic effect that will most strongly apply in the case of LLMs is that of the technology treadmill (Cochrane 1958): when there&#x27;s a tool that can improve productivity, it will be used competitively so that those who don&#x27;t use it effectively, to improve their productivity, will be outcompeted.This seems like an unavoidable result in typical capitalist economies.Your point about leveraging hungry humans would require strong incentives to overcome the treadmill effect. Most Western countries don&#x27;t have many ways to implement anything like that. The closest thing might be unions, but of course most software development is not unionized. reply bbor 16 hours agoparentprevLike… hiring people?

Before ChatGPT&#x2F;LLM, I had to pull that effort out from within myself, with my fingertips. Now, I can farm it out to ChatGPT.It&#x27;s less efficient, not as powerful as if I truly \"sat down and did it myself,\" but it removes the cost of \"deciding to sit down and do it myself.\" And even then, I&#x27;m cribbing and mashing together copy-pasted fragments from GitHub code search, Stackoverflow, random blog posts, reading docs, Discord, etc. After several attempts and retries, I have a \"5% beginning\" of a project when it finally takes form and I can truly work on it.I sort of transition from copy-pasting ChatGPT crap to quickly create a bunch of shallow, bullshit proofs-of-concept, eventually gathering enough momentum to dive into it myself.So, yes, it&#x27;s slower, and more inefficient, and ChatGPT can&#x27;t do it better than I can. But it&#x27;s easier and I don&#x27;t have to dig as deep. The end result is I have much more endurance in the actual important parts of the project (the middle and end), versus burning myself out on the beginning. reply itomato 19 hours agoparentWas I digging too deeply before?Was I asking the right questions from the beginning, and if not, can I effectively salvage my work?Sunk costs disappear into a $20 subscription reply madeofpalk 19 hours agoprev> I have a problem, I need to quickly know something that I can verify* if the LLM is feeding me nonsense. Well, in such cases, I use the LLM to speed up my need for knowledge.*This is the key insight from using LLMs in my opinion. One thing that makes programming especially well suited for LLMs is that it&#x27;s often trivial to verify the correctness.I&#x27;ve been toying around this concept for evaluating whether a LLM is the right tool for the job. Graph out \"how important is it that the output is correct\" vs \"how easy is it to verify the output is correct\".

Perhaps at times, they seem to reason only because, as semioticians would say, the \"signifier\" gives the impression of a meaning that actually does not exist. Those who have worked enough with LLMs, while accepting their limits, know for sure that it cannot be so: their ability to blend what they have seen before goes well beyond randomly regurgitating words. As much as their training was mostly carried out during pre-training, in predicting the next token, this goal forces the model to create some form of abstract model. This model is weak, patchy, and imperfect, but it must exist if we observe what we observe. If our mathematical certainties are doubtful and the greatest experts are often on opposing positions, believing what one sees with their own eyes seems a wise approach. reply ahgamut 18 hours agoprev> Instead, many have deeply underestimated LLMs, saying that after all they were nothing more than somewhat advanced Markov chains, capable, at most, of regurgitating extremely limited variations of what they had seen in the training set.

Is there a numerical measurement, like training loss or perplexity, that quantifies \"outside the training set\"? Otherwise, I find it difficult to take statements like the above seriously.LLMs can do some interesting things with text, no doubt. But these models are trained on terabytes of data.

LLMs save me from all this more and more every day.This is depressing or tongue-in-cheek considering who he is -- Redis creator -- and has an older post titled &#x27;In defense of linked lists&#x27;, so talking about linked lists in Rust is not \"junk knowledge\" or something an LLM can analyze circles around any human.It&#x27;s the best coding nihilism as a profession post I have read though. reply antirez 19 hours agoparentThere is a misunderstanding going here. A linked list is a pure form of knowledge. What we see today is an explosion of arbitrary complexity that is the fruit, mostly, of bad design. If I learn the internals of React, I&#x27;m not really understanding anything fundamental. If I get to know the subtleness of Rust semantics and then Rust goes away, I&#x27;m left with nothing: it&#x27;s not like learning Lisp. Think to all the folks that used to master M4 macros in the Sendmail, 30 years ago. I was saying the same, back then: this is garbage knowledge.Today we have a great example in Kubernetes, and all the other synthetic complexity out there. I&#x27;m in, instead, to learn important ML concepts, new data structures, new abstractions. Not the result of some poor design activity. LLMs allow you to offload this memorization out of your mind, to make space for distilled ideas. reply emporas 17 hours agorootparentTo rephrase it a little bit.Much of programming, coding and developing is done by a person who is a knowledge worker and writes code. A good proportion of code to be written, will be written just once and never again. The one-off code snippet will stay in a file collecting dust forever. There is no point in trying to remember it in the first place, because without constant repetition of using it, it will be forgotten.LLMs can help us focus our knowledge where it really matters, and discard a lot of the ephemeral stuff. That means that we can be more of knowledge workers and less of coders. I will push it even further and state that we will become more of knowledge workers and less of coders until we will be, eventually and gradually, just knowledge workers. We will need to know about algorithms, algorithmic complexity, abstractions and stuff like that.We will need to know subjects like that Rust book [1] writes about.[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;QMHTMY&#x2F;RustBook&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;books reply gilbetron 18 hours agorootparentprevSpot on - it is one of the main reasons I haven&#x27;t enjoyed programming in recent years, so much of it is learning what you call \"garbage knowledge\". Yet another API, yet another DSL, yet another standard library. Endless reading of internal wiki pages to learn the byzantine deployment system of my current company. Even worse, when I know exactly what I want, but some little dependency or piece of tooling is bad and I spend hours, or days, trying to debug it.I, too, find LLMs a balm for this pain. They have kind-of-basic level of knowledge, but about everything.In short, it allows for a more efficient expenditure of mental and emotional energy! reply abhinavstarts 19 hours agoprev> High levels of reasoning are not required. LLMs are quite good at doing this, although they remain strongly limited by the maximum size of their context. This should really make programmers think. Is it worth writing programs of this kind? Sure, you get paid, and quite handsomely, but if an LLM can do part of it, maybe it&#x27;s not the best place to be in five or ten yearsI appreciate the author writing this article. Whenever I read about future of field, I get anxiety and confusion but then again I think other options too which were available to me was less interest of me.I am now at the place that I still have the opportunity to pivot and focus on pure&#x2F;applied mathematics than being in software field.Honestly I wanted to make money through this career but I don&#x27;t know what carrer to choose now.I keep working on myself and don&#x27;t compare myself to others but if argument is top 1% programmers will be required in the future then I doubt myself because I have still learn lot of things and then how about competing with both experienced & knowledgeable.I was thinking about pin-pointing a target then becoming expert at it (by 10000 hrs rule)I&#x27;m sorry to ask but today or in-general I am very confused which path&#x2F;carrer to Target related to computing, Mathematics. Please suggest and give me your valuable advice. Thank you reply makk 18 hours agoparentI’m not sure you’re focused on the important question. For example: Who you marry, if you choose to go that route, may very well be the most important decision you’ll ever make.Putting that aside, based on your question and willingness to put it out there… I would say this: just surrender to what charms you right now. Do you feel drawn toward programming? Follow that. Or math? Follow that. They may not be mutually exclusive.As you go, stay tuned in to how you feel about the activity in the moment. Not your anxiety about what you think about the future prospects, but just how it feels right now to be doing the thing. That feeling may change over time, and it will guide you if you stay tuned in. reply thomashop 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d say study deep learning (nice mix of maths and CS) or do software but learn to use the AI tools in the process.If you&#x27;re looking at a 5-10 year timeline then even pure or applied mathematics may well heavily use AI models.We&#x27;re always going to need architects that build the scaffolding together with LLMs. Programmers + LLMs will be able to outcompete programmers without. If one programmer can do more it just means projects will become more ambitious not less programming needed.I&#x27;ve never worked for a company that had too little work for their software engineers. Rather many projects are on long timelines because there are only so many hours available per month.Another analogy: with a high level programming language you can do what previously needed 10x the lines of code in assembly. I don&#x27;t think they caused job losses for software engineers. reply throwuwu 18 hours agoparentprevI wouldn’t worry too much about the demand for programmers.

I think stepping back and thinking maybe this thing is just giving us more and more agency and what can we do with that? We need to adapt to not constrain ourselves to just being programmers.

LLMs are, at the very least, just better at answering your questions than putting your question into to google and searching Stack Overflow.About two years ago I got so sick of how awful Google was for any serious technical questions that I started building up a collection of reference books again just because it was quickly becoming the only way to get answers about many topics I cared about.

We need to invest more in our infrastructure so we can keep shipping our products quickly.The main thing you’ll need in this job is curiosity; I work at every layer of a very large stack. One day you might dig into AWS apis, another it’s a 3rd party Ruby gem or our git history. Or maybe you get paged that all the SSDs for Hacker News (primary and standby!) died on the same day :) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32028511.The first few months will be heavier on infrastructure work but in the future the job will hopefully be equal parts developer experience, infrastructure work, and product engineering that impacts all of our products (think SSO, sending email, security, etc).The main products we support are all Ruby on Rails apps running in AWS (mostly in ECS); ideally you’ve already worked on apps like that. You have at least 5 years of experience. Part of that was shipping code to customers but you’ve also got cloud experience (we try to mostly use Terraform).

We’ve built an end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.Healthcare in the United States runs on private and public insurance billing, but providers spend huge amounts of time on faxes, phone calls, and error-prone legacy systems to get paid. That’s not why they got into care.What’s worse, these systems aren’t hugely successful—clinics regularly get back 80% what they know the insurance company should pay. Those missing dollars could be used to hire more care providers to help more kids, but instead line insurance companies’ pockets.We’re changing that.At Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. It starts with ingesting from a clinic’s EHR, then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections.)Our typical paid rate is above 95%.We are a team of 25 with STRONG product market fit—we’ve had to push out onboardings because engineering can’t build quickly enough.You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get doctors and clinicians back to work helping kids.Email me at chris@juniperplatform.com reply wshart 16 hours agoprevGoGoGrandparent (YC S16)FULLY REMOTEFull-timeUS, UK, or able to work 4+ hours overlap with mainland USSenior&#x2F;Staff Backend Engineer$100k-$140k+Build high-quality, robust engineering at the rarest of things - a Silicon Valley startup that is both wholesome AND profitable.

    "originLink": "https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/02/mozilla_in_2024_ai_privacy/",
    "originBody": "Applications 50 Mozilla CEO pockets a packet, asks biz to pick up pace the 'Mozilla way' 50 Which is all about privacy and encryption, apparently Richard Speed Tue 2 Jan 2024 // 11:45 UTC Mozilla closed out 2023 with a report that dodges its flatlining browser market share and Mozilla.social beta in favor of calls for a faster pace from its highly paid CEO. According to the company's filings, Mitchell Baker's compensation went from $5,591,406 in 2021 [PDF] to $6,903,089 in 2022 [PDF]. It's quite the jump considering that revenues declined from $527,585,000 to $510,389,000 in the same period [PDF]. Despite the executive payout, Firefox continues to trail Google and even Microsoft in desktop browser market share. While it has not suffered any catastrophic losses, neither has it made any significant gains. Baker, however, would very much like to speed things up and says in the State of Mozilla report: \"The pace is not enough, the impact is not enough.\" Unsurprisingly for a technology company, the report is heavy on AI going mainstream where Mozilla reckons it can make an impact in the technology, particularly with regard to open source developers and privacy. Mozilla's adventures in AI? The organization says it has 15 engineers working on open source large language models and is working on use cases in the healthcare space. Moez Draief, managing director of Mozilla.ai, said: \"There's a lot of structured data work in that industry that will feed the language models; we don't have to invent it.\" Mozilla decides Trusted Types is a worthy security feature Penguins get their Wayland with Firefox 121 Firefox slow to load YouTube? Just another front in Google's war on ad blockers Google, Amazon, Microsoft make the Mozilla naughty list for Christmas shopping Earlier this year, Mozilla had to hit pause on its AI chatbot after the service served up a worrying amount of nonsense in response to user queries. Chief product officer Steve Teixeira notes in the report the rapid growth of AI and social networks, although warns that Mozilla.social is unlikely to move beyond the experimentation phase in 2024. He says that Mozilla would be \"exploring ways to better integrate advertising while adhering to our focus on privacy and choice,\" including web browsing. Teixeira also acknowledged subscription services such as Mozilla VPN and Relay. It will be interesting to see how Mozilla picks up the pace in 2024. As well as Teixeira's comments regarding advertising, Baker notes: \"We need to be faster in prototyping, launching, learning, and iterating ... This requires rich data, and so we will be moving in that direction, but in a very Mozilla way.\" Surely not slurping telemetry? According to the report, the \"Mozilla way\" is all about privacy, encryption, and keeping customer data safe. Hopefully, it will also be about innovation rather than scattering AI fairy dust over its product line. ® Whitepaper: Top 5 Tips For Navigating Your SASE Journey Share More about Firefox Mozilla Foundation Open Source More like these × More about Firefox Mozilla Foundation Open Source Software Narrower topics AdBlock Plus App Application Delivery Controller Audacity Confluence Database Digital Public Goods FOSDEM Grab Graphics Interchange Format IDE Jenkins Legacy Technology LibreOffice Map Microsoft 365 Microsoft Office Microsoft Teams Mobile Device Management MySQL OpenOffice Programming Language QR code Retro computing Search Engine Software bug Software License text editor User interface Visual Studio Visual Studio Code WebAssembly Wikipedia Wordpress Broader topics FOSS Web Browser More about Share 50 COMMENTS More about Firefox Mozilla Foundation Open Source More like these × More about Firefox Mozilla Foundation Open Source Software Narrower topics AdBlock Plus App Application Delivery Controller Audacity Confluence Database Digital Public Goods FOSDEM Grab Graphics Interchange Format IDE Jenkins Legacy Technology LibreOffice Map Microsoft 365 Microsoft Office Microsoft Teams Mobile Device Management MySQL OpenOffice Programming Language QR code Retro computing Search Engine Software bug Software License text editor User interface Visual Studio Visual Studio Code WebAssembly Wikipedia Wordpress Broader topics FOSS Web Browser TIP US OFF Send us news",

So how is it possible that we as humans collectively just accept this, also psychologically speaking? reply sackfield 7 hours agoparentWhat usually happens here is the board of a company say to themselves \"Let&#x27;s hire a professional CEO\", the next answer then is how, you don&#x27;t see these jobs advertised on LinkedIn, so they get a talent recruitment agency. For C level management positions there are usually 2 options that control the most of the market, these 2 options have rosters of people from well known business schools with experience ready to step in.Because the supply is constrained by these companies the CEO pay increases well beyond market rates, as each CEO will earn X% more than the one before it by faking competitiveness, then the former CEOs will complain (as the Mozilla CEO did here) about relative market rates of other CEOs, even though the market rates are set by the cartel that proposed them in the first place.The board not wanting to rock the boat for the shareholders will generally agree to this extortion for optics, and round and round the merry go round goes. reply FredPret 4 hours agorootparentHow can CEO pay increase “beyond market rates”?They get paid what they get paid and that is by definition market rates.The supply constraint is not due to recruitment companies somehow cornering the CEO market - the very idea is absurd.It’s because large companies need someone with incredibly deep and broad experience to do a job that has a 50&#x2F;50 chance of going well, a 100% chance of being blamed when things go wrong, a 1% of getting due credit when it’s due, and a 100% chance of copping flak from legions of armchair critics like you. reply wkat4242 6 hours agorootparentprevAlso when you buy a CEO you buy their old boys network with it.

For example, David Drummond, who was Chief Legal Officer at Google (until it turned out he was impregnating people who reported to him) was convicted in a lawsuit in Italy, sentenced to prison, and there was a warrant for his arrest if he entered. This was over a video on a part of google that David had no real oversight on, where Google removed a video within only minutes of the issue being reported.I figure legal responsibility is about $1-2M in pay right there.The CEO also plays a critical role (with the CFO) in finalizing the earnings reports, with severe penalties for mistakes. They make strategic decisions that many employees aren&#x27;t even aware of, that can have $billion+ repercussions for the company.Taken all together, it&#x27;s not completely surprising that a CEO of a trillion dollar company makes $10M&#x2F;year (or receives stock of that value).No, it&#x27;s not truly meritocratic.

I&#x27;ve yet to see anyone or anything even close to legally accountable for their behavior. Corporations get caught doing things all the time, and the most I can see is a fine that is typically much smaller than the laws they broke.There&#x27;s no reason for the compensation between executives and workers to be so great.

They will add $50 mln in value per year. If that person asks $5 mln as compensation would it be responsible to say no?Or to take a more concrete example, if Elon Musk decided to quit Tesla in a huff and focus entirely on X and stop dealing with the annoyance of public markets, the stock&#x27;s would probably lose $75 bln in value overnight. If your legal goal is to maximize the company&#x27;s value and it takes $500 mln pay per year to keep that from loss happening, it seems like it&#x27;s probably a good deal to just pay the $500. As another example, Steve Jobs received hundreds of millions in stock options, and that was probably an excellent deal for Apple, though they probably could&#x27;ve hired someone cheaper.I agree there are many cases where a more expensive CEO is actually worse. But I think it is very very easy to imagine cases where it makes a ton of sense to pay a large amount for an expensive CEO if they are the right person for the job and will add 10x more value than their pay. reply ikt 4 hours agorootparent> if Elon MuskThis isn&#x27;t a fair comparison to most companies as Musk has made Tesla largely about him, can you think of many other companies where if the CEO left a 75 billion dollar stock drop would happen? reply bad_username 6 hours agoparentprev> average worker actually responsible for creating valueCEOs actually are generally responsible for creating a lot of value, but most importantly, enabling a lot of value to be created by many others. When there is a causal link from you to a lot of created value, you tend to be paid proportionally well.To believe that value is only actually created by average workers, and not the organizers of this work such as leaders or business owners, is quite short sighted.

I only know two:1) khtml based - Chrome&#x2F;Edge&#x2F;Safari 2) Gecko based - FirefoxThird would be Servo? Any browser uses it? reply jlokier 6 hours agorootparentChrome and Edge use the Blink rendering engine (except on iOS). Safari uses WebKit. Firefox uses Gecko.(Edge used to use its own engine, EdgeHTML, but switched to Blink and EdgeHTML is no longer developed. EdgeHTML was derived from the Trident&#x2F;MSHTML engine, which is also no longer developed.)Blink and WebKit can both trace their history to khtml, but that was a very long time ago.Chrome used to use WebKit (before Edge existed). Blink was forked from WebKit and they diverged about 10 years ago. They are now considered distinct rendering engines with different behaviours.So the big three rendering engines today are: Blink, WebKit and Gecko.All browsers in wide use today use one of those three.On iOS, all browsers use WebKit due to OS policy restrictions. Chrome and Firefox use WebKit on iOS. This works, and different browsers continue to have their own respective featureson top.It is widely thought that if Apple loses the power to limit the rendering engine on iOS due to changes in law, so many web devs will drop testing with WebKit browsers that they will pressure users to install Chrome on iOS instead: \"Best viewed in Chrome. Some site features may not work using other browsers...\". The same way many web devs already dropped testing on Firefox&#x2F;Gecko. Those site features may become critical, such as abitiy to sign in or view some kinds of data. Apps will ship with parts of Chrome&#x2F;Blink directly in the app, saving users the decision.This is what people mean when they say Apple&#x27;s rendering engine policy on iOS may be all that&#x27;s preventing most of the web shifting to Chrome&#x2F;Blink-only dominance, that you won&#x27;t be able to avoid if you need essential services online. reply MBCook 6 hours agorootparentI thought EdgeHTML was a clean sheet. I know they had a way to continue to run the old Trident engine under the hood for compatibility, but I didn’t think EdgeHTML was based on it.Excellent description of the situation. I both think people should get to choose their own browser on iOS, and don’t want them to get to choose their own browser for the reason you stated. reply meatmanek 7 hours agorootparentprevI think they&#x27;re counting Webkit (Safari) and Blink (Chrome) as two separate engines.

I use Safari. It is and has always been my choice since it was released.But I still think it’s better if Firefox exists.——My experience has been kind of odd compared to most. I switched to the Mac before Chrome or Safari came out. When Safari arrived it was vastly faster than anything else at the time. So it became my browser.People on Windows or Linux couldn’t use Safari (I tried the Windows version, let’s not talk about that, ouch). So when Chrome came out, and they left IE&#x2F;FF, they got the same giant performance jump that I liked so much but associated it with a different product. I’m sure I would’ve done the same thing if I was still on Windows.Firefox eventually got way better, becoming what it is today. But almost everyone had already moved to Chrome.I’m left with this sort of weird view of the world. When I did try Chrome it wasn’t noticeably faster than Safari because it was using the same rendering engine at the time, but it had a really different UI design that I didn’t like.So a huge amount of people really love Chrome because of their experiences, and I hate it for the same reason. All because of the order I ended up using browsers in. reply perryizgr8 6 hours agorootparentprev> A lot of people don’t like Safari because it’s from AppleAlso the fact that most people cannot use it.

There is a MASSIVE sunk cost to get a modern browser off the ground compared to a static target.Even if you could do it, Chrome is going to keep moving forward. And they have enough power to change things in incompatible ways that everyone will follow because they have the vast majority of the market.Microsoft made a new modern browser engine. They gave it up because it was too hard to compete with Chrome.When Apple is forced to let people replace Safari, I fear we’re going to get into an IE6 situation.It doesn’t matter how good Chrome is, IE6 was great too. But when the company lets it stagnate for years because there’s no reason to invest, or decides to use it to push their advertising business to new heights, we are all screwed until a new competitor comes around.Firefox only exists because it was built from the Netscape code base. And ‘a modern browser’ was a WAY easier target 20 years ago. What if no group&#x2F;company can muster enough effort to dethrone a stagnate Chrome?The web is in trouble. Even tagging along in 3rd place, Firefox is a good browser that could step up in such a situation. But only if development continues. If Firefox dies next year and Chrome stagnates five years from now we’ll be screwed. reply int_19h 6 hours agorootparentFirefox was not the only competition back then.

I think it was considered one of the best when it was released in 2001.IE 7 came out in… 2006. So IE 6 just sat there for 5 years. And it’s not like ever upgraded to 7 immediately. Lots of corporate PCs kept 6 for many years longer.That’s why it has the reputation it does. By 2006 IE 6 was horribly behind FF by every measure. Tons of security bugs had been found. By 2010 it was a total joke but developers were still having to make the modern web work on it, somehow.If it had been replaced in 2003 or 2004 and MS never paused development no one would remember IE 6 as a dumpster fire.But once you get a total stranglehold on the market, you can do stuff like that. reply grodriguez100 3 hours agorootparentYou are right in that it was way ahead of its competitors (mainly Netscape) when it launched. It had more features, much better performance, and it looked great in comparison.But it also had an insanely huge amount of bugs, half-broken features and “I’ll just do it my way” stuff. This was also true already at launch.Sure, if Microsoft had replaced it in 2003 or 2004, nobody would have such “fond” memories of it even today. But the bad reputation does not come only from the fact that it was not updated for a long time; it also comes from its many problems and issues. reply charcircuit 4 hours agorootparentprev>There is a MASSIVE sunk cost to get a modern browser off the ground compared to a static target.You can incrementally improve the browser.

Don&#x27;t need bat tokens for that.The advertising industry will never take that as an option anyway. They&#x27;re addicted to big data now. They have to sell a hell of a lot of less-annoying non-data-mined BAT ads to compensate, or do with less profit. They&#x27;re not going to be on board.And these tokens don&#x27;t really solve the issue. People hate ads. Trading their ads for slightly less annoying ones when they can do without them altogether is not going to work. How many of those 65M brave users actually opt in to the BAT ads?It&#x27;s just a non-starter and will always be that. Sorry. It&#x27;s just another fairytale spun to dig into VC money pools. reply makestuff 6 hours agorootparentPeople hate ads but they hate paying for content even more. There are startups that offer a pay per article integration for publishers but it never really caught on. Monthly subscriptions to one publisher work decently but people are tired of that too.Ad revenue adds so much juice to the profit margins, just look at Netflix&#x2F;amazon prime&#x2F;etc. None of them could resist the ad tier.I think about this a lot because I dislike the ad tech industry and would like to leave it (even though I currently work in it) but I honestly don’t know what the solution is besides ads. reply wkat4242 6 hours agorootparentI know, but BAT isn&#x27;t going to transform the ad industry. It has nothing to offer to them that they don&#x27;t have now and will only make things harder for them.The only thing that will do that is a legal framework that forbids tracking so untracked ads are worth more because they no longer have to compete with the tracked ones. After all there will be no retargeting etc. It will have to be purely contextual.The EU unfortunately stopped short of doing that and created the cookiewall plague in the process. For which they are rightfully blamed.Ps I don&#x27;t really hate paying for content but the \"sign up for a recurring $20 monthly subscription just to read this one article\" like most sites are doing now is complete BS too of course. Of course nobody wants that unless they are already a regular reader. reply qp11 6 hours agoparentprevWhat the above lacks is a finance model of how to make it work with real numbers. reply wmf 6 hours agorootparent$500M per year isn&#x27;t enough to develop and market a browser? reply ycdxvjp 5 hours agorootparentToo many technical people talk without being capable of generating revenue.Instead of developing that finance capability lets cry about how others are supposed to raise funds and hand it to us.

The rest are useless loudmouths. reply scarface_74 6 hours agoparentprevSo how is doing all of this “free” stuff going to increase revenue? reply lupusreal 7 hours agoparentprevMozilla doesn&#x27;t need any Mastadon instance. They need to stop pretending to be a social media company and focus all their resources on browser development.Their only reason for being involved in social media in the first place is because it gives them a plaything for their forays into censorship and narrative engineering. This is one aspect of the cancer Mitchell Baker has been cultivating in Mozilla reply whakim 6 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t understand this oft-regurgitated opinion that Mozilla needs to \"focus all their resources on browser development.\" Mozilla does focus a large portion of their resources on browser development. Firefox is fast enough and has an interface that&#x27;s largely similar to its main competitors. It works pretty well. This is a browser we&#x27;re talking about. What special features do you think Mozilla could build that&#x27;ll magically allow Firefox to claw back huge chunks of market share? And why do you think that Mozilla isn&#x27;t building those features due to lack of focus - surely they build browser features and do other things simultaneously? In my opinion, building a killer non-browser thing might be one of the only ways to save Firefox - after all, the history of browsers shows us that successful ones typically piggyback off of successful non-browser things (Windows, Google, iPhone, etc.) reply vasac 5 hours agorootparentThey removed XUL without providing an API to replace it, even for some very popular use cases (TabMixPlus comes to mind). I lost a few (to me) important extensions and had a hard time finding replacements. For me, extensions were the major thing that differentiated Firefox from other browsers, as I could customize it exactly as I liked. reply whakim 5 hours agorootparentI certainly respect your take. I just don&#x27;t think that XUL is a killer feature that vast numbers of people are clamoring for. reply COGlory 7 hours agorootparentprevFirefox engineering is in a pretty good spot. What they need now is clout and market share to bring in income and brand awareness. I&#x27;m not sure how else to achieve that? They need people to associate them with being the good stewards.

Some US states have down the same. Trust in these big tech companies has cratered. reply boomboomsubban 6 hours agorootparentprev>Firefox engineering is in a pretty good spotIt is strange that a moron surrounded by morons taking Firefox solely in non-good directions could accomplish that. reply COGlory 5 hours agorootparentFirefox would be better off if it was technically a worse browser but more relevant. The function (and central marketing claim) of Mozilla and Firefox is that it is an alternative to big tech controlling the entire internet. It has completely failed at that mission. At one point, it was failing because engineering. 10 years later they&#x27;ve finally corrected that, about 8 years to late, and at the cost of tying themselves to Google and losing all their relevance. Again, this is a zero sum game. Firefox only has value as an alternative to big tech if it has enough relevance to prevent Google and Microsoft from abandoning standards. And it has failed spectacularly in that arena. It spent all its relevance, has failed to recoup it, and is now reliant on Google to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars solely to pay the bills. Mitchell has been at the helm for nothing short of an unmitigated disaster. reply Gigachad 6 hours agorootparentprevFirefox as a browser is doomed no matter what Mozilla does. People installed Firefox because the default browser sucked. Now the default browser doesn’t suck. reply wkat4242 5 hours agorootparentChrome still isn&#x27;t the default on any major desktop OS (ChromeOS is far from major) and only on one of the two mobile platforms.Yet people go out of their way to install it even over edge on windows which is kinda the same thing.

And we don&#x27;t even know if he&#x27;d have done a better job (though this is admittedly not hard)Eich wouldn&#x27;t have made a change to prop 8, no. But the culture at and image of Mozilla would have changed. reply reducesuffering 51 minutes agorootparentOk so we have the benefit of hindsight, but I say, let&#x27;s predict these things better. Principles are worthwhile to speak out for, but if we have better predictions on getting better outcomes, we should lean towards those better outcomes and not certainly dig our own grave by latching onto what may be a misguided principled stance. I&#x27;m quite sure that most of the people, that care about an independent successful Firefox and celebrated Eich&#x27;s ouster, now regret that. We need to change our mindset when what happens is viciously descending on someone, years after the fact, for donating to what was a majority opinion in a liberal state. And yet ignoring or giving a pass to the years of continued actual malfeasance running Firefox thereafter. If it means actually accomplishing good things in the world, an independent web, I&#x27;m willing to give people leeway, nowhere close to what they&#x27;re giving current Mozilla.

    "originBody": "Daemonic Dispatches Musings from Colin Percival A Canadian payroll dependency chart The Canada Revenue Agency publishes, on a regular basis (they're now up to the 119th edition), a document entitled \"Payroll Deductions Formulas\". This document contains all of the formulas needed to calculate payroll deductions collected by the CRA: Canada Pension Plan, Employment Insurance, and Income Tax. As someone running a small business in Canada and not wanting to use an external payroll provider, I implement these formulas myself in a spreadsheet. Unfortunately, like most aspects of the tax system, this steadily increases in complexity, and this year with the Canada Pension Plan including not just \"base\" premiums and \"additional\" premiums but also \"second additional premiums\", I needed to rewrite my spreadsheet from scratch; and also very unfortunately, the authors of the document have failed to grasp an essential detail of software: You have to calculate values before you use them. This results in a document requiring constant jumping back and forth to find where each value is calculated — before or after it is used. To help myself keep everything straight, I decided to draw a dependency chart using GraphViz. There are 79 nodes in the graph, starting with values like \"Year's Annual Maximum Pensionable Earnings\" ($73200 in the 2024 tax year), and ending up with \"Total payroll deductions\". Note that I did not write the formulas onto the chart — I simply recorded which other values they depend upon, so someone (aka myself) looking at the chart can figure out what to calculate first without going around in circles. Oh, and to keep things simple, I assumed I wasn't dealing with commissioned employees, employees entering or exiting the Canada Pension Plan, or anyone resident in Quebec, Nova Scotia, Yukon, or Ontario (each of which has their own special tax complications).

I tried to get API access to my bank account and was told by my bank that Open Banking is not for physical persons. I tried to the same for my nonprofit and was told that only licensed PSD2 TPPs (\"third-party providers\") can use it. The national bank issues those licenses, but provides no information on what the process for obtaining one is. I called some friends and got in touch with someone at a major payment services provider, who explained that to get their license, the national bank insisted on them having essentially unlimited-coverege insurance - something no insusrer in the country was even willing to sell at any price. They managed to get the insurance from elsewhere in the EU and whole process cost them \"six figures\". Even after that, you still don&#x27;t get full access to their own accounts, because the whole API is built on the idea of connecting customers with fintech apps, so there are a bunch of limitations intended for privacy and security that don&#x27;t make any sense in a \"I want full access to my own account\" scenario. All the advice I got was \"just keep scraping\". How the fuck do they dare call that \"open\" banking?!?reply viraptor 1 hour agorootparentI wouldn&#x27;t even trust the API with the numbers. The CSV and OBX published by a number of banks I used were always broken in some interesting but obvious ways.

The calculation should be listed explicitly in the mortgage documents.I&#x27;ve also struggled through figuring it out on my own, and the two things that got me to less than a dollar of difference were: 1) \"Mortgage\" in Canada is a specific legal term used for fixed term mortgages that compounds every 6 months. Therefore, to get your effective annual you take you have to convert it: ((1 + nom_rate&#x2F;2)^2)-1 2) You then take your effective rate, divide by the days in the year to get your daily rate. You then take your daily rate, multiply it by your outstanding principle, and multiply it by the number of days since your last payment. That result is the amount of interest you pay, and the rest of your payment goes to pay down principle.In practice, I have a monthly payment, and just divide my annual effective rate by 12, and call it close enough. The extra precision of daily vs monthly isn&#x27;t worth the extra complexity in the spreadsheet. reply humanlion87 16 hours agorootparentprevI was in the same boat. I ran into similar discrepancies until I realized that I was not accounting for the number of days in the month correctly.One option is to call the mortgage department and ask them to provide the split.

This tends to increase the cost of housing while taxpayers are taking on the interest rate risk instead of the banks.The U.S. is an anomaly with these loans.

We have ce tral bank interest rates which are relatively stable (except recently), and mortgages are given out as a function of that rate (e.g. rate + 2.4%). After the central bank rate changes, at the next three month period they use the new rate to adjust your mortgage payments. reply j45 10 hours agorootparentprevPaying off mortgages quickly is often a topic, how much faster it happens compared to the US is another thing.Typically, you decide on how you are going to approach the interest rate, and for how long. Owners can lock in for a fixed interest rate, or a variable rate that changes with prime. Term is most often 5 years, but latesly shorter or more flexible mortgages are more popular, sometimes between 2-4 years, and some folks who might take a risk on a 5+ year mortgage rate.The variable rate mortgages out performed fixed rate mortgages for nearly 15-20 years.

Most of it is from politicians wanting to name things.For example, for decades Canada has had a \"personal amount\" tax credit -- for arcane reasons, rather than saying \"the first $X of income isn&#x27;t taxed\", the lowest tax bracket starts at $0 but there&#x27;s a non-refundable credit equal to the lowest tax rate times $X. Then a politician came along and said \"we should increase the personal amount so that people can earn more money without paying taxes... but we don&#x27;t want to decrease taxes on the top 1%\". So now we have a \"personal amount\" which depends on your income. Similarly, in BC we have the \"BC Tax Reduction\" which is an extra tax credit given to people with incomes between (roughly) $22k and $36k.Both of those examples could have simply been implemented as tax brackets but voters get far more excited about a \"Tax Reduction\" than they do about a new tax bracket. reply jessriedel 15 hours agorootparent> None of this complexity is from trying to plug tax loopholes. Most of it is from politicians wanting to name things.The effect you describe is very real, but \"loop hole closure\" is certainly a source of complexity too, e.g., the US&#x27;s insane alternative minimum tax (AMT), which nearly duplicates the amount of tax work to be done by insisting you compute your taxes under a second set of assumptions. The idea was to make sure people who were using \"loopholes\" (or just like, reasonable features of the tax system) to pay at least above a certain amount.Of course, the sane solution would have been to choose tax policies that combine together reasonably.

And there are many such laws. And those individual laws can be updated or repealed; and new laws can also come in that, through a few simple statements, make sweeping changes to the meanings of other laws.As such, the tax-filing instructions, ideally, have to be constructed in such a way that they cope efficiently with someone being able to pull a single jenga-block out of the tower that is tax law, that topples over a whole slew of other instructions and definitions. The team of tax lawyers and technical writers that maintain the instructions should not have to sit down and rewrite every instruction on every schedule&#x2F;form, just because one of the core definitions changes. Because that&#x27;s gonna happen a lot! Every year, even!If I was in charge of a team of (automation-minded) lawyers and technical writers maintaining the tax-filing instruction repository, I&#x27;d probably, ideally, want to factor out the instructions into separate modular files per law — with each file acting as a sort of Aspect-Oriented equivalent of Javadoc. (Or, actually, something very much like Inform 7. See e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i7-examples.github.io&#x2F;Bronze&#x2F;source_1.html)So you&#x27;d see:• Paragraphs that interpolate definitions as constants from other laws&#x27; modules;• paragraphs that have implicit AOP hooks for other laws&#x27; modules to inject additional language into;• the ability of a law to override specific sentences or wording of the language of the laws so far;...and so forth.This would be hell to read, but it&#x27;d sure make the job of dealing with changes in the law easy. (And it wouldn&#x27;t be something you&#x27;d really read anyway — more often, it&#x27;d be something you&#x27;d carefully poke at, while watching the compiled result change live in a split pane. Like writing LaTeX in LyX.)---To be clear, I don&#x27;t imagine that any existing set of tax-form language is actually maintained using some weird AOP DSL.Rather, I imagine that the maintainers are manually doing the same business process that use of such an AOP DSL would formalize.They&#x27;re maintaining a very non-intuitive \"storage architecture\" for all the instructions that go into these forms, to minimize re-working when the law changes; and then — mostly manually, but maybe with a bit of Excel — collating them together into new schedules and forms each year.And it&#x27;s that \"storage architecture\" — despite not being something as rigid as source code — that still nevertheless forces the language of the instructions into the form you see at tax-filing time, with the weird grammatical shapes, the distant definitions, etc. reply btilly 16 hours agorootparentI have a simpler theory.The law is the way it is because of the influence of lobbyists. Those lobbyists include lobbyists for companies that do things like payroll.

For the rest of the time I lived in Canada I hired a CPA.The IRS is warm and fuzzy by comparison. At least if you screw up, the fine is proportional to the amount you under report.

The tool identifies biconnected components and draws the nodes of the component on a cir‐ cle. The block‐cutpoint tree is then laid out using a recursive radial algorithm. Edge crossings within a circle are minimized by placing as many edges on the circle&#x27;s perimeter as possible. In particular, if the component is outerplanar, the component will have a planar layout. If a node belongs to multiple non‐trivial biconnected components, the layout puts the node in one of them. By default, this is the first non‐ trivial component found in the search from the root component. reply mmsc 16 hours agorootparentDoing a bit more digging, it&#x27;s using cytoscape[0] which is similar to graphviz.

The formula has to do with the amount of provincial taxation that a province charges its residents versus the rest of Canada.

Some of the Federal income tax that Quebec residents pay ends up going to the province, so it&#x27;s not just coming out of the income tax of non-quebec residents. replyorzig 16 hours agoprevI&#x27;m in the US but I&#x27;ll say for sure that things like this are about half the reason I haven&#x27;t hired any employees for my LLC.

The representation ended up being that each form line value was a Scheme procedure that called other such procedures, which was one way to enforce dependencies. (Fortunately, there were no cycles in the dependencies, like the article author found in their CRA payroll deductions work.)I don&#x27;t have the code handy, but the procedures typically looked like this: (define (form-1234-line-22--foo-income-dollars) 234.00) (define (form-1234-line-23--taxable-bar-income-dollars) (max (+ (form-1234-line-22--foo-income-dollars) (form-1234-line-21--baz-income-dollars) (form-1234-schedule-x-line-10--total-blort-dollars)) 0.00))It was a lot of work, but (since I used error placeholders for many code paths my own data wouldn&#x27;t exercise) not that much more work than I had to do anyway, for doing my returns with just the PDF forms and instructions. (The extra work came when I had to enter and double-check the form data manually in the official format, for this one-off exercise.)I did this exercise to see what it would look like, would it save me time&#x2F;headache, and did it suggest anything about DSLs for this kind of work (say, for domain experts to codify and maintain something more formal and checkable than the form instructions or tax code). reply jdmichal 15 hours agoparentI used to do the same with just Excel.

For example, if we find everything can be implemented as these procedures, or with maybe with an additional concept (such as to handle cycles like in the article), a simple first step DSL might be another s-expression language that has magic variables that are more akin to spreadsheet cell references, in that the dependencies are evaluated in order. And it might also do things like populate a hashtable with the cached values for application use (e.g., PDF form-filling). That DSL might be implemented as a simple `syntax-case` or `syntax-parse` transformer. If that works and could, we could optimally make it more palatable&#x2F;marketable&#x2F;politic by defining a keywords-and-whitespace grammar that parses by transforming those syntax objects to syntax objects in our intermediate s-expression DSL (which transforms to the basic Scheme code approach we worked out originally).There are other valid ways (say, you want tax law logic to be definable dynamically at run time).

The UK seems reasonable for most.For the employed, you let your employer worry about it. You might occasionally get given a \"tax code\" which essentially equates to your tax free allowance. If that happens you just let your employer know and they&#x27;ll sort it, and you can confirm by checking your payslip.If you&#x27;re determined to have over or underpaid tax (e.g. your income went down unexpectedly), your tax code for the following year will be adjusted so that you&#x27;ll end up clawing back the money over time.Unless you are self employed or have special circumstances, then you&#x27;ll avoid having to file a \"self assessment\" form.And to be clear, the \"special circumstances\" are nothing like the US&#x27; system of hundreds of different \"deductions\".Even if you do have to fill in a self assessment form, you can do so with an online form, which actually takes into account answers rather than making you manually have to do things such as \"Skip section 5 if you have put a number of in section 4b or a number less than 3340 in section 2a\" that the US forms love to make you do.Filing my US taxes is literally 99% of all paperwork I have to do each year, and I don&#x27;t even earn enough to actually have to pay anything. Yet I still have to calculate everything, then write down the right numbers in the \"foreign earned income exclusion\" boxes, then tally it all up to make sure it&#x27;s still zero, then make sure I&#x27;ve copied the right numbers to the right boxes and haven&#x27;t mistakenly transposed any numbers, then copy those zeroes down to the right boxes through the rest of the 1040.The UK has had this system for decades, it has had online tax filing since 3 July 2000. It&#x27;s had PAYE (pay as you earn tax, i.e. tax deduction at source) since 1944.The UK feels stagnant as heck, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend people actually move here, but its tax system is trivial to the point of ignorable if you&#x27;re employed. reply Tade0 16 hours agoparentprevI can give you a primer on the system for independent contractors in Poland:-Flat minimal monthly pension contribution either filed as a business expense or just deducted from gross income - subtly different, but functionally the same as long as you have income. Calculated as the pension contribution of someone making 60% of the average wage - the exact number is published on an annual basis.-Income tax: every January you can select one of several schemes:1. Two brackets - 17% and 32% with the first 30k PLN ($7k USD) tax-free and ability to file taxes together as a married couple, in which case you effectively average out your and your spouse&#x27;s incomes and pay taxes accordingly.2. 19% flat rate, no tax-free range, no rules like for marriages.3. 12% flat rate, mostly same as 2., except on top of that you can&#x27;t file business expenses. There a few different rates in this scheme, but IT generally falls under the group charged 12%.Healthcare contributions depend on tax scheme chosen above and are calculated as a percentage of gross income from the previous month minus deductions and expenses.1. - 9%, 2. - 4,9%, 3. - 3%.That is mostly it. Regular employees have more complicated rules with employer contributions on top of gross income and small deductions like for living sufficiently far from the workplace, having an internet connection and whatnot, but they don&#x27;t add up to much. reply pzduniak 16 hours agoparentprevIn Poland there are some complexities when you run a company &#x2F; employ, but as an employee it&#x27;s relatively straightforward UX where you click through a government-operated \"income tax fillings wizard\" and either just OK a pre-filled declaration or add a couple missing items. Paper filling is a bit more complicated, but I think you can get help at the tax office to get 1 or 2 forms sorted out.For self-employment I send 2 documents per month regarding my expenses (which is somewhat easy if you understand the rules), plus one or two summaries per year. Hiring is a bit more complicated, I only file simplified declarations for employing private people as contractors.

Tax law is complex by design, partially because it seeks to do things that are simply impossible, and partially because anybody with enough power to influence changing it benefits from the complex quagmire of ambiguous laws. The complexity allows the IRS to run roughshod over most people and businesses, but the truly powerful can do almost anything they want if they pay for enough advisors and lawyers. The system is in a perfect equilibrium in that respect.I personally think that if a government fails to enforce a law to a reasonable standard, then the law should be invalidated.

They receive cash from the sale of goods and services. They have to divide up that cash to spend on the ingredients needed to run the business: real estate rent, supplies, maintenance, and labor. Labor can be subdivided into categories like salary, bonus, medical insurance, 401(k) plans, etc.In the status quo, 401(k) plans exist and have certain tax advantages, so employers feel compelled to make contributions to the plans. But if you pretend there&#x27;s a universe where 401(k) doesn&#x27;t exist at all, then the employer will just have to allocate that cash towards something else - like paying higher salaries, buying better office facilities, or whatever.Here&#x27;s a real-life example from a ~10-person startup that I worked for. The company was debating about whether to purchase group health insurance benefits for us. The employees casually talked about how much they actually spent on healthcare each year, and we realized that our average spending was significantly lower than the average cost per person that the company would pay to enroll in the plan. So we agreed to decline the plan and asked the company to focus on cash compensation.Remember, money is fungible and there&#x27;s no free lunch. reply irrational 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m wondering the same thing.

Ignore it - it&#x27;s verbal diarrhea.Employer match is \"free money\" (there&#x27;s no \"gotcha\" other than vesting schedules) and 401k is a part of the American tax code whereas this is an article about Canadian payroll.I presume they are complaining about the fact that employers actually budget their match it as part of total compensation or whatever. So it&#x27;s \"really just a part of your salary.\" Or perhaps they are just mad they have to put the match into the 401k and can&#x27;t opt to redirect that part of their salary to a non-tax advantaged account.

I’m not one to gatekeep, so here’s how you can get yourself a nice local ocr ‘service’ that works in the terminal/CLI/python and costs 0 dollars: ((by the way sharing Shortcuts is really weird which is why I’m having you do this all manually…)) (also, most of the stuff below only needs to be done once – after that, actually ocr’ing is easy) open the Shortcuts app in your Applications folder click the “+” button to create a new shortcut in the right sidebar, search for “extract text” you should see “Extract Text from Image” in the list of possible actions. drag it from the right sidebar into the main area on the left in the “Extract text from …” action that’s now on the left, click on the pale “Image” blue-ish pill pick “Shortcut Input” you’ll see a big “Receive Any input from Nowhere” action appear above the “Extract text from Shortcut Input”. it’s all good, leave it as is in the right sidebar, search for “copy”. you should see “Copy to Clipboard”. drag that action below the “Extract text from …” one dragging the “Copy to …” action below the “Extract from …” is really annoyingly hard. just keep dragging it really below and it will work at some point your final setup should look like this: in the last action, make sure that after “Copy” it does say “Text from Image”! you’re like almost done!! in the window title bar, type stuff to name the shortcut. because I’m from a generation, I recommend naming it “extract-text” or “ocr-text” or something simple with no spaces and all lowercase. sorry. press enter after naming the shortcut otherwise it won’t remember the name (…??) ok you may be actually done here I think try out the shortcut in your terminal: shortcuts run ocr-text -ithen try command-V – do you see the resulting text? if yes, you’re good to go!!! from python, you can do the following: import subprocess file_path = '... some file path ...' ocr_out = subprocess.check_output( f'shortcuts run ocr-text -i \"{file_path}\"', shell=True ) print(ocr_out) THAT’S IT! x",

I was super impressed with the Apple&#x27;s vision framework. I used it on a personal project involving the OCRing of tens of thousands of spreadsheet screenshots and ingesting them into a postgres database. I tried other OCR CPU methods (since macOS and Nvidia still don&#x27;t play nice together) such as Tesseract but found the output to be incorrect too often. The vision framework was not only the highest quality output I had seen, but it also used the least amount of compute. It was fairly unstable, but I can chalk that up to user error w&#x2F; my implementation.I used a combination of RHetTbull&#x27;s vision.py (for the actual implementation) [1] + ocrmac (for experimentation) [2] and was pleasantly surprised by the performance on my i7 6700k hackintosh.I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a programmer but I can generally troubleshoot anything if given enough time, but it did cost time.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;RhetTbull&#x2F;1c34fc07c95733642cffcd1ac5...[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;straussmaximilian&#x2F;ocrmac reply RockRobotRock 10 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s better than Tesseract?

Thanks for sharing. reply lelandfe 10 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience using it constantly, it is far beyond Tesseract’s.I have never gotten truly garbled output from Apple’s, whereas Tesseract will frequently produce random Unicode characters from text.Apple’s also handles things like overlapping text or changing font sizes and typefaces far better than any open-source OCR I’ve used. reply laborcontract 6 hours agorootparentprevIMO it goes head to head with the anazon&#x2F;google cloud OCR services.

    "originLink": "https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/",
    "originBody": "cURL and libcurl, Security The I in LLM stands for intelligence January 2, 2024 Daniel Stenberg Leave a comment I have held back on writing anything about AI or how we (not) use AI for development in the curl factory. Now I can’t hold back anymore. Let me show you the most significant effect of AI on curl as of today – with examples. Bug Bounty Having a bug bounty means that we offer real money in rewards to hackers who report security problems. The chance of money attracts a certain amount of “luck seekers”. People who basically just grep for patterns in the source code or maybe at best run some basic security scanners, and then report their findings without any further analysis in the hope that they can get a few bucks in reward money. We have run the bounty for a few years by now, and the rate of rubbish reports has never been a big problem. Also, the rubbish reports have typically also been very easy and quick to detect and discard. They have rarely caused any real problems or wasted our time much. A little like the most stupid spam emails. Our bug bounty has resulted in over 70,000 USD paid in rewards so far. We have received 415 vulnerability reports. Out of those, 64 were ultimately confirmed security problems. 77 of the report were informative, meaning they typically were bugs or similar. Making 66% of the reports neither a security issue nor a normal bug. Better crap is worse When reports are made to look better and to appear to have a point, it takes a longer time for us to research and eventually discard it. Every security report has to have a human spend time to look at it and assess what it means. The better the crap, the longer time and the more energy we have to spend on the report until we close it. A crap report does not help the project at all. It instead takes away developer time and energy from something productive. Partly because security work is consider one of the most important areas so it tends to trump almost everything else. A security report can take away a developer from fixing a really annoying bug. because a security issue is always more important than other bugs. If the report turned out to be crap, we did not improve security and we missed out time on fixing bugs or developing a new feature. Not to mention how it drains you on energy having to deal with rubbish. AI generated security reports I realize AI can do a lot of good things. As any general purpose tool it can also be used for the wrong things. I am also sure AIs can be trained and ultimately get used even for finding and reporting security problems in productive ways, but so far we have yet to find good examples of this. Right now, users seem keen at using the current set of LLMs, throwing some curl code at them and then passing on the output as a security vulnerability report. What makes it a little harder to detect is of course that users copy and paste and include their own language as well. The entire thing is not exactly what the AI said, but the report is nonetheless crap. Detecting AI crap Reporters are often not totally fluent in English and sometimes their exact intentions are hard to understand at once and it might take a few back and fourths until things reveal themselves correctly – and that is of course totally fine and acceptable. Language and cultural barriers are real things. Sometimes reporters use AIs or other tools to help them phrase themselves or translate what they want to say. As an aid to communicate better in a foreign language. I can’t find anything wrong with that. Even reporters who don’t master English can find and report security problems. So: just the mere existence of a few give-away signs that parts of the text were generated by an AI or a similar tool is not an immediate red flag. It can still contain truths and be a valid issue. This is part of the reason why a well-formed crap report is harder and takes longer to discard. Exhibit A: code changes are disclosed In the fall of 2023, I alerted the community about a pending disclosure of CVE-2023-38545. A vulnerability we graded severity high. The day before that issue was about to be published, a user submitted this report on Hackerone: Curl CVE-2023-38545 vulnerability code changes are disclosed on the internet That sounds pretty bad and would have been a problem if it actually was true. The report however reeks of typical AI style hallucinations: it mixes and matches facts and details from old security issues, creating and making up something new that has no connection with reality. The changes had not been disclosed on the Internet. The changes that actually had been disclosed were for previous, older, issues. Like intended. In this particular report, the user helpfully told us that they used Bard to find this issue. Bard being a Google generative AI thing. It made it easier for us to realize the craziness, close the report and move on. As can be seen in the report log, we did have to not spend much time on researching this. Exhibit B: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability A more complicated issue, less obvious, done better but still suffering from hallucinations. Showing how the problem grows worse when the tool is better used and better integrated into the communication. On the morning of December 28 2023, a user filed this report on Hackerone: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in WebSocket Handling. It was morning in my time zone anyway. Again this sounds pretty bad just based on the title. Since our WebSocket code is still experimental, and thus not covered by our bug bounty it helped me to still have a relaxed attitude when I started looking at this report. It was filed by a user I never saw before, but their “reputation” on Hackerone was decent – this was not their first security report. The report was pretty neatly filed. It included details and was written in proper English. It also contained a proposed fix. It did not stand out as wrong or bad to me. It appeared as if this user had detected something bad and as if the user understood the issue enough to also come up with a solution. As far as security reports go, this looked better than the average first post. In the report you can see my first template response informing the user their report had been received and that we will investigate the case. When that was posted, I did not yet know how complicated or easy the issue would be. Nineteen minutes later I had looked at the code, not found any issue, read the code again and then again a third time. Where on earth is the buffer overflow the reporter says exists here? Then I posted the first question asking for clarification on where and how exactly this overflow would happen. After repeated questions and numerous hallucinations I realized this was not a genuine problem and on the afternoon that same day I closed the issue as not applicable. There was no buffer overflow. I don’t know for sure that this set of replies from the user was generated by an LLM but it has several signs of it. Ban these reporters On Hackerone there is no explicit “ban the reporter from further communication with our project” functionality. I would have used it if it existed. Researchers get their “reputation” lowered then we close an issue as not applicable, but that is a very small nudge when only done once in a single project. I have requested better support for this from Hackerone. Future As these kinds of reports will become more common over time, I suspect we might learn how to trigger on generated-by-AI signals better and dismiss reports based on those. That will of course be unfortunate when the AI is used for appropriate tasks, such as translation or just language formulation help. I am convinced there will pop up tools using AI for this purpose that actually work (better) in the future, at least part of the time, so I cannot and will not say that AI for finding security problems is necessarily always a bad idea. I do however suspect that if you just add an ever so tiny (intelligent) human check to the mix, the use and outcome of any such tools will become so much better. I suspect that will be true for a long time into the future as well. I have no doubts that people will keep trying to find shortcuts even in the future. I am sure they will keep trying to earn that quick reward money. Like for the email spammers, the cost of this ends up in the receiving end. The ease of use and wide access to powerful LLMs is just too tempting. I strongly suspect we will get more LLM generated rubbish in our Hackerone inboxes going forward.

I suspect that will be true for a long time into the future as well.I love this paragraph. I think that generative AI companies, especially OpenAI, have completely dropped the ball when it comes to their marketing.The narrative (that these companies encourage and often times are responsible for) is that AI is intelligent and will be a replacement for humans in the near future. So is it really a surprise when people do things like this?LLMs don’t shine as independent agents. They shine when they augment our skills. Microsoft has the right idea by calling everything “copilot”, but unfortunately OpenAI drives the narrative, not Microsoft. reply godelski 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been using a chocolate factory analogy around this. These companies are making damn fine chocolate, without a doubt. Maybe even some of the best chocolate in the world. But they got tired of selling just chocolate and so started marketing their chocolate as cures for cancer, doctors, farmers, and all sorts of things that aren&#x27;t... well... chocolate. Some people are responding by saying that the chocolate tastes like shit and others are true believers trying to justify the fact that they like the chocolate by defending the outrageous claims. But at the end of the day, it&#x27;s just chocolate and it is okay to like it even if the claims don&#x27;t hold up. So can&#x27;t we just enjoy our chocolate without all the craziness? This seems to be a harder ask than I&#x27;ve expected. reply lesuorac 12 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s also a better company strategy to be an augment vs replacement. Like, advertise that you can get twice as much done not that you can get the same amount done with half the effort.If somebody spends 10M on Labor then at best you can change 10M to replace their labor costs. Lets say its 1,000 people.If you instead argue that those people are now 2x as efficient you can sell the company of the idea of paying for 2,000 seats when their company grows. reply richardwhiuk 11 hours agorootparentThat assume the company has the requirement to have 2x the work.If not, the argument becomes:a) Get rid of 1000 peopleb) Get rid of 500 people, by making 500 people 2x efficient.Option (a) is clearly better. reply fnordpiglet 13 hours agorootparentprevThat’s absolutely fair IMO, but they aren’t use it right if that’s what’s happening. LLMs can do a decent job translating, and they should have written their bug report in their native language and asked for a translation. Then translated responses, wrote their response, and translated backThis appears to be “write a bug report about X” then “write a response to triager for their reply Y” without intermediating, let alone factually checking the output.That use doesn’t fall prey to LLM voice because the translation is of your text and phrasing.God bless people who use LLMs to improve their life, translate, etc. But using them to think isn’t acceptable. reply dang 9 hours agorootparentprevOk, we&#x27;ve changed the URL from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerone.com&#x2F;reports&#x2F;2298307 to that link.

If you only have a basic understanding of a language then can you really accurately accomplish this? Sounding natural&#x2F;native is a challenge that even many speakers never obtain despite being able to be understandable. So even the (arguably poor) argument of \"just learn English\" isn&#x27;t that great. I&#x27;d also say that that argument is poor because you don&#x27;t need to know any specific language to contribute. Isn&#x27;t it actually a good thing that we can bridge these gaps and allow more people to contribute? Certainly we should reduce noise but I think this is far easier said than done (and some noise is even helpful at times).I just don&#x27;t think there are easy answers, no matter how much we want there to be.

What probably will happen is that maintainers will have to get better at identifying and screening out this kind of nonsense early, and for platforms to get better at banning people who submit bogus reports (but that’s really going to be a whack-a-mole game). reply skeptrune 11 hours agoparentprevdamn, I had no idea this had happened beforethat makes this precedent even more established reply yashap 13 hours agoprev“Beg bounty” ppl have already made it a major pain in the ass to have a bug bounty program, even when they were real people who had to take the time to craft “bug reports” about basically nothing. But if you mix in LLMs, generating bogus reports at essentially no cost, this could get really out of control. Could be the end of bug bounty programs IMO.Or, maybe we just need to lock them down more? Like you need to apply to become part of the bug bounty program, which involves some sort of cheap-to-perform check that you’re a real person and actual security researcher, looking to find real, impactful security bugs. And only ppl admitted into the program can submit bugs and collect financial rewards. reply masklinn 13 hours agoparentThere are platforms which do that yeah, they have \"pools\" of known researchers with tracked statuses, and you can tune how open your program is.Some also have triage staff, but depending how typical your project is that can be very hit or miss. reply yashap 13 hours agorootparentYeah, a decently locked down program seems like a good idea! At the startups I’ve worked at, the programs have been very open (basically “email us”), and it does lead to a fair bit of beg bounty spam, even without LLMs in the mix. reply donmcronald 11 hours agoparentprevMaybe have a submission fee? I don&#x27;t know if that helps, but it would be a deterrent for massive amounts of machine generated garbage.The worst case in my opinion is massive amounts of AI garbage being submitted which will require equally bad AI filtering to \"solve\" the problem with the result being an overall reduction on quality for everyone trying to participate in good faith. reply yashap 3 hours agorootparentThat’s an interesting idea, though I’m sure you’d be inviting some scathing blog posts!

I think the knock-on effects are probably huge - not only are the reporter and the maintainer both wasting time here that could be better spent on something useful, but the whole bug-bounty-crowdsourced-CVE process is now compromised by a lower signal-to-noise ratio and the probable outcome of raising barriers to submission as a means of dealing with the spam, meaning fewer bugs discovered and fixed, more security vulnerabilities, and everything that results from that.The same dynamic is at play in other sectors, meaning we find ourselves increasingly unable to assign any trust to product reviews, court filings, recipes, how-to guides, medical advice, and so forth. One of the promises of the internet was the rapid expansion of content through democratization of publishing, but I think we&#x27;re witnessing the gutting of any benefit that had left. reply unglaublich 13 hours agoprevThe most worrying is that a few cents of LLM cost wasted a lot of expensive, significant engineering time.

Why not just set `heads[3].val = randstr` then `free()` it after the header data is processed? And why is `keyval` 40 bytes instead of 26 or 32? reply tom_ 13 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s presumably to reduce the number of places where you might need to call free, and then fail to do so?(This might already be happening in line 580? Though in practice perhaps that case never occurs.) reply rstuart4133 5 hours agorootparentI doubt it&#x27;s to reduce the number of calls to free. After all, there must be exactly one call to free() for every call to malloc().It looks more like a coding habit this particular programmer uses to avoid forgetting to call free(). He puts it as close to the call to malloc() as possible, which reduces the changes of forgetting.It&#x27;s interesting code to look at, if you are a C programmer. As you noted, his heroic efforts to always call free fails if line 580 gets executed. It never will of course, so him adding 580 reveals a certain paranoia. Perfectly understandable in a C programmer, but for most line 578 would be enough to assuage the paranoia. Others (me, for instance) would make 578 an assert, and get rid of 580. At the 1000ft level the result is the presumably the same in both cases: the program exits after printing an error on stderr, but the error message will be different. The assert makes it plain it&#x27;s an internal failure, but the current method may be mistaken for a externally triggered error. Or he could have sidestepped the overflow checks and free() by using salloc() - but maybe it doesn&#x27;t exist on platforms he ports to.I would do a lot of other things differently too. I guess it just shows the way old C programmers deal with the repeated beatings inflicted by the language varies a lot. reply hnarn 12 hours agorootparentprevHow to get your open source project peer reviewed: post an LLM bug report, post it to HN and scour the comments for people reviewing your code ;-) reply blibble 9 hours agoparentprevusing the stack is free as the space was reserved as part of the function setup and will be torn down automatically when the function returnsusing the heap requires more work, can fail and requires manual cleanup reply stefan_ 12 hours agoparentprevAt that point you can just ditch both randstr and keyval entirely and encode directly into &heads[3].val since it allocates anyway. You still have to pass in a useless randlen because it will otherwise crash, oh well, the beauty of C \"output\" parameters.This \"copy from heap into stack variable\" dance doesn&#x27;t save on cleanups either since there is only one unconditional return after the encode.(But I can see how you arrive at this current code if you \"laid out\" your needed variables at the top and then realized later Curl_base64_encode always allocates) reply rdtsc 13 hours agoprevIf it wasn&#x27;t the frustration and time wasted it would be funny how dineshsec &#x2F; dinesh_b is teaching Daniel how to use strncpy.

The users wants to analyze something, but it&#x27;s too long, so they chop it up into multiple requests. And by the time they get to the point, the original code snipped is long out the window and the model confidently spews up something that was never there (though it looks plausible). reply rdtsc 13 hours agorootparentIt seems at some point a human (Dinesh B?) had reviewed and posted it.

The code already knows the size of the source buffer and has checked if it will fit in the destination buffer, there is no reason to call strcpy and have it strlen the string unnecessarily.Genuinely the LLM recommendation is something I would actively discourage. If you don&#x27;t know the size, and don&#x27;t care about silent truncation, and don&#x27;t care about performance (strncpy will unnecessarily zero the rest of the buffer), just use snprintf. Unless you&#x27;re dealing with some UI or something, you probably SHOULD care about truncation and in that case strncpy won&#x27;t save you. reply leejo 11 hours agoprevSpurious CVEs have been around for a long time, it seems that people feeding open source codebases into LLMs and asking it to point out potential issues is just the next step in that approach.LLMs don&#x27;t understand the code they&#x27;re being fed, and it seems the people feeding the LLMs don&#x27;t understand it either... reply layer8 13 hours agoprevI believe they have a bit of a point, because it isn’t locally obvious that randlen will match the zero-terminated length of randstr, at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;curl&#x2F;curl&#x2F;blob&#x2F;1d8e8c9ad1ff3351386422535f....

Still, strncpy is a horrible API in general.

Open source already has a problem, where many newcomers get discouraged by curt responses and their issues not really getting investigated or addressed. Sometimes the responders come off as rude, because they see so many low-effort PRs and issues and feature requests, and have very limited time. But a lot of \"low-effort, low-quality\" stuff is just submitted by people who are trying to join OSdev, so they deserve friendly responses and actual investigation like this responder did.This stuff just makes maintainers&#x27; lives harder and increases the chance that newcomers get unreasonably-harsh responses, discouraging them from making future contributions (which may eventually become useful).Ironically this is even a problem in HackerOne: I&#x27;ve read multiple blog posts where someone submit a CVE to a big company, and the company responded \"this isn&#x27;t a real problem\" and just left it unaddressed (sometimes leading to the public disclosure in the blog post). reply pavel_lishin 6 hours agorootparent> I don&#x27;t like how the person who responded was very friendly and actually looked at the issue.

And when they interjected to try and explain an error in their machine mis-stating the name of the reviewer, the text they injected was likely not English-as-first-language.So I can imagine someone basically trying to run an auto-scanner for common vulns to highlight them for various parties to address, because addressing them increases software health globally.Problem is that it&#x27;s false-positiving on some (admittedly very fragile, in the \"only guarded by every human being writing the right code all the time\" sense, i.e. the detector&#x27;s not wrong that if the called function violates contract stuff will break) working code. reply wrs 13 hours agorootparentAs I found out when I first put something up for review on HackerOne, there is a whole cottage industry of people just running scanners and blindly reporting whatever comes out.

    "originBody": "Why Are Tech Reporters Sleeping On The Biggest App Store Story? Browsers are the most likely disruptor of the mobile duopoly but you'd never know it reading Wired or The Verge. January 1, 2024 This is part eight of the eight-part series \"Browser Choice Must Matter\" The tech news is chockablock[1] with antitrust rumblings and slow-motion happenings. Through eagle-eyed press coverage, regulatory reports, and legal discovery the shady dealings of Apple and Google's app stores are now comprehensively documented and pressure for change has built to an unsustainable level. Something's gotta give. This is the backdrop to the biggest app store story nobody is writing about: on pain of steep fines, gatekeepers are opening up to competing browsers. This, in turn, will enable competitors to replace app stores with directories of Progressive Web Apps. Capable browsers that expose web app installation and powerful features to developers can kickstart app portability, breaking open the mobile duopoly. But you'd never know it reading Wired or The Verge. The Buried Lede Disruption Disrupted Green Shoots A New Hope With shockingly few exceptions, coverage of app store regulation that the answer to crummy, extractive native app stores is other native app stores. This unexamined framing shapes hundreds of pieces covering regulatory events, including by web-friendly authors. The tech press almost universally fails to mention the web as a substitute for native apps and fail to inform readers of its potential to disrupt app stores. As Cory Doctorow observed: \"An app is just a web-page wrapped in enough IP to make it a crime to defend yourself against corporate predation.\" The implication is clear: browsers unchained can do to mobile what the web did to desktop, where more than 70% of daily \"jobs to be done\" happen on the web. Replacing mobile app stores will look different than the web's path to desktop centrality, but the enablers are waiting in the wings. It has gone largely unreported that Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) have been held back by Apple and Google denying competing browsers access to essential APIs.[2] Thankfully, regulators haven't been waiting on the press to explain the situation. Recent interventions into mobile ecosystems include requirements to repair browser choice, and the analysis backing those regulations takes into account the web's role as a potential competitor (e.g., Japan's JFTC (pdf)). Regulators seem to understand that: App stores protect proprietary ecosystems through preferential discovery and capabilities. Stores then extract rents from developers dependent on commodity capabilities duopolists provide only through proprietary APIs. App portability threatens the proprietary agenda of app stores. The web can interrupt this model by bringing portability to apps and over-the-top discovery through search. This has yet to happen because... The duopolists, in different ways, have kneecapped competing browsers along with their own, keeping the web from contesting the role of app stores. Apple and Google saw what the web did to desktop, and they've laid roadblocks to the competitive forces that would let history repeat on smartphones. The Buried Lede # The web's potential to disrupt mobile is evident to regulators, advocates, and developers. So why does the tech news fail to explain the situation? Consider just one of the many antitrust events of recent months. It was covered by The Verge, Mac Rumors, Apple Insider, and more. None of the linked articles note browser competition's potential to upend app stores. Browsers unshackled have the potential to free businesses from build-it-twice proprietary ecosystems, end rapacious app store taxes, pave the way for new OS entrants — all without the valid security concerns side-loading introduces. Lest you think this an isolated incident, this article on the impact of the EU's DMA lacks any hint of the web's potential to unseat app stores. You can repeat this trick with any DMA story from the past year. Or spot-check coverage of the NTIA's February report. Reporters are \"covering\" these stories in the lightest sense of the word. Barrels of virtual ink has been spilt documenting unfair app store terms, conditions, and competition. And yet. Disruption Disrupted # In an industry obsessed with \"disruption,\" why is this David vs. Goliath story going untold? Some theories, in no particular order. First, Mozilla isn't advocating for a web that can challenge native apps, and none of the other major browser vendors are telling the story either. Apple and Google have no interest in seeing their lucrative proprietary platforms supplanted, and Microsoft (your narrator's employer) famously lacks sustained mobile focus. Next, it's hard to overlook that tech reporters live like wealthy people, iPhones and all. From that vantage point, it's often news that the web is significantly more capable on other OSes (never mind that they spend much of every day working in a desktop browser). It's hard to report on the potential of something you can't see for yourself. Also, this might all be Greek. Reporters and editors aren't software engineers, so the potential of browser competition can remain understandably opaque. Stories that include mention of \"alternative app stores\" generally fail to mention that these stores may not be as safe, or that OS restrictions on features won't disappear just because of a different distribution mechanism, or that the security track records of the existing duopolist app stores are sketchy at best. Under these conditions, it's asking a lot to expect details-based discussion of alternatives, given the many technical wrinkles. Hopefully, someone can walk them through it. Further, market contestability theory has only recently become a big part of the tech news beat. Regulators have been writing reports to convey their understanding of the market, and to shape effective legislation that will unchain the web, but smart folks unversed in both antitrust and browser minutiae might need help to pick up what regulators are putting down. Lastly, it hasn't happened yet. Yes, Progressive Web Apps have been around for a few years, but they haven't had an impact on the iPhones that reporters and their circles almost universally carry. It's much easier to get folks to cover stories that directly affect them, and this is one that, so far, largely hasn't. Green Shoots # The seeds of web-based app store dislocation have already been sown, but the chicken-and-egg question at the heart of platform competition looms. On the technology side, Apple has been enormously successful at denying essential capabilities to the web through a strategy of compelled monoculture combined with strategic foot-dragging. As an example, the eight-year delay in implementing Push Notifications for the web[3] kept many businesses from giving the web a second thought. If they couldn't re-engage users at the same rates as native apps, the web might as well not exist on phones. This logic has played out on a loop over the last decade, category-by-category, with gatekeepers preventing competing browsers from bringing capabilities to web apps that would let them supplant app stores[2:1] while simultaneously keeping them from being discovered through existing stores. Proper browser choice could upend this situation, finally allowing the web to provide \"table stakes\" features in a compelling way. For the first time, developers could bring the modern web's full power to wealthy mobile users, enabling the \"write once, test everywhere\" vision, and cut out the app store middleman — all without sacrificing essential app features or undermining security. Sunsetting the 30% tax requires a compelling alternative, and Apple's simultaneous underfunding of Safari and compelled adoption of its underpowered engine have interlocked to keep the web out of the game. No wonder Apple is massively funding lobbyists, lawyers, and astroturf groups to keep engine diversity at bay while belatedly battening the hatches. On the business side, managers think about \"mobile\" as a category. Rather than digging into the texture of iOS, Android, and the differing web features available on each, businesses tend to bulk accept or reject the app store model. One sub-segment of \"mobile\" growing the ability to route around highway robbery Ts & Cs is tantalising, but not enough to change the game; the web, like other metaplatforms, is only a disruptive force when pervasive and capable.[4] A prohibition on store discovery for web apps has buttressed Apple's denial of essential features to browsers: Even if developers overcome the ridiculous hurdles that Apple's shoddy browser engine throws up, they're still prevented by Apple policy from making interoperable web apps discoverable where users look for them. Google's answer to web apps in Play is a dog's breakfast, but it does at least exist for developers willing to put in the effort, or for teams savvy enough to reach for PWA Builder. Recent developments also point to a competitive future for capable web apps. First, browser engine choice should become a reality on iOS in the EU in 2024, thanks to the plain language of the DMA. Apple will, of course, attempt to delay the entry of competing browsers through as-yet-unknown strategies, but the clock is ticking. Once browsers can enable capable web apps with easier distribution, the logic of the app store loses a bit of its lustre. Work is also underway to give competing browsers a chance to facilitate PWAs that can install other PWAs. Web App Stores would then become a real possibility through browsers that support them, and we should expect that regulatory and legislative interventions will facilitate this in the near future. Removed from the need to police security (browsers have that covered) and handle distribution (websites update themselves), PWA app stores like store.app can become honest-to-goodness app management surfaces that can safely facilitate discovery and sync. PWA app stores like Appscope and store.app exist, but they're hobbled by gatekeepers that have denied competing browsers access to APIs that could turn PWA directories into real contenders. It's no surprise that Apple and Google have kept private the APIs needed to make this better future possible. They built the necessary infrastructure for the web to disrupt native, then kept it to themselves. This potential has remained locked away within organisations politically hamstrung by native app store agendas. But all of that is about to change. This begs the question: where's the coverage? This is the most exciting moment in more than 15 years for the web vs. native story, but the tech press is whiffing it. A New Hope # 2024 will be packed to the gills with app store and browser news, from implementation of the DMA, to the UK's renewed push into mobile browsers and cloud gaming, to new legislation arriving in many jurisdictions, to the first attempts at shipping iOS ports of Blink and Gecko browsers. Each event is a chance to inform the public about the already-raging battle for the future of the phone. It's still possible to reframe these events and provide better context. We need a fuller discussion about what it will mean for mobile OSes to have competing native app stores when the underlying OSes are foundationally insecure. There are also existing examples of ecosystems with this sort of choice (e.g., China), and more needs to be written about the implications for users and developers. Instead of nirvana, the insecure status quo of today's mobile OSes, combined with (even more) absentee app store purveyors, turns side-loading into an alternative form of lock-in, with a kicker of added insecurity for users. With such a foundation, the tech-buying public could understand why a browser's superior sandboxing, web search's better discovery, and frictionless links are better than dodgy curation side-deals and \"beware of dog\" sign security. The more that folks understand the stakes, the more likely tech will genuinely change for the better. And isn't that what public interest journalism is for? Thanks to Charlie, Stuart Langride, and Frances Berriman for feedback on drafts of this post. Antitrust is now a significant tech beat, and recent events frequently include browser choice angles because regulators keep writing regulations that will enhance it. This beat is only getting more intense, giving the tech press ample column inches to explain the status quo more deeply and and educate around the most important issues. In just the last two months: Google lost to Epic in a jury trial that determined Google's Play Store is an illegal monopoly. Google lost all assumption of good faith as evidence from the Epic trial showed the Play team to be scoundrels, two-timers, and cretins who were willing to set shockingly unfair terms for anyone with enough market power to embarrass them. And that's before we get to the light attempted bribery. Google's witness also blurted out a statistic that is both anodyne and damning: 36%. That's what Google pays Apple in search rev-share for default search placement in Safari. Normally, this would be a detail of a boring business deal. In context, however, it highlights Apple's decade-long suppression of iOS browser competition — combined with poverty-level funding of WebKit — which has skimmed tens of billions in profit per year from the web while starving browser development. This has deprived users, businesses, and web developers of safe (but critical) capabilities. It wasn't just Play that buggered the mobile web; Google was happy to outsource the dirty deed too. Apple lost on an appeal to keep the UK's Competition and Market Authority (CMA) investigation into browsers and cloud gaming on ice.[5] In December, Apple declined to appeal to the UK's Supreme Court for reasons that remain opaque. Perhaps Apple didn't appeal because, in November, the UK unexpectedly brought forward the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill. It looks set to become law early in the new year, standing up a regulator with real teeth who, one presumes, will not be predisposed to think well of Apple's delay of its predecessor's investigations. Meanwhile, in the EU, Apple attempted to wriggle out of regulations that might bring about proper browser choice by arguing that Safari is actually three under-performing browsers. in a marketing trenchcoat[6]. On the other side of the planet, news just broke that Japan will bring forward legislation to target app store shenanigans. Given the JFTC's earlier findings about how interlocking layers of control have kept browsers from contesting app store prominence, we can expect some spicy legislative language around browsers. Australia has also just agreed (in principle) to do the same, including language that acknowledges the role suppressing browser choice has had in preventing the web from competing with mobile native app ecosystems. All but one of the 19 links above are from just the last 60 days, a period which includes a holiday break in the US and Europe. With the EU's DMA coming into force in March and the CMA back on the job, browser antitrust enforcement is only accelerating. It sure would be great if reporters could occasionally connect these dots. ↩︎ The stories of how Apple and Google have kept browsers from becoming real app stores differ greatly in their details, but the effects have been nearly identical: only their browsers could offer installation of web apps, and those browsers have done shockingly little to support web developers who want to depend on the browser as the platform. The ways that Apple has undermined browser-based stores is relatively well known: no equivalent to PWA install or \"Smart Banners\" for the web, no way for sites to suppress promotion of native apps, no ability for competing browsers to trigger homescreen installation until just this year, etc. etc. The decade-long build of Apple's many and varied attacks on the web as a platform is a story that's both tired and under-told. Google's malfeasance has gotten substantially less airtime, even among web developers – nevermind the tech press. The story picks up in 2017, two years after the release of PWAs and Push Notifications in Chrome. At the time, the PWA install flow was something of a poorly practised parlour trick: installation used an unreliable homescreen shortcut API that failed on many devices with OEM-customised launchers. The shortcut API also came laden with baggage that prevented effective uninstall and cross-device sync. To improve this situation, \"WebAPKs\" were developed. This new method of installation allows for deep integration with the OS, similar to the Application Identity Proxy feature that Windows lets browsers to provide for PWAs, with one notable exception: on Android, only Chrome gets to use the WebAPK system. Without getting into the weeds, suffice to say many non-Chrome browsers requested access. Only Google could meaningfully provide this essential capability across the Android ecosystem. So important were WebAPKs that Samsung gave up begging and reverse engineered it for their browser on Samsung devices. This only worked on Samsung phones where Suwon's engineers could count on device services and system keys not available elsewhere. That hasn't helped other browsers, and it certainly isn't an answer to an ecosystem-level challenge. Without WebAPK API access, competing browsers can't innovate on PWA install UI and can't meaningfully offer PWA app stores. Instead, the ecosystem has been left to limp along at the excruciating pace of Chrome's PWA UI development. Sure, Chrome's PWA support has been a damn sight better than Safari's, but that's just damning with faith praise. Both Apple and Google have done their part to quietly engineer a decade of unchallenged native app dominance. Neither can be trusted as exclusive stewards of web competitiveness. Breaking the lock on the doors holding back real PWA installation competition will be a litmus test for the effectiveness of regulation now in-flight. ↩︎ ↩︎ Push Notifications were, without exaggeration, the single most requested mobile Safari in the eight years between when Chromium browsers shipped them and when Apple finally capitulated. It's unedifying to recount all of the ways Apple prevented competing iOS browsers from implementing Push, all while gaslighting developers who requested this business-critical feature over and over and over again. It's also unhelpful to fixate on the runarounds that Apple gave companies with enough clout to somehow find an Apple rep to harangue directly. So, let's call it water under the bridge. Apple shipped, so we're good, right? Right? I regret to inform you, dear reader, that it not, in fact, \"good\". Despite most of a decade to study up on the problem space, and nearly 15 years of of experience with Push, Apple's implementation is anything but complete. The first few releases exposed APIs that hinted at important functionality, but were broken or missing. Features as core as closing notifications, or updating text when new data comes in. Think, showing the latest message in a chat, rather than leaving a stream of notifications in the tray for every message that has arrived since you last cleared the tray. Important features didn't work. Some still don't.. And the pathetic set of customisations provided for notification UI is a joke. Web developers have once again been left to dig through the wreckage to understand just how badly Apple's cough \"minimalist\" cough implementation is compromised. And boy howdy, is it bad. Apple's implementation might have passed surface-level tests (gotta drive up that score!), but it's unusable for serious products. It's possible to draw many possible conclusions from this terrible showing, but even the relative charity of Hanlon's Razor is damning. Nothing about this would be worse than any other under-funded, trailing-edge browser over the past three decades (which is to say, a bloody huge problem), except for Apple's well-funded, aggressive, belligerent ongoing protest to every regulatory attempt to allow true browser choice for iPhone owners. In the year 2024, you can have any iOS browser you like. You can even set them as default. They might even have APIs that look like they'll solve important product needs, but as long as they're forced to rely on Apple's shit-show implementation, the web can't ever be a competitive platform. When Apple gets to define the web's potential, the winner will always be native, and through it, Apple's bottom line. ↩︎ The muting effect of Apple's abuse of monopoly over wealthy users to kneecap the web's capabilities is aided by the self-censorship of web developers. The values of the web are a mirror world to native, where developers are feted for adopting bleeding-edge APIs. On the web, features aren't \"available\" until 90+% of all users have access to them. Because iOS is at least 20% of the pie), web developers don't go near features Apple fails to support. Which is a lot. caniuse.com's \"Browser Score\" is one way to understand the scale of the gap in features that Apple has forced on all iOS browsers. The Web Platform Tests dashboard highlights 'Browser Specific Failures', which only measure failures in tests for features the browser claims to support. Not only are iOS browsers held back by Apple's shockingly poor feature support, but the features that _are_ available are broken so often that many businesses feel no option but to retreat to native APIs that Apple doesn't break on a whim, forcing the logic of the app store on them if they want to reach valuable users. Apple's pocket veto over the web is no accident, and its abuse of that power is no bug. Native app stores can only take an outsized cut if the web remains weak and developers stay dependent on proprietary APIs to access commodity capabilities. A prohibition on capable engines prevents feature parity, suppressing competition. A feature-poor, unreliable open web is essential to prevent the dam from breaking. Why, then, have competing browser makers played along? Why aren't Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, and Opera on the ramparts, waving the flag of engine choice? Why do they silently lend their brands to Apple's campaign against the web? Why don't they rename their iOS browsers to \"Chrome Lite\" or \"Firefox Lite\" until genuine choice is possible? Why don't they ask users to write their representatives or sign petitions for effective browser choice? It's not like they shrink from it for other worthy causes. I'm shocked by not surprised by the tardiness of browser bosses to seize the initiative. Instead of standing up to unfair terms, they've rolled over time and time again. It makes a perverse sort of sense. More than 30 years have passed since we last saw effective tech regulation. The careers of those at the top have been forged under the unforgiving terms of late-stage, might-makes-right capitalism, rather than the logic of open markets and standards. Today's bosses didn't rise by sticking their necks above the parapets to argue virtue and principle. At best, they kept the open web dream alive by quietly nurturing the potential of open technology, hoping the situation would change. Now it has, and yet they cower. Organisations that value conflict aversion and \"the web's lane is desktop\" thinking get as much of it as they care to afford. ↩︎ Recall that Apple won an upset victory in March after litigating the meaning of the word \"may\" and arguing that the CMA wasn't wrong to find after multiple years of investigations that Apple were (to paraphrase) inveterate shitheels, but rather that the CMA waited too long (six months) to bring an action which might have had teeth. Yes, you're reading that right; Apple's actual argument to the Competition Appeal Tribunal amounted to a mashup of rugged, free-market fundamentalist \" but mah regulatory certainty!\", performative fainting into strategically placed couches, and feigned ignorance about issues it knows it'll have to address in other jurisdictions. Thankfully, the Court of Appeals was not to be taken for fools. Given the harsh (in British) language of the reversal, we can hope a chastened Competition Appeal Tribunal will roll over less readily in future. ↩︎ If you're getting the sense that legalistic hair-splitting is what Apple spends its billion-dollar-per-year legal budget on because it has neither the facts nor real benefits to society on its side, wait 'till you hear about some of the stuff it filed with Japan's Fair Trade Commission! A clear strategy is being deployed. Apple: First claims there's no there there (pdf). When that fails... Claims competitors that it has expressly ham-strung are credible substitutes. When that fails... Claims security would suffer if reasonable competition were allowed. Rending of garments is performed while prophets of doom recycle the script that the sky will fall if competing browsers are allowed (which would, in turn, expand the web's capabilities). Many treatments of this script fill the inboxes of regulators worldwide. When those bodies investigate, e.g. the history of iOS's forced-web-monoculture insecurity, and inevitably reject these farcical arguments, Apple... Uses any and every procedural hurdle to prevent intervention in the market it has broken. The modern administrative state indulges firms with \"as much due process as money can buy\", and Apple knows it, viciously contesting microscopic points. When bluster fails, huffingly implemented, legalistic, hair-splitting \"fixes\" are deployed on the slowest possible time scale. This strategy buys years of delay, and it's everywhere: browser and mail app defaults, payment alternatives, engine choice, and right-to-repair. Even charging cable standardisation took years longer than it should have thanks to stall tactics. This maximalist, joined-up legal and lobbying strategy works to exhaust regulators and bamboozle legislators. Delay favours the monopolist. A firm that can transform the economy of an entire nation just by paying a bit of the tax it owes won't even notice a line item for lawyers to argue the most outlandish things at every opportunity. Apple (correctly) calculates that regulators are gun-shy about punishing them for delay tactics, so engagement with process is a is a win by default. Compelling $1600/hr white-shoe associates to make ludicrous, unsupportable claims is a de facto win when delay brings in billions. Regulators are too politically cowed and legally ham-strung to do more, and Apple plays process like a fiddle. ↩︎ Previously: \"Safari 16.4 Is An Admission\"",

Not on your life. reply manchego 6 hours agoparentMy wife has had to listen to me complain for the last week about what a pain it is to get the absolute orientation of an iPhone from the browser.On Android you can use AbsoluteOrientationSensor or deviceorientationabsolute event. These will provide a quaternion or Euler angles describing how to rotate the device from the default orientation (flat on the ground, screen up, with the top pointing north) to its current orientation.The situation on the iPhone has almost reduced me to tears. As far as I can tell, it only provides Euler angles relative to some implementation defined reference frame, along with the actual compass heading. In practice, the Euler angles given are absolute with respect to gravity, but always treat north as the direction the phone was pointed when the first sensor reading took place. To deal with this, you can use the actual compass heading to rotate the relative orientation to the absolute orientation. But this will have problems near the poles, as the Euler angles and heading will give conflicting values. Beyond this the compass heading field is really weird. If you want to experience its behavior for yourself, take the iPhone compass app and starting from flat, rotate the phone 360 degrees through the pitch axis. Notice at what points the heading flips between its start heading and start heading+180. I bet it will surprise you! reply yonatan8070 5 hours agorootparentTo me it sounds like the solution is \"We have detected you&#x27;re using an unsupported browser, iOS does not allow websites to properly access device orientation and therefore this app cannot function\" reply manchego 4 hours agorootparentI wish I had come to that conclusion a week ago, but I&#x27;m in too deep now.

The friction of typing the website name or dealing with the inherent clunkiness of a mobile site vs the app cannot be understated and it is part of why brands create apps.Plus, don&#x27;t forget the notifications they can send, for deals and promotions. That is also why I have several apps for brands installed, because I know I already want to use their products, so the free discount works in my favor. I have the willpower to resist impulsive purchases, personally speaking, but many don&#x27;t. When a notification pops up announcing \"50% off on this sandwich,\" it&#x27;s tempting for people who hadn&#x27;t planned to spend at all that day. They might think they&#x27;re saving money by spending less than full price, not realizing that spending anything at all is more than they intended.

It only becomes a problem when a platform decides to act as a gatekeeper for the entire platform with insane rules & fees.Furthermore, social media is a really poor way to discover anything unless it happens to go viral. A general-purpose search engine such as Google is entirely suboptimal, as it can only match on keywords on the page.

Instead permissions are usually opt-in when requested by the application. So applications have always been incentivised to limit their requirements (you can reject any request, and you can toggle them off afterwards through the setting, all the application can tell you is \"I can&#x27;t work without that dave\"). Apple has also increased the number &#x2F; scope of opt-in permissions over time, increasing the scope of that effect. reply PaulHoule 10 hours agorootparentprevI dunno, try looking for “qr code reader” on the play store and you will find the same spammy product listings that AMZN is choked with, reply rpbiwer2 4 hours agorootparentAndroid&#x27;s app store may suck, but at least it&#x27;s possible to start a competing store which sucks less. reply amadeuspagel 10 hours agorootparentprevYou have something like user reviews with comments on HN or reddit.Changelogs and permissions are more difficult as they require the app store to control hosting.

But also it’s not the only challenge: sustenance is. Google and Apple operate their app stores because they get a lot of value out of them—both because they make their platforms more useful, and because of their absurdly high taxes. But a third-party website that’s essentially just a link aggregator, how is it going to make money? The only realistic ways (advertising&#x2F;sponsored listings, or charging subscriptions to either side of the marketplace) increase the critical mass required drastically, far beyond what’s realistic.And indeed, there have been multiple attempts at something like this, because it is something people want—but there’s just no money in it, and so they’ve all failed. reply rpbiwer2 4 hours agorootparentprevOne major caveat is that PWAs don&#x27;t have all the capabilities of a native app. I think that&#x27;s the biggest issue people have with this -- if PWAs had full feature parity with native apps, I&#x27;d agree Apple&#x27;s app store monopoly wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal.I think there are many reasons why something that people do want might not (yet) exist.

However, there is plenty of reason to rely on native frameworks with modern graphics systems.I suspect there were radically different levels of engineering and optimization that went into Google Sheets vs a typical pizza-ordering app. Even with the same level of engineering, I suspect the pizza ordering app would be larger due to the need to bundle media like pizza and topping images. reply Eridrus 11 hours agorootparentprev\"My highly abstract cross-platform framework must be as fast as native code\" is not a sane view on this.A tonne of effort has gone into making spreadsheets work on the web; both in the browsers as well as the spreadsheet apps themselves.The fact that the web works as well as it does is a huge feat of engineering, but in no way indicative of there being no technical reason that native apps can be better. reply qgin 11 hours agorootparentThe vast majority of apps are just text, images, and buttons.

At the moment we are lacking in tooling and language support and also leaving a lot of performance on the table.I love how easy it is to get up and running with a PWA and most of my front end stuff is using PWAs today. From a technical standpoint it still needs a lot of work from the vendor side though. reply dwaite 1 hour agorootparent> I also believe that a lot of APIs in iOS are not available from PWAs.The security model of a store is delegated trust and stewardship. There is someone who will review if applications need capabilities, and will provide business penalties for bad behaviors.The security model of the web is basically a mix of site sandboxing and caveat emptor. There is no guarantee the web app you hit one minute to the next will be the same code base, or belong to the same owner. For example, the same interface has to get consent for notifications from an advertising site which wants to spam you as your corporate chat app.Chrome had quite a bit more motivation to ignore this or to create a tiered model with PWAs because of Chromebooks, where the model (originally) was web-only development. Google created quite a few one-off API for their systems, and promoted several Chrome-only API as if they were web standards. Even there, this approach was too limiting and eventually Android compatibility was added.Apple has started to add some additional app-useful features like notifications, but behind the &#x27;Add to Home Screen&#x27; option. One could look at this like promoting a website to an &#x27;app&#x27; on the phone, partially because that gives a consistent way for the user to understand permissions and privacy implications for both native and web code.There are plenty of people who wish there was a better mechanism on iOS than the current add to Home Screen flow, but it is highly unlikely to become more streamlined because of abuse potential. reply meheleventyone 2 hours agorootparentprev> I haven’t seen any AAA games that are developed to work in a browser.I think Stadia worked over the browser to deliver AAA games.

Web apps don&#x27;t have an API to prevent screenshotting or to know when one is about to be taken and hide their contents. This is important to protect privacy (nudes) and people have come to expect it.Know what&#x27;s interesting? Screenshot protection is available for Encrypted Media Extension (DRM) video if you have Hollywood $$$.Browsers (on desktop) also have dev tools built in.

My next thoughts were:- it protects the platform, to some extent, by reducing the number of unwanted screenshots- it sets a social norm that taking screenshots is unwanted and makes the screenshot taker look extra creepy if they share the image with anyone- if a platform provides screenshot blocking, and users (who have all seen pictures of one screen taken from another device) value that protection and make decisions about what to post based on it, the company should think long and hard before deploying a version that breaks that assumption reply arch-choot 5 hours agorootparentI think it just leads to a false sense of security for most \"normie\" users.

( The moment when I think Apple has really changed ) And the immediate answer to that was almost always, you cant, because you dont have an App ecosystem. A la Windows Mobile.I knew Apps were important, and I sometimes look up the most popular Apps on the two platform. But it never occur to me to check my own App usage or at least it wasn&#x27;t obvious how to check it. Until all of a sudden I remember you could look at battery usage of Apps in the past 10 days on iOS.It turns out 60% of my usage was between a Game I played, and Safari, both being 30% each. The others were Youtube, Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, News&#x2F; forum App. These few apps together were 35%. The other 5% was a long tail of other things, but mostly Uber, Food Delivery, and Banking Apps.Not only were the amount of Apps I used much much smaller than I thought. Most of them could be a Web App, and do offer an Online, Web version.I am not the usual one to be optimistic on HN. The task is still easily tens of billions of investment.

We use a plain web app with some basic PWA config to make the experience mostly the same for the legacy native users.Our latest generation web app doesn&#x27;t even use websockets - it can get nearly 100% of the job done with multipart form posts. The only thing that absolutely had to be otherwise was submitting high res photos via AJAX because of a ~twelve year old bug in Safari that blows out memory utilization. We use a bit of javascript to bandaid where Apple refuses. We stopped letting it bother us after a while. Momentum does wonders for morale.The hardest part of the transition for us was dealing with iOS hardware features from Safari, specifically the camera. Getting high resolution image&#x2F;video out of the correct camera consistently was a huge nightmare up until not very long ago. Maybe we were just holding it wrong, but I feel like something changed in the last 18 months to make it not so terrible. Today, you can constrain for ~2k@30fps video and mostly expect everything to \"just work\".My mood regarding Apple ecosystem has waffled 4-5 times over the course of the last ~decade. Today, I strongly recommend their hardware because I no longer have to worry about the App Store extortion + PKI certificate circus + weird dev ecosystem hellscape that we were trapped in for the prior half-decade.

The only thing the App Store does for you beyond this point is marketing&#x2F;PR.

Of course now we know it was because Apple wanted that 30% revenue stream, but at the time Apple said -- repeatedly -- that it was because they needed to \"protect the integrity of the cell phone networks.\"Some developers knew this was horseshit because they knew the baseband processor was a separate chip that was easily isolatable from the main CPU. We complained but there were not enough of us to rattle Apple&#x27;s cage sufficiently.Here&#x27;s the proof that Apple was lying about this: The iPod Touch (remember that thing?) had exactly the same App Store lockdown mechanism and it didn&#x27;t have a baseband processor at all. IOW it wasn&#x27;t protecting the cell phone networks because it couldn&#x27;t even participate in the cell phone networks. The iPod touch was just a plain desktop computer that happened to fit in your pocket, but we let Apple become the arbiter of what software we could install on it.

It&#x27;s not like Apple&#x27;s first approach to iOS apps wasn&#x27;t \"PWA-only\" and webOS on Palm didn&#x27;t try that.I also remember MS installing all kind of crap on my systems with their own browser monopoly and ActiveX and what not tricks, reaching deep into system function where&#x2F;when the user just expected safe content browsing in their... browser.That also was the main \"backdoor\" for many of the cheaper hacks during that era. And while I don&#x27;t wan&#x27;t to go all FUD here, I don&#x27;t want to go there again either. Especially not if some MS guy is demanding that is some extreme and stoking fashion.For the rest: There are much more ways to extend the basic browser engines with native functionality. So if it&#x27;s just about PW \"apps\", there is no real reason to not wrap them in your own extended native app wrapper. If you want to break the barrier between browsing and installing stuff though, you&#x27;ll need that MS-proposed approach. Just not sure if that&#x27;s a good idea, given what they did last time with it when they were the monopolists with the freedom to act \"freely\". reply charcircuit 8 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s the opposite.

Something is going to change eventually. Maybe sooner rather than later.In the case of Apple and Google enjoying full control over mobile, this cannot continue for much longer because of the following reasons:- It no longer is a duopoly. Places like China and Russia are cutting loose from Californian oversight on their mobile networks. So there are a lot of phones with Android but without Google&#x27;s flavor of it and Apple has withdrawn from the Russian market. In short, Chinese manufacturers are no longer that dependent on Google or Apple to lead the way. Other countries are pushing back as well. And the Chinese are happy to sell to all of them.- Regulatory oversight in both the EU and the US is putting pressure on both Apple and Google to open their app stores and reduce anti-competitive behavior exercised via those app stores. This includes competing unfairly with things in the app store, keeping competitors out of the app store, and squeezing app store developers for billions of revenue, etc. And in the case of Google, paying Mozilla and Apple for the privilege of being the default search engine on their browsers to the extent of many billions. They have been under a lot of scrutiny for years. For Apple that means their blanket ban on anything not using Safari as its web component might have to go. As soon as it does, there will be other browsers on the platform and they&#x27;ll compete on quality and features. Like they caved in and added USB-C to the iphone, it might soon have a proper version of Chrome and Firefox running on it.- Smart phones as the dominant way to consume content might not last. We have other modalities coming up now, including VR and AR, voice only applications, AI apps. Apple and Google will try to \"own\" this space. But it is not a given that they will succeed in that. For example, most VR content so far comes via the Steam store. Not the Play store. And neither Google nor Apple has made much of an impact with their AI efforts so far. It&#x27;s OpenAI and MS that are in the lead there.- There are a growing number of cross platform app development frameworks. Flutter is popular. React-native still is widely used. Jetbrains is positioning Compose as a cross platform option with IOS, Android, and Desktop support. Additionally, PWAs aren&#x27;t that bad these days and they are about to become a lot more capable via WASM. Some widely used apps are PWAs these days and most of the rest contain quite a bit of web views.- Networks are changing. We have satellite networks like Starlink and various competitors now starting to offer connectivity everywhere. Mobile operators and phone calls as a use case are a side show for that. The whole point of a smart phone is that it is a phone that connects to the phone network, which until recently was the only way to get connectivity in a lot of places without WIFI. The phone operators control the network, and Apple and Google pretend that phone numbers and sim cards still matter and everybody gets their proprietary firmware from Qualcomm (another nice monopoly). That&#x27;s the deal for the last fifteen years. That might stop being true soon. reply mpol 11 hours agoprevSure, the duopoly of app stores and browsers as a disruptor is a big story.But can I take offense of all this \"The biggest story\"?I see it so often, especially here on HN, and it feels overly dramatic.

The A350 came to a stop off the right hand edge of the runway about 1680 meters/5510 feet down the runway and was evacuated. All occupants were able to evacuate. The other aircraft carrying 6 people also burst into flames, 5 of the six occupants are confirmed dead. Both aircraft burned down. 14 occupants of the A359 received injuries, the captain of the Dash 8 received serious injuries. The airline reported their A350 was carrying 367 passengers (including 8 children) and 12 crew, all of them evacuated from the aircraft. In a second press release the airline reported there had been no anomaly with the aircraft prior to departure. The crew had received and read back landing clearance. After the collision and coming to a stand still three emergency slides were used to evacuate the occupants of the aircraft. The details of the accident are under investigation by the JTSB. Japan's Coast Guard reported their Dash 8-300 registration JA722A (Code MA722) was carrying 6 people, the captain was able to evacuate, the other 5 are currently missing. The aircraft was carrying supplies to their Niigata based where the New Year's Earthquake struck. Tokyo's Metropolitan Police reported 5 of the occupants of the Dash 8 are confirmed dead. Tokyo's fire department reported, the captain of the DH8C received serious injuries, 17 occupants of the A359 received injuries. Later the Fire Department corrected the number to 14 injuries amongst the occupants of the A359. Passengers of the A359 reported the landing appeared normal at first, after touchdown there was a thud and the outside lit up in orange. A first announcement was made \"please calm down\" followed by \"do not take your luggage and do not stand up\". There was no clear announcement to evacuate, however, when other passengers stood up they also stood up and thus escaped. Japan's Ministry of Transport stated Haneda Airport was closed, the flights cancelled, there is no prediction when the airport will open again. In a press conference the Ministry of Transport stated that it is under investigation whether JL-516 had been cleared to land. There was a Coast Guard aircraft on the runway causing a collision, the details of the collision are under investigation. In a graphics the Ministry showed the approximate positions of both aircraft (see below). In the afternoon of Jan 2nd 2023 (European Time) the French BEA reported they have dispatched 4 investigators and 5 technical advisors to Tokyo to join Japan's JTSB, who are investigating the accident. The team is expected to be on site by Jan 3rd 2024. A number of arriving flights are being diverted to Narita Airport where the flights are being accepted one by one. According to ATC recordings the A359 as well as a number of other aircraft departing runway 34R were handed off to Tower Frequency 118.725MHz, however, the Coast Guard DH8C was handed off to tower at 124.350MHz. JL-516, upon being handed off to tower by approach, was told by tower to \"continue approach\", about 90 seconds later tower cleared the aircraft to land. Haneda Airport resumed operations on their runways 16R/34L, 04/22 and 05/23 at about 21:30L (12:30Z) about 3:45 hours after the accident while runway 16L/34R remains closed.

There's too much risk of people posting links to inappropriate content. links are deleted all time By Sergio on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 09:29Z So, if you Google you may find daylight photos of the scene. The links I posted earlier got deleted every time, and can´t attach photos myself. Updated link By Sergio on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 09:24Z The link was deleted. \" daylight photos of the site By Sergio on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 09:23Z Someone was asking daylight photos, here is a webpage that shows the scene at daylight conditions: @ jeremy, ca By Captain Savaloy on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 09:22Z \"japan airlines now switching to safe boeing i guess\" What a complete clown comment, not only is it completely inappropriate, it's completely inaccurate, the 737 alone has more losses than all of Airbus's combined. @jeremy By Sergio on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 09:12Z Yes, the same safe Boeing with its superior MCAS design, the same Boeing with flaws in the B787, the same Boeing with, Boeing is so safe...oh wait. Dash lights difficult to see in a lighted runway By Sergio on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 09:08Z Hi, Just want to say that the Dash 8 is not precisely a lighted Christmas tree precisely seen from any angle, and specially from behind. Add it to a very well lighted runway, some distance, and that the Dash 8 didn't´move at all, and if the JAL crew saw any light of the Dash, they must have taken it as runway lightning. Interesting the fact that the CG aircraft was transferred to another frequency, that must have been a sip from ATC. Kudos for Airbus engineers to have designed such a safe and wonderful aircraft. That definitely buries down Boeing little deeper in mud, and Airbus proved many times now that in case of catastrophic damage, they respond well (Hudson, now this). RIP the deceased crew in the Dash 8, they were going to provide relief to the affected zones if the earthquake and found this tragedy. @Jeremy By (anonymous) on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 09:00Z Why? What proof do you have that indicates that there was a fault related to aircraft's manufacture or design in the A350? Please stop trolling stupid comments. a350 disaster By jeremy, ca on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 08:45Z japan airlines now switching to safe boeing i guess @ (anonymous), re: Confusing statements regarding Coast Guard aircraft By Capt. Yossarian on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 08:44Z Should be no more than 6 kms or so rolling distance. And there might even have been a priority handling for the Coast Guard aircraft. @Andreas By FltOps on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 08:37Z RJTT TWR have 5 frequencies (118.1 118.575 126.2 118.725 118.8 124.35) 8 frequencies for departures and more 5 for GND. @Capt. Yossarian By (anonymous) on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 08:16Z What is so confusing about it? The JCG base/hangars are pretty much as far away from Rwy 34R as possible (at the very westernmost part of the airport). It's a long taxi route, and can include lengthy waits to allow other traffic to pass. By Hubert Pikl on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 08:13Z I express my deep respect and admiration to the crew of the A350. Confusing statements regarding Coast Guard aircraft By Capt. Yossarian on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 07:57Z The New York Times website still states that »A Coast Guard official said the Coast Guard aircraft had started taxiing to the runway around 4:45 p.m., about an hour before the collision«. Confusing ... Outfit of the passengers By Bertram on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 07:20Z Whenever you see these pictures, think about entering an aircraft with flip flop type shoes. Luckily it was winter in Japan. A silly question about onboard cameras By (anonymous) on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 04:38Z I have flown on JAL A359 domestically, and I know that those aircraft have a tail and belly mounted cameras that can be viewed by the passengers through the IFE. Does anyone know if the footage from those cameras is recorded for possible later use (like a car dashcam)? @Mark regarding evacuation order By (anonymous) on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 04:30Z \"I’m a little curious about why the reporting here says “ There was no clear announcement to evacuate, however, when other passengers stood up they also stood up and thus escaped.” This statement suggests the evacuation was initiated by passengers but there is no evidence of this.\" In case the PA system had become inoperative, it's no wonder if in a full aircraft and in a situation like this some passenger(s) fail to personally hear the command given by the crew. @Bob By Whoops on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 04:14Z The priority is to save the pax not the airframe in this situation. The fire crew will always take their time to assess the situation before setting up in strategic locations. It's all planned out with set positions to provide the optimal coverage with the available trucks. Comment about evacuation By Mark on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 03:07Z I’m a little curious about why the reporting here says “ There was no clear announcement to evacuate, however, when other passengers stood up they also stood up and thus escaped.” This statement suggests the evacuation was initiated by passengers but there is no evidence of this. Based on available video, which appears to show the cabin crew mid cabin, the JAL cabin crew are shouting standard emergency commands but also assessing their exits. These doors in the video appear to be near to the fire and were not opened to prevent fire entry. A training video on how JAL cabin crew evacuates an aircraft - and shows their shouted commands - can be found by searching for “ JAL ¢¤WÙá Ê%1ú\u0013ô x è Fire engines By Bob on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 02:08Z Am I the only one who's confused as for the response of the fire service? I didn't doubt that the frame would be a write-off but I have the impression that the fire crew only circled the aircraft and took to much time to start extinguishing it. For me it looked that more of the frame could have been saved. TWR 124.35 controlling RWY 05 ? By Andreas on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 02:02Z I get the impression, that TWR 124.35 was actually handling takeoffs from RWY 05. Did GND intend to route JA722A to RWY 05? I only have some very old charts from AIP Japan, but back then, the bridge to RWY 05 was managed by a separate GND controller, so it‘s not something to mess up easily. But procedures might have changed since then. Number of exits By (anonymous) on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 01:59Z There seems to be confusion on the number of evacuation slides used. Based on videos, I believe it is a total of 3 not 2 slides used. 2 on the left hand side, and 1 on the right. It appears that the right hand engine could not be shut down, which may explain why the right hand rear slide was not used. The overwing slides were of course unusable due to the fires. Kudos to the JAL crew and to Japanese discipline for saving many lives! Could have Been Much Much Worse. By Capt Jim Bigglesworth on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 01:51Z Should be relatively easy to determine cause(s). ATC recordings will be crucial. Human error in one form or another, I predict. Modelling will be used to show whether A359 and Dash 8 could have had visual contact and a go-around initiated, though at that late stage of landing commitment the engines may not have had time to spool to up to avoid the collision even if the JAL crew had spotted the Dash 8. With the approach angle this may not have been a possibility. Yet to be confirmed, there is chatter that the aircraft were on different Tower frequencies and may not have been aware of each other's presence through radio monitoring. If true, questions will be asked about the use of such a system, that's if it was an actual system and not a practice that had been allowed to develop. This could have been much, much worse and kudos for the JAL crew in getting the aircraft evacuated of all passengers. Condolences to the families of the deceased. The A350 appears to be quite a tough bird. By DEE on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 01:48Z Well done carbin crews , well done airbus! 375 pax were able to evacuate from only 2 exits. This is kinda epic human error. A359 , Japanese. Dash8, Japanese. ACT, Japanese. result: communication error . Two Frequencies By selmer40 on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 00:42Z Why was there two radio frequencies in use for one runway? @ WAG By Tuomas on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 00:42Z Looking at the damage of A350 nose, it looks pretty much like hitting straight to T-tail of the Dash. I'd say the height of the impact damage matches too. What else would hit so high on A350? By luck, Dash was thrown to the side of runway and not crushed underneath. Propably at least one the wings from Dash was cut away right after impact spilling fuel on runway and contributing the start of fire. Looking at A350, it seems to me have damaged leading edge between #1 engine and fuselage and on video engine cowling seems damaged on upper parts. Parts (wing) of Dash might have caused the damages while rolling away from runway. New Video By WAG on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 00:41Z new video taken from Left Front of the A350. Shows what looks like Right/#2 Engine still running during evacuation. Also liquid pouring out, from belly, Center main body. Minimal flames and entire fuselage is not burning yet. So a WAG that the dripping liquid was fuel, sparks and flames emitting from running engine caused lower fuselage fire, spread and destroyed entire jet. Not a WAG- Passengers behaved with admirable composure and followed FAs directions. No cabin luggage taken, no ‘panicking /entitled ninnies’. Air traffic control By Pjr on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 00:40Z It will be interesting to hear and compare the air traffic control tapes and instructions to both aircraft . And a lesson for the US where we have a shortage of controllers. Kudos to the Cabin Crew for banning baggage By Captain Crunch on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 00:32Z One dropped bag in the dark, smoky aisle could have dog-piled them all into a terminal blockage. I'll bet the electronics bay is completely destroyed with a nosegear shoved up into it, so maybe the cockpit couldn't issue a evacuation order. Also, did eng 2 keep running? Maybe they had no control of that either? Sounds like they read back that they were cleared to land 34R. Sounds like they were the first ones to land on 34R upon Haneda resuming parallel approaches. Different freq and a different controller for each Western and Eastern Runway Complexes. This happened right when the airport switched to Parallel ops. My suspicion right now, is that this is an ATC handoff accident to a new controller coming on duty. Is the prime-time controller handling both 34L AND ground control between the runways AND the JL-156 on approach to the right side? I hate it when they overload controllers, if that's what happened. JMHO's only and I could be wrong about everything. More By Tuomas on Wednesday, Jan 3rd 2024 00:11Z A350 crew would have had very limited visibilty to Dash at final moments before touchdown due to nose up attitude of a/c. And even if they saw it, propably too little time to react. This could have been the thing that saved them as well. With desperate attempt to go-around would likely have got a/c traveling faster and even airborne again. If they had impacted the Dash, chances for successful go-around would have been limited with damages and possibly fire. Finally, looks like most of Dash a/c was not stuck underneath the A350 (and thus likely not all the fuel from it). This could have been a factor for A350 resisting the fire a bit longer and staying better manouverable while gliding down the runway. RIP Dash crew and all the strenght to Dash captain if (hopefully) he/she will recover to be able to explain what happened in their cockpit at last moments. That would be very valuable data for investigation and preventing further occurences. Only the most recent 30 comments are shown to reduce server load.

Looks like trading long term flammability for initial rigidity lived up to the design intent.- Excellent evacuation job, especially as it looks like on some videos that the crew was unable to shut down the right engine, rendering the entire right side unusable (severed lines given the severe belly damage?) UPDATE: they actually did use the front right exit nevertheless https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;tanakamaru1999&#x2F;status&#x2F;1742132422005981578- Don’t have headphones with me and in a public space, but landing &#x2F; takeoff clearances should be somewhere in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.liveatc.net&#x2F;rjtt&#x2F;RJTT-Twr-TCA-Jan-02-2024-08... if someone wants to try and find them (timestamps towards end of url come in 30 minute increments). reply brunohaid 18 hours agoparentRe clearance&#x2F;cause: VASA https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fItu5qM7QfE also couldn&#x27;t make it out, but it sounds like the Coast Guard Dash 8 got a not really perfect taxi instruction (neither \"hold short\" nor \"line up and wait\") to one of the other C* intersections leading onto 34R while a Delta flight occupied C1, but entered the runway anyway. The A350 got a proper clearance it read back correctly.Also looks like all C hold short lines have embedded guard lights - ie the stop \"bar\" on the way to the runway should have been flashing brightly.* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anaas.ana-g.com&#x2F;img&#x2F;business&#x2F;general_aviation&#x2F;pd... reply BorgHunter 15 hours agorootparentWhether it was perfect or not, there are only a few words&#x2F;phrases that allow an aircraft to cross the hold short bars at an airport with an active control tower. \"Cross\", \"line up and wait\", and \"cleared for takeoff\" are pretty much it. Runway incursions are very dangerous, as this incident shows, and pilots must be very sure they have clearance before entering a runway. If anything is ambiguous in an instruction, pilots are trained to ask ATC for confirmation before proceeding.It&#x27;s also possible that there was more ATC communication that was not recorded. LiveATC comes from feeds provided by volunteers, whose receivers may be some distance from the airport and which may not receive signals 100% reliably. The investigators will have access to the official recordings made by JCAB (the Japanese aviation authorities). reply brunohaid 13 hours agorootparentAbsolutely right!Point was that if the taxi clearance didn&#x27;t include \"hold (short of 34R)\" it might be seen as contributing factor in line with ICAO[1] or FAA recommendations.Also quite terrifying that, given all the equipment at Haneda and according to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6NbVdIoJsHY, around 2:45, with taxi lights fully visible at 2:53, the DH8 was lined up on the runway for more than a minute before being run over by the A350.But as you say, preliminary report should already have a clear timeline of the tower tapes.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icao.int&#x2F;safety&#x2F;runwaysafety&#x2F;documents%20and%20t... reply HeyLaughingBoy 13 hours agorootparentprevIs \"line up and wait\" really the new approved terminology?

It changed to \"line up and wait\" on 2010&#x2F;09&#x2F;30 to match ICAO standards and because \"hold (on the runway)\" might be confused with \"hold short (of a runway&#x2F;taxiway), or \"hold position (wherever you are now)\".https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faa.gov&#x2F;airports&#x2F;runway_safety&#x2F;resources&#x2F;luaw reply fireflash38 10 hours agorootparentI do love how we try so hard to disambiguate language.

So: \"Flight A (already lined up on runway 35L), cleared for takeoff runway 35L.\" (some short time later while Flight A is still in the process of taking off) \"Flight B, runway 35L line up and wait\"Aircraft departing after an arrival. eg \"Flight A cleared to land, 35L\", and right as flight A has crossed the threshold: \"Flight B, runway 35L line up and wait\"Also, as mentioned by others, when there are other movements to cross a runway between departures. eg \"Flight A, at Foxtrot 5, cross Runway 35L. Flight B, runway 35L line up and wait\" reply epolanski 11 hours agorootparentprev> and pilots must be very sure they have clearance before entering a runwayThe word \"clearance\" is used uniquely in the context of landing and departing exactly to avoid mistakes and has to be repeated again by the aircraft before ATC confirms. reply andkenneth 10 hours agorootparentThe terms \"cleared to land\" and \"cleared for takeoff\" are extremely specific (a regulation written in blood like many aviation rules), but \"cross runway\" and \"line up and wait\" also give permission for aircraft to enter the runway.The word \"cleared\" is often used for IFR clearance delivery as well which gives you permission to navigate via a planned route to a particular point, so it&#x27;s much more common than just takeoffs and landings. reply lxgr 11 hours agorootparentprevTrue in terms of phraseology (i.e. the actual word is not used in voice ATC communications), but all ATC instructions are generally referred to as clearances. reply throw0101d 21 hours agoparentprev> Excellent evacuation jobWhile there many silly reasons to force people to shutdown electronics and such on planes, I think forcing people to not have any distractions during take-offs and landings is a good thing.Over 50% of incidents (fatal and hull loss&#x2F;non-fatal) occurring during landing:* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;accidentstats.airbus.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;accident-by-flig...* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.1001crash.com&#x2F;transport-page-statistique-lg-2-nu...With take-off and descent&#x2F;approach being the next two more frequent phases. reply weinzierl 17 hours agorootparentEven more so: Keeping the shades open could have really made a significant difference in this case, because it could have helped the flight attendants to quickly determine the exits that are safe. reply traceroute66 16 hours agorootparent> it could have helped the flight attendants to quickly determine the exits that are safe.For obvious reasons, ordering the evacuation, in conjunction with criteria such as which side and which doors is the Captain&#x27;s job, or if the Captain is incapacitated, the First Officer. They will have access to far more data than the cabin crew will (e.g. whether the engines are safely shut down, circumstances on the ground thanks to radio contact etc.).The Cabin Crew will not make the decision themselves unless they have been unable to establish contact with the cockpit (i.e. both flight crew incapacitated). In normal circumstances the Cabin Crew are only there to action the Flight Crew&#x27;s orders. reply cryptonector 16 hours agorootparentThis is not at all obvious. The pilots can&#x27;t look backwards and don&#x27;t have eyes in the cabin. There have been cases of engine fires and failures where the pilots had to go into the passenger cabin to examine the damage.Communication is key, but comms might have been down, too. In cases like this the cabin crew have to be prepared to initiate an evacuation on their own, and they have to be prepared to choose which doors to use. reply traceroute66 15 hours agorootparent> the cabin crew have to be prepared to initiate an evacuation on their ownRe-read my post, because your conclusion is saying exactly what I already said with your words \"be prepared to\".To repeat what I said, but in simpler terms:In an ideal world, the Flight Crew have the responsibility for ordering evacuation and the associated parameters. End of story, no argument.BUT there is a well rehearsed, well practiced, protocol which surrounds this !So, at one extreme, if the Cabin Crew cannot communicate with the Flight Deck, then the decision is clearly theirs.But before the extreme, we have the obvious scenario .... Cabin Crew act as additional eyes and ears for Flight Crew.BUT in this scenario we are back to my main point ... the buck stops at the Captain to make the decision !!! The Cabin Crew are telling the Captain what they see, its ultimately his call. reply cryptonector 14 hours agorootparentYou wrote:> They will have access to far more data than the cabin crew will (e.g. whether the engines are safely shut down, circumstances on the ground thanks to radio contact etc.).This is not remotely guaranteed. It would be more accurate to say that the pilots will have access to information that the cabin crew don&#x27;t have access to and vice versa. If the cabin crew sees that the plane has stopped, there&#x27;s a fire on board, and instructions are not forthcoming from the pilots, the cabin crew absolutely must initiate an evacuation sua sponte. Heck, if the cabin crew won&#x27;t do it then the passengers might. People can and do freeze in the face of emergencies. When you have a fire on board all bets are off, and someone had better step up and begin the evacuation -- better that it all be orderly than not, but also better that it happen at all than not. reply ta1243 13 hours agorootparentprevIf the Captain says \"evacuate from all doors on port side\", yet the FA sees flames outside the door on the port side, the FA does not evacuate through those flames reply cryptonector 12 hours agorootparentRight! In a chaotic situation, the idea of hierarchy goes out the window. It is essential that all act rationally as much as possible and make the best decisions that they can with what information is available to them. And it is essential that all staff (flight crew, cabin crew) act with celerity as well to avoid panic among the passengers. Because if the passengers are left on their own then conflicts are more likely to arise just merely on account of the number of passengers being large, and conflicts in such a situation are very likely to be deadly. reply sbierwagen 6 hours agorootparentprevNotably, Qantas Flight 32 back in 2010, where the flight crew had a dozen contradictory ECAM messages, and it took the second officer entering the cabin to see that an engine had blown up. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;admiralcloudberg.medium.com&#x2F;a-matter-of-millimeters-...>In the meantime, the cabin crew had been attempting to get the pilots’ attention using the emergency call button, but all the pilots were so focused on the failures that they initially didn’t notice. Only now did they send Second Officer Mark Johnson to assess the situation in the cabin, whereupon a Qantas pilot riding as a passenger in the upper deck drew his attention to the in-flight entertainment system, which featured a live view of the aircraft from a tail-mounted camera. The digital stream clearly showed a much more literal stream of fuel pouring from the left wing and into the aircraft’s wake, which was also visible with the naked eye from the lower deck. Johnson proceeded down to check for himself, at which point he also observed for the first time that there were two gaping holes in the top of the left wing, surrounded by jagged metal, where the turbine disk fragments had exited. reply nradov 10 hours agorootparentprevThe Airbus A350 has an external camera mounted on the tail. I believe that pilots can monitor that video feed in the cockpit so if the system is still working then they should be able to see a fire on one side. But I don&#x27;t know whether that was possible in this incident. reply SoftTalker 15 hours agorootparentprevCabin crew play a critical role in informing the flight deck of external conditions especially fire that would preclude use of specific exits in an evacuation. reply IndrekR 13 hours agorootparentprevCabin crew are also eyes for the flight crew.

Even if everyone is still coherent technical problems alone can have quite horrific results. Using a megaphone to communicate is just not that useful in a plane. Which is why every flight attended will stay at their assigned doors instead of comforting passengers. They seem to have quite a bit responsibility when it comes to determining if its a functioning escape route. reply weinzierl 14 hours agorootparentprevMakes sense, but why do we have to open the shades during take-off and landing? It&#x27;s a honest question, I always heard in case of emergency for the personnel being able to see all sides, but if that&#x27;s not it, what is it? reply sitharus 12 hours agorootparentIt is so the flight attendants can see outside, and also so the passengers’ eyes are adapted to outside light in case of an evacuation. You don’t want people hesitating on the slides because they can’t see. reply justsomehnguy 10 hours agorootparentprevThe other one, often forgotten reason: rescuers should be able see inside. reply anigbrowl 14 hours agorootparentprevThe shades were open, or at least people quickly opened them (based on cellphone video from inside the plane). reply whycome 4 hours agorootparentprevThe \"excellent evacuation job\" is being judged by footage taken from electronic devices. There&#x27;s obviously at least some utility in these scenarios. The ones on their phones filming what they see outside are probably pretty aware of the situation. If you&#x27;ve crash landed, it would mean nothing that you were distracted on a device. You&#x27;re not exactly trying to continue watching a movie. reply jefftk 21 hours agorootparentprevOver 50%, sure, but 50% of a very small number. How many deaths do you expect keeping passengers from being distracted at these times would prevent?(I expect if you compare that to the number of people inconvenienced by the rule it&#x27;s a terrible trade off.) reply morsch 17 hours agorootparentThe number of fatalities and injuries seems minuscule because it&#x27;s normalised over distance traveled.This makes sense, because air travel is the only way to make voyages over this distance. But it also doesn&#x27;t make sense for the same reason -- it&#x27;s stupid to compare a 6000 mile holiday flight with a 6000 mile holiday road trip, because people don&#x27;t routinely make those. You&#x27;re still more likely to get injured on an eight hour car ride than on an eight hour flight, but the difference isn&#x27;t a factor 600.In much the same way, air travel is also arguably moderately efficient in terms of CO2 per mile, except that it&#x27;s also a super easy way -- in fact, practically the only way -- to accrue tens of thousands of miles every year, so the efficiency is kind of irrelevant. reply sokoloff 17 hours agorootparentI know people who are already at the \"if driving takes less than 8 hours, I&#x27;d rather drive than fly\" level. Every additional inconvenience (or psychological impediment) added to the safest mode of long-distance travel has a risk of decreasing overall safety.It&#x27;s not particularly relevant to an international flight into Japan, but the extent to which increasing annoyance&#x2F;instilling fear of airline passengers causing people to drive instead must be weighed against the small safety benefit resulting from a policy of telling passengers \"we think this phase of flight contains the most highly concentrated risk, so for the next 15 minutes, please put away all of your distractions, prepare for a possible crash, and try not to think about the fact that we could turn this aircraft into a tumbling, burning ball of wreckage at any moment.\"Something similar was the primary justification to support the continuation of \"infant in arms\" travel by passengers under the age of 2, with an expected 60:1 ratio of lives that would be lost if infants were required to occupy ticketed seats vs being carried in arms.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ntsb.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;events&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;child_safety-Clau... reply d1sxeyes 14 hours agorootparentFor other people who might not have followed completely: the NTAB don’t say (explicitly) that forcing children to occupy a seat of their own would result in 60 times as many deaths. They estimated the risk of lap infant deaths as 1 every 10 years, and then they estimated that if the cost of travel increased for families, enough families would instead choose to drive that 60 infants would die in road accidents in that same 10 year period. reply sokoloff 14 hours agorootparentThanks for posting that. It was perfectly clear in my head, but I really made a hash of describing it when summarizing it my post upthread. reply morsch 3 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately, there&#x27;s very little detail on how they arrive at the 60:1 ratio in that PowerPoint presentation. reply TylerE 17 hours agorootparentprevThat’s me. But for totally different reasons. I’m a 4-5 hour round trip by car to the nearest airport that actually flys anywhere. So unless it’s more than about a 8-10 hour drive, it’s faster (and way cheaper) to drive than fly. reply AnimalMuppet 17 hours agorootparentprevI once traveled for business from Salt Lake City to Fort Collins, Colorado.1&#x2F;2 hour to the airport + get to the airport 2 hours before flight + 1 hour direct flight to Denver + 1&#x2F;2 hour to deplane + 1&#x2F;2 hour to get bags + 1&#x2F;2 hour to get rental car + 1 hour drive to Fort Collins. Total 6 hours. Seems like it actually totalled 7 but I don&#x27;t remember where the extra time was.Versus 7 hours drive time from Salt Lake to Fort Collins.And if two people are going, you only drive one car, but you buy two plane tickets.And my car has more legroom than a coach seat.So, yes, flying is safer per mile, but the \"under 8 hours\" crowd also have a point... reply SoftTalker 17 hours agorootparentI pretty much have gotten to where I only fly if driving is impossible (e.g. crossing an ocean). reply gambiting 15 hours agorootparentprevWe literally decided to drive from UK to Poland this year(12 hour overnight ferry + another 12 hours of driving) instead of flying, because we hate Christmas flying so much, it&#x27;s always a shit show, we always end up ill because everyone is coughing, at least with driving we can take it at our own pace - we want to stop, we stop. reply jrockway 13 hours agorootparentprevThe statistics are also available as \"per passenger-hour\", which eliminates the speed factor. An 8 hour road trip is reasonable. An 8 hour flight is on the longer side. reply ta1243 12 hours agorootparentAn 8 hour flight is a normal intercontinental flight, not even particularly long (London - New York&#x2F;Delhi&#x2F;Nairobi&#x2F;Dubai sort of distance). Longer flights like London-LA&#x2F;Singapore&#x2F;Joburg&#x2F;Tokyo are perfectly normal, or reasonable.I would rarely do 8 hours driving in a single day, let alone 12. Certainly couldn&#x27;t do that for work, would be massively against policy. reply HPsquared 14 hours agorootparentprevSimilar to the Jevons Paradox, where increases in energy efficiency often lead to greater overall consumption, as the higher efficiency broadens the scope of the activity.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jevons_paradox reply ghaff 17 hours agorootparentprevAnd for anyone who remembers the electronics during takeoff and landing ban once cell phones became common it was a massive hassle for flight attendants as many passengers routinely ignored instructions. reply ryandrake 16 hours agorootparentNever really understood this \"we can&#x27;t enforce the rules because people routinely ignore the rules\" attitude. This should be dead simple on an airplane, where the airline knows who each passenger is by seat. So have one flight attendant make one pass down the aisle warning everyone to put away their phones, then have another one follow a minute or so later just making note of which seats are still using their phones. No-fly-list them all later. After this policy became known, people would be strongly incentivized to get with the program. reply ghshephard 14 hours agorootparentEven when there was a rule that cell-phones were supposed to be turned off, studies showed that 20-25% of cell phones were still active (Possibly forgotten in pockets) - wasting time, energy, traveler patience, on something that was entirely theater (I don&#x27;t believe there was ever a single incident associated with an active cell phone - which makes sense given the 10s of thousands per day that were powered on during takeoff) - seems like the worst possible tradeoff ever. The \"No cell phone use during takeoff\" or \"No mobile phone use during flight\" (China Air used to do that - very, very annoying) - bureaucracy flex just because the could. reply ryandrake 14 hours agorootparentI think the \"no cellphones\" rule is about minimizing distractions during critical phases of flight, not because a phone&#x27;s radio is going to do damage to the aircraft.

For example, we could prohibit radios in cars because the music and adjustment can be distracting and lead to collisions. Or ban cars entirely since they&#x27;re much more dangerous than walking and public transport. We could require everyone to wear an N95 all winter. Ban phones for the entirety of the flight, and prohibit books as well. Happy to give more examples of similarly bad tradeoffs!If you make policy with a principle of being unwilling to trade off deaths against inconvenience in any circumstance you&#x27;ll have somewhat fewer deaths and unbearable levels of inconvenience. reply spanktheuser 19 hours agorootparentIn this case, however, the impact is knowable:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;etsc.eu&#x2F;increasing-the-survival-rate-in-aircraft-acc...Furthermore, distracted or unprepared passengers impact the evacuation of others trapped behind them. I’ve participated in evacuation training for flight attendants and have personally witnessed how a bungled jump down evacuation slide led to a 5-10 second delay. This was equated with ~20 fatalities due to smoke inhalation in the simulation. reply jefftk 19 hours agorootparentMy objection isn&#x27;t that the impact of banning electronics during takeoff and landing is unknowable; that&#x27;s not the main issue with banning car radios, cars, or bare faces either. Instead it&#x27;s that the impact is too small to be worth the cost. reply spanktheuser 17 hours agorootparentI think its fair to say I misread the thrust of your argument. I still come down on the other side; I am comfortable enforcing a widespread deprivation of a convenience in order to further reduce the risk of a rare but catastrophic outcome. reply mh- 3 hours agorootparentRealize that if you make commercial air travel sufficiently (further) unpleasant, many of those people will choose to drive to their destinations instead.This will cause a net increase in deaths because, mile-for-mile, driving is orders of magnitude more deadly than flying commercial. reply lupusreal 16 hours agorootparentprevBanning car stereos would be a good idea. Besides distracting drivers, listening to music also helps people push past their normal fatigue limit and drive for much longer than they should. Driving tired is about as dangerous as driving drunk. reply filleduchaos 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m curious what the relevant part of that article is? As far as I can tell the only pertinent reference to passenger behaviour is the listing of \"Passengers&#x27; knowledge of safety procedures and their motivation to get acquainted with them\" as a factor in evacuation, which...does not really have anything to do with whether the passenger is \"distracted\" at the moment of an incident occurring.I feel like people are equating \"not paying attention\" (which, what does that even mean for a passenger in a jetliner? not paying attention to what?) with \"unpreparedness\" when that doesn&#x27;t really make any sense. reply Retric 19 hours agorootparentprevThe inconvenience vs risk threshold here is similar to bucking a seatbelt which is hard to argue is a poor investment.Aircraft may be very safe on a per mile basis, but those risks are extremely concentrated around takeoff and landing. Which are fast events, so the risk per second is relatively high even though flying is generally much safer than driving. reply filleduchaos 18 hours agorootparent> The inconvenience vs risk threshold here is similar to bucking a seatbelt which is hard to argue is a poor investment.It really, really is not. Seatbelts actively prevent injuries from sudden violent phenomena. \"Paying attention\" does absolutely nothing to reduce the forces you are subject to in the event of, say, a collision with a Dash 8 that was on your runway at landing. It helps post-incident at best.And I have \"paying attention\" in quotes because I feel like people are ignoring how attention actually works when they propose things like this. Human brains actively reroute focus in response to stimuli - like, say, a collision with a Dash 8 that was on your runway at landing. That&#x27;s the whole concept of \"a distraction\". Hell, just a car braking particularly hard is stimulus enough to capture its passengers&#x27; attention, to talk of a plane landing going wrong in such a catastrophic manner. By the time the cabin crew is even ready to begin an evacuation, whether or not a person was fiddling with their phone (or just staring into space) some seconds before the incident seems highly irrelevant. reply Retric 17 hours agorootparentFast isn’t instant. At 30,000 feet there’s plenty of time, at ground level things can go very badly extremely quickly and rapid task switching increases panic.There’s several ways paying attention directly increases safety. First many evacuations aren’t fast enough for everyone to escape so even fractions of a second directly correlate to lives. Taking the crash position promptly reduces the risk of injury most importantly disabling injuries which may slow people exiting the aircraft. Safety briefings give relevant information in the event of an emergency which means people act more appropriately. reply filleduchaos 16 hours agorootparentFor one thing, an evacuation is not something you begin to do the instant an accident occurs; it takes time to reach a physical state where evacuation is even possible at all. For instance, there is video footage from the inside of the A350 (taken by a passenger who was...you know...using their phone, and all 379 people on the board still exited in a timely manner). It took well over 10 seconds for the plane to even finish its landing roll-out post-collision and come to a stop. Handwringing over the fractions of a second that it took a passenger that was \"paying attention\" and someone that was looking at their phone or reading a book to realise that the plane had had an accident makes no sense. There is nothing either of them can do or should do until the situation has stabilised somewhat.For another, taking the brace position is something you do with forewarning and instruction from the crew, and the circumstances that lead to that forewarning are very capable of capturing attention. Additionally, safety briefings are given when the plane is very firmly planted on the ground pre-flight (cabin crew may repeat&#x2F;re-explain instructions like how to put on a life vest or how to properly take a brace position during an emergency if circumstances permit). And that&#x27;s really the crux of it: the time for a passenger to pay attention is while they are being briefed or otherwise addressed by the crew, and while they can properly review their specific plane&#x27;s safety information and setup. After that, there is literally nothing for the passenger to actively pay attention to.Staring very hard at the seat in front of you or out of the window \"in case something happens\" is not paying attention to anything but your own anxiety. You can be prepared and be ready for alerts without literally sitting and doing nothing; the human brain may not be capable of a lot of things, but it is very capable of that much. reply Retric 11 hours agorootparentFirst electronic devices + headphones provide significant isolation from what’s going on.

My sense that the tradeoff is not worth it is based on thinking that (a) there aren&#x27;t that many deaths to be prevented and (b) banning the devices wouldn&#x27;t increase the chance of survival during an evacuation by very much. reply hef19898 17 hours agorootparentSee, thing is, ypur oinion doesn&#x27;t really matter when it comes to banning electronics during take of and landing, mine doesn&#x27;t neither.

The total number of plane deaths is already low, and the fraction where a slightly more efficient evacuation would have made a difference is even lower.I think we may also disagree about how much it matters to subject ~4.5B people annually (the total number of passengers) to an additional ten minutes of boredom?

Like remembering where the safety doors are.Maybe this is more along those lines. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Law_of_truly_large_numbers The law of truly large numbers (a statistical adage), attributed to Persi Diaconis and Frederick Mosteller, states that with a large enough number of independent samples, any highly implausible (i.e. unlikely in any single sample, but with constant probability strictly greater than 0 in any sample) result is likely to be observed.[1] Because we never find it notable when likely events occur, we highlight unlikely events and notice them more.The law is meant to make a statement about probabilities and statistical significance: in large enough masses of statistical data, even minuscule fluctuations attain statistical significance. Thus in truly large numbers of observations, it is paradoxically easy to find significant correlations, in large numbers, which still do not lead to causal theories (see: spurious correlation), and which by their collective number,[4] might lead to obfuscation as well reply jefftk 15 hours agorootparent> that is also the time when people should be watching the safety videoI thought we were talking about the most dangerous parts of a flight, takeoff and landing, which are not when the safety video (or presentation) happens?> With a huge number, it is possible to make something look reasonable or un-reasonable.

I think a better way to make this at a scale that works well is to look at everything on a per-person basis. So if it saves one life per year (which I suspect is high) then we&#x27;re balancing 10min of boredom against 0.0002 micromorts [1], in the same range as traveling 270ft by car.

[2][1] 1 in 4.5B chance of death[2] 230mi per micromort, so 100mi is 0.435 micromorts and 101mi is 0.439 for a difference of 0.004 micromorts. If the journey is 1.5hr then this is 9 rounds of trading off 10min of boredom for 0.0004 micromorts. Which is twice the risk of death we&#x27;re positing in the airplane example. reply FrustratedMonky 14 hours agorootparentYes, take off and landing.Typically the phones have to be off by the time the safety video is happening. I think they do this on purpose so you are paying attention. Seems like they occur very close together.I might be assuming too much overlap, like if there is longer delay waiting on tarmac.

It&#x27;s a red-eye flight after all.2. You seem to be assuming that \"evacuating a burning plane\" is some kind of split-second thing, like a quicktime event in a video game. In reality, at least for this incident, there was a span of a significant number of seconds between \"impact\" and \"plane slows down enough for emergency slides to extend and evacuation to begin.\" 30, maybe 60 seconds.... I&#x27;m not sure, but there was no real positive action for a passenger to take during that time. Shifting attention away from one&#x27;s phone certainly has a nonzero time cost, but not remotely comparable to the time it took for the plane to come to a full stop.Again, you&#x27;re dealing in hypotheticals, while the actual reality of this incident (phones in use, orderly exit achieved, all lives saved) contradicts whatever it is you are imagining. reply jefftk 20 hours agorootparentprevWhere&#x27;s that number coming from? reply throw0101d 20 hours agorootparentThe number of souls on board for JL516.* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Japan_Airlines_Flight_516 reply jefftk 20 hours agorootparentBut all JL516 passengers survived?

I don&#x27;t know their SOP wrt. running engines, or if this engine was even &#x27;running&#x27; and not just freewheeling (it doesn&#x27;t seem to be producing meaningful air movement), but it appears they made a rational decision to use the R1 exit, since everyone survived and the evacuation was pretty quick (~2 minutes).> It took the firefighters over six minutes to respond to the site of the burning aircraft. In the US and Europe this would be unheard of, the fire brigade would be rolling as soon as the aircraft hit the ground.I haven&#x27;t found video of the very early moments after the aircraft stopped, but there appears to already be foam laid down under and on the aircraft and at least two trucks attending during the late stages of the evacuation, so I don&#x27;t know where you got this 6 minutes from. Given the circumstances, the crew waiting 6 minutes to begin evacuating doesn&#x27;t sound reasonable.> The only reason hundreds of people are not dead is directly attributable to the Japanese being an overly polite and orderly culture.Yes, the passengers are also an important part of an effective evacuation, and it is why you should not ignore the safety briefing and follow the instructions of the crew. Good on the passengers for effecting a successful evacuation in this case. You might well be right it would have gone down differently elsewhere, with the eventual report yet again espousing the importance of leaving the baggage behind and maintaining order. This is reason to praise the passengers&#x27; behaviour and learn from it, not somehow criticize it as &#x27;overly polite and orderly&#x27;.I am sure there were things that could have been done better, but this was a successful and quick evacuation. It&#x27;s far too early to decide what went well and what could be done better, but it&#x27;s pretty clear that it was a good job - everyone got out quickly and with minimal injury. reply JCharante 8 hours agorootparentprevI heard that the engine 2 was still running during the evacuation and that the front door on the right was used for evacuation, that sounds really scary and I&#x27;m very glad no one was sucked into the engine. reply gosub100 6 hours agorootparentprev> The only reason hundreds of people are not dead is directly attributable to the Japanese being an overly polite and orderly culture.Contrast this to the South Korean ferry disaster [1] where hundreds of Koreans (inb4 someone pops me with \"Japanese and Korean are completely different countries...\" - yes, I am aware) died as a result of being orderly and compliant.

That&#x27;s just one on my commute. Then there&#x27;s driving uphill on snow, seeing a person walking on the other side of the road and a car coming in the other direction. You foresee that this car will have some problems braking for that person (which would be the normal procedure - I&#x27;m coming the other way, that car shouldn&#x27;t try to pass the person). So, what I do is to slow down and give that other driver confidence to pass. And sometimes I have to do the other thing - speeding up a bit in order to create room for another car to let that car avoid problems (if I were a computer I would have no reason to think about that).This is also something happening all the time where I drive. And tons of other understanding-the-traffic cases.Self-driving systems only follow the rules. That is not sufficient. When general artificial intelligence eventually arrives - that&#x27;s when we get self-driving cars better than humans, in any other cases than for trivial cases.

In the Linate air disaster a small Cessna Citation invaded the runtime due to fog and misscomunication.2) You need to implement it for ground vehicles too, as in the LATAM example it was a fire truck that invaded the runtime.3) You need A LOT of infrastructural update.4) Even if you had computers talking to computers, this may still be far from enough to avoid collisions, as those mistakes are often a matter of seconds (as in the both accidents quoted before).5) Automation brings its own issues. One of them is complacency where attention levels unavoidably get lower as reliance on automation increases. In turn complacency can make runways more prone to such incidents in case of malfunctions&#x2F;bugs. reply konschubert 20 hours agorootparentYou can have this as an additional safety layer.You don’t need to update everything at once.If anything is able to react within seconds, it’s a computer. reply NBJack 18 hours agorootparentThis is a gross oversimplification.Yes, in this case, you do need to update everything at once. At least for a given aiport. All it takes is one plane, helicopter, fire truck, or baggage transport vehicle to screw with the assumptions of the system and jeopardize safety.No, computers aren&#x27;t necessarily faster, assuming we want to achieve autonomy on the ground. Note that the average human reaction time to visual stimulus is about 250ms. Achieving this on a plane would require a great deal of cameras and sensors that would not only need to stay clean, but capable of withstanding pressure changes, high velocity winds, the occasional unfortunate airborne debris, etc. Then there is the processing power to both process each input in real-time (per plane) and train it on real-world data to recognize a variety of scenarios to act upon (per model and perhaps configuration; AA alone has about 11 active aircraft types across 953 planes).

TCAS is a great example of an obvious solution to mid-air collisions - two devices seamlessly negotiate for one plane to go up, the other to go down.One I can think of is an electronic runway \"lock\". ATC mark the runway as locked to a particular aircraft. The landing aircraft checks at minimums whether if the runway is locked to any other aircraft. It&#x27;s harder to know how to prevent incursions at ground level, but it could be a beacon near the runway threshold and intersecting taxiways, flashing a warning in the cockpit of the taxing aircraft if an aircraft on final holds the lock. A pilot could still disregard it. Sometimes two planes can share the same runway, such as a plane lining up while another vacates, which adds further problems.I&#x27;m not aware of any system like this. reply tjohns 12 hours agorootparentRunway Status Lights (RWSL) are close to what you&#x27;re describing.

One could argue \"well, then maybe they weren&#x27;t actually that important, were they?\" but I&#x27;d reply that usually the criteria to define something as important is measured with growth potential, and that&#x27;s the wrong bar to use.That&#x27;s how we end up with \"we&#x27;ll build it in Electron for the time being and later will rebuild in proper native apps if the idea works\" ends up being still Electron 10 years later.

People usually says \"so what, RAM is there to be used\" (I even think I saw it in this thread).But when 3 of these bulky apps are eating the whole RAM and no more software can run because of them, it&#x27;s the user, especially the not very savvy user, the one who usually assumes their computer doesn&#x27;t work any more for modern software and they need to incur in the effort and cost of acquiring a new one.Electron is a fine way to test a market, but it is only financially viable to use long term (such as done by Slack, Discord or Spotify) because it externalizes the actual cost to its users.For an app that is open-use-close, it&#x27;s ok and I see no issue. But for apps meant to be constantly running in the background (like a music player or a chat app) I think Electron is almost a sin against its users. reply yashap 12 hours agorootparentprevAgreed, and as much as ppl hate it, this applies to a11y too. Ultimately all work that businesses do is only done if it’s a high enough priority for the business.

Not the company holdings. Also, that doesn&#x27;t address that a rewrite comes with stalled features (often), as well as new bugs introduced. How much of a business value is there in that rewrite? We&#x27;re talking about a business. These are tools that are usually forced upon people by management, and if it works but is a little slow or taking large amounts of memory, management will either do nothing because they got a discount or upgrade machines. At the end of the day, for most it&#x27;s \"good enough\".To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that a developer culture shouldn&#x27;t strive for this, but these are large businesses and are out for that dollar, and neither seem to be run by developers that would call for a rewrite. reply dylan604 10 hours agorootparent>and neither seem to be run by developers that would call for a rewrite.No, but they seem to be run UI people. They can justify doing a rewrite of the UI, but not the core? Not one person that I interact with using Slack appreciated the UI changes reply progmetaldev 9 hours agorootparentIn my experience, which may not be common, UI people tend to be more social than backend developers. In reality, and this is not a judgment as to what is right and wrong, but who is more readily able to push for change? Someone that is deep into the software, or someone who is closer to management and able to communicate more effectively (as far as socializing and building a rapport?). Again, I&#x27;m not saying it is right, I&#x27;m just going by the reality of how software works. This is a good reason for independent software developers to exist! I agree that there is huge business value in writing correct software that is performant, and gets the job done properly. I agree with you that Slack&#x27;s UI could be improved drastically. The problem is that it&#x27;s driven by money rather than productivity. I&#x27;m pretty sure you and I both agree on how software SHOULD be, but that is not how software actually is, and I don&#x27;t think it will be until it gets out of the grips of large software developers, or we start to write for performance in an attempt to make software that is environmentally performant.I&#x27;m not sure if we ever get to the point where developers need to start worrying about performance for environmental purposes, that we&#x27;ll survive if the performance impacts have been measured properly. I&#x27;m not trying to be depressing, but I just don&#x27;t think that it would ever happen until it was too late. Maybe there would be a minority left of society to do this, but that would be building back society. Doomsday scenario.

Then you make concessions to make sure it works in the flawed reality it needs to operate in.A classic example from back in the day (maybe it’s still this way): don’t just design your webpages for IE. Write the markup and stylesheets as they ought to be, then amend as necessary to make it look correct for each browser’s quirks. reply mattchamb 11 hours agorootparentTo interpret your example in another way, a page working in IE is doing it right. So first you do it, and structure it the way you think it should be done with \"correct\" markup. Once you have that, you can then do it right and get it working properly in IE. After that, doing it better would be restructuring things so maybe you dont need as many hacks. reply pixl97 11 hours agorootparentReality: Your employer doesn&#x27;t pay you to write &#x27;right&#x27; software, they want a deliverable that works in IE by end of day tomorrow and for the life of you, you can&#x27;t figure out where half the elements are actually displaying. reply stouset 5 hours agorootparentReality: it is far easier to iterate on software that’s clean and mostly correct than it is to do on software that is riddled with hacks, gotchas, footguns, and long-distance side effects.It’s extremely depressing working with “senior” engineers who’ve spent an entire career with the above mentality, who have missed out on any chance at ever learning how to actually engineer software for reliability and maintainability. Their inability to do so reflects on a lack of practice rather than some sort of fundamental impossibility.

SWEs are typically shielded from the business side so many don&#x27;t understand this and treat it like an art form, which it can be, but that is not its primary purpose. If Electron didn&#x27;t work, people wouldn&#x27;t use it.

Each iteration was small but we measured everything and made sure it had impact. Every feature was built properly, IE tested, refactored, typed etc. It made our pace more steady. If something didn’t have an impact we tried to understand why, incidents were reported and properly remedied. Still the most solid way I’ve worked. reply sanderjd 11 hours agoparentprevAll three legs of the \"first do it, then do it right, then do it better\" stool are necessary parts of this philosophy &#x2F; methodology. It&#x27;s indeed a difficult and rarely-achieved practice. But personally, I think it&#x27;s the better aspiration, even recognizing that it often gets stuck at the first step. I think the alternative of trying to start with \"build it right\" also usually falls into its own failure modes - analysis paralysis, crumbling under the weight of adding all the complexity all at once rather than iteratively, etc. - which in my view are even worse. reply hinkley 10 hours agoparentprevMy read is that most people try to skip step 2. So we either stay with the kludge, or we double down on it, making it even more expensive to remove than if we had just left it.The real revelation for me though is the reversible decision, to the point that for really reversible decisions, I can be very averse to us spending any significant meeting time on it at all.

It is an acknowledgement that there aren&#x27;t enough devs on payroll to support a true-native app. The tradeoff is RAM for developer time and hiring efficiency. That is a pretty good trade; RAM is there to be used.The technical issue here is that the protocol is closed, not that the client is fat. So someone in a RAM-constrained environment can&#x27;t choose to make different trade offs. But the protocol being closed, while annoying as a user, is definitely a strategic choice. reply Analemma_ 13 hours agorootparentPeople who constantly bellyache about Electron need to compare the all-up cost of one web developer-- of which there is a massive supply in the labor market-- versus one experienced native dev per OS, who are rare and expensive and getting more so all the time as the desktop withers as a development platform. That cost difference absolutely can be the difference between economic viability and unviability, but HN constantly seems to think companies only pick Electron because they&#x27;re cackling with glee at the thought of wasting their customer&#x27;s CPU cycles or whatever. reply progmetaldev 11 hours agorootparentOn top of having different teams supporting each OS, because a company developing a project this large isn&#x27;t going to have a small team where the developers know each OS (not quite full-stack in the web development stack, but just comparable to developers that know every OS they need to build for). There then needs to be communication between different development teams, as well as offering feature-parity across OS&#x27;s, because your clients need to be able to communicate with each other across OS&#x27;s since your product is a chat application for business. It&#x27;s not normally acceptable to have features that are different between OS&#x27;s when your product is meant for team chat. reply treprinum 12 hours agoparentprevNothing is more permanent than a temporary solution. reply marcosdumay 13 hours agoparentprevIf you don&#x27;t have the time and agency to do-it-right, you won&#x27;t.It&#x27;s tempting to believe that just by dropping the \"discover what you need to do step\" and you&#x27;ll get enough time for it and make the thing a single change you can plug on your Jira.

You can make it work&#x2F;right and then realize you designed the core data structures completely wrong for performance. I know, I&#x27;ve made that mistake terribly before where I avoided performance until a year after a project was in flight, only to realize the fundamental API design actually made it impossible to fix. Had to basically start from scratch.Of course it depends on if performance matters much, but it often does. reply sodapopcan 13 hours agorootparentJoe Armstrong, one of the inventors of Erlang, seems to agree on your last point. He said: \"Make it work, then make it beautiful, then if you really, really have to, make it fast.\" I think \"make it right\" is often a moving target in software development (depending on how you&#x27;re looking at it). reply Jtsummers 14 hours agorootparentprev> I know, I&#x27;ve made that mistake terribly before where I avoided performance until a year after a project was in flight [emphasis added]It&#x27;s not about avoiding making it fast, it&#x27;s about prioritizing. There&#x27;s a probably apocryphal story from, I believe, The Psychology of Computer Programming (Weinberg) where a mainframe programmer opposed a new program because it wouldn&#x27;t be as fast as theirs. Except their program produced garbage results, and the new one produced correct results.The priority was in the wrong place (speed) rather than the business need (correctness).There&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with making your program fast, so long as it&#x27;s not to the detriment of correctness or while avoiding making it correct. Fighting for performance boosts in your data access patterns or data layouts while still manipulating the data incorrectly is a fruitless endeavor. reply Tallain 14 hours agorootparentprevI see Make It Fast as a discrete step after Make It Right, because if it&#x27;s made Right, then you can swap out the parts where optimizations need to be made. While you can&#x27;t always know where slowness will occur, you do know that it will happen one day, and design the system so that swapping the \"slow part\" for a \"fast part\" is relatively trivial. That&#x27;s the Make It Right part.An well-designed API should behave so that you can fudge up whatever is happening behind the scenes, so long as the outputs remain the same based on the inputs. Design for consistency and idempotency. Implementation (read: behind the scenes) details are just that, details, and subject to change. If your implementation is tied to your interface, there are bigger problems and you skipped the Make It Right part. reply jandrewrogers 11 hours agorootparentMost of \"make it fast\" in modern software is fundamentally architectural in nature. If your architecture is not designed for performance or efficiency then no amount of module swapping will make it fast in any kind of absolute sense. And swapping architectures is tantamount to a rewrite.Most performance has to be intentionally designed in from the beginning if it matters. reply nwienert 11 hours agorootparentprevMy exact case was something like this: I&#x27;ve made a bunch of style libraries for web (my latest is Tamagui). The one before Tamagui was similar, it had variants and a `styled` helper, but it didn&#x27;t output to \"atomic CSS\". A full year plus into the development of it it was working alright but was quite slow due to all the crazy CSS is was generating and inserting all the time. Atomic CSS really helps this in many ways.So I dove in, technically I felt I could keep the API surface the same. But after about a full month of refactoring it to work with atomic CSS I found many problems. There are just some fundamental limitations to the API design you must enforce to make it work, and without such you really can&#x27;t merge things properly. It&#x27;s hard to explain without writing a mini-book, but needless to say the API surface very much can dictate the performance, and if you stuff your API with a bunch of features before making things fast, you may end up like me having to basically start from scratch.My take: work&#x2F;right&#x2F;fast is a loop you must run many times. They also bleed into each other. Sometimes you do work&#x2F;right and it feels fast, but you haven&#x27;t deployed it at scale, so you never realize it&#x27;s not fast. Keep your API as simple as you can, try and hit the fast part somewhat early before you add many features, and don&#x27;t be afraid to take all your lessons and restart things. If fast is important to your lib, making it right must also be done in tandem with make it fast. reply baxuz 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah, make \"make it work, make it right, make it fast\" is only applicable if you get to throw out most of the work from the first two steps, which is rarely the case. reply hartator 13 hours agoprev> First do itSounds like your codebase will be full of shitty half-backed half-non-needed \"features\" with a lot bugs, legacy, and misdirection.> then do it rightSounds like your codebase will have a lot of hyped, now-dead, trends-of-the-moment frameworks while your team keeps arguing what&#x27;s \"right\".> then do it betterSounds like your codebase will have a lot of rewrite in the new hyped, not-yet-dead, trends-of-the-moment frameworks while actual business logic will be ignored.In my experience, this is the worst advice if we are talking about software engineering.

Even angular is reliable even if not popular.>> then do it better> Sounds like your codebase will have a lot of rewrite in the new hyped, now-yet-dead, trends-of-the-moment frameworks while actual business logic will be ignored.Code should be considered disposable when it has outlived its usefulness.

I would be glad to have founded such a „loser“ reply anyonecancode 6 hours agoprevI think it&#x27;s hard to jump straight to \"do it right\" as step 1, because it&#x27;s often not actually clear what \"right\" means until you actually have running code. Editing is easier than writing. Few essays, books, or software projects can skip having at least a first draft.There are two problems that tend to keep much software in what is essentially the \"draft\" stage, though. One, articulated by many on this thread, is that business incentives really push to \"if it&#x27;s working well enough, it&#x27;s working well enough.\" And as some have noted, that&#x27;s not necessarily a problem! We&#x27;re, most of us, writing software for pay here, not for fun or personal expression. But! As engineers, we have more insight into if it&#x27;s really working \"well enough\" (assuming that we, as engineers, have also taken the time to make sure we understand the product we&#x27;re building). Things like performance, security, and maintainability are part of making sure it&#x27;s \"good enough,\" but our non-technical partners and stakeholders can&#x27;t necessarily see this, and part of our role is to help them see this so that they are making truly informed decisions on if it really is \"good enough.\"Second, and I feel bad saying this, there&#x27;s often a dearth of widespread technical ability to actually take code from \"ok\" to \"good.\" I don&#x27;t mean this in an elitist way of saying some programmers are just better than others -- I do truly believe that with proper support and mentoring almost anyone who wants to become a better programmer can (see my user name). But I think that as an industry, we actually do a poor job helping our colleagues advance and deepen their skill. The ratio of skilled programmers to new is too small, and of skilled programmers with ability and inclination to level up their junior colleagues even smaller.That&#x27;s a decision by business leaders, who by and large have decided that junior-heavy, cheaper dev teams are \"good enough.\" reply lionkor 11 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been fixing \"this is just a prototype\" code for most of my professional life.

Except for the parts where you just copy paste your old shit because everyone forgot how it works reply sanderjd 10 hours agoparentSee, I share your experience of spending most of my time improving things that aren&#x27;t great, but I see it as a good thing. A full two thirds of \"do it, do it right, do it better\" is about making improvements to something that is already working and useful.Sure, there is some inefficiency in re-doing already-working things to improve them, but in my view, less so than in spending more time creating a more perfect thing, but which is often the wrong solution or a solution to the wrong problem altogether.If it were possible to perfectly know that you are creating the definite right solution to the definite right problem, then sure, go nuts! But in the real world this is essentially never the case, so it is better to first \"do it\", then if that \"it\" turns out to be useful, to \"do it right\", and then since that still inevitably won&#x27;t actually be \"right\", to \"do it better\", and then to \"do it better\" again and again, until \"it\" is no longer useful. reply puttycat 12 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;addyosmani&#x2F;status&#x2F;1739052802314539371 reply geemee 14 hours agoprevI have always heard this when talking about approach to solving problems...Once to understand the problem, once to understand the solution, once to do it properly. reply ramijames 9 hours agoprevI just wrote a similar article called \"Iterate relentlessly\" which covers much of the same ground.It&#x27;s here if you&#x27;re interested: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ramijames.com&#x2F;thoughts&#x2F;iterate-relentlessly reply danielovichdk 13 hours agoprevFred Brooks.

The technically correct - and therefore useful - name is ADHD.Because I have lived so much of my life generally unable to \"Just Start Somewhere\", I&#x27;ve given the concept a lot of thought, and a lot of criticism. I can see my bias clearly today, but I&#x27;m still not convinced that my criticisms were ever wrong.--What&#x27;s the value in doing something? Is it the doing, or the something?If the value is in the doing, then there is no value in progress. That&#x27;s obviously untrue.If the value is in the something, then where is the doing to make that something in the first place? Clearly, some doing is necessary, too.I find that the true value of \"doing something\" lies in the connection between the two. Their interdependence creates structure. By doing, we build something into something more. As a result of the expansion of something, we are better equipped for more doing.--But what if something could do itself? To me, this is the ultimate dream of software: the limitless potential of a something that does. The more time I have spent obsessing over this system, the more I have seen the world of software go in the other direction.The problem lies in our goals. What is it that we desire to do? What is the something that will get us there? These are obvious questions with an obvious answer: application. An application is the kind of something that takes us directly to our desires. There&#x27;s one problem with that system: every application must be constructed with the same process of doing. There is just enough of a platform for this to work, so everyone who is comfortable with \"just doing the thing\" can build an application, and be on their merry way.The platform itself was made with this very category of goal in mind. Our foundations are constrained to a single design pattern: applications. This was not always the case.--Once upon a time, we had scripts. Technically, they are still here, but this platform is showing its age. Much like a human&#x27;s ears, there are some features of the script platform that will never stop growing. New languages. New toolchains. New protocols. The more somethings we build onto script, the more unbalanced the overall platform gets. This is the problem that the application platform avoids.But how? There are a few valuable weaknesses that application provides:- Applications are weakly interconnected. If you don&#x27;t need one, you can simply leave it behind. There is no need to cut it out, because it was never built in.- Applications are redundant. An application has all of its doing built-in. This allows its UI&#x2F;UX to be coherent, because it is free to define the doing in its own terms.- Applications are independent. If an application depends on another application, that dependency is explicit, and can be easily managed. Dependencies can be swapped out with minimal work.As valuable as each of these are, a weakness is a weakness. They haven&#x27;t stopped the world of software from reaching incredible goals; but they have been enough to stop me.--Is this the end? Is application the final penultimate platform? I&#x27;m not convinced. I think we can do better. I think we have everything we need to create a new platform. This new platform can contain the strengths of both script and application. I have a mostly-coherent idea in mind: I call it the story empathizer.Now I just need to start building it... reply johnea 13 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve seen it as this:1) The first time, get it done the most expeditious way 2) The second time, do the way you wished you&#x27;d done it the first time 3) The third time, automate it... reply stillbourne 13 hours agoprevThis has been one of my mantras since I started as a software developer. reply dang 13 hours agoprev [–] Url changed from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.cz&#x2F;addyosmani&#x2F;status&#x2F;1739052802314539371, which points to this.It&#x27;s fine to post workaround URLs in the comments, but please don&#x27;t make them top-level links. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Cochrane had 14 guns and 54 men, and he captured a ship with 32 guns and 309 men, taking ~260 of them prisoner. the feat required excellent maneuvering, painting his crew’s faces black and intentionally lowering the frigate’s Spanish flag to convince its crew they were surrendering generally heavily relied on “nobody could possibly be stupid enough to attempt this” tactic to great success in 13 months captured over 50 vessels. got captured once by three French battleships, the French commander refused to take Cochrane’s sword because he had evaded them for so long got screwed out of the bulk of his prize money by bureaucrats with what he got, instead of partying, went to Edinburgh to get a first class education in moral philosophy with his next ship, plundered Spanish ships in the Azores for a while. once captured a ship captained by hard workers and returned some of the loot to them. was heavily weighed down by plunder, got chased by Spanish ships, escaped by launching a barrel with a candle on it at night as a decoy invented a new convoy lamp. the bureaucrats hated him and refused to buy it for the Navy. he entered it under a fake name into the contest for a new lamp and won it became the enemy of all the bureaucrats in the Admiralty who started plotting his downfall decided to get elected. went to a very corrupt district where votes were bought for five guineas. campaigned on principles. lost heavily but paid all those who voted for him ten guineas after the fact. next year campaigned on principles again and won. when people came to him for the ten guineas, said “The former gift was for their disinterested conduct in not taking the bribe of five pounds from the agents of my opponent. For me to pay them now would be a violation of my own previously expressed principles” attacked corruption mercilessly decided to win the war against Napoleon… … with one ship at his disposal captured a fortress, forced a French general to abandon all of his artillery, and delayed him getting to Barcelona by a month. all with one ship in three days single handedly terrorized the French. said “It is wonderful what an amount of terrorism a small frigate is able to inspire on an enemy’s coast” captured the enemy naval codes but left some pages half-burned at the scene, so that the French thought that his brutes had burned them “Lord Cochrane, during the mont of September 1808, with his single ship, kept the whole coast of Languedoc in alarm” didn’t lose a single man during it heard that there is a 6000 man French column marching and decided to take it on landed and occupied a fortress. set up booby traps. explosives and pits, etc. defended the fortress for weeks, threw back attacks by thousands with his crew of a couple hundred sailors walked out of the fortress leisurely under artillery fire to pick up a flag ended up delaying a whole column by weeks, killed hundreds. lost three men was reprimanded by the Admiralty for it, citing “excessive use of powder and shot” got summoned to Whitehall after a disaster - the French navy had escaped the blockade. the only chance to destroy it was with a fire ship attack but nobody would do it. so the powers that be charged Cochrane with doing it. he said ok, but I will also use EXPLOSIVE SHIPS in general, he really liked explosives, and was convinced that most problems in life could be solved with a careful application of the right amount of explosives at a precise point in space and time he also was a handsome devil the account of the battle is worth reading in full but the TL;DR is that Cochrane executed a brilliant plan, beached the entire French navy, but an idiot admiral who was more concerned with his sailors reading psalms than with anything involving naval affairs didn’t send ships to destroy the beached French navy and when Cochrane said, fine, I’ll just do it myself, the admiral instead sent him to England with a message there was a court martial afterwards stacked with friends of the admiral. Cochrane got disgraced and wouldn’t be given command of a ship. account of the battle by Napoleon - “The French admiral was an imbecile but yours was just as bad. I assure you that, if Cochrane had been supported, he would have taken every one of the ships.” not having command of a ship, Cochrane designed a new way of winning the war by using an entirely new way of bombardment and chemical weapons. his proposals were rejected took down a corrupt naval office in Malta that had refused him payment for captured ships. escaped from a local prison in the process got disinherited for marrying a firebrand 16-year-old instead of going into an arranged marriage married her twice more later for good measure got arrested for allegedly running a stock market fraud. was likely innocent but didn’t handle the court case well. all the other defendants (who were guilty) fled the country and he stayed and got sent to jail escaped from prison saying that it was illegal to imprison an MP. showed up to Parliament and had to be carried out back to prison got recruited by the Chileans to lead their navy in their war of independence casually plotted to rescue Napoleon from the island of Saint Helena and let him build an empire in South America to rival the USA captured the biggest Spanish naval fort in the Pacific with just a brig and a schooner. “Cool calculation would make it appear that the attempt to take Valdivia is madness. This is one reason why the Spaniards will hardly believe us in earnest, even when we commence. And you will see that a bold onset, and a little perseverance afterwards will give us complete triumph.” at a cost of 26 casualties capturing, amongst other things, 128 pieces of artillery and a ship actually sent a ship to get Napoleon, but was too late, Napoleon’s health had declined too much got frustrated with San Martin because the latter was being too cautious in liberating Peru. said “fine, I’ll just do it my gd self” and stole the Spanish flagship Esmeralda from Lima’s harbor, right under the nose of 300 guns and the entire Spanish navy in the region. lost just 11 men. the operation took fifteen to seventeen minutes blockaded Lima until the Spanish gave up and surrendered got really disappointed with San Martin when SM became a dictator of Peru instead of liberating it. SM refused to pay Cochrane’s men. Cochrane captured SM’s personal loot ship to pay his men, taking nothing for himself left Chile not being paid for his work at all. remarked that Chilean independence had cost him personally 19,000 pounds took command of the Brazilian navy in their war of independence basically had one functioning ship did a recon mission sailing through the main Portuguese harbor at night between all their ships that demoralized the Portuguese so much that they decided to evacuate the evacuation convoy was thirteen warships and 60-70 transports and Cochrane picked them off one by one with his one ship captured like half the Portuguese army then he sailed to their destination port, talked the commander into surrendering, and then leveraged that into convincing the rest of the armada to surrender basically captured the Portuguese navy in the region with one ship when the infighting between the Brazilians became too much, Cochrane took a ship and sailed to England took command of the Greek navy in their war for independence from the Ottomans united the Greek factions by saying “unless you unite, I’m out” made a fortune buying Greek bonds when nobody thought Greece could win returned to England a conquering hero, fought for personal justice, became an Admiral etc oh that reminds me, once when the British government wanted to arrest a radical MP, Cochrane showed up with gunpowder and mined his house to prevent that, freaking everyone out these are just some of the anecdotes about Cochrane. he was a rogue, a performer, a leader of men, and a man of uncompromising principle. but if there is one lesson to learn from him, it’s that applying explosives wisely can solve most problems. if there’s a second lesson to learn, it’s that “a brilliant plan that is too dumb for anyone to reasonably attempt because of the odds against them may well succeed because nobody expects brilliant people to do such stupid hopeless things” (all of the above is sourced from Cochrane: Britannia’s Sea Wolf by Donald Thomas) Subscribe to How the Hell By Sergey Alexashenko · Launched 3 years ago All I say is by way of discourse, and nothing by way of advice.

For me to pay them now would be a violation of my own previously expressed principles”Prior to the Reform Act 1832[1], each town with a Royal Charter had the right to elect two burgesses to the House of Commons. There were numerous &#x27;rotten boroughs&#x27;, such as Old Sarum, whose two burgesses were chosen by just seven electors, the rest of the population having moved downhill to Salisbury in the thirteenth century, or Dunwich, once one of the most important towns in England, but now washed away into the North Sea. Elections were not secret, and in rotten boroughs, electors could be bribed individually. Manchester, a bustling settlement of one million inhabitants by the time of the Act, on the other hand, was not chartered, and consequently had no burgesses in the Commons at all.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Scottish_Enlightenment[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reform_Act_1832 reply jimz 10 hours agoparentI would like to be pedantic and mention that instead of outright bribery as we know today, the sort of coercion (in the broadest sense of the word) that enabled the rotten boroughs involved some far more innovative and long-term thinking like ensuring that the demographics of boroughs in question, if anyone still lived there, to essentially to owe their ability to live and by extension, ply their trades and all that. You are effectively voting so you can have a place to live, in many cases. Old Sarum is the classical case and almost certainly the most egregious one in a prima facie manner but thanks to the manifold of coercive measures implemented it took until the implementation of secret ballots to truly ensure that the old rotten boroughs age was finally no longer a serious concern, and that took another... 40 years? (I realize that I&#x27;m focusing on the descriptor on pocket boroughs specifically, which is a subset of the broader rotten boroughs phenomenon, but the subset&#x27;s primary differentiation comes from how they were attained and not how their existence determined the makeup of parliament, considering that large landowners were able to have \"in their pocket\" the votes of multiple constituencies that they could exert indirect coercion over quite readily). Yes, it&#x27;s amazing looking back that one did not follow the other somehow, but baby steps man, baby steps. It beats no steps at all when there&#x27;s not really a better alternative on the table, even if it&#x27;s a long way from ideal. reply 082349872349872 14 hours agoparentprevand for follow-on history to the Reform Act of 1832:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833#:~:... reply cf1241290841 4 hours agorootparentYour link seems to go to the article itself. What function did you try to use?Did you try to reference this paragraph?>Up until then, sugar planters from rich British islands such as the Colony of Jamaica and Barbados were able to buy rotten and pocket boroughs, and they were able to form a body of resistance to moves to abolish slavery itself. This West India Lobby, which later evolved into the West India Committee, purchased enough seats to be able to resist the overtures of abolitionists. However, the Reform Act 1832 swept away their rotten borough seats, clearing the way for a majority of members of the House of Commons to push through a law to abolish slavery itself throughout the British Empire.[21] reply lelandfe 3 hours agorootparentNo FF support yet: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;Text_fragments reply 082349872349872 1 hour agorootparentSorry, hadn&#x27;t realised those were bleeding edge :( replybenrules2 15 hours agoprevHe&#x27;s my ancestor!

Most of the fighting of course did not happen on the seas, but just as air superiority matters a great deal, naval superiority in the 1820s mattered as well, and the upper hand he gave to the expedition from Chile&#x2F;Argentina made it a war that was effectively centered on the land war aspect and led to in part and a few years down the line, Peru&#x27;s independence from Spain as well.Somewhat ironically, the Irish diaspora (the Flight of the Wild Geese, which happened in 1691 and scattered the Irish Catholic military aristoracy across Catholic Europe and their descendants, just Europe in general, likely had a larger cumulative role in effectuating much of the independence movements. After all, O&#x27;Higgins is not exactly a native Spanish surname. Informally the scions of Irish Catholic families of importance, with their paths of advancing in Britain blocked, filtered out across the continent for the next hundred years or so and ended up having certainly an outsized influence on the makeup of military administration and colonial administration by way of the makeup of the officer corps of the nations where they ended up settling, stretching from Spain to France to Austria to Russia. They were not exactly mercenaries but really a true diaspora before the concept really solidified in today&#x27;s terms. One can argue that it was certainly an early and self-inflicted &#x27;brain-drain&#x27; through policies instituted by the post-Williamite British state that may have had longer term consequences (the loss of Minorca and the loss of America came in fairly rapid succession, for example) to the British and the distinct and separate traditions allowing them to be less attached to a sovereign but a cause. Much more on this needs studying, but what is certain is that policies made out of fear undermined the British and aided continental powers for generations. Look at the names etched on the Arc de Triomphe and you&#x27;ll notice how many of the names are distinctly not French, including that of Dillion (Arthur Dillion, related to the Viscount Dillion, who also fought for the American side during the revolution), Clarke (whose father served in the Dillion Regiment), MacDonald (whose ties to Flora Macdonald during the Jacobite Rising precipitated his family&#x27;s exile, but nevertheless served as officers first under Dillon before later siding with Napoleon and taking independent command, primarily in Switzerland) are just some of the prominent names inscribed.

Less naval terminology, sharper characterization. reply dghlsakjg 15 hours agorootparentI don’t think that’s fair at all. My advice to people struggling with the naval stuff in Master and Commander is to keep reading. The important stuff gets explained in plain language to the perpetually lubberly Maturin, presumably for the benefit of the reader.Aubrey and Maturin are two of my favorite characters in all of literature. The depth of their motivations, their relationship, and their own personal wants are at the heart of the series. The best parts of the entire series are frequently their adventures on land rather than the purely naval parts. reply weard_beard 12 hours agorootparentThe hornblower books are for folks getting bored on their 3rd or 4th read through of the Aubrey&#x2F;Maturin series :-) reply AlbertCory 16 hours agorootparentprevI like the naval terminology, even though I don&#x27;t understand most of it.Not having read the Hornblower books since adolescence, I can&#x27;t compare them, but on \"characterization\" : sorry, bro. O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s the master of it. Two very good actors took on Jack and Steven (Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany) and made a classic movie. reply jhbadger 15 hours agorootparentUnfortunately the movie oversimplified the characters. Jack in the books is a complex guy, who has besides his good traits some unpleasant parts (his obsession with making money with get rich quick schemes on land which often land him in debt, and his obsession with taking \"prizes\" at sea for personal gain more than duty). Crowe&#x27;s Jack is just a generic hero. And Stephen is a complex guy too, who is an intelligence agent in addition to being a doctor and naturalist. Bettany&#x27;s Stephen ignores this whole part of his character. reply AlbertCory 15 hours agorootparentOk. But you&#x27;re criticizing the movie, not the books. reply marcpaq 16 hours agorootparentprevO&#x27;Brian & Forester wrote fun adventures in the golden age of sailing.You can look a little further still to check out Dudley Pope&#x27;s Ramage series. reply legitster 15 hours agorootparentprevI absolutely adore the Hornblower books. Almost anything by CS Forester, really.Patrick O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s books are too dry for me. There&#x27;s lots of characters stopping and explaining naval terminology to each other, or long conversations about feelings and posturing and etc.In comparison, Forester writing really captures the adventure and gives you the spirit of the era in much less verbose but sharper prose. reply hyperbovine 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s dry in the sense the same sense Jane Austen&#x27;s fiction is dry: it spends a lot of time chronicling the everyday minutiae of a bygone era. But whereas Austen was writing about her contemporaries, O&#x27;Brian does so at a remove of two centuries. As a literary and research achievement it&#x27;s just .. stunning. I re-read this series at least once every decade, and each time my awe over what he has managed to accomplish in these books somehow increases. There is an old NYT book review (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1991&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;books&#x2F;an-author-i-d-walk-...) that expresses it better than I can. reply hyperbovine 11 hours agorootparentprevMy suggestion would be to try the audiobooks instead (the ones narrated by Patrick Tull). reply jhbadger 8 hours agorootparentYes, those are fun. My idea of what Jack and Stephen sound like in my mind is based on the voices Tull does for them.

    "originBody": "Japan Goes All In: Copyright Doesn’t Apply To AI Training Posted by Ingrid RiehlJun 21, 2023! Homepage Slider, ! Recent Country News, Artificial Intelligence, BIG DATA, Breaking News, Compliance, Insights, Japan, Machine Learning, Regulatory, Regulatory Framework, Transparency0In a surprising move, Japan’s government recently reaffirmed that it will not enforce copyrights on data used in AI training. The policy allows AI to use any data “regardless of whether it is for non-profit or commercial purposes, whether it is an act other than reproduction, or whether it is content obtained from illegal sites or otherwise.” Keiko Nagaoka, Japanese Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, confirmed the bold stance to local meeting, saying that Japan’s laws won’t protect copyrighted materials used in AI datasets. Japan, AI, and Copyright English language coverage of the situation is sparse. It seems the Japanese government believes copyright worries, particularly those linked to anime and other visual media, have held back the nation’s progress in AI technology. In response, Japan is going all-in, opting for a no-copyright approach to remain competitive. This news is part of Japan’s ambitious plan to become a leader in AI technology. Rapidus, a local tech firm known for its advanced 2nm chip technology, is stepping into the spotlight as a serious contender in the world of AI chips. With Taiwan’s political situation looking unstable, Japanese chip manufacturing could be a safer bet. Japan is also stepping up to help shape the global rules for AI systems within the G-7. Artists vs. Business (Artists Lost) Not everyone in Japan is on board with this decision. Many anime and graphic art creators are concerned that AI could lower the value of their work. But in contrast, the academic and business sectors are pressing the government to use the nation’s relaxed data laws to propel Japan to global AI dominance. Despite having the world’s third-largest economy, Japan’s economic growth has been sluggish since the 1990s. Japan has the lowest per-capita income in the G-7. With the effective implementation of AI, it could potentially boost the nation’s GDP by 50% or more in a short time. For Japan, which has been experiencing years of low growth, this is an exciting prospect. It’s All About The Data Western data access is also key to Japan’s AI ambitions. The more high-quality training data available, the better the AI model. While Japan boasts a long-standing literary tradition, the amount of Japanese language training data is significantly less than the English language resources available in the West. However, Japan is home to a wealth of anime content, which is popular globally. It seems Japan’s stance is clear – if the West uses Japanese culture for AI training, Western literary resources should also be available for Japanese AI. What This Means For The World On a global scale, Japan’s move adds a twist to the regulation debate. Current discussions have focused on a “rogue nation” scenario where a less developed country might disregard a global framework to gain an advantage. But with Japan, we see a different dynamic. The world’s third-largest economy is saying it won’t hinder AI research and development. Plus, it’s prepared to leverage this new technology to compete directly with the West.

Even \"just\" OpenAI has a valuation large enough to just buy several major publishers and data brokers to secure access to data if they need to license.And while I expect NYT imagines that their archive is really valuable for training, they&#x27;re just not that special in the sense that while they may have broken more stories on average than many others, and have had influential op eds etc., the ones that matters will have been cited and referenced and written about elsewhere - the irony is that by virtue of being so well known, their historically most important content is also less unique in terms of the accessibility of the information in it.So while I&#x27;m sure OpenAI would love their archives, I&#x27;m also sure that if OpenAI and others have to license content and NYT end up being \"difficult\", OpenAI will just license content from (or buy) a suitably diverse portfolio of other papers instead.In other words, beyond producing outright synthetic data, if AI companies are prevented from training on data they don&#x27;t have a license to, the net effect will just be a scramble to buy licenses and&#x2F;or buy companies that can provide sources of content, and the price for that content will be a lot lower than some of the people pursuing these copyright claims imagine.In the end, if we go that route, all we&#x27;ll have achieved as a society is creating massive moats protecting the companies already big enough to buy access to a broad enough set of content and made open models harder. reply miki123211 15 hours agorootparentThis will also enable new and unique business models for social network.

If LLMs were just learning from their training set and generating novel output, the same way a human might, then there&#x27;d be no problem.The issue is that generative AI - both for images as well as text - in effect memorize sources as well as learn from from, and can end up regenerating training sources verbatim (or with minimal changes in case of images).I don&#x27;t think any US court is going to accept \"yes your honor, we copied this copyright material, but we used a TOOL to do it\" as a way to avoid copyright. reply night-rider 17 hours agoparentprevGenerative AI tweaks the original material such that it&#x27;s modified beyond recognition, and non verbatim.

The way LLMs work makes it quite likely that once it has started copying a training sample it will continue to do so (after copying&#x2F;generating N consecutive words of a training sample, the most statistically likely next word will be often be the N+1th word of that same sample).The same thing happens for images - the more an output looks like an input, the more likely (as diffusion-based generation proceeds) it is to look more like it. There are recent examples of Dune posters being recreated essentially as-is. reply Xelynega 17 hours agorootparentprevAn alternative viewpoint:Generative AI algorithmically processes the inputs such that they can be roughly recreated after decoding.

Is that still fair use? This is the crux of NYT&#x27;s lawsuit, and making laws about AI training isn&#x27;t going to make a difference to that. reply lesuorac 17 hours agoparent> This is what the crux of NYT&#x27;s lawsuit is about, and making laws about AI training isn&#x27;t going to make a difference to that.The claims of NYT are more than just about training. They&#x27;re claiming that as part of the ChatGPT software; it _looks up_ stuff in a database of articles. That is beyond _training_.If a human kept around a briefcase of NYT articles they didn&#x27;t pay for and let you view them for a fee I think everybody would agree that&#x27;s copyright infringement.The focus on \"whats the difference between an AI and a Human learning\" is a great slight of hand to bypass the obvious copyright infringement OpenAI is doing. reply jsmith45 17 hours agorootparent> If a human kept around a briefcase of NYT articles they didn&#x27;t pay for and let you view them for a fee I think everybody would agree that&#x27;s copyright infringement.Sure. Slightly more interesting is if that same human with those same breifcases was taking money to answer questions and referenced those papers, but did not just provide the article or headlines, and might not even be paraphrasing the article at all. Is that okay?To the extent it is merely paraphrasing articles, or outputting headlines that it just looked up, I agree that could well be infringement. If it more transformative processes those articles into something distinct, then it is not nearly as clear cut. The latter is arguably the intent of openAI, even if the current results might be closer top the former. reply __e 17 hours agorootparentWhile LLMs are designed to generalize from their training data, rather than simply memorizing it, overfitting occurs in niche areas. There&#x27;s be plenty of niche areas and LLMs of today merely repeat training data, like with the NYT case. Larger datasets and better algorithms will help to an extent, but you&#x27;ll always have niche topics where overfitting happens. The intent has always been to generalize well, however, it may not be feasible to do so in the long tail of the internet. How should copyright law address this? reply chii 7 hours agorootparentprev> the obvious copyright infringement OpenAI is doing.I don&#x27;t see how it is obvious, nor how it is infringement.How come this doesn&#x27;t apply to the person who memorized the NYT article, and recited it verbatim?It&#x27;s obviously infringement for the person who pressed the \"generate\" button to produce the article. That&#x27;s no different from someone who copied a picture using photoshop. However, photoshop itself (and the making of it) does not constitute any infringement whatsoever, as long as at the time of making the application, the sources used are not infringing (which, i presume openAI had the right to view the articles at the time of training).The crux, to me, is that the information extracted and produced (aka, the neural weights) do not itself constitute any infringement. Using those weights to generate copyrighted stuff is an infringement, but only for the person _doing_ the generation, not on the authors of the weights. reply Turing_Machine 17 hours agorootparentprev> it _looks up_ stuff in a database of articles.That is clearly not the case. There isn&#x27;t anything like enough storage space in typical LLMs to maintain a \"database\" of all the training data.If an article can be reproduced from an extremely sparse representation using a stochastic algorithm, that seems to me to be prima facie evidence that the article didn&#x27;t contain much (or possibly, any) significant creative content to begin with.Certainly I would expect to find less creativity in an allegedly factual news article than in a piece of acknowledged fiction.Only creative works are copyrightable in the United States.There are soi-disant \"artists\" who produce \"artworks\" that are (e.g.) nothing but a pure white rectangle. That doesn&#x27;t makeany kind of copyright infringement. reply l33tman 17 hours agorootparentprevSounds similar to the lawsuits against Google by the newspapers of the world for them providing excerpts of their articles on the search result page or so.So essentially you can ask chatgpt to fetch and summarize a paywalled article, because openai has subscribed their crawler? reply nicklecompte 17 hours agorootparentI believe it really only works with GPT-4 directly, because OpenAI&#x27;s prompting to make ChatGPT a chatbot ruins the effect.Specifically the NYT put in the first sentence of the article and asked GPT-4 to autocomplete it, which it did with >95% accuracy. It&#x27;s really quite stark: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;jason_kint&#x2F;status&#x2F;1740146134767865895#mThe issue isn&#x27;t that GPT-4 users can read NYT stories without paying for a subscription, though that is a legitimate concern. The issue is that for good-faith use cases - e.g. asking to write a summary about a recent current event - GPT-4 could very well copy an entire paragraph from NYT verbatim, without the user having any way of knowing. It&#x27;s a serious problem. reply graeme 17 hours agorootparentprevWhich lawsuits? Newspapers are free to remove themselves from google at any time.You might be thinking of newspapers’ political campaigns such as C-18 in Canada, which were done in bad faith.

Here&#x27;s what I get: \"Sorry, but I can&#x27;t provide verbatim excerpts from copyrighted texts. How about I provide a summary or some information about the article instead?\"Did ChatGPT change this after the lawsuit was filed? Probably.

No. reply paxys 17 hours agorootparentprev> Show me how I can get ChatGPT to show me the full text of a NYT article.There are like 40 pages of examples in NYT&#x27;s lawsuit showing exactly that. reply mdorazio 15 hours agorootparentTry any of those examples yourself and show me what you get.

Maybe it’s time for legislation forcing LLMs to be deterministic so that answers can be reproduced in cases like this. Though that wouldn’t help because ChatGPT constantly changes and there is no way to access older versions. replyredcobra762 17 hours agoparentprevI’ve come around somewhat on this, at least insofar as I do believe it’s a novel legal question that I genuinely don’t see a clean way through.If AI training maximally wins, it could substantially erode the value of IP to the degree of threatening the business models of some very important societal pillars like news media. reply JKCalhoun 17 hours agoparentprev> nearly no modificationHow much modification is enough modification?

It would be entirely legitimate to legally privilege human learning without allowing that privilege to transfer (by analogy) to machine learning.There are a lot of people who want use analogy to force the transfer of that privilege because 1) they judge they can profit handsomely and&#x2F;or 2) they&#x27;re technology enthusiasts who&#x27;ve read too much sci-fi. reply jncfhnb 17 hours agorootparentprevThey do have to be the same because learning is not something you can constrain with law pragmatically. Style and structure is not protected and can be mimicked so it is trivial to do parallel construction for any stylistic ideal even if the law says you can’t train on the original. Society does not benefit from these extra steps.Specific IP like characters are already perfectly well protected by copyright. It does not infringe on anything to learn about Batman.Just “training for the heck of it” without any justification for limits besides hurting the artists feelings who put their art in public kinda sucks for them but the alternative is just saying that only but doing otherwise is just asking for only large corporations to be able to train.

I could easily see a rule where you can train a model, but it&#x27;s still on you to make sure that you don&#x27;t use output from it that is too close to a copyright work.This to me seems like the right approach, and is not much different from what humans do.

But to answer your question, in the case of github copilot it does the checking for you, so no you don&#x27;t need a list of all the sources.Regarding you wanting to opt-out of training, that&#x27;s fine you can already do that for many large models. But likely doing that will become the equivalent of putting your works in a safe where no one but you will ever end up reading them or finding them.Banning all AI training is the equivalent to banning search with any modern search engine.edit: Also, note that you are already on the hook for not infringing patents, which if you were to try to do \"perfectly\" like you imply with copyright, then you need to search&#x2F;read&#x2F;understand the entire body of published patents. A task that is clearly not possible.

A USB stick with a copy of a movie on it, an LLM trained on a book, and a human that has watched a Disney film can all actually infringe copyright.There&#x27;s an issue beyond copyright, though. A lot of companies seem to think it&#x27;s okay to train LLMs on data that they at least have no moral rights to and possibly have no legal rights to either. (A TOS saying that anyone posting anything privately, IMO, does not mean that the person posting it had rights to it, nor do I believe that fine print ought to give anyone rights to anyone else&#x27;s private information.) And a person that read all your email and an LLM that has been trained on all your email can both easily infringe your rights to privacy. reply ziddoap 18 hours agoparentprevA pencil can be used to recreate copyrighted works.

You don&#x27;t need an LLM to copy and paste a Disney character and post it on a million websites. An LLM returning an output isn&#x27;t the same as publishing something. It&#x27;s not being redistributed by virtue of just being output by the LLM. reply cwillu 18 hours agorootparentprevSpeed and scale also makes the printing press completely different than the pencil, but the principle that the user is responsible for the output remains practical. reply ben_w 17 hours agorootparentThe printing press also indirectly triggered the Reformation, and through that the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the Eighty Years&#x27; War, and through all those together the invention of the concept of Westphalian sovereignty. And in the UK the \"Licensing of the Press Act 1662\" (full title \"An Act for preventing the frequent Abuses in printing seditious treasonable and unlicensed Bookes and Pamphlets and for regulating of Printing and Printing Presses\" so guess what they cared about here).While the ideals of freedom these brought may be desirable, we may want to avoid repeating the bloodshed from this particular bit of history. And that goes double for anyone in government who takes personal exception to being treated like French royalty. reply ziddoap 17 hours agorootparentprevMy opinion is that people should just state that conclusion rather than make these silly comparisons. reply exe34 17 hours agorootparentNot everybody thinks in the same way. Some, maybe most people benefit from intuition pumps such as analogies. Good analogies clarify the point, poor ones obscure it. reply ziddoap 17 hours agorootparent>Good analogies clarify the point, poor ones obscure it.I definitely agree with this, but I think a \"good analogy\" is really rare.In this case, I think that the analogy just obscures the main point about copyright. I think the original comment would have been stronger by omitting the analogy and just discussing where the legal responsibility falls.In almost every case an analogy is made, people discuss the validity of the analogy over the actual point of the comment (I&#x27;m guilty here too! my comment ended up being about the analogy rather than the main point). reply Workaccount2 17 hours agorootparentprevCripple the future so we don&#x27;t have to leave the ways of the past... reply agilob 17 hours agorootparentprevSo if I use 500 pages&#x2F;minute scanner it will be fine? reply ziddoap 17 hours agorootparentMy comment doesn&#x27;t say what my opinion on the topic is, just that pencils and LLMs are hardly comparable due to difference in speed and scale. reply CamperBob2 17 hours agorootparentCongratulations, by attaching qualitative legal importance to scale, speed, and size, you just successfully argued that the First Amendment doesn&#x27;t apply on the Internet.You&#x27;ll make friends on both sides of the political aisle with that position, but it&#x27;s a shame to see it so readily accepted around here.(Can&#x27;t reply due to HN&#x27;s rate limiting algorithm that penalizes me after four or five posts while allowing the most-corrosive trolls imaginable to party all day, so I edited to clarify.) reply ziddoap 17 hours agorootparentCongratulations, you just successfully argued that the First Amendment doesn&#x27;t apply on the Internet.What? reply CamperBob2 18 hours agorootparentprevYou will still eventually run into absurd contradictions whenever you blame a tool for the actions of its user. Subjective factors like \"scale and speed\" should have no place in the law, even though they often do.Never mind that every regulation that constrains AI development in the West is a giftwrapped blessing to China and other actors that DGAF about copyright law. reply JoeAltmaier 18 hours agoparentprevWhat&#x27;s the difference between picking a cherry tomato from your streetside garden and eating it, and driving a combine harvester over your lawn and taking everything? reply ryandrake 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not a lawmaker, but it&#x27;s probably pretty hard to write a law that effectively distinguishes between \"doing X\" and \"doing X at scale\". As another commenter mentions, if you target the means of doing it (human doing X vs. machine doing X), someone will just use Mechanical Turk or something to hire 10,000 humans to do X.If telling AI to study Spiderman and then output 10 pictures of Spiderman is illegal, how is that different from hiring 10,000 artists to study Spiderman, having them each do a drawing, and then hiring 100 talent judges to pick the top 10? reply ben_w 17 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t the latter already a copyright infringement? So in this case, both should be forbidden?I think the more immediate issue with AI is that it&#x27;s like having access to a close-to-zero cost human who doesn&#x27;t care whether or not they&#x27;re creating content which, if a human did it, would be considered a copyright infringement. And that they care so little about copyright (and other data rights) that they&#x27;re basically incapable of even warning you if they are close to an existing character or living person.I don&#x27;t know how this is going to play out, but right now we&#x27;re getting a more polite re-run of the luddites smashing early industrial equipment. I can sympathise with the loss of purpose and economic disenfranchisement, but the economic power in that revolution went to those that did the most automation, and I expect the same to be true this time. reply JoeAltmaier 17 hours agorootparentprevNot at all. We do it all the time. E.g. It&#x27;s legal to consume fruits found in a National Park, as much as a single person can consume. It&#x27;s illegal to harvest and take away anything more than that. reply mdorazio 17 hours agorootparentprevLegally, the scale of the punishment &#x2F; fine, but not the legality of the base act. Also, the latter involves trespassing and probably property damage. reply Spivak 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m usually sympathetic to arguments where scale can change the fundamental nature of the thing but this doesn&#x27;t really track. Because the argument is that LLMs are tools -- you can disagree with that but that&#x27;s the parent&#x27;s position, and those tools can be used to create copyrighted material. The quality, availability, and ease of use of those tools don&#x27;t particularly matter.The difference as far as copyright is concerned if one person has a scanner, camera, or blank cassette tape or everyone has them are the same. reply jncfhnb 17 hours agorootparentprevPathetically incongruent analogy reply JoeAltmaier 17 hours agorootparentExactly, as was the previous one. Catching on to this stuff I see. reply jncfhnb 16 hours agorootparentPiling on to a bad example with a much dumber example is not helpful reply bee_rider 17 hours agoparentprevWhat’s the work? Would you say it ought to be legal to distribute a really good prompt to generate a copyright character? What about an embedding? reply criley2 17 hours agorootparentI would say it ought to be as legal as distributing a \"how to draw mickey mouse\" tutorial or a \"how to sing taylor swift song\" video or perhaps even a \"how to make a twitter clone\" tutorial. reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentIn that case it seems like it would be much easier to just make it legal to distribute the copyright material in the first place. reply criley2 17 hours agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t follow at all? Just because you can create something doesn&#x27;t mean you can distribute it.Just because I drew Mickey Mouse doesn&#x27;t mean I can sell it. Just because I sing Taylor&#x27;s song doesn&#x27;t mean I can upload it to Spotify.Just because GPT can return an image doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m allowed to sell it.Creation and distribution are different, and the reality is that the 90% of consumers will never create, they will consume distribution. reply itishappy 17 hours agoparentprev> A pencil can be used to recreate copyrighted works. Why should a LLM be different?I find this a pretty week argument too. Does an LLM use a pencil? Can an LLM use a pencil? Does a pencil watch anime or read the NYT? Does a pencil create new work when upon request?Are these things really comparable? Are they even related? reply bakugo 17 hours agoparentprevI just tried asking my pencil to draw me a picture of Mario but nothing happened.

Information wants to be free. People can still pay other people for a promise to create more content, or to create custom content. Companies can still have trademarks and patents for a couple of years.

Copyright maximalists are constantly trying to invent new rights that they&#x27;ve never had. If a person is allowed to read training material acquired legally, then so too must their LLM experiment be allowed to read it. The LLM reading it creates no new copies.Moloch didn&#x27;t win here. Everyone else did. We get new technologies, the copyright owners got everything they were promise, just not more. reply gwd 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think the result is as clear either as the \"Moloch\" commenter, nor you, seem to think.I agree that the result is not a \"Moloch trap\": as you say, the new technology actually does de-fang Google Search and empowers many smaller people to be able to do things they would never otherwise have been able to do. The contrary ruling would certainly have been enjoyed by \"copyright maximalists\" like Disney extracting value from the public domain without giving anything back.But there are more people affected than just greedy copyright maximalists. Individual artists who have spent years developing a distinctive style and making it popular are seeing their style copied ad-infinitum for free. Organizations like the NYT that invest money doing investigative journalism are having their results slurped up and regurgitated.To your comment:> If a person is allowed to read training material acquired legally, then so too must their LLM experiment be allowed to read it. The LLM reading it creates no new copies.In the past, each copyrighted work seen might train a single BNN (biological neural network). Only a small percentage of BNNs would actually study such work to learn to emulate it; only a handful would achieve parity or exceed the quality of the work. Each BNN was expensive to employ, would only work for a certain number of hours per day, and a certain number of years before retiring.Now a single ANN (artificial neural network) can study works to emulate them in a month or two. That ANN is far less expensive to employ than a BNN; can be deployed 24&#x2F;7 indefinitely; and can be duplicated to as many GPUs as someone can get their hands on.Currently legally, it may be that an ANN learning from an artist&#x27;s work is the same as a BNN learning from an artist&#x27;s work. But from a practical perspective, from the case of individual artists, it&#x27;s clearly not the same.Now maybe that&#x27;s the inevitable price of progress; but 1) I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the inevitable conclusion, and 2) even if it is, we need to be honest about it. replynuz 18 hours agoprev90s Japan vs the US energy is back. reply rvz 17 hours agoprevIt is not that hard to train on public-domain content only or content that has the permission of the creators.

There is no definition of \"AI\", it has always been a marketing term for monetising csci research. There is no difference between a lossy jpg, taking its pixels as weights, and the weights of a NN.So if i just zip up copyrighted images using a NN, then, what? They&#x27;re public domain?Regulators here are miles away from understanding the implications -- this is what happens when you let companies whose profit motive is selling \"AI\" be the \"Experts\" on the topic.If you don&#x27;t care about Disney, fine -- so what about your health records? This is also the prelude to an end to privacy reply throwawaymaths 18 hours agoparentCompletely crazy take. Your health records are not currently protected by copyright law. If someone magically snapped their fingers and eliminated copyright law, the protections on your health data, scant though they may be, would more or less be the same (IANAL) reply mjburgess 18 hours agorootparentSo to be clear -- you&#x27;re well aware that in the case of your private data that you have an interest in preventing it being used to train AI.Great. So d&#x27;you think you could outline a reason why you wouldnt have an interest in your creative works not being used also?Either the training data is, as big-ad-tech says, essentially equivalent to generic human experiences -- ie., weakly repoducible; OR it is extremely reporducible, and equivalent more to standard contemporary data compression.If you&#x27;re kool-aid&#x27;ing the former on copyright, why not the latter on privacy?> reply Spivak 17 hours agorootparentBecause my private data isn&#x27;t protected by copyright, it&#x27;s protected by things like HIPAA which doesn&#x27;t matter one iota about human experiences and applies equally to humans and machines. It&#x27;s about data sovereignty and who may access my data and for what purpose. A human is not allowed to share, retain, or reproduce my medical data.So arguments like \"I can get the AI to output my chart verbatim\" start carrying weight because it&#x27;s granted access to data that the humans that created the AI are not permitted to share in any form whatsoever where as copyright concerns what I may do with the data after it&#x27;s produced. Copyright is full of exceptions for things that don&#x27;t count as a reproduction or performance of the work and this is just one more, it doesn&#x27;t change the nature of copyright. reply Workaccount2 17 hours agorootparentprevEquivocating health records to art style is a laughable proposition to build an argument on.

This decision feels incredibly half baked. reply knome 17 hours agorootparentThis is explicitly for training, not for the distribution of copyrighted material. Courts aren&#x27;t stupid. reply munk-a 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d clarify that in my example the screening would be of the potentially random output of a model... just one that was only trained by watching a specific blockbuster movie and thus extremely likely to just reproduce the source material. My example is obviously an extreme but it gets at the core of the NYT case here in the states... I think it&#x27;s a bad thing if we allow models to output data nearly indistinguishable from copyrighted data it was trained on.W.r.t to the NYT case - It&#x27;s my opinion that it&#x27;s completely reasonable to use a corpus of vetted english literature like the NYT as a way to train your model to comprehend language - but if the model also begins to echo the contents of those articles then that may be a serious breech of the NYT&#x27;s right&#x27;s to monetize their work. reply johncolanduoni 16 hours agorootparentprevThat will probably go about as well as distributing an encrypted copyrighted work along with its encryption key and then claiming that none of the bits are the same so you did nothing wrong.
