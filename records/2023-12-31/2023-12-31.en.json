    "originBody": "The Art of HPC Textbooks by Victor Eijkhout of TACC Volume 1: The Science of Computing This book has the general background knowledge for scientific computing: computer architecture, parallel computer architecture, computer arithmetic, linear algebra, ODE/PDEs, and how it all comes together in big computations. Paired with Volume 2, this teaches you all about HPC: the what/why here, and the how over there.. Volume 2: Parallel Programming for Science and Engineering Much of scientific computing involves parallel programming of some sort. This book is the ultimate introduction to modern versions of MPI and OpenMP, with shorter sections on PETSc, Kokkos, Sycl, Co-array Fortran. This book is notable for its coverage of MPI and OpenMP in both C, Fortran, C++, and (for MPI) Python. Volume 3: Introduction to Scientific Programming Programming in science and engineering is overwhelmingly done in C/C++ and Fortran. This book teaches you modern C++17 (which is really to be preferred over C these days) and Fortran2008. You can read this as a from-zero introduction to scientific programming, or as a “C++ for C programmers”. There are various longer programming projects. Volume 4: HPC Carpentry The ecosystem of scientific computing involves much more than just a programming language and a parallel programming system: you need to understand about compilers, build systems, source code control, and a lot more. This book does not aim to be a compendium of all of these, but rather a set of introductions, biased to scientific workflows.. About Victor Victor Eijkhout is a research scientist at the .Texas Advanced Computing Center These textbooks came about while teaching various courses at The University of Texas at Austin.

But now and then, we would crash some talks from the datacenter folks.One key relevation for me was that increasing compute power in DCs is primarily a thermodynamics problem than actual computing. The nodes have become so dense that shipping power in and shipping heat out, with all kinds of redundancies is an extremely hard problem. And it&#x27;s not like you can perform a software update if you&#x27;ve discovered some inefficiencies.This was ~10 years ago, so probably some things have changed.What blows me away is that Amazon, starting out as an internet bookstore is at the cutting edge of solving thermodynamics problems. reply projectileboy 11 hours agoparentSeymour Cray used to say this all the way back in the 1970s: his biggest problems were associated with dissipating heat. For the Cray 2 he took an even more dramatic approach: \"The Cray-2&#x27;s unusual cooling scheme immersed dense stacks of circuit boards in a special non-conductive liquid called Fluorinert™\" (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerhistory.org&#x2F;revolution&#x2F;supercomputers&#x2F;10...) reply logtempo 8 hours agorootparentFew days ago I saw an article passing by,about chips hiting the kw floor. reply cogman10 11 hours agoparentprevIt always made me wonder why liquid cooling wasn&#x27;t more of a thing for datacenters.Water has a massive amount of thermal capacity and can quickly and in bulk be cooled to optimal temperatures. You&#x27;d probably still need fans and AC to dissipate heat of non-liquid cooled parts, but for the big energy items like CPUs and GPUs&#x2F;compute engines, you could ship out huge amounts of heat fairly quickly and directly.I guess the complexity and risk of a leak would be a problem, but for amazon sized data centers that doesn&#x27;t seem like a major concern. reply adev_ 10 hours agorootparent> It always made me wonder why liquid cooling wasn&#x27;t more of a thing for datacenters.Liquid cooling is almost a defacto-standard in data centers in the HPC world. The Top of the TOP500 machines are all liquid cooled. Not by choice, but due to physics constraints.There is a big gap in power density between the HPC world and the usual datacenter-commodity-hardware world.Commodity DS are designed with the assumption that the average machine will run with a fraction of it&#x27;s maximum load. HPC systems at the opposite are designed to operate safely at 100% load all the time.In a previous company where I worked, we attempted to install a medium size HPC cluster in a well-known commerical datacenter and network provider. The commercial of the DS almost felt from his chair when we announced the power requirements. reply bayindirh 10 hours agorootparent> we attempted to install a medium size HPC cluster in a well-known commerical Datacenter and network provider. The commercial of the DS almost fall from his chair when we announced the power requirements.Heh. We tried it too. They didn’t believe that a single node used their entire rack’s budget at first. reply mrgaro 8 minutes agorootparentSounds fascinating. Can you give any more details? What kind of nodes are they and how they differ from \"traditional\" DC hardware, say from Supermicro? reply bayindirh 10 hours agorootparentprevBecause it’s complex. Even more complex than “engineered” air.You need two circuits, and a CDU between them. Coolants needs maintaining. You add antifreeze, biocides, etc.Air is brute force. It cools everything it touches. Liquid cooling is serialized in a node. Two sockets? Second will be hotter. HBA not making good contact? It’ll overheat.You add extensive leak detection subsystems, the amount of coolant moving in your primary circuit becomes massive.Currently you can remove 97% of the heat via liquid (including the PSUs), and it’s cheaper to do so than air, but it’s not “rails, screws, cables, power on”. Air cooled systems can be turned on in a week. Liquid cooled ones take a month.However, using liquid is mandatory after some point. You can’t cool systems that dense and under that load with air. They’ll melt. reply magicalhippo 4 hours agorootparent> Liquid cooling is serialized in a node. Two sockets?I&#x27;ve seen tests done on heavy PC loops (ie multi-GPU) both high-flow and low-flow, as well as on car engines, in different coolant flow configurations. The results from all of those are that the water doesn&#x27;t rise meaningfully in temperature between components.Unless I did my back-of-the-napkin math wrong, this seems reasonable. If you have a single 10mm ID pipe going through a 1U server and up to the next, then for a full 42U rack you have about 1.7kg of water going through the servers. If the flow rate is about 1s per server (so 42 seconds for the full rack) and each 1U server dumps 500W of energy into the water, there should be just a 3 degree C difference in the water temperature between the first and the last server. reply bayindirh 3 hours agorootparentIn our system every node gets inlet water at the same temperature via parallel piping, but when it’s in node, it goes through processors first, then RAM, then PCIe and disks. Delta T between two sockets is 5 degrees C, and the delta T between input and output is around 15-18 C depending on load. reply menaerus 1 hour agorootparentFirst, thanks for sharing these details, I find them fascinating because they are not so common to be read or heard about.> Delta T between two sockets is 5 degrees CAnd secondly, ~5-10 degrees is what I see on my dual-socket workstation, and have been wondering about this delta ever since the first day I started monitoring the temperatures. At first, I thought that the heat sink wasn&#x27;t installed properly but after reinstalling it the delta remained. Since I didn&#x27;t notice any CPU throttling or whatsoever I figured it&#x27;s \"normal\" and ignored it. reply bayindirh 1 hour agorootparentHey, no worries. Using one is equally fascinating as much as reading about it. It feels like a space shuttle, so different, yet so enjoyable.I mean, water travels from one socket to another, so one processor adds heat equal to 5 degrees C under nominal load. The second socket doesn’t complain much, but this is enormous amounts of heat transferred in a such quick pace. reply gopher_space 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s this all look like without an atmosphere? reply eutropia 8 hours agorootparentWorse, heat dissipation is a major constraint for spacecraft and satellites because you can only radiate heat away as infrared photons. reply fecal_henge 51 minutes agorootparentYou just need to radiate in the visible spectrum then the problem will be much reduced. reply uticus 5 hours agorootparentprevAmazing considering how much heat travels from Sun (and punches through atmosphere) to Earth surface. Didn’t realize there was that much of an insulation property. reply taneq 7 hours agorootparentprevDoesn’t have to be infrared but yeah, space isn’t “cold” so much as it’s an insulator. reply lub 10 hours agorootparentprevOVH prominently uses water cooling including custom components with their own design.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ovhcloud.com&#x2F;water-cooling-from-innovation-to-d...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ovhcloud.com&#x2F;water-cooling-from-innovation-to-d...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ovhcloud.com&#x2F;new-hybrid-immersion-liquid-coolin... reply victotronics 10 hours agorootparentprevImmersion cooling is getting big. At the last Supercomputing conference I probably saw at least a dozen vendors of immersion cooling equipment. My datacenter has one cluster with liquid cooling caps over the sockets, and two immersed clusters. The latter two have basins of various degrees of sophistication under them for when they do spring a leak. reply cyrillite 8 hours agoparentprevIs there any good data on the scale of this problem or that can be used to visualise it?What is the cutting edge of cooling tech like? reply dist1ll 18 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s very interesting how abtracted away HPC sometimes looks from hardware. The books seem to revolve a lot around SPMD programming, algo & DS, task parallelism, synchronization etc, but very little about computer architecture details like supercomputer memory subsystems, high-bandwidth interconnects like CXL, GPU architecture and so on. Are the abstractions and tooling already good enough that you don&#x27;t need to worry about these details? I&#x27;m also curious if HPC practitioners have to fiddle a lot of black-box knobs to squeeze out performance? reply jandrewrogers 17 hours agoparentFor most HPC, you will not be able to maximize parallelism and throughput without intimate knowledge of the hardware architecture and its behavior. As a general principle, you want the topology of the software to match the topology of the hardware as closely as possible for optimal scaling behavior. Efficient HPC software is strongly influenced by the nature of the hardware.When I wrote code for new HPC hardware, people were always surprised when I asked for the system hardware and architecture docs instead of the programming docs. But if you understood the hardware design, the correct way of designing software for it became obvious from first principles. The programming docs typically contained quite a few half-truths intended to make things seem misleadingly easier for developers than a proper understanding would suggest. In fact, some HPC platforms failed in large part because they consistently misrepresented what was required from developers to achieve maximum performance in order to appear \"easy to use\", and then failing to deliver the performance the silicon was capable of if you actually wrote software the way the marketing implied would be effective.You can write HPC code on top of abstractions, and many people do, but the performance and scaling losses are often unavoidably integer factor. As with most software, this was considered an acceptable loss in many cases if it allowed less capable software devs to design the code. HPC is like any other type of software in that most developers that notionally specialize in it struggle to produce consistently good results. Much of the expensive hardware used in HPC is there to mitigate the performance losses of worse software designs.In HPC there are no shortcuts to actually understanding how the hardware works if you want maximum performance. Which is no different than regular software, in HPC the hardware systems are just bigger and more complex. reply bluedino 15 hours agoparentprevI started in HPC about 2 years ago on a ~500 node cluster at a Fortune 100 company. I was really just looking for a job where I was doing Linux 100% of the time, and it&#x27;s been fun so far.But it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. I guess I expected to be doing more performance oriented work, analyzing numbers and trying to get every last bit of performance out of the cluster. To be honest, they didn&#x27;t even have any kind of monitoring running. I set some up, and it doesn&#x27;t really get used. Once in a while we get questions from management about \"how busy is the cluster\", to justify budgets and that sort of thing.Most of my &#x27;optimization&#x27; work ends up being things like making sure people aren&#x27;t (usually unknowingly) requesting 384 CPUs when their script only uses 16, testing software to see what # of CPU&#x27;s it works with before you see a degradation, etc. I&#x27;ve only had the Intel profiler open twice.And I&#x27;ve found that most of the job is really just helping researchers and such with their work. Typically running either a commercial or open-source program, troubleshooting it, or getting some code written by another team on another cluster and getting it built and running on yours. Slogging through terrible Python code. Trying to get a C++ project built on a more modern cluster in a CentOS 7 environment.It can be fun in a way. I&#x27;ve worked with different languages over the years so I enjoy trying to get things working, digging through crashes and stack traces. And working with such large machines, your sense of normal gets twisted when you&#x27;re on a server with &#x27;only&#x27; 128GB of RAM or 20TB of disk.It&#x27;s a little scary when you know the results of some of this stuff are being used in the real world, and the people running the simulations aren&#x27;t even doing things right. Incorrect code, mixed up source code, not using the data they thing they are, I once found a huge bug that had existed for 3 years. Doesn&#x27;t this invalidate all the work you&#x27;ve done on this subject?The one drawback I find is that a lot of HPC jobs want you do have a masters degree. Even to just run the cluster. Doesn&#x27;t make sense to me, I&#x27;m not writing the software you&#x27;re running, we aren&#x27;t running some state of the art, TOP500 cluster. We&#x27;re just getting a bunch of machines networked together and running some code. reply justin66 13 hours agorootparent> The one drawback I find is that a lot of HPC jobs want you do have a masters degree.Is it possible that pretty much any specialization, outside of the most common ones, engages in a lot of gatekeeping? I remember how difficult it appeared to be after I graduated to break into embedded systems (I never did). I persisted until I realized it doesn&#x27;t even pay very well, comparatively. reply throwawaaarrgh 14 hours agorootparentprevI always found that funny too. A business who needs a powerful computing solution can come up with some amazingly robust stuff, whereas science&#x2F;research just buys a big mainframe and hopes it works. reply s_Hogg 9 hours agorootparentI was working in a company that had been spun out of a university until recently and it was shocking how hopeless the researchers were. I&#x27;ve always been critical of how poor the job security in academia is but you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s still too much given how slapdash some of the crap you see is. We basically had to reinvent their product from the ground up, awful. reply danparsonson 7 hours agorootparentThis is probably a naive question but isn&#x27;t that the point of having developers on staff? The researchers aren&#x27;t coders and vice versa, so having researchers produce prototypes that are productized by engineers makes sense to me. reply rramadass 5 hours agorootparentExactly! This is how it should be.Researchers&#x2F;Scientists with their hard earned PhDs should only concentrate on doing cutting-edge \"researchy\" stuff. It is hard enough that they should not be asked to learn all the intricacies&#x2F;problems inherent in Software Development. That is the domain of a \"Professional Software Engineer\".There is now in fact a new class called \"Research Software Engineer\" who are Software Developers working in Research developing code specific to their needs - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-022-01516-2 and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Research_software_engineering reply m-ee 6 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve had very similar experiences working with former researchers including at a university spinout. Mechanical rather than CS. It was perplexing how they still carried the elitism that industry was mostly for people who can&#x27;t hack it in academia given the quality of their work. Would be unacceptable coming from a new hire PD engineer at Apple yet you&#x27;re demanding respect because you used to lead a whole lab apparently producing rubbish? reply dahart 17 hours agoparentprevThere is a lot of abstraction, but knowing which abstraction to use still takes knowing a lot about the hardware.> I’m also curious if HPC practitioners have to fiddle a lot of black-box knobs to squeeze out performance?In my experience with CUDA developers, yes the Shmoo Plot (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shmoo_plot, sometimes called a ‘wedge’ in some industries) is one of the workhorses of every day optimization. I’m not sure I’d call it black-box, though maybe the net effect is the same. It’s really common to have educated guesses and to know what the knobs do and how they work, and still find big surprises when you measure. The first rule of optimization is measure. I always think of Michael Abrash’s first chapter in the “Black Book”: “The Best Optimizer is Between Your Ears” http:&#x2F;&#x2F;twimgs.com&#x2F;ddj&#x2F;abrashblackbook&#x2F;gpbb1.pdf. This is a fabulous snippet of the philosophy of high performance (even though it’s PC game centric and not about modern HPC.)Related to your point about abstraction, the heaviest knob-tuning should get done at the end of the optimization process, because as soon as you refactor or change anything, you have to do the knob tuning again. A minor change in register spills or cache access patterns can completely reset any fine-tuning of thread configuration or cache or shared memory size, etc.. Despite this, some healthy amount of knob tuning is still done along the way to check & balance & get an intuitive sense of the local perf space of the code. (Just noticed Abrash talks a little about why this is a good idea.) reply squidgyhead 13 hours agorootparentCould you explain how you use a shmoo plot for optimization? Do you just have a performance metric at each point in parameter space? reply dahart 10 hours agorootparentThe shmoo plot is just the name for measuring something (such as perf) over a range of parameter space. The simplest and most straightforward application is to pick a parameter or two that you don’t know what value they should be using, do the shmoo over the range of parameter space, and then set the knobs at whatever values give you the optimal measurement.Usually though, you have to iterate. Doing shmoos along the way can help with understanding the effects of code changes, help understand how the hardware works, and it can sometimes help identify what code changes you might need to make. A simple abstract example might be I know what my theoretical peak bandwidth is, but my program only gets 30% of peak. I suspect it has to do with how many registers are used, and I have a knob to control it, so I turn the knob and plot all possible register settings, and find out that I can get 45% of peak with a different value. Now I know it was partially registers I was limited by, but I also know to look for something else too. Then I profile, examine the code, maybe refactor or adjust some things, hypothesize, test, and then shmoo again on a different knob or two if I suspect something else is the bottleneck. reply atrettel 18 hours agoparentprevYes and no.MPI and OpenMP are the primary abstractions from the hardware in HPC, with MPI being an abstracted form of distributed-memory parallel computing and OpenMP being an abstracted form of shared-memory parallel computing. Many researchers write their codes purely using those, often both in the same code. When using those, you really do not need to worry about the architectural details most of the time.Still, some researchers who like to further optimize things do in fact fiddle with a lot of small architectural details to increase performance further. For example, loop unrolling is pretty common and can get quite confusing in my opinion. I vaguely recall some stuff about trying to vectorize operations by preferring addition over multiplication due to the particular CPU architecture, but I do not think I&#x27;ve seen that in practice.Preventing cache misses is another major one, where some codes are written so that the most needed information is stored in the CPU&#x27;s cache rather than memory. Most codes only handle this by ensuring column-major order loops for array operations in Fortran or row-major order loops in C, but the concept can be extended further. If you know the cache size for your processors, you could hypothetically optimize some operations to keep all of the needed information inside the cache to minimize cache misses. I&#x27;ve never seen this in practice but it was actively discussed in the scientific computing course I took in 2013.The use of particular GPUs depends heavily on the problem being solved, with some being great on GPUs and others being too difficult. I&#x27;m not too knowledgeable about that, unfortunately. reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentOf course, not every problem can be solved by BLAS, but if you are doing linear algebra, the cache stuff should be mostly handled by BLAS.I’m not sure how much multiplication vs addition matters on a modern chip. You can have a bazillion instructions in flight after all, as long as they don’t have any dependencies, so I’d go with whichever option shortens the data dependencies on the critical path. The computer will figure out where to park longer instruction if it needs to. reply atrettel 17 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right that the addition vs. multiplication issue likely does not matter on a modern chip. I just gave the example because it shows how the CPU architecture can affect how you write the code. I do not recall precisely when or where I heard the idea, but it was about a decade ago --- ages ago by computing standards. reply bayindirh 12 hours agoparentprevHPC admin here, generally serving \"long tail of science\" researchers.In today&#x27;s x86_64 hardware, there&#x27;s no \"supercomputer memory subsystem\". It&#x27;s just a glorified NUMA system, and the biggest problem is putting the memory close to your core, i.e. keeping data local in your NUMA node to reduce latencies.Your resource mapping is handled by your scheduler. It knows your hardware, hence it creates a cgroup which satisfies your needs and as optimized as possible, and stuffs your application into that cgroup and runs it.Currently king of high performance interconnects is Infiniband, and it accelerates MPI at the fabric level. You can send messages, broadcasts and reduce results like there&#x27;s no tomorrow. Because when the message arrives you, it&#x27;s already reduced. When you broadcast, you only send a single message which is broadcasted at fabric layer. Multiple Context IB cards have many queues and more than one MPI job can run on the same node&#x2F;card with queue&#x2F;context isolation.If you&#x27;re using a framework for GPU work, the architecture & optimization is done at that level automatically (the framework developers do the hard work generally). NVIDIA&#x27;s drivers are pure black magic, too. They handle some parts of the optimization, too. InterGPU connection is handled by a physical fabric, managed by drivers and its own daemon.If you&#x27;re CPU bound, your libraries are generally hand tuned by its vendor (Intel MKL, BLAS, Eigen, etc.). I personally used Eigen, and it has processor specific hints and optimizations baked in.The things you have to worry is to compile your code for the correct architecture, make sure that the hardware you run on can satisfy your demands (i.e.: do not make too many random memory accesses, keep the prefetcher and branch predictor happy if you&#x27;re trying to go \"all-out fast\" on the node, do not abuse disk access, etc.).On the number crunching side, keeping things independent (so they can be instruction level parallelized&#x2F;vectorized), making sure you&#x27;re not doing unnecessary calculations, and not abusing MPI (reducing inter-node talk to only necessary chatter) is the key.It&#x27;s way easier said than done, but when you get the hang of it, it becomes like a second nature to think about these things, if these kinds of things are your cup of tea. reply dist1ll 9 hours agorootparentThanks for the thoughtful comment, pretty fascinating stuff.> In today&#x27;s x86_64 hardware, there&#x27;s no \"supercomputer memory subsystem\". It&#x27;s just a glorified NUMA system, and the biggest problem is putting the memory close to your core, i.e. keeping data local in your NUMA node to reduce latencies.I mean, memory topology varies greatly by uarch (doubly so between vendors). I can&#x27;t take a routine tuned to Nehalem, run it on Haswell or Skylake and expect it to stay competitive. More generally, different hardware has different bandwidth and latency ratios, which affects software design (e.g. software written for commodity Dell w&#x2F; PCIe cards probably won&#x27;t translate to Cray accelerator grid connected by HPE slingshot). And then there&#x27;s hardware-specific features like RNICs bypassing DRAM and writing RDMA messages directly into the receiver&#x27;s cache. So I think that ccNUMA and data locality is not sufficient to reason about memory perf. reply efxhoy 11 hours agoparentprevI wrote scientific simulation software in academia for a few years. None of us writing the software had any formal software engineering training above what we’d pieced together ourselves from statistics courses. We wrote our simulations to run independently on many nodes and aggregated the results at the end, no use of any HPC features other than “run these 100 scripts on a node each please, thank you slurm”. That approach worked very well for our problem.I’d bet a significant part of compute work on HPC clusters in academia works the same way. The only thing we paid attention to was number of cores on the node and preferring node local storage over the shared volumes for caching. No MPI.There are of course problems requiring “genuine” HPC clusters but ours could have run on any pile of workers with a job queue. reply eslaught 18 hours agoparentprevNo, the abstractions are not sufficient. We do care about these details, a lot.Of course, not every application is optimized to the hilt. But if you want to so optimize an application, exactly things you&#x27;re talking about are what come into play.So yes, I would expect every competent HPC practitioner to have a solid (if not necessarily intimate) grasp of hardware architecture. reply mgaunard 17 hours agoparentprevRegardless of what you do, domain knowledge tends to be more valuable than purely technical skills.Knowing more numerical analysis will get probably get you further in HPC than knowledge of specific hardware architectures.Ideally you want both, of course. reply marcosdumay 17 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not intuitive, but for HPC is more about scalability than performance.You won&#x27;t be able to use a supercomputer at all without scalability, and it&#x27;s the one topic that is specific to it. But, of course, those computers time is quite expensive so you&#x27;ll want to optimize for performance too. It&#x27;s just secondary. reply bee_rider 18 hours agoparentprevI don’t think I do HPC (I only will use up to, say, 8 nodes at a time), but the impression I get is that they are already working on quite hard problems at the high-level, so they need to lean on good libraries for the low-level stuff, otherwise it is just too much. reply MichaelZuo 18 hours agoparentprevMemory architecture and bandwidth are still very important, most of IBM&#x27;s latest performance gains for both mainframes and POWER are reliant on some novel innovations there. reply crabbone 17 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;d be surprised how actually backwards and primitive are the tools used in HPC.Take for instance the so-called workload managers, of which the most popular ones are Slurm, PBS, UGE, LSF. Only Slurm is really open-source, PBS has a community edition, the rest is proprietary stuff executed in the best traditions of enterprise software which locks you into using pathetically bad tools, ancient and backwards tech with crappy &#x2F; nonexistent documentation and inept tech support.The interface between WLMs and the user who wants to use some resources is through submitting \"jobs\". These jobs can be interactive, but most often they are the so-called \"batch jobs\". A batch job is usually defined as... a Unix Shell script, where the comments are parsed to interpret those as instructions to the WLM. In the world with dozens of configuration formats... they chose to do this: embed configuration into Shell comments.Debugging job failures is a nightmare, mostly because WLM software has really poor quality of execution. Pathetic error reporting. Idiotic defaults. Everything is so fragile it falls apart if you just as much as look at it in the wrong way. Working with it reminds me the very early days of Linux, when sometimes things just won&#x27;t build, or would segfault right after you&#x27;ve tried running them, and there wasn&#x27;t much you could do beside spending days or weeks trying to debug it just to get some basic functionality going.When I have to deal with it, I feel kind of like in a steam-punk movie. Some stuff is really advanced, and then you find out that this advanced stuff is propped by some DIY retro nonsense you thought have died off decades ago. The advanced stuff is usually more on the side of hardware, while software is not keeping up with it for the most part. reply victotronics 15 hours agorootparentYou do a lot of scare quotes. Do you have any suggestions on how things could be different? You need batch jobs because the scheduler has to wait for resources to be available. It&#x27;s kinda like Tetris in processor&#x2F;time space. (In fact, that&#x27;s my personal \"proof\" that workload scheduling is NP-complete: it&#x27;s isomorphic to Tetris.)And what&#x27;s wrong with shell scripts? It&#x27;s a lingua franca, generally accepted across scientific disciplines, cluster vendors, workload managers, .... Considering the complexity of some setups (copy data to node-local file systems; run multiple programs, post-process results, ... ) I don&#x27;t see how you could set up things other than in some scripting language. And then unix shell scripts are not the worst idea.Debugging failures: yeah. Too many levels where something can go wrong, and it can be a pain to debug. Still, your average cluster processes a few million jobs in its lifetime. If more than a microscopic portion of that would fail, computing centers would need way more personnel than they have. reply romanows 15 hours agorootparentprevI really like using Slurm, the documentation is great (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slurm.schedmd.com) and the model is pretty straightforward, at least for the mostly-single-node jobs I used it for.You can launch a job(s) via command-line, config in Bash comments, REST APIs, linking to their library, and I think a few more ways.I found it pretty easy to setup and admin. Scaling in the cloud was way less developed when I used it, so I just hacked in a simple script that allowed scaling up and down based on the job queue size.What do you like better and for what use-case? Mine was for a group of researchers training models, and the feature I desired most was an approximately fair distribution of resources (cores, GPU hours, etc.). reply bee_rider 16 hours agorootparentprevHaving switched from LSF to slurm, I have to appreciate that the ecosystem is so bash-centric. Lots of re-use in the conversion.

I don&#x27;t know if you know this. LSF is perhaps the only system alive today that I know of that uses literal patches as a means of software distribution.Fist time I saw it, I had a flashback to the times when I worked for HP, and they were making some huge SAP knock-off, and that system was so labor-intensive to deploy that their QA process involved actual patches. As in pre-release QA cycle involved installing the system, validating it (which could take a few weeks) and if it&#x27;s not considered DoD, then the developers are given the final list of things they need to fix and those fixes would have to be submitted as patches (sometimes, literal diffs that need to be applied to the deployed system with the patch tool).This is, I guess, how the \"patch version component\" came to be in SemVer spec. It&#x27;s kind of funny how lots of tools are using this component today for completely unrelated purposes... but yeah, LSF feels like the time is ticking there at a different pace :) reply OPA100 15 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve dug deeply into LSF in the last few years and it&#x27;s like a car crash - you can&#x27;t look away.

It was cross-listed under both the computer science and applied math departments. The issue is that the field is pretty broad overall and a lot of topics were covered in a cursory manner, including anything related to HPC and parallel programming in particular. I don&#x27;t regret taking the course, but it was too broad for the applications I was pursuing.I haven&#x27;t looked at what courses are being offered in several years, but when I was a graduate student, I really would have benefited from a dedicated semester-long course on parallel computing, especially going into the weeds about particular algorithms and data structures in parallel and distributed computing. Those were handled in a super cursory manner in the scientific computing course I took, as if somehow you&#x27;d know precisely how to parallelize things the first time you try.

    "originBody": "In The birth & death of search engine optimization, Xe suggests Here's a fun experiment to try. Take an open source project such as yt-dlp and try to find it from a very generic term like \"youtube downloader\". You won't be able to find it because of all of the content farms that try to rank at the top for that term. Even though yt-dlp is probably actually what you want for a tool to download video from YouTube. More generally, most tech folks I'm connected to seem to think that Google search results are significantly worse than they were ten years ago (Mastodon poll, Twitter poll, Threads poll). However, there's a sizable group of vocal folks who claim that search results are still great. E.g., a bluesky thought leader who gets high engagement says: i think the rending of garments about how even google search is terrible now is pretty overblown1 I suspect what's going on here is that some people have gotten so used working around bad software that they don't even know they're doing it, reflexively doing the modern equivalent of hitting ctrl+s all the time in editors, or ctrl+a; ctrl+c when composing anything in a text box. Every adept user of the modern web has a bag of tricks they use to get decent results from queries. From having watched quite a few users interact with computers, that doesn't appear to be normal, even among people who are quite competent in various technical fields, e.g., mechanical engineering2. However, it could be that people who are complaining about bad search result quality are just hopping on the \"everything sucks\" bandwagon and making totally unsubstantiated comments about search quality. Since it's fairly easy to try out straightforward, naive, queries, let's try some queries. We'll look at three kinds of queries with five search engines plus ChatGPT and we'll turn off our ad blocker to get the non-expert browsing experience. I once had a computer get owned from browsing to a website with a shady ad, so I hope that doesn't happen here (in that case, I was lucky that I could tell that it happened because the malware was doing so much stuff to my computer that it was impossible to not notice). One kind of query is a selected set of representative queries a friend of mine used to set up her new computer. My friend is a highly competent engineer outside of tech and wanted help learning \"how to use computers\", so I watched her try to set up a computer and pointed out holes in her mental model of how to interact with websites and software. The second kind of query is queries for the kinds of things I wanted to know in high school where I couldn't find the answer because everyone I asked (teachers, etc.) gave me obviously incorrect answers and I didn't know how to find the right answer. I was able to get the right answer from various textbooks once I got to college and had access to university libraries, but the questions are simple enough that there's no particular reason a high school student shouldn't be able to understand the answers; it's just an issue of finding the answer, so we'll take a look at how easy these answers are to find. The third kind of query is a local query for information I happened to want to get as I was writing this post. In grading the queries, there's going to be some subjectivity here because, for example, it's not objectively clear if it's better to have moderately relevant results with no scams or very relevant results mixed interspersed with scams that try to install badware or trick you into giving up your credit card info to pay for something you shouldn't pay for. For the purposes of this post, I'm considering scams to be fairly bad, so in that specific example, I'd rate the moderately relevant results above the very relevant results that have scams mixed in. As with my other posts that have some kind of subjective ranking, there's both a short summary as well as a detailed description of results, so you can rank services yourself, if you like. In the table below, each column is a query (there are more details about what each query is later in the post) and each row is a search engine or ChatGPT. Results are rated (from worst to best) Terrible, Very Bad, Bad, Ok, Good, and Great, with worse results being more red and better results being more blue.YouTube Adblock Firefox Tire CPU Snow Marginalia Ok Good Ok Bad Bad Bad ChatGPT V. Bad Great Good V. Bad V. Bad Bad Mwmbl Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Kagi Bad V. Bad Great Terrible Bad Terrible Google Terrible V. Bad Bad Bad Bad Terrible Bing Terrible Terrible Great Terrible Ok Terrible Marginalia does relatively well by sometimes providing decent but not great answers and then providing no answers or very obviously irrelevant answers to the questions it can't answer, with a relatively low rate of scams, lower than any other search engine (although, for these queries, ChatGPT returns zero scams and Marginalia returns some). Interestingly, Mwmbl lets users directly edit search result rankings. I did this for one query, which would score \"Great\" if it was scored after my edit, but it's easy to do well on a benchmark when you optimize specifically for the benchmark, so Mwmbl's scores are without my edits to the ranking criteria. One thing I found interesting about the Google results was that, in addition to Google's noted propensity to return recent results, there was a strong propensity to return recent youtube videos. This caused us to get videos that seem quite useless for anybody, except perhaps the maker of the video, who appears to be attempting to get ad revenue from the video. For example, when searching for \"ad blocker\", one of the youtube results was a video where the person rambles for 93 seconds about how you should use an ad blocker and then googles \"ad blocker extension\". They then click on the first result and incorrectly say that \"it's officially from Google\", i.e., the ad blocker is either made by Google or has some kind of official Google seal of approval, because it's the first result. They then ramble for another 40 seconds as they install the ad blocker. After it's installed, they incorrectly state \"this is basically one of the most effective ad blocker [sic] on Google Chrome\". The video has 14k views and it appears to be made by someone who has no idea what they're talking about, who's part of the cottage industry of people making videos taking advantage of Google's algorithm prioritizing recent content regardless of quality. We'll discuss other Google quirks in more detail below. ChatGPT does its usual thing and impressively outperforms its more traditional competitors in one case, does an ok job in another case, refuses to really answer the question in another case, and \"hallucinates\" nonsense for a number of queries (as usual for ChatGPT, random perturbations can significantly change the results3). It's common to criticize ChatGPT for its hallucinations and, while I don't think that's unfair, as we noted in this 2015, pre-LLM post on AI, I find this general class of criticism to be overrated in that humans and traditional computer systems make the exact same mistakes. In this case, search engines return various kinds of hallucinated results. In the snow forecast example, we got deliberately fabricated results, one intended to drive ad revenue through shady ads on a fake forecast site, and another intended to trick the user into thinking that the forecast indicates a cold, snowy, winter (the opposite of the actual forecast), seemingly in order to get the user to sign up for unnecessary snow removal services. Other deliberately fabricated results include a site that's intended to look like an objective review site that's actually a fake site designed to funnel you into installing a specific ad blocker, where the ad blocker they funnel you to appears to be a scammy one that tries to get you to pay for ad blocking and doesn't let you unsubscribe, a fake \"organic\" blog post trying to get you to install a chrome extension that exposes all of your shopping to some service (in many cases, it's not possible to tell if a blog post is a fake or shill post, but in this case, they hosted the fake blog post on the domain for the product and, although it's designed to look like there's an entire blog on the topic, there isn't — it's just this one fake blog post), etc. There were also many results which don't appear to be deliberately fraudulent and are just run-of-the-mill SEO garbage designed to farm ad clicks. These seem to mostly be pre-LLM sites, so they don't read quite like ChatGPT hallucinations, but they're not fundamentally different. Sometimes the goal of these sites is to get users to click on ads that actually scam the user, and sometimes the goal appears to be to generate clicks to non-scam ads. Search engines also returned many seemingly non-deliberate human hallucinations, where people confidently stated incorrect answers in places where user content is highlighted, like quora, reddit, and stack exchange. On these queries, even ignoring anything that looks like LLM-generated text, I'd rate the major search engines (Google and Bing) as somewhat worse than ChatGPT in terms of returning various kinds of hallucinated or hallucination-adjacent results. While I don't think concerns about LLM hallucinations are illegitimate, the traditional ecosystem has the problem that the system highly incentivizes putting whatever is most profitable for the software supply chain in front of the user which is, in general, quite different from the best result. For example, if your app store allows \"you might also like\" recommendations, the most valuable ad slot for apps about gambling addiction management will be gambling apps. Allowing gambling ads on an addiction management app is too blatantly user-hostile for any company deliberately allow today, but of course companies that make gambling apps will try to game the system to break through the filtering and they sometimes succeed. And for web search, I just tried this again on the web and one of the two major search engines returned, as a top result, ad-laden SEO blogspam for addiction management. At the top of the page is a multi-part ad, with the top two links being \"GAMES THAT PAY REAL MONEY\" and \"GAMES THAT PAY REAL CASH\". In general, I was getting localized results (lots of .ca domains since I'm in Canada), so you may get somewhat different results if you try this yourself. Similarly, if the best result is a good, free, ad blocker like ublock origin, the top ad slot is worth a lot more to a company that makes an ad blocker designed to trick you into paying for a lower quality ad blocker with a nearly-uncancellable subscription, so the scam ad blocker is going to outbid the free ad blocker for the top ad slots. These kinds of companies also have a lot more resources to spend on direct SEO, as well as indirect SEO activities like marketing so, unless search engines mount a more effective effort to combat the profit motive, the top results will go to paid ad blockers even though the paid ad blockers are generally significantly worse for users than free ad blockers. If you talk to people who work on ranking, a lot of the biggest ranking signals are derived from clicks and engagement, but this will only drive users to the best results when users are sophisticated enough to know what the best results are, which they generally aren't. Human raters also rate page quality, but this has the exact same problem. Many Google employees have told me that ads are actually good because they inform the user about options the user wouldn't have otherwise known about, but anyone who tries browsing without an ad blocker will see ads that are various kinds of misleading, ads that try to trick or entrap the user in various ways, by pretending to be a window, or advertising \"GAMES THAT PAY REAL CASH\" at the top of a page on battling gambling addiction, which has managed to SEO itself to a high ranking on gambling addiction searches. In principle, these problems could be mitigated with enough resources, but we can observe that trillion dollar companies have chosen not to invest enough resources combating SEO, spam, etc., that these kinds of scam ads are rarely seen. Instead, a number of top results are actually ads that direct you to scams. In their original Page Rank paper, Sergei Brin and Larry Page noted that ad-based search is inherently not incentive aligned with providing good results: Currently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users. For example, in our prototype search engine one of the top results for cellular phone is \"The Effect of Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention\", a study which explains in great detail the distractions and risk associated with conversing on a cell phone while driving. This search result came up first because of its high importance as judged by the PageRank algorithm, an approximation of citation importance on the web [Page, 98]. It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers. For this type of reason and historical experience with other media [Bagdikian 83], we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the Consumers. Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly insidious. A good example was OpenText, which was reported to be selling companies the right to be listed at the top of the search results for particular queries [Marchiori 97]. This type of bias is much more insidious than advertising, because it is not clear who \"deserves\" to be there, and who is willing to pay money to be listed. This business model resulted in an uproar, and OpenText has ceased to be a viable search engine. But less blatant bias are likely to be tolerated by the market. ... This type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on the market. Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results. For example, we noticed a major search engine would not return a large airline’s homepage when the airline’s name was given as a query. It so happened that the airline had placed an expensive ad, linked to the query that was its name. A better search engine would not have required this ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the advertising supported business model of the existing search engines ... we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm. Of course, Google is now dominated by ads and, despite specifically calling out the insidiousness of user conflating real results with paid results, both Google and Bing have made ads look more and more like real search results, to the point that most users usually won't know that they're clicking on ads and not real search results. By the way, this propensity for users to think that everything is an \"organic\" search result is the reason that, in this post, results are ordered by the order the appear on the page, so if four ads appear above the first organic result, the four ads will be rank 1-4 and the organic result will be ranked 5. I've heard Google employees say that AMP didn't impact search ranking because it \"only\" controlled what results went into the \"carousel\" that appeared above search results, as if inserting a carousel and then a bunch of ads above results, pushing results down below the fold, has no impact on how the user interacts with results. It's also common to see search engines ransoming the top slot for companies, so that companies that don't buy the ad for their own name end up with searches for that company putting their competitors at the top, which is also said to not impact search result ranking, a technically correct claim that's basically meaningless to the median user. When I tried running the query from the paper, \"cellular phone\" (no quotes) and, the top result was a Google Store link to buy Google's own Pixel 7, with the rest of the top results being various Android phones sold on Amazon. That's followed by the Wikipedia page for Mobile Phone, and then a series of commercial results all trying to sell you phones or SEO-spam trying to get you to click on ads or buy phones via their links (the next 7 results were commercial, with the next result after that being an ad-laden SEO blogspam page for the definition of a cell phone with ads of cell phones on it, followed by 3 more commercial results, followed by another ad-laden definition of a phone). The commercial links seem very low quality, e.g., the top link below the carousel after wikipedia is Best Buy's Canadian mobile phone page. The first two products there are an ad slots for eufy's version of the AirTag. The next result is for a monthly financed iPhone that's tied to Rogers, the next for a monthly financed Samsung phone that's tied to TELUS, then we have Samsung's AirTag, an monthly financed iPhone tied to Freedom Mobile, a monthly financed iPhone tied to Freedom mobile in a different color, a monthly financed iPhone tied to Rogers, a screen protector for the iPhone 13, another Samsung AirTag product, an unlocked iPhone 12, a Samsung wall charger, etc.; it's an extremely low quality result with products that people shouldn't be buying (and, based on the number of reviews, aren't buying — the modal number of reviews of the top products is 0 and the median is 1 or 2 even though there are plenty of things people do actually buy from Best Buy Canada and plenty of products that have lots of reviews). The other commercial results that show up are also generally extremely low quality results. The result that Sergei and Larry suggested was a great top result, \"The Effect of Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention\", is nowhere to be seen, buried beneath an avalanche of commercial results. On the other side of things, Google has also gotten into the action by buying ads that trick users, such as paying for an installer to try to trick users into installing Chrome over Firefox. Anyway, after looking at the results of our test queries, some questions that come to mind are: How is Marginalia, a search engine built by a single person, so good? Can Marginalia or another small search engine displace Google for mainstream users? Can a collection of small search engines provide better results than Google? Will Mwmbl's user-curation approach work? Would a search engine like 1996-Metacrawler, which aggregates results from multiple search engines, ChatGPT, Bard, etc., significantly outperform Google? The first question could easily be its own post and this post is already 17000 words, so maybe we'll examine it another time. We've previously noted that some individuals can be very productive, but of course the details vary in each case. On the second question, we looked at a similar question in 2016, both the general version, \"I could reproduce this billion dollar company in a weekend\", as well as specific comments about how open source software would make it trivial to surpass Google any day now, such as Nowadays, most any technology you need is indeed available in OSS and in state of the art. Allow me to plug meta64.com (my own company) as an example. I am using Lucene to index large numbers of news articles, and provide search into them, by searching a Lucene index generated by simple scraping of RSS-crawled content. I would claim that the Lucene technology is near optimal, and this search approach I'm using is nearly identical to what a Google would need to employ. The only true technology advantage Google has is in the sheer number of servers they can put online, which is prohibitively expensive for us small guys. But from a software standpoint, Google will be overtaken by technologies like mine over the next 10 years I predict. and Scaling things is always a challenge but as long as Lucene keeps getting better and better there is going to be a point where Google's advantage becomes irrelevant and we can cluster Lucene nodes and distribute search related computations on top and then use something like Hadoop to implement our own open source ranking algorithms. We're not there yet but technology only gets better over time and the choices we as developers make also matter. Even though Amazon and Google look like unbeatable giants now don't discount what incremental improvements can accomplish over a long stretch of time and in technology it's not even that long a stretch. It wasn't very long ago when Windows was the reigning champion. Where is Windows now? In that 2016 post, we saw that people who thought that open source solutions were set to surpass Google any day now appeared to have no idea how many hard problems must be solved to make a mainstream competitor to Google, including real-time indexing of rapidly-updated sites, like Twitter, newspapers, etc., as well as table-stakes level NLP, which is extremely non-trivial. Since 2016, these problems have gotten significantly harder as there's more real-time content to index and users expect much better NLP. The number of things people expect out of their search engine has increased as well, making the problem harder still, so it still appears to be quite difficult to displace Google as a mainstream search engine for, say, a billion users. On the other hand, if you want to make a useful search engine for a small number of users, that seems easier than ever because Google returns worse results than it used to for many queries. In our test queries, we saw a number of queries where many or most top results were filled with SEO garbage, a problem that was significantly worse than it was a decade ago, even before the rise of LLMs and that continues to get worse. I typically use search engines in a way that doesn't run into this, but when I look at what \"normal\" users query or if I try naive queries myself, as I did in this post, most results are quite poor, which didn't used to be true. Another place Google now falls over for me is when finding non-popular pages. I often find that, when I want to find a web page and I correctly remember the contents of the page, even if I do an exact string search, Google won't return the page. Either the page isn't indexed, or the page is effectively not indexed because it lives in some slow corner of the index that doesn't return in time. In order to find the page, I have to remember some text in a page that links to the page (often many clicks removed from the actual page, not just one, so I'm really remembering a page that links to a page that links to a page that links to a page that links to a page and then using archive.org to traverse the links that are now dead), search for that, and then manually navigate the link graph to get to the page. This basically never happened when I searched for something in 2005 and rarely happened in 2015, but this now happens a large fraction of the time I'm looking for something. Even in 2015, Google wasn't actually comprehensive. Just for example, Google search didn't index every tweet. But, at the time, I found Google search better at searching for tweets than Twitter search and I basically never ran across a tweet I wanted to find that wasn't indexed by Google. But now, most of the tweets I want to find aren't returned by Google search4, even when I search for \"[exact string from tweet] site:twitter.com\". In the original Page Rank paper, Sergei and Larry said \"Because humans can only type or speak a finite amount, and as computers continue improving, text indexing will scale even better than it does now.\" (and that, while machines can generate an effectively infinite amount of content, just indexing human-generated content seems very useful). Pre-LLM, Google certainly had the resources to index every tweet as well as every human generated utterance on every public website, but they seem to have chosen to devote their resources elsewhere and, relative to its size, the public web appears less indexed than ever, or at least less indexed than it's been since the very early days of web search. Back when Google returned decent results for simple queries and indexed almost any public page I'd want to find, it would've been very difficult for an independent search engine to return results that I find better than Google's. Marginalia in 2016 would've been nothing more than a curiosity for me since Google would give good-enough results for basically anything where Marginalia returns decent results, and Google would give me the correct result in queries for every obscure page I searched for, something that would be extremely difficult for a small engine. But now that Google effectively doesn't index many pages I want to search for, the relatively small indices that independent search engines have doesn't make them non-starters for me and some of them return less SEO garbage than Google, making them better for my use since I generally don't care about real-time results, don't need fancy NLP (and find that much of it actually makes search results worse for me), don't need shopping integrated into my search results, rarely need image search with understanding of images, etc. On the question of whether or not a collection of small search engines can provide better results than Google for a lot of users, I don't think this is much of a question because the answer has been a resounding \"yes\" for years. However, many people don't believe this is so. For example, a Google TLM replied to the bluesky thought leader at the top of this post with Somebody tried argue that if the search space were more competitive, with lots of little providers instead of like three big ones, then somehow it would be *more* resistant to ML-based SEO abuse. And... look, if *google* can't currently keep up with it, how will Little Mr. 5% Market Share do it? presumably referring to arguments like Hillel Wayne's \"Algorithm Monocultures\", to which our bluesky thought leader replied like 95% of the time, when someone claims that some small, independent company can do something hard better than the market leader can, it’s just cope. economies of scale work pretty well! In the past, we looked at some examples where the market leader provides a poor product and various other players, often tiny, provide better products and in a future post, we'll look at how economies of scale and diseconomies of scale interact in various areas for tech but, for this post, suffice it to say that it's clear that despite the common \"econ 101\" cocktail party idea that economies of scale should be the dominant factor for search quality, that doesn't appear to be the case when we look at actual results. On the question of whether or not Mwmbl's user-curated results can work, I would guess no, or at least not without a lot more moderation. Just browsing to Mwmbl shows the last edit to ranking was by user \"betest\", who added some kind of blogspam as the top entry for \"RSS\". It appears to be possible to revert the change, but there's no easily findable way to report the change or the user as spammy. On the question of whether or not something like Metacrawler, which aggregated results from multiple search engines, would produce superior results today, that's arguably irrelevant since it would either be impossible to legally run as a commercial service or require prohibitive licensing fees, but it seems plausible that, from a technical standpoint, a modern metacrawler would be fairly good today. Metacrawler quickly became irrelevant because Google returned significantly better results than you would get by aggregating results from other search engines, but it doesn't seem like that's the case today. Going back to the debate between folks like Xe, who believe that straightforward search queries are inundated with crap, and our thought leader, who believes that \"the rending of garments about how even google search is terrible now is pretty overblown\", it appears that Xe is correct. Although Google doesn't publicly provide the ability to see what was historically returned for queries, many people remember when straightforward queries generally returned good results. One of the reasons Google took off so quickly in the 90s, even among expert users of AltaVista, who'd become very adept at adding all sorts of qualifiers to queries to get good results, was that you didn't have to do that with Google. But we've now come full circle and we need to add qualifiers, restrict our search to specific sites, etc., to get good results from Google on what used to be simple queries. Thanks to Laurence Tratt, Heath Borders, Viktor Lofgren (who, BTW, I didn't know before writing this post — I only reached out to him to discuss the Marginalia search results after running the queries), Misha Yagudin, @hpincket@fosstodon.org, Jeremey Kun, and Yossi Kreinin for comments/corrections/discussion Appendix: Other search engines DuckDuckGo: in the past, when I've compared DDG to Bing while using an ad blocker, the results have been very similar. I also tried DDG here and, removing the Bing ads, the results aren't as similar as they used to be, but they were still similar enough that it didn't seem worth listing DDG results. I use DDG as my default search engine and I think, like Google, it works fine if you know how to query but, for the kinds of naive queries in this post, it doesn't fare particularly well. wiby.me: Like Marginalia, this is another search engine made for finding relatively obscure results. I tried four of the above queries on wiby and the results were interesting, in that they were really different than what I got from any other search engine, but wiby didn't return relevant results for the I tried. searchmysite.net: Somewhat relevant results for some queries, but not as relevant as Marginalia. Many fewer scams and ad-laden pages than Google, Bing, and Kagi. indieweb-search.jamesg.blog: seemed to be having an outage. \"Your request could not be processed due to a server error.\" for every query. Teclis: The search box is still there, but any query results in \"Teclis.com is closed due to bot abuse. Teclis results are still available through Kagi's search results, explicitly through the 'Non-commercial Web' lens and also as an API.\". A note on the front page reads \"Teclis results are disabled on the site due to insane amount of bot traffic (99.9% traffic were bots).\" Appendix: queries that return good results I think that most programmers are likely to be able to get good results to every query, except perhaps the tire width vs. grip query, so here's how I found an ok answer to the tire query: I tried a youtube search, since a lot of the best car-related content is now youtube. A youtube video whose title claims to answer the question (the video doesn't actually answer the question) has a comment recommending Carroll Smith's book \"Tune To Win\". The comment claims that chapter 1 explains why wider tires have more grip, but I couldn't find an explanation anywhere in the book. Chapter 1 does note that race cars typically run wider tires than passenger cars and that passenger cars are moving towards having wider tires and it make some comments about slip angle that give a sketch of an intuitive reason for why you'd end up with better cornering with a wider contact patch, but I couldn't find a comment that explains differences in braking. Also, the book notes that the primary reason for the wider contact patch is that it (indirectly) allows for more less heat buildup, which then lets you design tires that operate over a narrower temperature range, which allows for softer rubber. That may be true, but it doesn't explain much of the observed behavior one might wonder about. Tune to Win recommends Kummer's The Unified Theory of Tire and Rubber Friction and Hays and Brooke's (actually Browne, but Smith incorrectly says Brooke) The Physics of Tire Traction. Neither of these really explained what's happening either, but looking for similar books turned up Milliken and Millken's Race Car Vehicle Dynamics, which also didn't really explain why but seemed closer to having an explanation. Looking for books similar to Race Car Vehicle Dynamics turned up Guiggiani's The Science of Vehicle Dynamics, which did get at how to think about and model a number of related factors. The last chapter of Guiggiani's book refers to something called the \"brush model\" (of tires) and searching for \"brush model tire width\" turned up a reference to Pacejka's Tire and Vehicle Dynamics, which does start to explain why wider tires have better grip and what kind of modeling of tire and vehicle dynamics you need to do to explain easily observed tire behavior. As we've noted, people have different tricks for getting good results so, if you have a better way of getting a good result here, I'd be interested in hearing about it. But note that, basically every time I have a post that notes that something doesn't work, the most common suggestion will be to do something that's commonly suggested that doesn't work, even though the post explicitly notes that the commonly suggested thing doesn't work. For example, the most common comment I receive about this post on filesystem correctness is that you can get around all of this stuff by doing the rename trick, even though the post explicitly notes that this doesn't work, explains why it doesn't work, and references a paper which discusses why it doesn't work. A few years later, I gave an expanded talk on the subject, where I noted that people kept suggesting this thing that doesn't work and the most common comment I get on the talk is that you don't need to bother with all of this stuff because you can just do the rename trick. If you have a suggestion for the reason wider tires have better grip or for a search which turns up an explanation, please consider making sure that the explanation is not one of the standard incorrect explanations noted in this post and that the explanation can account for all of the behavior that one must be able to account for if one is explaining this phenomenon. On how to get good results for other queries, since this post is already 17000 words, I'll leave that for a future post on how expert vs. non-expert computer users interact with computers. Appendix: summary of query results For each question, answers are ordered from best to worst, with the metric being my subjective impression of how good the result is. These queries were mostly run in November 2023, although a couple were run in mid-December. When I'm running queries, I very rarely write natural language queries myself. However, normal users often write natural language queries, so I arbitrarily did the \"Tire\" and \"Snow\" queries as natural queries. Continuing with the theme of running simple, naive, queries, we used the free version of ChatGPT for this post, which means the queries were run through ChatGPT 3.5. Ideally, we'd run the full matrix of queries using keyword and natural language queries for each query, run a lot more queries, etc., but this post is already 17000 words (converting to pages of a standard length book, that would be something like 70 pages), so running the full matrix of queries with a few more queries would pretty quickly turn this into a book-length post. For work and for certain kinds of data analysis, I'll sometimes do projects that are that comprehensive or more comprehensive, but here, we can't cover anything resembling a comprehensive set of queries and the best we can do is to just try a handful of queries that seem representative and use our judgment to decide if this matches the kind of behavior we and other people generally see, so I don't think it's worth doing something like 4x the work to cover marginally more ground. For the search engines, all queries were run in a fresh incognito window with cleared cookies, with the exception of Kagi, which doesn't allow logged-out searches. For Kagi, the queries were done with a fresh account with no custom personalization or filters, although they were done in sequence with the same account, so it's possible some kind of personalized ranking was applied to the later queries based on the clicks in the earlier queries. These queries were done in Vancouver, BC, which seems to have applied some kind of localized ranking on some search engines. Download youtube videos Ideally, the top hit would be yt-dlp or a thin, graphical, wrapper around yt-dlp. Links to youtube-dl or other less frequently updated projects would also be ok. Great results (yt-dlp as a top hit, maybe with youtube-dl in there somewhere, and no scams): none Good results (youtube-dl as a top hit, maybe with yt-dlp in there somewhere, and no scams): none Ok results ('youtube-dlas a top hit, maybe withyt-dlp` in there somewhere, and fewer scams than other search engines): Marginalia: Top link is for youtube-dl. Most links aren't relevant. Many fewer scams than the big search engines Bad results (has some useful links, but also links to a lot of scams) Mwmbl: Some links to bad sites and scams, but fewer than the big search engines. Also has one indirect link to youtube-dl in the top 10 and one for a GUI for youtube-dl Kagi: Mostly links to scammy sites but does have, a couple pages down, a web.archive.org link to the 2010 version of youtube-dl Very bad results (fails to return any kind of useful result) ChatGPT: basically refuses to answer the question, although you can probably prompt engineer your way to an answer if you don't just naively ask the question you want answered Terrible results (fails to return any kind of useful result and is full of scams: Google: Mostly links to sites that try to scam you or charge you for a worse version of free software. Some links to ad-laden listicles which don't have good suggestions. Zero links to good results. Also links to various youtube videos that are the youtube equivalent of blogspam. Bing: Mostly links to sites that try to scam you or charge you for a worse version of free software. Some links to ad-laden listicles which don't have good suggestions. Arguably zero links to good results (although one could make a case that result #10 is an ok result despite seeming to be malware). Ad blocker Ideally, the top link would be to ublock origin. Failing that, having any link to ublock origin would be good Great results (ublock origin is top result, no scams): ChatGPT: First suggestion is ublock origin Good results (ublock origin is high up, but not the top result; results above ublock origin are either obviously not ad blockers or basically work without payment even if they're not as good as ublock origin; no links that directly try to scam you): none Ok results (ublock origin is in there somewhere, fewer scams than other search engines with not many scams) Marginalia: 3rd and 4th results gets you to ublock origin and 8th result is ublock origin. Nothing that appears to try to scam you directly and \"only\" one link to soe kind of SEO ad farm scam (which is much better than the major search engines) Bad results (no links to ublock origin and mostly links to things that paywall good features or ad blockers that deliberately let ads through by default): Mwmbl: Lots of irrelevant links and some links to ghostery. One scam link, so fewer scams than commercial search engines Very bad results (exclusively or almost exclusively link to ad blockers that paywall good features or, by default, deliberately let through ads) Google: lots of links to ad blockers that \"participate in the Acceptable Ads program, where publishers agree to ensure their ads meet certain criteria\". Some links to things that appear to be scams. Zero links to ublock origin. Also links to various youtube videos that are the youtube equivalent of blogspam. Kagi: similar to Google, but with more scams, though fewer than Bing Terrible results (exclusively or almost exclusively link to ad blockers that paywall good features or, by default, deliberately let through ads and has a significant number of scams): Bing: similar to Google, but with more scams and without youtube videospam Download Firefox Ideally, we'd get links to download firefox with no fake or scam links Great results (links to download firefox; no scams): Bing: links to download Firefox Mwmbl: links to download firefox Kagi: links to download firefox Good: ChatGPT: this is a bit funny to categorize, since these are technically incorrect instructions, but a human should easily be able to decode the instructions and download firefox Ok results (some kind of indirect links to download firefox; no scams): Marginalia: indirect links to download Firefox instructions to get to a firefox download Bad results (links to download firefox, with scams): Google: top links are all legitimate, but the #7 result is a scam that tries to get you to install badware and the #10 result is an ad that appears to be some kind of scam that wants your credit card info. Why do wider tires have better grip? Ideally, would link to an explanation that clearly explains why and doesn't have an incomplete explanation that can't explain a lot of commonly observed behavior Great / Good / Ok results: none Bad results (no results or a very small number of obviously incorrect results): Mwmbl: one obviously incorrect result and no other results Marginalia: two obviously incorrect results and no other results Very bad results: (a very small number of semi-plausible incorrect results) ChatGPT: standard ChatGPT \"hallucination\" that's probably plausible to a lot of people (it sounds like a lot of incorrect internet comments on the topic, but better written) Terrible results (lots of semi-plausible incorrect results, often on ad farms): Google / Bing / Kagi: incorrect ad-laden results with the usual rate of scammy ads Why do they keep making cpu transistors smaller? Ideally, would link to an explanation that clearly explains why. The best explanations I've seen are in VLSI textbooks, but I've also seen very good explanations in lecture notes and slides Great results (links to a very good explanation, no scams): none Good results (links to an ok explanation, no scams): none Ok results (links to something you can then search on further and get a good explanation if you're good at searching and doesn't rank bad or misleading explanations above the ok explanation): Bing: top set of links had a partial answer that could easily be turned into links to correct answers via more searching. Also had a lot of irrelevant answers and ad-laden SEO'd garbage Bad results (no results or a small number of obviously irrelevant results or lots of semi-plausible wrong results with an ok result somewhere): Marginalia: no answers Mwmbl: one obviously irrelevant answer Google: 5th link has the right keywords to maybe find the right answer with further searches. Most links have misleading or incorrect partial answers. Lots of links to Quora, which don't answer the question. Also lots of links to other bad SEO'd answers Kagi: 10th link has a fairly direct path to getting the correct answer, if you scroll down far enough on the 10th link. Other links aren't good. Very bad results: ChatGPT: doesn't really answer the question. Asking ChatGPT to explain its answers further causes it \"hallucinate\" incorrect reasons. Vancouver snow forecast winter 2023 I'm not sure what the ideal answer is, but a pretty good one would be to Environment Canada's snow forecast, predicting significantly below normal snow (and above normal temperatures) Great results (links to Environment Canada winter 2023 multi-month snow forecast as top result or something equivalently good): none Good results: none Ok results (links to some kind of semi-plausible winter snow forecast that isn't just made-up garbage to drive ad clicks): none Bad results (no results or obviously irrelevant results): Marginalia: no results ChatGPT: incorrect results, but when I accidentally prepended my question with \"User\", then it returned a link to the right website (but in a way that would make it quite difficult to navigate to a decent result), so perhaps a slightly different prompt would pseudo-randomly cause a ok result here? Mwmbl: a bunch of obviously irrelevant results Very bad results: none Terrible results (links to deliberately faked forecast results): Bing: mostly irrelevant results. The top seemingly-relevant result is the 5th link, but it appears to be some kind of scam site that fabricates fake weather forecasts and makes money by serving ads on the heavily SEO'd site Kagi: top 4 results are from the scam forecast site that's Bing's 5th link Google: mostly irrelevant results and the #1 result is a fake answer from a local snow removal company that projects significant snow and cold weather in an attempt to get you to unnecessarily buy snow removal service for the year. Other results are SEO'd garbage that's full of ads Appendix: detailed query results Download youtube videos For our first query, we'll search \"download youtube videos\" (Xe's suggested search term, \"youtube downloader\" returns very similar results). The ideal result is yt-dlp or a thin, free, wrapper around yt-dlp. yt-dlp is a fork of youtube-dlc, which is a now defunct fork of youtube-dl, which seems to have very few updates nowadays.. A link to one of these older downloaders also seems ok if they still work. Google Some youtube downloader site. Has lots of assurances that the website and the tool are safe because they've been checked by \"Norton SafeWeb\". Interacting with the site at all prompts you to install a browser extension and enable notifications. Trying to download any video gives you a full page pop-over for extension installation for something called CyberShield. There appears to be no way to dismiss the popover without clicking on something to try to install it. After going through the links but then choosing not to install CyberShield, no video downloads. Googling \"cybershield chrome extension\" returns a knowledge card with \"Cyber Shield is a browser extension that claims to be a popup blocker but instead displays advertisements in the browser. When installed, this extension will open new tabs in the browser that display advertisements trying to sell software, push fake software updates, and tech support scams.\", so CyberShield appears to be badware. Some youtube downloader site. Interacting with the site causes a pop-up prompting you to download their browser extension. Putting a video URL in causes a pop-up to some scam site but does also cause the video to download, so it seems to be possible to download youtube videos here if you're careful not to engage with the scams the site tries to trick you into interacting with PC Magazine listicle on ways to download videos from youtube. Top recommendations are paying for youtube downloads, VLC (which they note didn't work when they tried it), some $15/yr software, some $26/yr software, \"FlixGrab\", then a warning about how the downloader websites are often scammy and they don't recommend any downloader website.

One page doesn't do this, but it also doesn't suggest the good, free, option for downloading youtube videos and instead suggests a number of paid solutions. We also had three youtube videos, all of which seem to be the video equivalent of SEO blogspam. Interestingly, we didn't get a lot of ads from Google itself despite that happening the last time I tried turning off my ad blocker to do some Google test queries. Bing Some youtube downloader site. This is google (2), which has ads for scam sites [EXPLORE FURTHER ... \"Recommended to you based on what's popular\"] Some youtube download site, not one we saw from google. Site has multiple pulsing ads and bills itself as \"50% off\" for Christmas (this search was done in mid-November). Trying to download any video pulls up a fake progress bar with a \"too slow? Try [our program] link\". After a while, a link to download the video appears, but it's a trick, and when you click it, it tries to install \"oWebster Search extension\". Googling \"oWebster Search extension\" indicates that it's badware that hijacks your browser to show ads. Two of the top three hits are how to install the extension and the rest of the top hits are how to remove this badware. Many of the removal links are themselves scams that install other badware. After not installing this badware, clicking the download link again results in a pop-over that tries to get you to install the site's software. If you dismiss the pop-over and click the download link again, you just get the pop-over link again, so this site appears to be a pure scam that doesn't let you download videos [EXPLORE FURTHER]. Interacting with the site pops up fake ads with photos of attractive women who allegedly want to chat with you.

There's a scam ad that's made to look like a youtube downloader button. If you scroll past that, there's a text box and a button for trying to download a youtube video. Entering a valid URL results in an error saying there's no video that URL. Gigantic card that actually has a download button. The download button is fake and just takes you to the site. The site loudly proclaims that the software is not adware, spyware, etc.. Quite a few internet commenters note that their antivirus software tags this software as malware. A lot of comments also indicate that the software doesn't work very well but sometimes works. The site for the software has a an embedded youtube video, which displays \"This video has been removed for violating YouTube's Terms of Service\". Oddly, the download links for mac and Linux are not for this software and in fact don't download anything at all and are installation instructions for youtube-dl; perhaps this makes sense if the windows version is actually malware. The windows download button takes you to a page that lets you download a windows executable. There's also a link to some kind of ad-laden page that tries to trick you into clicking on ads that look like normal buttons PC magazine listicle An ad for some youtube downloader program that claims \"345,764,132 downloads today\"; searching the name of this product on reddit seems to indicate that it's malware Ad for some kind of paid downloader software That's the end of the first page. Like Google, no good results and a lot of scams and software that may not be a scam but is some kind of lightweight skin around an open source project that charges you instead of letting you use the software for free. Marginalia 12-year old answer suggesting youtube-dl, which links to a URL which has been taken down and replaced with \"Due to a ruling of the Hamburg Regional Court, access to this website is blocked.\" Some SEO'd article, like you see on normal search engines Leawo YouTube Downloader (I don't know what this is, but a quick search at least doesn't make it immediately obvious that this is some kind of badware, unlike the Google and Bing results) Some SEO'd listicle, like you see on normal search engines Bug report for some random software Some random blogger's recommendation for \"4K Video Downloader\". A quick search seems to indicate that this isn't a scam or badware, but it does lock some features behind a paywall, and is therefore worse than yt-dlp or some free wrapper around yt-dlp A blog post on how to install and use yt-dlp. The blogpost notes that it used to be about youtube-dl, but has been updated to yt-dlp. More software that charges you for something you can get for free, although searching for this software on reddit turns up cracks for it A listicle with bizarrely outdated recommendations, like RealPlayer. The entire blog seems to be full of garbage-quality listicles. A script to download youtube videos for something called \"keyboard maestro\", which seems useful if you already use that software, but seems like a poor solution to this problem if you don't already use this software. The best results by a large margin. The first link doesn't work, but you can easily get to youtube-dl from the first link. I certainly wouldn't try Leawo YouTube Downloader, but at least it's not so scammy that searching for the name of the project mostly returns results about how the project is some kind of badware or a scam, which is better than we got from Google or Bing. And we do get a recommendation with yt-dlp, with instructions in the results that's just a blog post from someone who wants to help people who are trying to download youtube videos. Kagi 1. That NortonSafeWeb youtube downloader site. Interacting with the site at all prompts you to install a browser extension and enable notifications. Trying to download any video gives you a full page pop-over for extension installation for something called CyberShield. There appears to be no way to dismiss the popover without clicking on something to try to install it 2. Another link to that NortonSafeWeb youtube downloader site. For some reason, this one is tagged with \"Dec 20, 2003\", apparently indicating that the site is from Dec 20th 2003, although that's quite wrong. 3. Some youtube downloader site. Selecting any video to download pushes you to a site with scam ads. 4. Some youtube downloader site. Interacting with the site at all pops up multiple ads that link to scams and the page wants to enable notifications. A pop-up then appears on top of the ads that says \"Ad removed\" with a link for details. This is a scam link to another ad. 5. Another link to the above site 6-7. Under a subsection titled \"Interesting Finds\", there are links to two github repos. One is for transcribing youtube videos to text and the other is for using Google Takeout to backup photos from google photos or your own youtube channel 8. Some youtube downloader site. 9-13. Under a subsection titled \"Blast from the Past\", 4 irrelevant links and a link to youtube-dl's github page, but the 2010 version at archive.org 14. SEO blogspam for youtube help. Has a link that's allegedly for a \"Greasemonkey script for downloading YouTube videos\", but the link just goes to a page with scammy ads 15. Some software that charges you $5/mo to download videos from youtube Mwmbl Some youtube video downloader site, but one that no other search engine returned. There's a huge ad panel that displays \"503 NA - Service Deprecating\". The download link does nothing except for pop up some other ad panes that then disappear, leaving just the 503 \"ad\". $20 software for downloading youtube videos 2016 blog post on how to install and use youtube-dl. Sidebar has two low quality ads which don't appear to be scams and the main body has two ads interspersed, making this extremely low on ads compared to analogous results we've seen from large search engines Some youtube video download site. Has a giant banner claiming that it's \"the only YouTube Downloader that is 100% ad-free and contains no popups.\", which is probably not true, but the site does seem to be ad free and not have pop-ups. Download link seems to actually work. Youtube video on how to install and use youtube-dlg (a GUI wrapper for youtube-dl) on Linux (this query was run from a Mac). Link to what was a 2007 blogpost on how to download youtube videos, which automatically forwards to a 2020 ad-laden SEO blogspam listicle with bad suggestions. Article has two autoplay videos. Archive.org shows that the 2007 blog post had some reasonable options in it for the time, so this wasn't always a bad result. A blog post on a major site that's actually a sponsored post trying to get you to a particular video downloader. Searching for comments on this on reddit indicate that users view the app as a waste of money that doesn't work. The site is also full of scammy and misleading ads for other products. E.g., I tried clicking on an ad that purports to save you money on \"products\". It loaded a fake \"checking your computer\" animation that supposedly checked my computer for compatibility with the extension and then another fake checking animation, after which I got a message saying that my computer is compatible and I'm eligible to save money. All I have to do is install this extension. Closing that window opens a new tab that reads \"Hold up! Do you actually not want automated savings at checkout\" with the options \"Yes, Get Coupons\" and \"No, Don't Save\". Clicking \"No, Don't Save\" is actually an ad that takes you back to a link that tries to get you to install a chrome extension. That \"Norton Safe Web\" youtube downloader site, except that the link is wrong and is to the version of the site that purports to download instagram videos instead of the one that purports to download youtube videos. Link to Google help explaining how you can download youtube videos that you personally uploaded SEO blogspam. It immediately has a pop-over to get you to subscribe to their newsletter. Closing that gives you another pop-over with the options \"Subscribe\" and \"later\". Clicking \"later\" does actually dismiss the 2nd pop-over. After closing the pop-overs, the article has instructions on how to install some software for windows. Searching for reviews of the software returns comments like \"This is a PUP/PUA that can download unwanted applications to your pc or even malicious applications.\" Basically the same as Google or Bing. ChatGPT Since ChatGPT expects more conversational queries, we'll use the prompt \"How can I download youtube videos?\" The first attempt, on a Monday at 10:38am PT returned \"Our systems are a bit busy at the moment, please take a break and try again soon.\". The second attempt returned an answer saying that one should not download videos without paying for YouTube Premium, but if you want to, you can use third-party apps and websites. Following up with the question \"What are the best third-party apps and websites?\" returned another warning that you shouldn't use third-party apps and websites, followed by the ironic-for-GPT warning, I don't endorse or provide information on specific third-party apps or websites for downloading YouTube videos. It's essential to use caution and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines when it comes to online content. ad blocker For our next query, we'll try \"ad blocker\". We'd like to get ublock origin. Failing that, an ad blocker that, by default, blocks ads. Failing that, something that isn't a scam and also doesn't inject extra ads or its own ads. Although what's best may change at any given moment, comparisons I've seen that don't stack the deck have often seemed to show that ublock origin has the best or among the best performance, and ublock origin is free and blocks ads. Google \"AdBlock — best ad blocker\". Below the fold, notes \"AdBlock participates in the Acceptable Ads program, so unobtrusive ads are not blocked\", so this doesn't block all ads. Adblock PlusThe world's #1 free ad blocker. Pages notes \"Acceptable Ads are allowed by default to support websites\", so this also does not block all ads by default AdBlock. Page notes that \" Since 2015, we have participated in the Acceptable Ads program, where publishers agree to ensure their ads meet certain criteria. Ads that are deemed non-intrusive are shown by default to AdBlock users\", so this doesn't block all ads \"Adblock Plus - free ad blocker\", same as (2), doesn't block all ads \"AdGuard — World's most advanced adblocker!\" Page tries to sell you on some kind of paid software, \"AdGuard for Mac\". Searching for AdGuard turns up a post from this person looking for an ad blocker that blocks ads injected by AdGuard. It seems that you can download it for free, but then, if you don't subscribe, they give you more ads? \"AdBlock Pro\" on safari store; has in-app purchases. It looks like you have to pay to unlock features like blocking videos [YouTube] \"How youtube is handling the adblock backlash\". 30 second video with 15 second ad before the video.

This is for something called TOTAL Ad Block. Searching for TOTAL Ad Block turns up results indicating that it's a scammy app that doesn't let you unsubscribe and basically tries to steal your money 15 [ad] 100% Free & Easy Download - Automatic Ad Blocker. Actually for Avast browser and not an ad blocker. A quick search show that this browser has a history of being less secure than just running chromium and that it collects an unusually large amount of information from users. No links to ublock origin. Some links to scams, though not nearly as many as when trying to get a youtube downloader. Lots of links to ad blockers that deliberately only block some ads by default. Bing 1. [ad] \"Automatic Ad Blocker100% Free & Easy Download\". [link is actually to avast secure browser, so an entire browser and not an ad blocker; from a quick search, this appears to be a wrapper around chromium that [has a history of being less secure than just running chromium](https://palant.info/2020/01/13/pwning-avast-secure-browser-for-fun-and-profit/) [which collects an unusually large amount of information from users](https://palant.info/2019/10/28/avast-online-security-and-avast-secure-browser-are-spying-on-you/)]. 2.

[ad] \"Best Ad Blocker (2023)100% Free Ad Blocker\". Seems to be a fake review site that reviews various ad blockers; ublock origin is listed as #5 with 3.5 stars. TOTAL ad block is listed as #1 with 5 stars, is the only 5 stars ad blocker, has a banner that shows that it's the \"#1 Free Ad Blocker\", is award winning, etc. If you then click the link to ublock origin, it takes you to a page that \"shows\" that ublock origin has 0 stars on trustpilot. There are multiple big buttons that say \"click to start blocking ads\" that try to get you to install TOTAL ad block. In the bottom right, in what looks like an ad slot, there's an image that says \"visit site\" for ublock origin. The link doesn't take you to ublock origin and instead takes you a site for [the fake ublock origin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ublock/comments/32mos6/ublock_vs_ublock_origin/). 4.

We're now three screens down from the result, so the equivalent of the above google results is just a bunch of ads and then links to one website. The note that something is an ad is much more subtle than I've seen on any other site. Given what we know about when users confuse ads with organic search results, it's likely that most users don't realize that the top results are ads and think that the links to scam ad blockers or the fake review site that tries to funnel you into installing a scam ad blocker are organic search results. Marginalia \"Is ad-blocker software permissible?\" from judaism.stackexchange.com Blogspam for Ghosterty. Ghostery's pricing page notes that you have to pay for \"No Private Sponsored Links\", so it seems like some features are behind a pay wall. Wikipedia says \"Since July 2018, with version 8.2, Ghostery shows advertisements of its own to users\", but it seems like this might be opt-in? https://shouldiblockads.com/.

Blog post, anti-anti-adblocker polemic. ublock origin. Fairphone forum discussion on whether or not one should install an ad blocker. SEO site blogspam (as in, the site is an SEO optimization site and this is blogspam designed to generate backlinks and funnel traffic to the site). Probably the best result we've seen so far, in that the third and fourth results suggest ublock origin and the first result is very clearly not an ad blocker. It's unfortunate that the second result is blogspam for Ghostery, but this is still better than we see from Google and Bing. Mwmbl A bitly link to a \"thinkpiece\" on ad blocking from a VC thought leader. A link to cryptojackingtest, which forwards to Opera (the browser). A link to ghostery. Another link to ghostery. A link to something called 1blocker, which appears to be a paid ad blocker. Searching for reviews turns up comments like \"I did 1blocker free trial and forgot to cancel so it signed me up for annual for $20 [sic]\" (but comments indicate that the ad blocker does work). Blogspam for Ad Guard. There's a banner ad offering 40% off this ad blocker. An extremely ad-laden site that appears to be in the search results because it contains the text \"ad blocker detected\" if you use an ad blocker (I don't see this text on loading the page, but it's in the page preview on Mwmbl). The first page is literally just ads with a \"read more\" button. Clicking \"read more\" takes you to a different page that's full of ads that also has the cartoon, which is the \"content\". Another site that appears to be in the search results because it contains the text \"ad blocker detected\". Malwarebytes ad blocker, which doesn't appear to work. HN comments for article on youtube ad blocker crackdown. Scrolling to the 41st comment returns a recommendation for ublock origin. Mwmbl lets users suggest results, so I tried signing up to add ublock origin. Gmail put the sign-up email into my spam folder. After adding ublock origin to the search results, it's now the #1 result for \"ad blocker\" when I search logged out, from an incognito window and all other results are pushed down by one. As mentioned above, the score for Mwmbl is from before I edited the search results and not after. Kagi 1. \"Adblock PlusThe world's #1 free ad blocker\". 2-11.

Under a section titled \"Interesting Finds\", three articles about youtube's crackdown on ad blockers. One has a full page pop-over trying to get you to install TOTAL Adblock with \"Close\" and \"Open\" buttons. The \"Close\" button does nothing and clicking any link or the open button takes to a page advertising TOTAL adblock. There appears to be no way to dismiss the ad and read the actual article without doing something like going to developer tools and deleting the ad elements. The fourth article is titled \"The FBI now recommends using an ad blocker when searching the web\" and 100% of the above the fold content is the header plus a giant ad. Scrolling down, there are a lot more ads. 19. \"AdBlock\". 20. Another link from the Adblock site, \"Ad Blocker for Chrome - Download and Install AdBlock for Chrome Now!\". 21-25.

Maybe halfway in between in terms of the number of links to scams. ChatGPT Here, we tried the prompt. How do I install the best ad blocker? First suggestion is ublock origin. Second suggestion is adblock plus. This seems like the best result by a significant margin. download firefox Google 1-6. Links to download firefox. 7. Blogspam for firefox download with ads trying to trick you into installing badware. 8-9. Links to download firefox. 10 [ad] Some kind of shady site that claims to have firefox downloads, but where the downloads take you to other sites that try to get you to sign up for an account where they ask for personal information and your credit card number. Also pops up pop-over with window that does the above if you try to actually download firefox. At least one of the sites is some kind of gambling site, so this site might make money off of referring people to gambling sites? Mostly good links, but 2 out of the top 10 links are scams. And we didn't have a repeat of this situation I saw in 2017, where Google paid to get ranked above Firefox in a search for Firefox. For search queries where very search engine returns a lot of scams, I might rate having 2 out of the top 10 links be scams as \"Ok\" or perhaps even better but, here, where most search engines return no fake or scam links, I'm rating this as \"Bad\". You could make a case for \"Ok\" or \"Good\" here by saying that the vast majority of users will click one of the top links and never get as far as the 7th link, but I think that if Google is confident enough that's the case that they view it as unproblematic that the 7th and 10th links are scams, they should just only serve up the top links. Bing 1-12. Links to download firefox or closely related links. 13. [ad] Avast browser. That's the entire first page. Seems pretty good. Nothing that looks like a scam. Marginalia 1. \"Is it better to download Firefox from the website or use the package manager?\" on the UNIX stackexchange 2-9. Various links related to firefox, but not firefox downloads 10. \"Internet Download Accelerator online help\" Definitely worse than Bing, since none of the links are to download Firefox. Depending on how highly you rate users not getting scammed vs. having the exact right link, this might be better or worse than Google. In this post, this scams are relatively highly weighted, so Marginalia ranks above Google here. Mwmbl 1-7. Links to download firefox. 8. A link to a tumblr that has nothing to do with firefox. The title of the tumblr is \"Love yourself, download firefox\" (that's the title of the entire blog, not a particular blog post). 9. Link to download firefox nightly. 10. Extremely shady link that allegedly downloads firefox. Attempting to download the shady firefox pops up an ad that tries to trick you downloading Opera. I did not run either the Opera or Firefox binaries to see if they're legitimate. kagi.com 1-3. Links to download firefox. 4-5. Under a heading titled \"Interesting finds\", a 404'd link to a tweet titled \"What happens if you try to download and install Firefox on Windows\" [which used to note that downloading Firefox on windows results in an OS-level pop-up that recommends Edge instead \"to protect your pc\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20220403104257/https://twitter.com/plexus/status/1510568329303445507) and some extremely ad-laden article (though, to its credit, the ads don't seem to be scam ads). 6. Link to download firefox. 7-10. 3 links to download very old versions of firefox, and a blog post about some kind of collaboration between firefox and ebay. 11. Mozilla homepage. 12. Link to download firefox. Maybe halfway in between Bing and Marginalia. No scams, but a lot of irrelevant links. Unlike some of the larger search engines, these links are almost all to download the wrong version of firefox, e.g., I'm on a Mac and almost all of the links are for windows downloads. ChatGPT The prompt \"How do I download firefox?\" returned technically incorrect instructions on how to download firefox. The instructions did start with going to the correct site, at which point I think users are likely to be able to download firefox by looking at the site and ignoring the instructions. Seems vaguely similar to marginalia, in that you can get to a download by clicking some links, but it's not exactly the right result. However, I think users are almost certain to find the correct steps and only likely with Marginalia, so ChatGPT is rated more highly than Marginalia for this query. Why do wider tires have better grip? Any explanation that's correct must, a minimum, be consistent with the following: Assuming a baseline of a moderately wide tire for the wheel size. Scaling both of these to make both wider than the OEM tire (but still running a setup that fits in the car without serious modifications) generally gives better dry braking and better lap times. In wet conditions, wider setups often have better braking distances (though this depends a lot on the specific setup) and better lap times, but also aquaplane at lower speeds. Just increasing the wheel width and using the same tire generally gives you better lap times, within reason. Just increasing the tire width and leaving wheel width fixed generally results in worse lap times. Why tire pressure changes have the impact that they do (I'm not going to define terms in these bullets; if this text doesn't make sense to you, that's ok). At small slip angles, increasing tire pressure results in increased lateral force. In general, lowering tire pressure increases effective friction coefficient (within reason a semi-reasonable range). This is one that has a lot of standard incorrect or incomplete answers, including: Wider tires give you more grip because you get more surface area. Wider tires don't, at reasonable tire pressure, give you significantly more surface area. Wider tires actually don't give you more grip because friction is surface area times a constant and surface area is mediated by air pressure. It's easily empirically observed that wider tires do, in fact, give you better handling and braking. Wider tires let you use a softer compound, so the real reason wider tires give you more grip is via the softer compound. This could be part of an explanation, but I've generally seen this cited as the only explanation. However, wider tires give you more grip independent of having a softer compound. You can even observe this with the same tire by mounting the exact same tire on a wider wheel (within reason). The shape of the contact patch when the tire is wider gives you better lateral grip due to [some mumbo jumbo], e.g., \"tire load sensitivity\" or \"dynamic load\". Ok, perhaps, but what's the mechanism that gives wider tires more grip when braking? And also, please explain the mumbo jumbo. For my goal of understanding why this happens, if you just use some word but don't explain the mechanism, this isn't fundamentally different than saying that wider tires have better grip due to magic. When there's some kind of explanation of the mumbo jumbo, there will often be an explanation that only applies to aspect of increased grip, e.g., the explanation will really only apply to lateral grip and not explain why braking distances are decreased. Google 1. A \"knowledge card\" that says \"Bigger tires provide a wider contact area that optimizes their performance and traction.\", which explains nothing. On clicking the link, it's SEO blogspam with many [incorrect statements, such as \"Are wider tires better for snow traction? Or are narrow tires more reliable in the winter months? The simple answer is narrow tires!](https://mastodon.social/@danluu/111441790762754806) Tires with a smaller section width provide more grip in winter conditions. They place higher surface pressure against the road they are being driven on, enabling its snow and ice traction\" 2. [Question dropdown] \"do wider tires give you more grip?\", which correctly says \"On a dry road, wider tires will offer more grip than narrow ones, but the risk of aquaplaning will be higher with wide tires.\". On clicking the link, there's no explanation of why, let alone an answer to the question we're asking 3. [Question dropdown] \"Do bigger tires give you better traction?\", which says \"What Difference Does The Wheel Size Make? Larger wheels offer better traction, and because they have more rubber on the tire, this also means a better grip on the road\", which has a nonsensical explanation of why. On clicking the link, the link appears to be talking about wheel diameter and is not only wrong, but actually answering the wrong question. 4. [Question dropdown] \"Why do wider tires have more grip physics?\", which then has some of the standard incorrect explanations. 5. \"Do wider wheels improve handling?\", which says \"Wider wheels and wider tires will also lower your steering friction coefficient\". On clicking the link, there's no explanation of why nor is there an answer to the question we're asking. 6. \"What are the disadvantages of wider tires?\", which says \"Harder Handling & Steering\". On clicking the link, there are multiple incorrect statements and no explanation of why. 7. \"Would wider tires increase friction?\", which says \"Force can be stated as Pressure X Area. For a wide tire, the area is large but the force per unit area is small and vice versa. The force of friction is therefore the same whether the tire is wide or not.\". Can't load the page due to a 502 error and the page isn't in archive.org, but this seems fine since the page appears to be wrong 8. \"What is the advantage of 20 inch wheels over 18 inch wheels?\" Answers a different question. On clicking the link, it's low quality SEO blogspam. 9. \"Why do race cars have wide tires?\", which says \"Wider tires provide more resistance to slippery spots or grit on the road. Race tracks have gravel, dust, rubber beads and oil on them in spots that limit traction. By covering a larger width, the tires can handle small problems like that better. Wider tires have improved wear characteristics.\". Perhaps technically correct, but fundamentally not the answer and highly misleading at best. 10-49. Other question dropdowns that are wrong. Usually both wrong and answering the wrong question, but sometimes giving a wrong answer to the right question and sometimes giving the right answer to the wrong question. I am just now realizing that clicking question dropdowns give you more question dropdowns. 50. \"Why do wider tires get more grip? : r/cars\". The person asks the question I'm asking, concluding with \"This feels like a really dumb question because wider tires=more grip just seems intuitive, but I don't know the answer.\". The top answer is total nonsense \"The smaller surface area has more pressure but the same normal force as a larger surface area. If you distribute the same load across more area, each square inch of tire will have less force it's responsible for holding, and thus is less likely to be overcome by the force from the engine\". The #2 answer is a classic reddit answer, \"Yeah, take your science bs and throw it out the window.\". The #3 answer has a vaguely plausible sounding answer to why wider tires have better lateral grip, but it's still misleading. Like many of the answers, the answer emphasizes how wider tires give you better lateral grip and has a lengthy explanation for why this should be the case, but wider tires also give you shorter braking distances and the provided explanation cannot explain why wider tires have shorter braking distances so must be missing a significant part of the puzzle. Anyway, none of the rest of the answers really even attempt to explain why 51-54. Other reddit answers bunched with this one, which also don't answer the question, although one of them links to https://www.brachengineering.com/content/publications/Wheel-Slip-Model-2006-Brach-Engineering.pdf, which has some good content, though it doesn't answer the question. 55.

Unusually, the few ads that I clicked on seemed to be normal ads and not scams. Blogspam for ad farm that has pop-overs that try to get you to install badware. Page with ChatGPT-sounding nonsense. Has a \"Last updated\" timestamp that's sever-side generated to match the exact moment you navigated to the page. Page tries to trick you into clicking on ads with full-page popover. Ads don't seem to be scams, as far as I can tell. Page which incorrectly states \"In summary, a wider tire does not give better traction, it is the same traction similar to a more narrow tire.\". Has some ads that get you to try to install badware. ChatGPT Provides a list of \"hallucinated\" reasons. The list of reasons has better grammar than most web search results, but still incorrect. It's not surprising that ChatGPT can't answer this question, since it often falls over on questions that are both easier to reason about and where the training data will contain many copies of the correct answer, e.g., Joss Fong noted that, when her niece asked ChatGPT about gravity, the response was nonsense: \"... That's why a feather floats down slowly but a rock drops quickly — the Earth is pulling them both, but the rock gets pulled harder because it's heavier.\" Overall, no search engine gives correct answers. Marginalia seems to be the best here in that it gives only a couple of links to wrong answers and no links to scams. Why do they keep making cpu transistors smaller? I had this question when I was in high school and my AP physics teacher explained to me that it was because making the transistors smaller allowed the CPU to be smaller, which let you make the whole computer smaller. Even at age 14, I could see that this was an absurd answer, not really different than today's ChatGPT hallucinations — at the time, computers tended to be much larger than they are now, and full of huge amounts of empty space, with the CPU taking up basically no space relative to the amount of space in the box and, on top of that, CPUs were actually getting bigger and not smaller as computers were getting smaller. I asked some other people and didn't really get an answer. This was also relatively early on the life of the public web and I wasn't able to find an answer other than something like \"smaller transistors are faster\" or \"smaller = less capacitance\". But why are they faster? And what makes them have less capacitance? Specifically, what about the geometry causes that to scale so that transistors get faster? It's not, in general, obvious that things should get faster if you shrink them, e.g., if you naively linearly shrink a wire, it doesn't appear that it should get faster at all because the cross sectional area is reduced quadratically, increasing resistance per distance quadratically. But length is also reduced linearly, so total resistance is increased linearly. And then capacitance also decreases linearly, so it all cancels out. Anyway, for transistors, it turns out the same kind of straightforward scaling logic shows that they speed up (at back then, transistors were large enough and wire delay was relatively small enough that you got extremely large increases in performance for shrinking transistor). You could explain this to a high school student who's taken physics in a few minutes if you had the right explanation, but I couldn't find an answer to this question until I read a VLSI textbook. There's now enough content on the web that there must be multiple good explanations out there. Just to check, I used non-naive search terms to find some good results. Let's look at what happens when you use the naive search from above, though. Google 1. A knowledge card that reads \"Smaller transistors can do more calculations without overheating, which makes them more power efficient.\", which isn't exactly wrong but also isn't what I'd consider an answer of why. The article is interesting, but is about another topic and doesn't explain why. 2. [Question dropdown], \"Why are transistors getting smaller?\". Site has an immediate ad pop-over on opening. Site doesn't really answer the question, saying \"Since the first integrated circuit was built in the 1950s, silicon transistors have shrunk following Moore’s law, helping pack more of these devices onto microchips to boost their computing power.\" 3. [Question dropdown] \"Why do transistors need to be small?\". Answer is \"The capacitance between two conductors is a function of their physical size: smaller dimensions mean smaller capacitances. And because smaller capacitances mean higher speed as well as lower power, smaller transistors can be run at higher clock frequencies and dissipate less heat while doing so\", which isn't wrong, but the site doesn't explain the scaling that made things faster as transistors got smaller. The page mostly seems concerned about discrete components and note that \"In general, passive components like resistors, capacitors and inductors don’t become much better when you make them smaller: in many ways, they become worse. Miniaturizing these components is therefore done mainly just to be able to squeeze them into a smaller volume, and thereby saving PCB space.\", so it's really answering a different question 4. [Question dropdown], \"Why microchips are getting smaller?\". SEO blogspam that doesn't answer the question other than saying stuff like \"smaller is faster\" 5. [Question dropdown], \"Why are microprocessors getting smaller?\". Link is to stackexchange. The top answer is that yield is better and cost goes down when chips are smaller, which I consider a non-answer, in that it's also extremely expensive to make things smaller, so what explains why the cost reduction is there? And, also, even if the cost didn't go down, companies would still want smaller transistors for performance reasons, so this misses a major reason and arguably the main reason. #2 answer actually sort of explains it, \"The reason for this is that as the transistor gate gets smaller, threshold voltage and gate capacitance (required drive current) gets lower.\", but is both missing parts of the explanation and doesn't provide the nice, intuitive, physical explanation for why this is the case. Other answers are non-answers like \"The CORE reason why CPUs keep getting smaller is simply that, in computing, smaller is more powerful:\". It's possible to get to a real explanation by searching for these terms 6. \"Why are CPU and GPU manufacturers trying to make ...\". Top answer is the non-answer of \"Smaller transistors are faster and use less power. Small is good.\" and since it's quora and I'm not a subscriber, the other answers are obscured by a screen that suggests I start a free trial to \"access this answer and support the author as a Quora+ subscriber\". 7-10. sub-links to other quora answers. Since I'm not a subscriber, by screen real estate, most of the content is ads. None of the content I could read answered the question. Bing 1. Knowledge card with multiple parts. First parts have some mumbo jumbo, but the last part contains a partial answer. If you click on the last part of the answer, it takes you to a stack exchange question that has more detail on the partial answer. There's enough information in the partial answer to do a search and then find a more complete explanation. 2-4. [people also ask] some answers that are sort of related, but don't directly answer the question 5. Stack exchange answer for a different question. 7-10 [explore further] answers to totally unrelated questions, except for 10, which is extremely ad-laden blogspam to a related question that has a bunch of semi-related text with many ads interspersed between the text. Kagi 1. \"Why does it take multiple years to develop smaller transistors for CPUs and GPUs?\", on r/askscience. Some ok comments, but they answer a different question. 2-5. Other reddit links that don't answer the question. Some of them are people asking this question, but the answers are wrong. Some of the links answer different questions and have quite good answers to those questions. 6. Stackexchange question that has incorrect and misleading answers. 7. Stackexchange question, but a different question. 8. Quora question. The answers I can read without being a member don't really answer the question. 9. Quora question. The answers I can read without being a member don't really answer the question. 10. Metafilter question from 2006. The first answers are fundamentally wrong, but one of the later answers links to the wikipedia page on MOSFET. Unfortunately, the link is to the now-removed anchor #MOSFET_scaling. There's still a scaling section which has a poor explanation. There's also a link to the page on Dennard Scaling, which is technically correct but has a very poor explanation. However, someone could search for more information using these terms and get correct information. Marginalia No results Mwmbl A link to a Vox article titled \"Why do artists keep making holiday albums?\". This is the only result. ChatGPT Has non-answers like \"increase performance\". Asking ChatGPT to expand on this, with \"Please explain the increased performance.\" results in more non-answers as well as fairly misleading answers, such as Shorter Interconnects: Smaller transistors result in shorter distances between them. Shorter interconnects lead to lower resistance and capacitance, reducing the time it takes for signals to travel between transistors. Faster signal propagation enhances the overall speed and efficiency of the integrated circuit ... The reduced time it takes for signals to travel between transistors, combined with lower power consumption, allows for higher clock frequencies I could see this seeming plausible to someone with no knowledge of electrical engineering, but this isn't too different from ChatGPT's explanation of gravity, \"... That's why a feather floats down slowly but a rock drops quickly — the Earth is pulling them both, but the rock gets pulled harder because it's heavier.\" vancouver snow forecast winter 2023 Good result: Environment Canada's snow forecast, predicting significantly below normal snow (and above normal temperatures) Google Knowledge card from a local snow removal company, incorrectly stating \"The forecast for the 2023/2024 season suggests that we can expect another winter marked by ample snowfall and temperatures hovering both slightly above and below the freezing mark. Be prepared ahead of time.\". On opening the page, we see that the next sentence is \"Have Alblaster [the name of the company] ready to handle your snow removal and salting. We have a proactive approach to winter weather so that you, your staff and your customers need not concern yourself with the approaching storms.\" and the goal of the link is to get you to buy snow removal services regardless of their necessity by writing a fake forecast.

I admit I use adblock (uBlock Origin) and won&#x27;t even try to disable it.I understand the author&#x27;s point of turning off their ad blocker \"to get the non-expert browsing experience\" but then they could make a different test with uBlock on for every query and see how it goes.It&#x27;s also a bit inconsistent to expect results for downloading videos mentioning yt-dlp while trying to emulate \"the non-expert browsing experience\"... Yt-dlp is a command-line Python utility. Talk about non-expert! Most people don&#x27;t know that videos are files that can be downloaded; of those who do, most don&#x27;t know about the command line or Python.Yet when searching for \"how to download youtube videos\" the first result I get on Google is a link to a service called \"savefrom.net\", which appears to work well and does not seem to be a scam. This would qualify as \"very good\" in my book.When searching for \"how to download youtube videos from the command line\" the first few results are about youtube-dl, including links to github and superuser. Granted they don&#x27;t mention yt-dlp, but youtube-dl is a good start. reply hannasanarion 3 hours agoprevI&#x27;m not able to reproduce the author&#x27;s bad results in Kagi, at all. What I&#x27;m seeing when searching the same terms is fantastic in comparison. I don&#x27;t know what went wrong there.In the Youtube Downloader search, NortonSafeWeb is nowhere to be found. I get a couple of legit downloader websites, and some articles from reputable tech newspapers on how to use them or command line tools.In the Adblock search, ublock Origin is #3, followed by some blogs about ad blocking ethics debates and the bullshit Google has been pulling recently.In the wider tires grip search, #3 is a physics blog that dives deep into the topic.In the transistors search, the first reddit link directly answers the question in very similar wording to the hypothetical correct answer spelled out in the rubric. 4&#x2F;5 of the reddit results are on the correct topic, followed by two SuperUser questinos also on the correct topic, then some linus tech tips and toms hardware articles, also on the correct topic. No Quora questions.In the vancouver winter snow search, the first several results are from local news papers talking about the anticipated effects of el nino on snowfall, and then a couple of high-quality blogs and weather sites.Really wondering how Dan got such bad results.------Aside from that, the way that the author expects all the results to return the same kind of thing is just... weird? Like, that&#x27;s not how search engines are supposed to work. A search that gives you 10 links to fundamentally the same thing is a bad search. Search results should cover a breadth of reasonable guesses for what you should be looking for given a query. If you search for \"download firefox\", and you scroll past the first 5 download links, then you&#x27;re probably not actually looking for a download link and a blog post about firefox is not \"irrelevant\" and shouldn&#x27;t be points against.This opinion is even borne out in search engine quality metrics that have been industry-standard for decades, like mean reciprocal rank and distributed cumulative gain. What matters is how far you have to scroll to get to a good result, not what proportion of the first N results are good. reply Semaphor 1 hour agoparentWhat region? I get similarly bad results with international (and a quick check with region US also didn’t improve things) and uBo at only #5, and ytdl at #12. And I already have github on \"raise\" and a bunch of domains blocked (not many though)For the transistor query, it’s a very \"googly\" way of writing a query, when I saw the results I instantly felt like rewriting it and the first try gave much better results with \"Why keep cpu transistors getting smaller?\". Caveat that the results look better and more topical, I don’t know what a good answer would be, also why I didn’t evaluate the tires or Vancouver weather (I tried a local search for my cities weather, and while the first result was unreleated, the 2nd was okay)edit: This whole thread made me finally create a file for documenting bad searches on Kagi. The issue for me is usually that they drop very important search terms from the query and give me unrelated results. But switching to verbatim or \"forced terms\" also prevents any kind of error correction of the search. This used to be one of my main annoyances with DDG back then, and Kagi did not have that issue during the early days. reply Scaless 2 hours agoparentprevI have a new Kagi account with no custom rankings and I see the same terrible results. Basically the same as what he describes. yt-dlp is not found at all, the 2010 link to youtube-dl, and a bunch of spam sites. reply trb 2 hours agoparentprevSame here, I was curious about Kagis low ranking, and couldn&#x27;t replicate the search results. Also saw ublock Origin on #3, good results for tires, transitors and snow, etc. I&#x27;ve never used any of the Kagi search result weighing features.Ctrl+F on the page for \"System prompt\" doesn&#x27;t show any hits. Given how important those are for ChatGPT (another thought - was the author testing GPT3.5 or 4?) I&#x27;m not sure how much weight to put into the ChatGPT results either.Not sure how much I can take away from this comparison. reply spaceman_2020 2 hours agorootparentI asked GPT-4 about Youtube Downloader and it rambled on about how downloading videos is against Youtube’s TOS and I should buy YouTube premium which has the download feature.Getting any useful data from GPT-4 about anything even remotely “illegal” is a waste of time. reply Huppie 1 hour agorootparentThe author already alludes to the fact that you can probably prompt-engineer around this and indeed, as soon as I added a blurb like \"these are my own videos that I own the copyright to\" it did suggest a bunch of third-party tools and let me ask it about what third-party tools I could use.It suggested &#x27;4K Video Downloader&#x27;, &#x27;YTD Video Downloader&#x27;, &#x27;JDownloader&#x27; and &#x27;Clipgrab&#x27; at first and when I asked for cli tools it came with &#x27;youtube-dl&#x27;, &#x27;yt-dlp&#x27;, and &#x27;ffmpeg&#x27;Those seem pretty reasonable results to me but I&#x27;ll readily admit I don&#x27;t know (yet) if &#x27;most users&#x27; would ask these follow-up questions. reply Semaphor 1 hour agorootparentprevWith a better prompt, you can get it to list some, but it’s very annoying to do so.Mistral showed that their medium model is far better (yet not good), and the same prompt as in the article gives only one instead of 3 paragraphs of rambling about copyright, and then lists 3 categories of options with examples for each (not good, because ytdl is not one of those listed).Funnily enough, both mistral and GPT4 apologize profoundly and almost with the same wording when asked \"Why did you not mention the very popular, free and open source \"youtube-dl\" software?\" and then mention how&#x2F;where to get it and how to use it. reply okasaki 1 hour agorootparentprevWorks fine IMOhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;7dfd22d2-975c-4e6d-ba4b-c6b99e...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;90fae0dc-f8fd-4603-835c-5f3a57... reply alextingle 1 hour agorootparentprevclaude.ai produced pretty reasonable results. reply UberFly 1 hour agorootparentprevSo it has also become one of the glitterati.

I&#x27;ll search the most inane things, like lyrics to a song, and get results for local businesses containing maybe one word in common.It&#x27;s most frustrating with phone numbers. I picked up the habit of searching the random numbers that called me, to try and find out if they were possibly important. I used to get a bunch of spam sites that clearly existed to profit off me making those searches.Both Google and DDG have removed those spam sites, even though they were useful at times. Google will tell me the number is in some random PDF that contains a few of the digits, then no other results. DDG will say the top result is my local police department, something that freaked me out the first few times. reply berkut 5 hours agoparentYeah, I&#x27;ve noticed this as well with DDG recently: even with the localised checkbox disabled it still prioritises them, which often is very frustrating as the results are then almost totally useless.However, more generally, I&#x27;ve personally found that DDG (and maybe Bing&#x27;s then?) localised results are just really bad, and have been for the multiple years I&#x27;ve been using DDG and it&#x27;s had this feature: I&#x27;m in New Zealand, and enabling localised &#x2F; region-based search still often provides results to pages with TLDs like \"co.uk\", \".ca\" and \".pl\" (these latter are really common for content-generated spam in my experience), which I just can&#x27;t understand...Unfortunately, I have found that Google&#x27;s results are usually a lot better in terms of being \"location-aware\" than DDG, at least when that&#x27;s what you want... reply csnover 4 hours agoparentprevMan, thank you for saying this. Stuffing results with geolocated local junk despite explicitly opting out by choosing “All regions” is so frustrating. This wasn’t happening a year or two ago. I submit negative feedback about it constantly, but I guess not enough people are doing that for anyone to notice or care.I’ve also noticed a significant increase in attempts to stuff news into regular search results. I really do not appreciate being force-fed mental health poison.

In those scenarios, close to all ten of the numbers are found on the page.The top result being my local police department because it shares the same area code and has maybe one other number in common is clearly a bad result.

I recommend using a search engine that lets you effectively change which sites are shown. You can do this with Kagi, or with Google&#x27;s Programmable Search Engines - I&#x27;m sure there are more too.In particular I block Youtube, not because they aren&#x27;t sometimes correct, but because I don&#x27;t want videos polluting the regular results - it just takes too long to get info from videos.An ability to upvote results for a given query seems tantalizing but I bet it would be gamed too. The DIY approach seems to be the only tractable one.In my case I only only results from domains I believe are correct. The whitelist approach does have downsides. Usually I&#x27;ll vet new potential domains through social means like Reddit and this site, rather than identifying them through the search results.

So many sites now are just regurgitated SEO farms with minimal quality, and easy to see why: it&#x27;s minimal effort to produce and cheap to host. But making a video takes time and effort, so has a much higher barrier to use as a click farm.More than once when traditional search failed me, I went to YT and found some video from 2009 clearly and eloquently explaining what I&#x27;m looking for in detail, and without any distractions because the person authoring the video clearly didn&#x27;t specialize in the media format or show interest in experimenting.I&#x27;ve found it to also be a better source when looking a product to buy. Want to know which fan to get?

What changed isn&#x27;t that there was some sudden breakthrough in malicious SEO, it&#x27;s that it was more profitable to keep the spammers around than to fight them, and with the entire tech industry settling on advertising&#x2F;\"engagement\" as its business model, the risk of competition was nil because competitors with the same business model would end up making the same decision.The same reason is behind the neutering of advanced search features. These have nothing to do with the supposed war on spam&#x2F;SEO, so why were they removed?

Most search companies do this “at scale” according to very specific guidelines, like what the author did here but on steroids. For example, take a look at Google’s 168-page instruction manual for search quality raters:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;guidelines.raterh...It talks about figuring out a query’s meaning(s), judging the user’s intent (were they looking for some specific answer, etc.), evaluating the “quality” of a website, rating the site’s usefulness in relation to the query’s meaning&#x2F;intent, etc.All this is to say, it’s not that search companies don’t do exactly what the author did here, it’s just that they have different standards than the author.

The majority of my searches are related to IT, programming, software and computers in general, but what does \"normal\" people search for.

There is still some signal left, but it’s such a small fraction that it’s much more difficult to filter it out.Having said that, I’m usually still able to find what I’m looking for, if I know that it likely exists, and know the keywords to use to find it. But it’s much harder nowadays for sure. reply genewitch 5 hours agorootparenti have a radio that can \"hear\" down to -130dBm, i&#x27;ve proven this empirically. Cellular signals work at -12dB or more below the noise floor, wspr works even lower than that. Lightning is broadband noise, and yet i can still use digital stuff when there&#x27;s lightning storms.I don&#x27;t buy the signal to noise argument. For example, whenever i get on youtube and get fed some content, i can immediately tell if it&#x27;s had AI involved anywhere, and thumbs it down. I won&#x27;t recommend it, i&#x27;ve called people out for linking such tripe to me (or others).Hear me out - google got bad about 11 years ago when the dorking stopped being effective, right around the time of the spotlight search results and the sponsored junk taking the top results. Around this time, various agencies (news, etc) started gaming the SEO to respond to any remotely related search with whatever the news was currently. Google chose not to \"fix\" this, because we&#x27;re not the customer. DDG was better for a few years for real results, too, but that has gone downhill as well.The current zeitgeist uses stuff like tiktok and facebook for \"web searches\" - \"food trucks near Austin, TX\" or so. No one really uses web search like people on this site do, and google couldn&#x27;t care less if we don&#x27;t like the search results. reply amlib 5 hours agorootparentprevI wonder how much influence google had in lowering the content quality over the years?

We will publish a full report next week, but it is already clear that what we are finding poses serious challenges for generative AI. The crux of the Times lawsuit is that OpenAI’s chatbots are fully capable of reproducing text nearly verbatim: § The thing is, it is not just text. OpenAI’s image software (which we accessed through Bing) is perfectly capable of verbatim and near-verbatim repetition of sources as well. Dall-E already has one minor safeguard in place – proper names (and hence deliberate infringement attempts) reportedly sometimes get blocked – but those safeguards aren’t fully reliable: And worse, infringement can happen even the user isn’t looking to infringe and doesn’t mention any character or film by name: Dall-E can does the same kind of thing with short prompts like this one, Here, just two words. The show SpongeBob SquarePants is never mentioned: No mention of the film RoboCop Video game characters And a whole universe of potential trademark infringements with this single two-word prompt: § A few minutes ago, a user on X, named Blanket_Man01 discovered essentially the same thing: Blanketman’s Mario experiment: Justine Moore of A16Z earlier today independently noticed the same thing: § The cat is out of the bag: Generative AI systems like DALL-E and ChatGPT have been trained on copyrighted materials; OpenAI, despite its name, has not been transparent about what it has been trained on. Generative AI systems are fully capable of producing materials that infringe on copyright. They do not inform users when they do so. They do not provide any information about the provenance of any of the images they produce. Users may not know when they produce any given image whether they are infringing. § My guess is that none of this can easily be fixed. Systems like DALL-E and ChatGPT are essentially black boxes. GenAI systems don’t give attribution to source materials because at least as constituted now, they can’t. (Some companies are researching how to do this sort of thing, but I am aware of no compelling solution thus far.) Unless and until somebody can invent a new architecture that can reliably track provenance of generative text and/or generative images, infringement – often not at the request of the user — will continue. A good system should give the user a manifest of sources; current systems don’t. In all likelihood, the New York Times lawsuit is just the first of many. On a multiple choice X poll today I asked people whether they thought the case would settle (most did) and what the likely value of such a settlement might be. Most answers were $100 million or more, 20% expected the settlement to be a billion dollars. When you multiply figures like these by the number of film studios, video game companies, other newspapers etc, you are soon talking real money. And OpenAI faces further risks. And because the stuff we reported on above was all done through Bing using Dall-E, Microsoft is on the hook, too. More about all this on January 3, at IEEE Spectrum.

Disney&#x27;s success was partly built on adapting these existing narratives, which were once shared and reshaped by communities over centuries.This conversation shouldn&#x27;t just be about the technicalities of AI or the legalities of copyright; it should be about understanding the deep roots of our shared culture.At its core, culture is a communal property, evolving and growing through collective storytelling and reinterpretation.The current debate around AI and copyright infringement seems to overlook this fundamental aspect of cultural evolution. The algorithms might be new, but the practice of reimagining and repurposing stories is as old as humanity itself.By focusing solely on the legal implications and ignoring the historical context of cultural storytelling, we risk overlooking the essence of what it means to be a creative society.As a large human model, (no really I could probably lose some weight) I think it&#x27;s just silly how we&#x27;re all sort of glossing over the fact that Disney built their house of mouse on existing culture, on existing stories, and now the idea that we might actually limit the tools of cultural expression to comply with some weird outdated copyright thing is just...bonkers. reply jerf 14 hours agoparent\"Who truly owns the tales of Snow White and Cinderella?\"If you want to make your point, you need to choose something that isn&#x27;t already public domain. Disney already only owns their own interpretations, and, arguably, whatever penumbric emanation they can convince a court is stealing from them, but it still certainly isn&#x27;t the entire space of Snow White and Cinderella stories. There is some fairly recent stuff being used in the images in the article and there isn&#x27;t even any question whether or not it&#x27;s Mario or Coca Cola; if Nintendo and Coca Cola did a cross promotion I could believe the exact images that popped out.If they were trying to claim the entire concepts of dumpy plumbers dressed in any manner vaguely like Mario that would be one thing... but that&#x27;s Mario and Luigi, full stop. That&#x27;s Robocop. That&#x27;s C3PO. It&#x27;s not even subtle. If we can AI-wash those trademarks away then we can AI-wash absolutely anything. reply lovecg 14 hours agorootparentI think the world would be completely fine without a copyrighted C3PO or Robocop. George Lucas didn’t have billions of merchandising revenue in mind when working on his wild and thought unlikely to be successful science fiction movie in the 70s. Robocop was also a labor of love. We don’t really need Nth Star Wars sequel powered by those extra profits. The art form could be healthier overall. reply 6gvONxR4sf7o 11 hours agorootparentFine if they weren&#x27;t copyrighted today, or ever? Because if copyright was eliminated the day Star Wars was released, other people would have copied the film reels and charged for entry, and Lucas would have hardly made a cent. Or if copyright was eliminated the day he went looking for funding, it wouldn&#x27;t have ever been made. Personally, I think the world&#x27;s a little richer for star wars&#x27;s existence. reply lovecg 10 hours agorootparentYou make a good point, there’s a difference in copyrighting exact works vs. the characters or the story that the work is made up of. I’m not arguing for removing literal copyright (though the terms should be shorter). But I think it’s fine if other people rushed to make their own Star Wars movies after it came out. Hardcore fans are pretty good at deciding what’s “canon” vs. not anyway, and the rest of us don’t care as long as the work is of good quality. Would it matter if the same Spiderman or Batman movie that’s remade once a decade could be made by literally anyone without paying royalties? It could make for richer content I’d think. reply Nevermark 10 hours agorootparentThe only problem with this view, is:> \"the rest of us don’t care as long as the work is of good quality\"Copyright protects Disney.But it also protects every creative author, no matter how disadvantaged, from mass shareholder driven behemoths.Today \"Disney likes your work\" is ear music.

Disney built an impressive machine where everything feeds on everything else. The problem is not so much bad sequels per se, it’s all the marketing that goes into making sure they solidly occupy their corner of our mindshare and force the whole industry to compete churning out more and more subpar sequels. If one company would build a Star Wars theme park, another produced toys etc. etc. this might not be a huge concern. reply d6e 12 hours agorootparentprevAm I not allowed to draw Mario? I don&#x27;t really see the difference in me drawing mario or an AI drawing mario. reply idopmstuff 11 hours agorootparentThis has always felt like the important-but-ignored distinction to me. You can definitely draw Mario! Copyright doesn&#x27;t protect against you doing so. You can also use tools to recreate copyrighted materials. For example, you can use Word to type out the text of a copyrighted book. Perhaps more relevant to the AI discussion, you can use a scanner and printer to reprint copyrighted text.What you can&#x27;t do is use those recreations for commercials purposes. You can&#x27;t sell your paintings of Mario. You can&#x27;t decorate your business with Mario drawings.That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve always felt like the idea that AI should be blocked from creating these things is generally not the right place to look at copyright. Rather, the issue should be if someone uses AI to create a picture of Mario and then does something commercial with it, you should be able to go after the person engaging in the commercial behavior with the copyrighted image. reply strix_varius 11 hours agorootparent> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve always felt like the idea that AI should be blocked from creating these things is generally not the right place to look at copyright.

It&#x27;s not possible for you as an individual consumer to know whether or not the AI result is a violation, given an AI that has been trained on copyrighted works.2. Before you, the AI consumer, uses the generated result, a company (in this case OpenAI) is already charging for it. I&#x27;m currently paying OpenAI. That AI is currently able and willing to sell me copyrighted images as part of my subscription. Frankly that should be illegal, full stop.I look forward to AI enhanced workflows and I&#x27;m experimenting with them today. But it&#x27;s morally indefensible to enable giant corporate AIs to slurp up copyrighted images&#x2F;code&#x2F;writing and then vomit it back out for profit. reply idopmstuff 9 hours agorootparent> 1. It&#x27;s not possible for you as an individual consumer to know whether or not the AI result is a violation, given an AI that has been trained on copyrighted works.I see what you&#x27;re saying in some cases, but in the cases where the user is explicitly attempting to create images of copyrighted characters (e.g. the Mario example), they would definitely know. I honestly don&#x27;t see this as a practical issue - as far as I&#x27;m aware (and like most on HN I follow these things more than the average person), there aren&#x27;t a lot of concerns about inadvertent generation of copyrighted material. It&#x27;s certainly not at issue in the NYT lawsuit.2. Before you, the AI consumer, uses the generated result, a company (in this case OpenAI) is already charging for it. I&#x27;m currently paying OpenAI. That AI is currently able and willing to sell me copyrighted images as part of my subscription. Frankly that should be illegal, full stop.Totally fair, but I feel like it&#x27;s a bit more of a gray area. If I use Photoshop to create or modify an image of Mario for personal use, we&#x27;d call that fine. I grant you that here OpenAI is doing more of the \"creating\" than in the Photoshop example, but we still do generally allow people to use paid tools to create copyrighted images for personal use.I&#x27;d also pose a question to you - what if OpenAI weren&#x27;t charging? Is it acceptable to train an open source model on copyrighted images and have it produce those for personal use?I guess I just understand the law to revolve more around what the end product is used for, as opposed to whether a paid tool can be used to create that end product. reply contrast 33 minutes agorootparentThe law tends to be weighted towards the consumer, but the law does apply to producers and supply chains, too. Photoshop doesn’t come with a library of copyrighted images, and would not be able to do so without licensing those images (whether they were explicitly labelled or not). Ditto any other tool.If people had to pay for the AI equivalent of that image library (ie the costs of training the model), I doubt many would. It’s phenomenally expensive. Costs for a creative tool and a copy of whatever IP you personally want to play with are negligible by comparison.It’s never been the case before that a toolmaker could ship their tools with copyrighted materials because they’ve no control over the end product. The answer doesn’t change whether they charge or not, and there no reason why AI should change that either.People tend to “feel like it’s a bit more of a gray area” when there is cool free stuff at stake, and I’m no exception. It would be a more convincing question if it was “what if we had to pay our fair share of the costs involved?”, rather than “what if we could just have it all at no charge?”. reply Aeolun 9 hours agorootparentprevOpenAI is not profiting off providing me with the ability to generate copyrighted images, they’re profiting off giving me the ability to generate copyrighted images. reply SergeAx 11 hours agorootparentprevBut... OpenAI is clearly profiting their $20&#x2F;m on drawing Mario pictures and word-by-word reproduction of NYT articles? reply idopmstuff 9 hours agorootparentOn the latter example, my question is whether anyone is actually using ChatGPT to read NYT articles. My understanding is that to produce the examples of word-for-word text in their lawsuit, they had to feed GPT the first half dozen paragraphs of the article and ask it to reproduce the rest. If you can produce the first half dozen paragraphs, you already have access to the article&#x27;s text. Given that, is this theoretical ability to reproduce the text actually causing financial harm? reply SergeAx 7 hours agorootparentI think it would be quite enough to prompt OpenAI with article title and author name.

While we can advocate for reform, reality is, LLM makers will be judged under the current law as it currently is formulated. The novelty will be the LLM and its technologies, not a total rethink of copyright under some noble cultural openness concept.So, it’s not actually a corporate narrative, it’s actually the law that the narrative stems from, right or wrong. Maybe corporations had a huge role in shaping the law (I’d note copyright benefits individuals as well, though), but it is not mere propaganda or shaping of a shared reality through corporate narrative. It’s enforced by the guys with the guns and jails, as arbitrated by a judge.It absolutely must be about the technicalities of the law as it’s at the basis a legal issue. By hand waving it away and claiming the social narrative is the right discussion you ignore the material consequences and reality in favor of a fantasy. We absolutely should -also- discuss the stifling nature of copyright and intellectual property, but you can’t ignore what’s actually happening here at the same time. reply kelseyfrog 9 hours agorootparentWe can do what we will.

People apparently much smarter than the typical software professional realized that meant some badly aligned incentives between (a) those holding these new reproduction capabilities and (b) those who created the works on which the value of those new reproduction capabilities relied. The heart of the copyright bargain is in aligning those incentives.Specific novel reproduction techniques can change the details of what&#x27;s prohibited or restricted or remitted and how and on what basis and powers&#x2F;limits of enforcement, etc etc. But the they don&#x27;t change the wisdom in the bargain. The only thing that would change that is a better way of organizing and rewarding the productive capacity of society. reply 8note 4 hours agorootparentThe incentives remain poorly aligned though. Otherwise the people who actually author the copyrighted works (actors, special effects artists, etc) wouldn&#x27;t have had to go on strike for so long to get proper compensation.The value still remains with the people who own the reproduction capabilities, and only scraps go to the artists.

Then imagine that the Animal Welfare Office declared steam engines to be immoral, and so steam engines were never used in industry, at least not in the Wester World. The Orient would eventually rise as the world&#x27;s only industrial power.In the same way, if we let the copyright industry veto generative AI, it will destroy the Western World.Our students are already at a huge disadvantage compared to Chinese students who get every book ever translated into Chinese for free (except a few immoral works that they would not want to see anyway.)Those who pose an existential threat to our civilization are rent seekers who abuse copyright in the US to go beyond protecting \"science and the useful arts,\" who seek infinite copyright terms, who grab every creative work We The People create and register lying paperwork to ensure they can steal our creative genius to enrich their cabal.If this was only a for-profit scheme, it would not be so bad. Do you remember when they Hollyweird degenerates sued a Christian company that wanted to put our G-rated versions of the movies aimed at children? The Christian company never suggested they not pay for the movies. No matter what the Christian company was willing to pay, they were not allowed to publish child-friendly versions of the movies.

Copyright is a fairly ancient concept that benefits normal people as much as it benefits big corporations. Most book authors, songwriters, and so on aren&#x27;t fat cats, and they would be harmed if we had zero protections for the duplication of their work. They&#x27;d need to depend on state sponsorship or charitable private patronage, both of which are problematic for obvious reasons and limit the range of artistic expression more than the market does.Instead, we came up with a system where you can actually derive fairly steady revenue by creating new works and sharing them with the world. And critically, I think you misinterpret it as calling dibs on shared culture or on stories. Copyright is usually interpreted fairly narrowly, and doesn&#x27;t prevent you from creating inspired works, or retelling the same story in your own words.Generative AI is a problem largely because it destroys these revenue streams for millions of people. Yeah, it will be litigated by wealthy corporations with top-notch lawyers, for self-interested reasons. But if we end up with a framework that maintains financial incentives to artistic expression, it&#x27;s probably a good thing. reply shkkmo 13 hours agorootparentThis is full of so many inaccuracies.> Copyright is a fairly ancient conceptThe idea is fairly old, but it&#x27;s current implementation in law is not nearly that old.> that benefits normal people as much as it benefits big corporationsClearly false if you measure that benefit in monetary terms.> Copyright is usually interpreted fairly narrowly, and doesn&#x27;t prevent you from creating inspired works, or retelling the same story in your own words.Absolutely false.

The restrictions on selling images of Mickey Mouse exist regarless of if they were created with or without AI assistance.> But if we end up with a framework that maintains financial incentives to artistic expression, it&#x27;s probably a good thing.We already have that framework and arguably it is already far more restrictive than it needs to be to maintain incentives for artistic creation. Indeed, these rules now often limit new artistic expression or prevent artists from monetizing their creations.The types of art that are helped the most today by the copyright laws of tosay are the kinds that require large budgets to produce. The types of art that are most hurt are those produced by fans who want to build new things upon the narratives in our shared culture.We need to shorten copyright durations and expand fair use protections and monetization options for derivative works. We don&#x27;t need to make copyright even more powerful than it already is.Edit: If you disagree, I&#x27;d be curious to hear your answer to this question. A character like Harry Potter is so widely known that it is now a ubiquitous part of our culture. To incentive new novels, what is the minimum duration we need to give J K Rowling control of who is allowed to write stories about this cultural touchstone? reply ben_w 13 hours agorootparent> How? The restrictions on selling images of Mickey Mouse exist regarless of if they were created with or without AI assistance.Scale.GenAI automates creation of things that are derived from but strictly aren&#x27;t the same as the original content; as it&#x27;s (currently) not possible to automate the detection of derivative works (which is something copyright is supposed to be about), this means actual humans have to look at each case, and that&#x27;s expensive and time consuming and O(n*m) on n new works that have to be compared against m existing in-copyright works for infringement.I also think copyright is too long, FWIW; but the way most people discuss arts, I think humans can be grouped into \"I just want nice stuff\" and \"I want to show off how cultured I am\", and the latter will never accept GenAI even if it&#x27;s an upload of the brain of their favourite artist, simply because when it becomes easy it loses value. I&#x27;m in camp \"nice stuff\". reply intended 13 hours agorootparentI feel this is true for the internet. I do not find scale being a valid defensive aspect for copyright here.For that matter, Photoshop has made art creation so easy, that we dont need GenAI to be swiming in more copyright infringement than we know what to do with.There is absurd amounts of content being created, no human will ever be able to see it all.Copyright will continue to work - if someone creates a rip off so popular that it becomes an issue for copyright holders, the DMCA and the rest of the tools they forced into the fabric of the net still exist.A few steps furhter down this argument, you get back to deep packet inspection, and the rest of the copyright wars which ended up making life worse. reply ben_w 12 hours agorootparentThe internet is a lesser example, but yes, it is also true for a million fans posting their own fan art.Arm those million fans with GenAI instead of pen and paper and MS Paint, and it gets more extreme.But I disagree WRT Photoshop; that takes much more effort to get anything close to what GenAI can do, and (sans piracy) is too expensive for amateurs. Even the cheaper alternatives take a lot of effort to get passable results that take tens of seconds with GenAI. reply shkkmo 12 hours agorootparent> Arm those million fans with GenAI instead of pen and paper and MS Paint, and it gets more extreme\"More extreme\" is not an explanation of how the change in scale matters here.Indeed, what I would argue is there is no fundamental change in scale. Digital reproduction plus the internet already caused the change in scale. We already had the capacity for anyone to produce fan art and publish it or reproduce existing work and publish that. What has changed is not a question on quantity, but one of quality. Those fan artists now have tools so thay even the lower skilled artists can produce higher quality work.Indeed, this is the real threat to artists from generative AI. Narrowing that skill gap is understandably threatening to those who make money with their artistic skills. I think trying to restrict the development of this technology is a losing battle. I think trying to do so by expanding the powers granted by copyright will exentuate the existing flaws with our modern copyright laws.Instead, I&#x27;d prefer to solve that problem by reducing the strength of copyright. If we make AI generated or derived works un-copyrightable than companies that want to own copyright on their content will have to keep paying people to create it. reply shkkmo 13 hours agorootparentprev> actual humans have to look at each case, and that&#x27;s expensive and time consuming and O(n*m) on n new works that have to be compared against m existing in-copyright works for infringement.That scale already exists. The amount of community generated derivative works already dwarfs the capacity of copyright holders to review each piece. The ease of publishing reproductions already makes endorcement a question of priorizing the larger infringers and ignoring those with no reach.Indeed, prohibitions of training on copyrighted work without a special license seem like they make it harder to develop the sorts of AI can detect derivitave works.As case law makes clear that people running the prompts and picking the output to keep are liable for infrinent then there will be demand for tools to detect derivitave works and either filter or warn the user. reply greenthrow 14 hours agoparentprevThis reply is so incredibly out of touch with reality.

The other two images, being a lot more fan-art-like, are examples where I think it would be an interesting question rather than incredibly obviously too close to Nintendo, although even there \"interesting\" means I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised by an actual lawyer saying either of \"this is obviously fine\" or \"this is obviously trademark infringement regardless of what it was trained on\".Now I&#x27;m wondering if there even are any videogame plumbers besides Marion and Luigi… reply shkkmo 12 hours agorootparentprevMario is a 30 year old culural touchstone that is well known by people who have never played a Nintendo game.I don&#x27;t see why we need to give Nintendo the exclusive right control the use of Mario for the next 65 years.

This could not only solve for the copyright problem, the state may even make it mandatory for publishers to contribute their published writings to the public LLMs. I&#x27;m sure libertarian tech bros have that in mind when they insist on open source development (which then opens another whole can of worms when you consider interpolative knowledge as intellectual nuclear fission, but that&#x27;s another story). reply appplication 6 hours agoprevThere are an alarming number of responses seemingly completely unaware of the core thrust of the article (and NYT lawsuit). ChatGPT was able to reproduce and publish significant portions of NYT articles, completely verbatim for hundred-to-thousand word stretches.It’s not derivative work. We’re way past that. NYT has an exceptionally strong case here and anyone arguing about the merits of copyright is way off the mark. This court case is not going single-handedly to undo copyright. OpenAI has very little going for them other than “this is new, how were we to know it could do this”. So knowing that, the currently trained models are in a very sticky situation.Further, I don’t see NYT settling. The implications are too large, and if they settle with OpenAI, they will have a similar case pop up with every other model. And every other publisher of digital content with have a similarly merited case. This is an inflection point for generative AI, and it’s looking like it will be either much more expensive or much more limited than we originally thought.A side effect of this: I am predicting that we will start to see a rise in “pirate” models.

Disney might not care, they can easily fight you in court if your DALL-E generated comics looks like Mickey Mouse and Nintendo will make sure that your video game about a electrician named Marvin from the Bronx, but who looks a lot like Mario is never going to get featured on Steam. The issue is the smaller artists that might not have the resources to fight AI content in court.There&#x27;s also the issue with using LLMs to \"white-wash\" articles and books. There will be people who will just run articles through ChatGPT and claim that it&#x27;s AI generated content that was in no way stolen from The Barents Observer. The absolute massive volume, lose in revenue and cost to fight this in court could make running an investigating newspaper impossible and leave us without any actual reporting.Not thinking ahead and having a plan for copyrighted material was an oversight by the current AI companies, but they are arrogant and just assumed that it would be a detail and anyway \"disruption\" so screw it. There has been zero consideration to the fact that their product is useless without the previous work of millions of people. My concern is that AI takes over content generation to the point where we actually run out of human generated content to train future AIs on.

But no one can prove that or otherwise to be the case with current technology.I think it&#x27;s just unfixable as far as fixing goes. The \"best\" way is to nuke all GPTs and DALL-Es and bury the technology, and the next best is to mark them all un-copyrightable and un-publishable as a compromise.

You yourself might separately be able to pursue a claim against the guitarist for breech of contract. In the process of that, it might get discovered that you deliberately instructed the guitarist to copy the work, or they copied despite your instructions not to.But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the final work is infringing. It just allows you to pursue damages that could potentially offset any damages you&#x27;re liable for from the infringement.But this also isn&#x27;t exactly the same situation as OpenAI. OpenAI isn&#x27;t an individual creator working on contact for you. Even if their ToS ultimately assigns copyright of output to you, there is a matter of scale involved that I think changes things.

    "originBody": "Amazon's Silent Sacking Posted on December 30, 2023 • 6 minutes • 1187 words This is not financial advice and I am not an expert. Amazon has a stock problem. It’s not only Amazon, but they have more to lose. If you’re a customer, that’s going to be bad for your business too. In 2023 Amazon laid off more than 27,000 people. While that’s a big number it’s a deceptively small percentage for a company with more than 1.6 million employees (1.7%). The vast majority of those layoffs happened in retail where a majority of Amazon’s employees work. When layoffs hit AWS it was mostly areas that were not revenue generating or had lower margins. But publicly laying off 27,000 isn’t good for business–at least not immediately. The low stock at the beginning of the year is before the mass layoffs when operating expenses were high. Then Andy announced return to office (RTO) initiatives , but nothing changed. I was told repeatedly it wouldn’t affect me or the teams I worked with. Then in the summer that changed. The negative press associated with layoffs wasn’t good. But the most effective way to reduce operational expenses was to get rid of all the expensive people. How could they force people to leave without severance packages or en masse? Making them miserable and silently sacking them. So RTO was enforced. And people started leaving in droves. If they weren’t leaving they were looking, or at minimum waiting for their next RSU payout. In my small sphere of people there wasn’t a single person under an L7 that didn’t want out. From what I could gather this mostly came down to compensation. Independent contributors (IC) and managers that are L7 or above generally make $400k-$800k and for that much money they’re willing to put up with some inconveniences. Since Amazon’s pay is roughly 40% stock, they only make that much money so long as the stock stays up. If Amazon keeps lowering their operating costs their earnings go up and stock rises. At the cost of burning out everyone doing the work. Welcome to Day 2 As customers are cutting their own costs, $1 spent on AWS is worth less than it was last year. Every trend line still goes up and to the right, but growth is slowing. Customers aren’t coming to the cloud for VMs and ludicrously expensive network anymore. They want higher levels of abstraction that AWS has historically been terrible at delivering. Couple that with Amazon trailing in AI and the most effective way Amazon can grow is by reducing costs. The biggest cost is people. Many teams at Amazon have been in a hiring freeze for over a year. And now they’re chasing away the people they do have. Amazon has shifted from a leader to a follower. From my perspective it’s not going well. Amazon hasn’t put in the decade of AI research Google has. It doesn’t partner with external companies as good as Microsoft. The high margin services AWS was built on (e.g. network egress) is being given away for free by competitors. Amazon is good at identifying real world problems they’ve faced from running an extremely large online store and logistics. Generative AI hasn’t been a problem Amazon has identified needed to be fixed (or even deeply worked on) until it was costing them business deals. No more pizza teams When I started at Amazon I was impressed that service teams were independent. It was the purest implementation of devops I had never seen before. Especially at Amazon’s scale. Then I realized how expensive it is. There are only a handful of centralized teams at Amazon. Those are almost all tools and compliance teams. Pipelines, SDKs, and security are centralized. All components of a service team are self-contained as part of that team. It turns out that devops is a very expensive org chart. Many of the service teams have lost a lot of institutional knowledge as part of RTO. Teams were lean before 2023, now they’re emaciated. Teams can’t keep innovating when they’re just trying to keep the lights on. They can’t maintain on-call schedules without the ability to take vacation or sick days. The next logical step to reduce costs is to centralize expertise. It’s the reason many large companies have database administration, network engineering, or platform teams. They’ll have to give up on autonomy to reduce duplication. Amazon has never had a platform engineering team or site reliability engineers (SRE). I suspect in 2024 they’ll start to reorg into a more centralized friendly org chart. They won’t call the teams that because those titles come from Google, but they’ll effectively be the same. They’ll centralize to create “better collaboration” but in reality it’ll be because they can’t lower margins enough to keep their earnings calls positive. Outages ahead I suspect there’ll be a major AWS outage in 2024. No amount of multi-region redundancy will protect you. There has already been an increase in large scale events (LSE) throughout Amazon , but AWS is so big most customers don’t notice. This is a direct result of RTO and Amazon’s silent sacking of thousands of people. Amazon isn’t incentivized to publicly share LSEs. Only outages customers notice are worthy of a dashboard update, but even those are quickly swept under the “all greens” dashboard. Amazon is an operationally strong company. Much stronger than any company I’ve worked for before. But those operational practices depend on people. When people are eliminated to raise the stock price bar, operational practices suffer. Amazon won’t fire me On September 1st, 2023 I was told by my skip level manager and VP that my team and an adjacent team were being eliminated. They claimed we all did such good work that they wanted us to remain at Amazon. “We still have a job, just not a role.” I was skeptical of how it was communicated–or rather not communicated–by management and I asked if severance was an option. I was repeatedly told it would be once we’d exhausted other options. They told us our number one priority was to find another job. Every role we found had significant downsides. Lower pay, lower title, RTO, or various other things. It was clear they wanted us to take a different role we could quit later. My management wanted to retain the headcount, but couldn’t do layoffs. October 16th I asked my VP for the severance I was told would be available. He let me know HR wasn’t aware of what he was doing and he would have to get approval. It would take some time. Every week for the next 2 1/2 months I asked for an update on my employment and severance package. I was either ghosted or given a variety of excuses. It’s now December 30th and I’m currently still employed by Amazon. It hasn’t only been happening to my team. This has been happening in multiple areas as Amazon silently sacks people without being required to give them severance or announce layoffs. I’ve heard similar tactics being used at other companies–mostly large companies–and it’ll only continue in 2024 as they make decisions that drive short term profits over all else.

Where will the world-changing, paradigm-disrupting ideas come from? Have we given up on that?Remember game rooms, 20% personal projects, sushi, etc.? Maybe some of that is still there, but it is a product of an attitude of a former time.Now in business and elsewhere there is the tidal wave of a new zeitgeist. Working together; believing in, having compassion for, and doing good for others are all outré, often depicted as humanly impossible and ridiculed. Corporate leaders are humans and are swept along too, perhaps more easily because it flatters and enhances their power (also, SV corporate leaders are perhaps more versed in the power of CPUs than the power of zeitgeist, which requires understanding Shakespeare (et al) not LLMs).The good news in this story is that the corrupt and misguided are easy to compete with, just like then-newer SV companies ran circles around corrupt, miguided incumbants that didn&#x27;t invest in the future. You just need the courage of your convictions. Believe that people can change the world, and (with lots and lots of work and risk) they will. reply losteric 10 hours agoparentMost SDEs have grown up in a severe labor deficit. It&#x27;s so interesting seeing the idealism smack in to reality.1. Those \"employee-appreciations\" were a cost-saving measure to retain talent. 20% time towards projects that benefit the employer vs getting paid 20% more, or free food at an incremental cost of $100&#x2F;mo&#x2F;employee instead of paying $2000&#x2F;mo&#x2F;employee for equivalent comp-based retention.2. We are no longer in a severe labor demand deficit. Quality of life will converge on the American norm - treating employees like disposable cogs, under layers of brutal middle-management politics.3. \"Believe that people can change the world\", or caring for and investing in employees... Can you point to any industry that was sustainably disrupted by a company following such a mindset? The only examples that come to my mind are niche companies that market based on such an ethos, like Patagonia. Of course there are stable European companies, and US union shops, but those aren&#x27;t disruptive. WeWork had that ethos for a little while I guess. reply bornfreddy 10 hours agorootparent> Can you point to any industry that was sustainably disrupted by a company following such a mindset?\"Don&#x27;t do evil\" comes to mind, though the company ethos changed a lot since then. reply SlightlyLeftPad 9 hours agorootparentIt’s interesting to me how important simply having that written down was to both the perception of the company from the outside and the products that it delivered.

Humans are earnest and deceitful, to varying degrees at varying times. We do acheive earnest goods; we have human rights, for example, democracy, and lots of peace (but not enough).

Based on people I know and interact with all the time; based on thousands of years of history, philosophy, stories, religion that embody it and talk about it.Based on our reality: We were born into a world built by it, free and prosperous and safe far beyond any of our ancestors. Generations before us actually built that (and what are we building for the next?). Look what King and Einstein and Keynes (and Friedman) and Steinum and all those people built - none profiting much from it.Do you really doubt that humans have better angels and worse - inside every one of us, and that we have a choice? It&#x27;s hardly a novel idea, though I can see that it&#x27;s outre, it&#x27;s disruptive and outside the pale, in this (uber-reactionary?) moment. Otherwise, who would want to deny that reality? reply MichaelZuo 4 hours agorootparentCan you list a few reasoned out examples of this &#x27;overwhelming evidence&#x27;?From what I understand of modern biology even newborn babies are not entirely blank slates, there&#x27;s some amount of genetic and epigenetic influence so that many &#x27;choices&#x27; are not really up to the individual to decide.And certainly by adulthood, which is the vast majority of passing HN readers, many many permanent life altering choices have occurred.For a real world example, the children and grandchildren of those who suffered severe starvation in the Netherlands during WW2 have noticeably worse characteristics on average, in terms of a shorter lifespan, less healthy, etc.., compared to families that didn&#x27;t undergo that. Even their personalities and behaviours, on average, were affected. reply wolverine876 3 hours agorootparent> From what I understand of modern biology even newborn babies are not entirely blank slates, there&#x27;s some amount of genetic and epigenetic influence so that many &#x27;choices&#x27; are not really up to the individual to decide. ...I think you are taking the influences we all have - emotional, physical, environmental, etc. - to an extreme. It&#x27;s not blank slate or automaton. People still make lots of choices, even if there are drives and other influences one way or the other.

Except for free coffee and tea in the kitchens. That&#x27;s it.I remember back in 2002 (?) when the 2-pizza team idea was introduced. My manager said he would find out how we could expense the pizza. It turns out that the pizza was merely theoretical: the team should be sized so that, if there were pizza, then 2 pizzas would be enough for the team. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that pizza would ever be ordered or expensed. reply spenczar5 10 hours agorootparentTwitch did the free food and snacks thing. When acquired by Amazon, Twitch opened a Seattle office, on a floor of an existing Amazon building.

Both are aimed at increasing the share of time employees spend at the office&#x2F;thinking about work&#x2F;immersed physically and socially in work-based networks. Employees who interpreted these amenities as a spirit of generosity that would just change with the times into a full remote culture were badly mistaken. If anything, it&#x27;s the companies that never put any thought or care into their office environments, teambuilding, etc. who would be most amenable to going remote. reply belter 11 hours agorootparentprevThe managerial way to say it...The company is frugal reply crtified 13 hours agoprevBeing \"managed out\" (as this is sometimes called) of a long term role can be very traumatic. Especially if you-the-employee approach the situation with a natural and genuine desire to fix or heal the situation, in the face of the (unbeknownst to you) deliberate and ongoing undermining coming from management. Which then draws the process out as long as possible - max pain.Sadly, one of the best options is to - as the author is more-or-less doing - resign yourself to cynically playing your side of the game, in order to extract the best possible concessions. While being mindful of the personal cost of protraction.I&#x27;ve been through it, and, again sadly, one of the more lasting regrets was that I showed any legal or financial mercy or restraint at the time - regret for the significant concessions that I had made from of a sense of personal &#x27;decency&#x27;. None whatsoever was shown to me. reply blagie 11 hours agoparentI have never been laid off or fired*. However, for most of my adult life, a layoff would have been traumatic. I have a specialized skillset, and it takes a while to find jobs. In the meantime, I have living expenses. It&#x27;s doubly hard to find a job unemployed. I don&#x27;t want to be in that position.\"Managed out\" would be much more humane, at least to me. If I&#x27;m put in a role I don&#x27;t like, I have time to find another job. Ideally, this would be explicit (\"We don&#x27;t like you, so we&#x27;re giving you the shit work, but if you find a better offer, please take it.\").If you want me out, stick me in a box writing test cases or documentation or something until I leave. Heck, cut my salary by 30%. I&#x27;ll be much more happy than if I suddenly have zero income and no job. It can be good for the company too. If there&#x27;s someone to do the crappy work while they do the job, no one else has to.* I&#x27;ve had one \"it&#x27;s complicated\" as a founder, but that&#x27;s a longer story. It didn&#x27;t involve losing my salary overnight like a layoff or firing, through. reply Aeolun 9 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;ll be much more happy than if I suddenly have zero income and no job.That entirely depends on whether they give you those 3-6 months of severance they’re supposed to give. I’d rather have that money without the need to spend my days killing my motivation by writing pointless docs. reply blagie 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve never had an employer who gave 3-6 months severance.Part of it also depends on your employability.A generalized, fungible skillset makes finding jobs relatively quick. If I were a SWE in SFO, I&#x27;d take the severance.For me, good jobs come up once every 1-2 years. When they do, they&#x27;re AWESOME, but if I were ever laid off, I could expect to either:- Have no income for a long time;- Take a job which made me miserable; or- Perhaps do consulting or a startupI have a very non-fungible skill set. That means there are very rarely people who want to hire me in an appropriate role, but when they come up, they&#x27;re often very desperate to hire me. reply sangnoir 8 hours agorootparentprev> If I&#x27;m put in a role I don&#x27;t like, I have time to find another job.

If it&#x27;s financial anxiety, then severance is the best of both worlds: ex-employee gets paid and time to find a new job reply entropi 8 hours agorootparentI am not the original commenter, but the way I see it, this is mainly about two things;1) Your lack of any sort of leverage. This means the potential employers will try to take advantage of your situation, and it will take some time to find an employer who does not.2) Prejudice against those who were laid-off. reply rsanek 8 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t mean to come off as aggressive but shouldn&#x27;t you have enough savings not to care about this? Generally specialized skillsets mean high enough pay to have a significant portion that is discretionary savings &#x2F; spending. I&#x27;ve tried to use at least a portion of mine to create a freedom fund (often called \"fuck you money\") that has enough to cover our expenses for at least a year. reply kjellsbells 8 hours agorootparentNot necessarily, you could have specialist skills in a market that is unfashionable, and consequently doesn&#x27;t pay well.

As if the people who are working in those divisions can&#x27;t adapt to something new that the company wants to grow into. The blog post even mentions that Amazon is lagging in AI, and so the smart move would be to move the people involved into the company&#x27;s AI efforts.I find it very hard to believe that profits are so slim at Amazon that they simply cannot afford to migrate existing employees to something new with growth potential. Where I work, an admittedly very small company by comparison, there is an active effort to hire people that want to stick around for the long-haul. Sure there have been several missteps in product divisions, but as long as the employees involved are at least somewhat competent then there will always be a place for them to work on something. The benefit to doing this is that it creates a culture where everybody working there legitimately wants the company to succeed, and they&#x27;re not thinking about it as merely a step in their own career path. reply alephnerd 13 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve been on the other side of these decisions.It&#x27;s not the fault of the individual engineers, but there just aren&#x27;t enough positions to fill.Leadership is accountable to shareholders, the board, and other stakeholders to ensure financial viability.It sucks, but it is what it is. reply bradleyjg 12 hours agorootparentWhich tech CEOs were fired for making the wrong call and overhiring?I don’t mind eye popping executive pay for exceptional performance, I mind that those positions have zero accountability. reply spdy 11 hours agorootparentBecause they don&#x27;t decide this on their own.

So when you switch speciality, value creation is going to take a hit. Some skills carry across directly, others take months&#x2F;years to acquire.This is why companies can simultaneously be hiring teams and firing teams at the same time.If the team is doing something critical for the business strategy, they need to be on-point straight off the bat. That normally is achieved by buying start-ups or doing deep partnerships. (MSFT + OpenAI comes to mind). reply applecrazy 12 hours agorootparentprevminor nit: there are no dedicated SREs at amazon. but your point stands otherwise reply dougweltman 12 hours agoprevVery few people are needed to run the technology elements of these businesses (let’s exclude warehouse&#x2F;logistics in Amazons case). So why is there an order of magnitude more staff than what’s needed to run those?There’s this idea that tech companies are laying off folks to boost their stock prices by cutting operating expenses. This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of investors think about these types of companies and what determines their worth.Unlike other kinds of businesses, these companies face very little pressure to control costs. They can overhire, and do. They can overpay employees, and do.

It’s because they want to get people out of there who don’t belong there, and because return to office in their minds is a good way to make the org more productive over the long term.These companies are trying to get a culture they perceive as being a little over staffed, too bureaucratic, maybe lacking in focus, to turn around.Fixing that has a much bigger impact on long term shareholder value creation — it’s the exact same rationale as overpaying staff, over staffing and spending generously on wacky new bets.

There is no \"system\". Individual companies don&#x27;t hesitate to lay off employees if that improves profits. While a few worthless employees can slip through the cracks at large companies, there is zero chance that employers continue paying large numbers of employees to do unnecessary jobs. Boards have no loyalty to abstract concepts like capitalism. reply _heimdall 7 hours agorootparentWith so many companies having layoffs in the last 12 months, were those all unnecessary jobs? If not, were revenue targets or company valuations lowered to match the loss of productivity with fewer necessary positions in the company?Companies will absolutely continue paying large numbers of employees to do unnecessary jobs, they&#x27;re incentivized to do so. A growing company is often seen as a good sign by shareholders and no one can really tell whether the new roles are any more or less productive. Existing employees and managers have the benefit of growing teams and getting promoted before anyone sees if the teams over-hired. Holding expendable positions also has the benefit of making for an easy layoff when investors get spooked.Meaning the company and employees have good reason to hire and keep unnecessary jobs, don&#x27;t have many short-term downsides as long as it doesn&#x27;t directly cause a drop in key metrics, and have a built-in backup plan when things turn south and they can show good leadership by trimming the fat. reply medvezhenok 10 hours agorootparentprevMore jobs can always be invented&#x2F;created in the name of safety.

Often there is not. Management gets PIP targets and someone has to get PIPed. It can be you for political reasons above your head that you are oblivious to.- You are subtlely being setup to fail, and even if you don&#x27;t explicitly fail, finding a reason to frame your performance as deficient is always possible.- There is always something you could have done better, and nothing ever goes 100% perfectly. Those things will be magnified 100x. Are they being over magnified? Or were you delusional to minimize them?- To be on the receiving end of this is totally disorienting. It&#x27;s basically gas lighting. Suddenly everything you do is somehow deficient in some way, even when you thought you were doing well. How could you have not realized this? Is this proof you can&#x27;t trust your own judgment? That you&#x27;re incompetent?- Your paper trails are useless. You can always be criticized for subjective reasons, like your style of communication, some 20&#x2F;20 hindsight way you arguably could have done things even better, you&#x27;re \"not showing enough leadership\", yes you&#x27;re doing your core job but at your level we also expect XYZ, etc.- This can go on for months, working 60-80 hour weeks, on little sleep, with constant stress. You start to question your ability to assess reality. What else are you missing if you didnt realize you were screwing up so badly? Are you doing this outside of work too?- You think, wait, this has never happened to me before, but maybe it was just luck until now. Was imposter syndrome not a syndrome this whole time? Was I actually an imposter and this is what it feels like to be found out?At the end of this gas lighting psychological manipulation marathon, you have a hard time knowing up from down and you&#x27;re fired.Who do you talk to about this to get your bearings back? You are ashamed this happened, and yet you&#x27;re also not because bullshit PIPing is famous. It&#x27;s not your fault. Or is it? Anyway you probably should find a way to process this right? Or maybe it&#x27;s best to shove it deep into your subconscious and move on.Isn&#x27;t this what therapists are for? Sure, go explain that your mind is vaguely screwed up from getting fired from a $300k&#x2F;year job for...reasons? Did you screw up? Well no, but technically yes, but in reality no? Maybe? How the hell do you even articulate this without sounding like an incoherent spoiled brat? reply lulznews 11 hours agoprevDude your VP rocks. Amazon sucks, RTO sucks, but none of that bad stuff will happen. The machine will keep chugging, and no one cares. reply paxys 13 hours agoprev [–] It&#x27;s funny to see new waves of Amazon developers discover year after year after year that they work in a shit engineering culture. No, nothing has changed in the last month or last quarter. The company was always like thus. If you are feeling the heat now it just means that your org is the latest to find itself in the line of fire.And no, the company won&#x27;t cease to exist after you and your colleagues are fired or forced to quit - a new group of fresh faced recruits will take your place and the cycle will continue. There is a reason the company has among the lowest average tenures in tech. This is simply its normal operation. reply ajkjk 12 hours agoparentIt is true now, and has always been true, that parts of the company are healthy places to work and parts are not. Despite the &#x27;all bad&#x27; narrative you see around here. Not to defend Amazon, I mean, they ought to just get it to all be good and of course they won&#x27;t. But it&#x27;s annoying having to argue about this all the time instead of everyone just understanding that it&#x27;s a mixed bag and which org you end up in counts for everything. reply arrakeenrevived 12 hours agorootparentMaybe this is true for many parts of Amazon culture, but the big factor recently is that the RTO mandate is company-wide. With very few exceptions, it doesn&#x27;t matter what org you&#x27;re in, RTO affects you, and can have a drastic change on the entire company&#x27;s culture. reply snotrockets 12 hours agorootparentprevEvery big enough company, is, for those not on the c-suite, a collection of 1000s of different companies with a single HR department. reply pas 12 hours agorootparentprev> which org you end up in counts for everythingmaybe... then maybe it&#x27;s time to name those orgs instead of just weaving their legendarium web... reply gdiamos 12 hours agorootparentprevIt’s great to win, until you lose. reply reducesuffering 11 hours agorootparentprevAnd it&#x27;s also annoying to argue that \"it&#x27;s a mixed bag\" is not an excuse for Amazon being in general or on average a huge step worse in terms of work life balance and pleasantness.

Amazon was always brutal, but two-pizza team six-pager culture was a great place to rule in hell as opposed to serving in Heaven as a generalist at Google. Two-pizza team six-pager culture died sometime during the last decade. At a guess, when they imported so many AI academics and they brought all the toxic worst practices of academia to bear on it.The Applied Scientist title at Amazon is the single worst thing they ever created: 15% higher comp and stock if any L10 or up decides you are one, a 100% political position that set everyone against each other just like separating the bonus for the success of Google+ from the rest of Google did in 2011 (was there for that idiocy myself). reply mjr00 12 hours agorootparentprevLooking at the author&#x27;s resume, they&#x27;ve only been at AWS since 2020. It&#x27;s unlikely they have a very good understanding of how the culture has changed over time. reply JustinGarrison 3 hours agorootparentIt’s true, I’ve only been here since COVID and from what I understand 2020-2021 were exceptionally good years. Lots of growth, fully remote, and plenty of new people and ideas. reply fnordpiglet 12 hours agorootparentprevWell, another option is it’s true and it’s monotonically getting worse.

And i strongly believe everyone at BigCo underwent a step-change in 2023.I do give the VP in TFA some credit for trying to give shelter and time. Google went rancid, you&#x27;d go to work one morning, get an unannounced event on your calendar, and be informed as a group you were locked out of everything except the internal job posting site and had 8 weeks to find a job. Meanwhile everyone had negative headcount. I&#x27;ve heard at least two dozen stories like that personally.Another effect is best communicated by a quote: \"there&#x27;s a fuck you got mine attitude.\" The internal peer support group i was a location lead for was overwhelmed by people with just bonkers stories of aggression and antisocial behavior from middle management punching down. I heard so many stories that wouldn&#x27;t have gone down at even the strangest and most inexperienced startups I worked at. (Hiring friends with 0 experience, outright lying, pushing out people)The bullwhip effect of management not really needing to learn to capital-M manage and now being asked to really exposed a lot of issues. Breaks my heart. (I left because of this) reply LargeTomato 11 hours agorootparentMany managers don&#x27;t know how to handle firings&#x2F;layoffs and there&#x27;s little incentive to because you&#x27;re gone after the event anyway. reply vinnymac 13 hours agoparentprevI had a professor who worked on security at Amazon 12 years ago. He would always go on and on about how terrible his job was there, and how much better it was being a teacher and getting to see the sun.Looked him up on LinkedIn 6 years later, and he was back at Amazon. reply hef19898 13 hours agorootparentOh, Amazon absolutely is cut throat and ruthless. But always within the law, never caught cheating. And it moves incredible fast at incredible scale, so you learn more in a year there than you do in 5 elsewhere.Some people are repulsed by that, others drawn to it and some thrive under these conditions. Heck, I really enjoy my life and job after Amazon. And still I miss the speed, the fast feedback on decisions and actions, the laser focused pursuit of a common goal, ruthlessly focused on efficiency, risk and details. Thought about going back there myself, lucky I didn&#x27;t. Propably wouod have been equally lucky if I did.Amazon is a peculiar place. reply milkshakes 12 hours agorootparentamazon seems to be the place where the worst leaders i&#x27;ve experienced who have been forced out of the organizations i&#x27;ve been a part of all inevitably wind up. based on this, i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;d ever like to work there. reply hef19898 12 hours agorootparentUsually, people quality follows a normally distributed curve at any place I worked that had enougj peoole in each grouo to make it mathematically work. Amazon transfromed tgat, IMHO, into a bathtub curve, really great (and ruthless, driven, qualified) folks at the top end, then nothing, finally those only checking one of the above mentioned boxes and offsetting the others with excelling at politics. S I said, a peculiar place.Something else I learned the very hard way: what constitutes a good or bad leader, or employee, is nost of the time highly subjective.That being said, realizing Amazon is not a place for you before joining is the best thing you can do. I have seen my fair share of people that realized after being hired, and for them the place was hell. Careerwise, and I explicity talk about white collar folks, Amazon had no negative impact on them. But going through personell hell 50+ hours a week for months until ypu found something else or you are let go during probation is torture. I know, I had the same thing after Amazon once, it sucks and drains you dry. reply milkshakes 9 hours agorootparent> what constitutes a good or bad leader, or employee, is nost of the time highly subjective.for myself, and the organizations i worked for, it was about results. these leaders swooped in from other prestigeous organizations, introduced toxic politics to completely disrupt existing cultures and working processes, and in the end, for all that drama, they never delivered reply Zanfa 1 hour agorootparentprevThe worst manager I’ve ever worked with had an Amazon background. Still remember how he was hyped up before starting as an amazing senior engineering manager that’s gonna bring some grown up experience (him being in his 40s, most of the team 20s&#x2F;30s) to the team.The pettiness, backstabbing, political games and kingdom building that ensued was a nightmare. I don’t think the team recovered even after he was eventually fired about a year later.It’s hard to consider hiring any manager coming from Amazon after that disaster. reply throwaway8877 13 hours agorootparentprevDoesn&#x27;t mean he wants to be there. Sometimes life is not fair. reply ambicapter 13 hours agorootparentYes the job sucks, but they pay me so much! Life is not fair. reply laidoffamazon 13 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience professors are very good candidates for top tech companies - many have management experience, many have taught algorithms at one point or are good at them already. I doubt this professor didn’t have a choice. reply shermantanktop 12 hours agorootparentMy experience (at a BigCo) has been the opposite. The below applies to about 60% of them; the other 40% are good or great.Our academic gets tired of terrible wages and thinks “I’ll do a tour of duty at a tech company and pay off my mortgage.” They arrive and freak out because the incentives are totally different. They spend their days trying to replicate the vibe of graduate seminars or R&D projects (e.g. “hey everyone, let’s explore type systems!”), but the working developers around them are not buying it. They rant and rave about how they can’t get approval to publish this or that IP. Oh, and it turns out their coding skills are below that of the incoming junior engineers who they used to teach.Ultimately they fail to make any impact, so their project is cancelled — an indignity which they would never experience at uni. So they leave, but during that 1-2 year adventure they have been paid 10x they would have made at a university.And now they can return to academia having paid off some debts and with a shiny entry on their resume that says they have Real World experience at a BigCo.Again, that’s not everyone, and I sort of rolled all the bad problems into one scenario. But I have seen it many times - just last month I watched a team of academics get torn down due to this type of square-peg-round-hole mismatch. reply laidoffamazon 12 hours agorootparentThis sounds like a Google experience - not something that happens at Amazon. Which is perhaps why OPs professor joined Amazon again after complaining. reply shermantanktop 11 hours agorootparentI worked at Amazon too, and this scenario has happened there as well. reply khazhoux 12 hours agorootparentprevYikes, I’ve had the opposite experience, uniformly. Professors join to great acclaim, and everyone then slowly learns (again for the Nth time) that “managing” students, writing grant proposals, and running research projects, has very little carryover to managing a team of engineers inside a large complex project. reply laidoffamazon 12 hours agorootparentOk, but that doesn’t change the fact that",

File searching is generally slow when a file system on a drive is not cached in memory, i.e. when most files are \"cold\". Indexing accelerates recursive searching by performing a quick check on precomputed indexes to only search those files that may match. Indexed-based search with ugrep is safe and never skips new or updated files that may now match. If any files and directories are added or changed after indexing, then ugrep will search these additions and changes made to the file system by comparing file and directory time stamps to the indexing time stamp. When many files were added or changed, then you may want to re-index to bring the indexes up to date. Re-indexing is incremental, it will not take as much time as the initial indexing process. Please note that indexing is effective for large file systems on slower storage media or when searching many zip and tarball archives. Indexing won't speed up regular file searching on fast nVME SSDs, for example. ugrep-indexer -Iz -v recursively (re-)index the working directory tree, ignore binary files (option -I), index archives and compressed files (option -z), showing verbose output (option -v) ugrep-indexer -Iz -v PATH same as above, but (re-)index the specified directory tree PATH ugrep-indexer -f -0 -Iz -v PATH force full re-indexing with lowest index match accuracy to minimize index files (option -0 for zero, default is -5 for five) ugrep-indexer -c PATH check the directory tree PATH indexes, the default is to check the working directory tree ugrep-indexer -d PATH delete the hidden index files from the directory tree PATH, the default is to delete index files from the working directory tree ug --index -Iz OPTIONS PATTERN perform an index-based recursive search, ignore binary files (option -I), also search archives and compressed files (option -z) ug --index -r -Iz OPTIONS PATTERN PATH same as above, but perform an index-based recursive search on the specified directory tree PATH ug --index OPTIONS PATTERN FILE search FILE, but not using an index (only recursive searching is accelerated) ugrep-indexer option -v reports progress; to create a log, redirect ugrep-indexer output to a log file ugrep-indexer option -S follows symlinks to files, never follows symlinks to directories ugrep-indexer option --ignore-files obeys gitignore files ugrep-indexer options -z --zmax=2 index nested archives and tarballs ug option --index works with all other search options, except for options -P, -Z, -v and --filter ug option --stats reports index-based search details, including false positives; false positives are reduced with higher indexing accuracy and/or by using more specific search patterns Bugs If you found a bug or an issue, then please report it at https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep/issues License Ugrep is open source BSD-3 licensed: Permissions ✔ commercial use ✔ modification ✔ distribution ✔ private use Limitations ❌ liability ❌ warranty Conditions ⓘ include license ⓘ copyright notice Ugrep is written by Robert A. van Engelen, Copyright (c) 2023 Robert A. van Engelen, Genivia Inc.

But greps are line oriented, and that means there are optimizations that can be done that are hard to do in a general regex library. You can read more about that here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.burntsushi.net&#x2F;ripgrep&#x2F;#anatomy-of-a-grep (greps are more than simple CLI wrappers around a regex engine).If you read my commentary in the ripgrep discussion above, you&#x27;ll note that it isn&#x27;t just about the benchmarks themselves being accurate, but the model they represent. Nevertheless, I linked the hypergrep benchmarks not because of Hyperscan, but because they were done by someone who isn&#x27;t the author of either ripgrep or ugrep.As for regex benchmarks, you&#x27;ll want to check out rebar: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;rebarYou can see my full thoughts around benchmark design and philosophy if you read the rebar documentation. Be warned though, you&#x27;ll need some time.There is a fork of ripgrep with Hyperscan support: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sr.ht&#x2F;~pierrenn&#x2F;ripgrep&#x2F;Hyperscan also has some preculiarities on how it reports matches. You won&#x27;t notice it in basic usage, but it will appear when using something like the -o&#x2F;--only-matching flag. For example, Hyperscan will report matches of a, b and c for the regex \\w+, where as a normal grep will just report a match of abc. (And this makes sense given the design and motivation for Hyperscan.) Hypergrep goes to some pain to paper over this, but IIRC the logic is not fully correct.

I wrote a 8 line script a few weeks ago to do this, that I will gladly throw away.

It’s VERY fast and has built-in option to search archives within archives recursively. reply Levitating 10 hours agoparentprevIs it that different from using fzf?I currently use ripgrep-all (which can search into anything, video captions or pdfs) and fzf. reply ww520 11 hours agoprevJust tried it out.

One has obscure feature X other has obscure feature Y, one is a bit faster on A, other is a bit faster on B, the defaults are a bit different, and one is written in Rust, the other in C++.Pick the one you like, or both. I have both on my machine, and tend to use the one that does what I want with the least options. I also use GNU grep when I don&#x27;t need the speed or features of either ug and rg. reply tredre3 11 hours agoparentprevOne thing I never liked about ripgrep is that it doesn&#x27;t have a pager. Yes, it can be configured to use the system-wide ones, but it&#x27;s an extra step (and every time I have to google how to preserve colors) and on Windows you&#x27;re SOL unless you install gnu utils or something. The author always refused to fix that.Ugrep not only has a pager built in, but it also allows searching the results which is super nice! And that feature works on all supported platforms! reply bornfreddy 11 hours agorootparentInteresting - for me a built-in pager is an antifeature. I don&#x27;t want to figure out how to leave the utility. Worst of all, pager usually means that sometimes you get more pages and you need to press q to exit, and sometimes not. Annoying. I often type yhe next command right away and the pager means I get stuck, or worse, pager starts doing something in response to my keys (looking at you, `git log`).Then again I&#x27;m on Linux and can always pipe to less if I need to. I&#x27;m also not the target audience for ugrep because I&#x27;ve never noticed that grep would be slow. :shrug: reply amethyst 9 hours agorootparentYou might appreciate setting `PAGER=cat` in your environment. ;)Git obeys that value, and I would hope that most other UNIXy terminal apps do too. reply bornfreddy 1 hour agorootparentOh, wow, thank you! I must try this. reply VTimofeenko 9 hours agorootparentprevSome terminal emulators (kitty for sure) support \"open last command output in pager\". Works great with a pager that can understand ANSI colors - less fussing around with variables and flags to preserve colors in the pager reply burntsushi 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is what I do personally: $ cat ~&#x2F;bin&#x2F;rgp #!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh exec rg -p \"$@\"less -RFXShould work just fine. For Windows, you can install `bat` to use a pager if you don&#x27;t otherwise have one. You don&#x27;t need GNU utils to have a pager. reply anjanb 7 hours agorootparenthi @burntsushi, fan of your tool. like it&#x27;s speed and defaults. I use windows : didn&#x27;t understand what you mean by \"install `bat`\" to use a pager.I use cygwin and WSL for my unix needs. I have more and less in cygwin for use in windows. reply burntsushi 7 hours agorootparentI referenced bat because I&#x27;ve found that suggesting cygwin sometimes provokes a negative reaction. The GP also mentioned needing to install GNU tooling as if it were a negative.bat is fancy pager written in Rust. It&#x27;s on GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sharkdp&#x2F;bat reply ilyagr 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t believe bat is a paper; it&#x27;s more of a pretty-printer that tends to call less.Two pallets that should work on Windows are https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;walles&#x2F;moar (golang) and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;markbt&#x2F;streampager (Rust). There might also be a newer one that uses rust, I&#x27;m unsure. reply anjanb 5 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sure you know but windows command prompt always came with its inbuilt pager -- more. So, you could always do \"dirmore\" or \"rg -p \"%*\"more \". (more is good with colors without flags) reply burntsushi 5 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t! I&#x27;m not a Windows user. Colors are half the battle, so that&#x27;s good. Will it only appear if paging is actually needed? That&#x27;s what the flags to `less` do in my wrapper script above. They are rather critical for this use case. replyMrDrMcCoy 7 hours agoparentprevFor me, it&#x27;s a lot easier to compile a static binary of a C++ app than a Rust one. Never got that to work.

Not me, but they exist. reply derriz 12 hours agorootparentI find myself returning to grep from my default of rg because I&#x27;m just too lazy to learn a new regex language. Stuff like word boundaries \"\\\" or multiple patterns \"\\(one\\|two\\)\". reply masklinn 11 hours agorootparentThat seems like the weirdest take ever: ripgrep uses pretty standard PCRE patterns, which are a lot more common than posix’s bre monstrosity.To me the regex langage is very much a reason to not use grep. reply derriz 11 hours agorootparentA bit hyperbolic, no?If you consider it \"the weirdest ever\", I&#x27;m guessing that I&#x27;m probably older than you. I&#x27;ve certainly been using regex long before PCRE became common.As a vim user I compose 10s if not 100s of regexes a day. It does not use PCRE. Nor does sed, a tool I&#x27;ve been using for decades. Do you also recommend not using these? reply comex 10 hours agorootparentI use all of those tools but the inconsistency drives me crazy as it&#x27;s hard to remember which syntax to use where. Here&#x27;s how to match the end of a word:ripgrep, Python, JavaScript, and practically every other non-C language: \\bvim: \\>BSD sed: [[:>:]]GNU sed, GNU grep: \\> or \\bBSD grep: \\>, \\b, or [[:>:]]less: depends on the OS it&#x27;s running on reply burntsushi 10 hours agorootparentDid you know that not all of those use the same definition of what a \"word\" character is? Regex engines differ on the inclusion of things like \\p{Join_Control}, \\p{Mark} and \\p{Connector_Puncuation}. Although in the case of \\p{Connector_Punctuation}, regex engines will usually at least include underscore. See: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;rebar&#x2F;blob&#x2F;f9a4f5c9efda069e798...And then there&#x27;s \\p{Letter}. It can be spelled in a lot of ways: \\pL, \\p{L}, \\p{Letter}, \\p{gc=Letter}, \\p{gc:Letter}, \\p{LeTtEr}. All equivalent. Very few regex engines support all of them. Several support \\p{L} but not \\pL.

So if you know grep -E, most of that will transfer over.Also, \\ are in ripgrep 14. Although you usually just want to use the -w&#x2F;--word-regexp flag. reply xoranth 11 hours agorootparent> Also, \\ are in ripgrep 14Isn&#x27;t that inconsistent with the way Perl&#x27;s regex syntax was designed? In Perl&#x27;s syntax an escaped non-ASCII character is always a literal [^1], and that is guaranteed not to change.That&#x27;s nice for beginners because it saves you from having to memorize all the metacharacters. If you are in doubt you on whether something has a special meaning, you just escape it.[^1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perldoc.perl.org&#x2F;perlrebackslash#The-backslash reply burntsushi 10 hours agorootparentYes, it&#x27;s inconsistent with Perl. But there are many things in ripgrep&#x27;s default regex engine that are inconsistent with Perl, including the fact that all patterns are guaranteed to finish a search in linear time with respect to the haystack. (So no look-around or back-references are supported.) It is a non-goal of ripgrep to be consistent with Perl. Thankfully, if you want that, then you can get pretty close by passing the -P&#x2F;--pcre2 flag.With that said, I do like Perl&#x27;s philosophy here. And it was my philosophy too up until recently. I decided to make an exception for \\ given their prevalence.It was also only relatively recently that I made it possible for superfluous escapes to exist. Prior to ripgrep 14, unrecognized escapes were forbidden: $ echo &#x27;@&#x27;rg-13.0.0 &#x27;\\@&#x27; regex parse error: \\@ ^^ error: unrecognized escape sequence $ echo &#x27;@&#x27;rg &#x27;\\@&#x27; @I had done it this way to make it possible to add new escape sequences in a semver compatible release. But in reality, if I were to ever add new escape sequences, it use one of the ascii alpha-numeric characters, as Perl does. So I decided it was okay to forever and always give up the ability to make, e.g., `\\@` mean something other than just matching a literal `@`.`\\` are forever and always the lone exceptions to this. It is perhaps a trap for beginners, but there are many traps in regexes, and this seemed worth it.Note that `\\b{start}` and `\\b{end}` also exist and are aliases for `\\`. The more niche `\\b{start-half}` and `\\b{end-half}` also exist, and those are what are used to implement the -w&#x2F;--word-regexp flag. (Their semantics match GNU grep&#x27;s -w&#x2F;--word-regexp.) For example, `\\b-2\\b` will not match in `foo -2 bar` since `-` is not a word character and `\\b` demands `\\w` on one side and `\\W` on the other. However, `rg -w -e -2` will match `-2` in `foo -2 bar`: $ echo &#x27;foo -2 bar&#x27;rg -w -e &#x27;\\b-2\\b&#x27; $ echo &#x27;foo -2 bar&#x27;rg -w -e -2 foo -2 bar reply xoranth 10 hours agorootparentOk, makes sense.

You need to maintain a close attention level to know which things are POSIX. And in the case of GNU grep, you actually need to set POSIXLY_CORRECT=1. Otherwise its behavior is not a subset.POSIX also forbids greps from searching UTF-16 because it mandates that certain characters always use a single byte. ripgrep, for example, doesn&#x27;t have this constraint and thus can transparently search UTF-16 correctly via BOM sniffing. reply Sparkyte 9 hours agoprevCool, but in a real life scenario where the system is not able to pull from external packages because it is in a secured environment makes myself think this is moot as you&#x27;ll be out of practice of actually running grep.

    "originLink": "https://nick.scialli.me/blog/why-im-skeptical-of-low-code/",
    "originBody": "Why I'm skeptical of low-code 30 December 2023 Low-Code I’m skeptical of low-code. When I was doing some software consulting, I would get clients who had been drawn to low-code all the time for the promise of fast development time and low maintenance cost. The client ended up not being happy for one of a few reasons: They wanted truly custom functionality that the low-code solution could not handle. A lot of low-code solutions seem to hit about 80% of a company’s requirement. But then there’s 20% the tool cannot do out of the box. Low-code tool marketers are pretty good at convincing executives that the tool can knock out the remaining 20% with ease (usually just by saying \"the tool can knock out the remaining 20% with ease\"). The reality ends up being that the remaining 20% requires significant and potentially-impossible customization. Companies are then forced to choose: is the tool’s out-of-the-box functionality close enough, or are we going to try to hack the tool up to make it fit our exact use case? They implemented a bunch of custom functionality in a product-specific or even proprietary language and now their pool of potential developer talent is tiny. Often, companies will opt to try to hack a low-code tool up to match 100% of its requirements. What they end up with is a bunch of custom code in a bespoke language that a very small number of people understand. Now, rather than being to recruit from a large pool of ubiquitous, open-source language developers, the company has to find maintainers who are very specialized in this tool. Upgrades to the low-code platform would break their custom implementation. Upgrading software without breaking things that interface with it is hard. Low-code tools have to do this with arbitrary code accomplishing use cases for which the low-code tool was never designed. This should be doable by having a strict API contract, but in practice I have seen a lot of tools that just kind of let the custom code do all sorts of shenanigans under the hood. The underlying database structure was an absolute mess, especially after a bunch of incremental modifications. I have seen companies use low-code tools for processes where precise analytics of the underlying data is critical. But then, when viewing the underlying data model, come to find that it’s inscrutable: what does user_attribute_47 mean? I moved a field from page 1 to page 2 of the application and now the data are in separate fields? This is not a \"low-code bad\" article but rather a recommendation to treat these tools with a healthy amount of skepticism. Anecdotally I have heard they can work great for the right use cases, but empirically I have found them to have a lot of \"gotchas.\" Previous: Software testing observations and recommendations",

All you have to do is make a boogie man out of the IT department, and play on existing frustrations. Then play a demo where a sign up form is made in ten minutes and say your IT department would have taken 3 months. You just make sure to walk the happy path during the demo and don’t stress the tool.Many things could be low code. Why do you need a developer for a sign up form if you are just making an API call in the end? Wiring up a form shouldn’t take html, js, and a serverside language.On the flip side, don’t put your core business logic in low code. Low code builders assume anything complex will be offloaded to a specialized system. The best ones provide escape hatches by calling remote APIs or calling a code module.Low code gets sold to smaller customers because it’s touted as a developer replacement. But really it’s most powerful in larger enterprises where individual teams may have technical people who have business knowledge but not much much IT power. It’s easy to get them to configure something in a SaaS they already use, than get a custom solution from IT. Also low code often comes with guardrails and permission sets tied to existing users.I see low code as a tech equivalent of the last mile problem in logistics. It addresses a large number of concerns with simple tools, but doesn’t scale well and needs to work in tandem with a stronger central system. End to end low code is a trap, but low code at the fringes is a multiplier. reply Roark66 23 minutes agoparent>Many things could be low code. Why do you need a developer for a sign up form if you are just making an API call in the end?Oh my... Many, many, maaaany reasons.For example, your entire stack is built in a certain way and you don&#x27;t want to introduce new dependencies.What if your cicd requires your config and code is separate and that you build a code artefact, and let&#x27;s say 3 config artefacts (dev, cert, prod), all these are then uploaded to a central repo and handed over to some proprietary security&#x2F;code scanning thing every time you merge new code. Then let&#x27;s say your deployment is done the same way, you have your \"deployment config\" artefacts for each environment, but an infrastructure team manages all the infrastructure-as-code artefacts that take your config.I worked in a bunch of big companies each having their own version of such process.In such an environment, creating an \"example project\" that contains all of the scaffolding required and just writing that sign on form is going to take waaaaay less time than even initial planning how to integrate the \"no code\" tool into our processes. reply Groxx 10 hours agoparentprevLow code with an escape hatch is quite nice, because yeah - many things can and probably should be low-code. It&#x27;s a big productivity and standardization enhancer.That escape hatch is absolutely necessary for longevity though. It lets you keep your low-code environment simple because you can leave it and write real code when necessary, rather than forcing everything into an over-complicated and under-capable custom thing with no editor tooling. reply throwup238 9 hours agorootparentLow-code tools have a market fit problem because of that escape hatch. The players keep trying to sell it as a solution to IT deficiencies but it should be sold as an IT empowerment tool. It really doesn&#x27;t matter how good your last mile delivery is if the shipping container with the product isn’t where it’s supposed to be to begin with.All the components and modules that low code tools provide should be nothing more than an onboarding tutorial like the first few levels of Factorio, before letting the engineering team loose hand in hand with the users. It shouldn’t be an escape hatch, it should be the front door.As such all these low code tools make the mistake of making it really difficult to bring the engineering team into the fold: modularization, logging, debugging, version control, and development tools are absolute garbage so instead of engineering providing a few sane company specific building blocks that they can tend and nurture, it inevitably turns into a shitshow because you can’t use a tool that ultimately depends on the IT department to fix the IT department!The best “low-code” tools have already been around for over a decade: it’s the headless CMS and autogenerated admin pages ala Django and Wagtail. They’ve been focused on solving the content management problem for e-commerce and marketing, but IMO it’s the write path for other groups too. The engineers write the pages and blocks and components while defining an input&#x2F;configuration schema for an automated tool that is usable by laymen. Up the level of abstraction to a well curated (by the engineers at the customer level) IFTTT layer and bam, you’ve 95% of use of low code without the 5% that inevitably ruins it. reply TristanBall 8 hours agorootparentI totally agree on the \"IT empowerment\" perspective, but unfortunately the price model of these tools makes it hard for many IT departments to introduce them, at least in established corporate environments, for internal use. Startup and public facing stuff is different of course but my experience is medium enterprise internal IT..Per end user rather than per developer means they&#x27;re far too expensive to introduce as a general IT toolbox item, they need to be part of a major strategic project where the $5-30&#x2F;month per staff user has a hope of being justified.But that also often takes it outside the \"IT Dept\", which is often just \"infrastructure and pc fleet\" support, not development ( at least, that&#x27;s my experience ). IT might do internal scripting and some service interface tooling, but business tooling and software is rarer, that&#x27;s usually either dev teams or ERP teams. The ERP teams will already using ERP platform tooling, so that further narrows the market.I don&#x27;t have a good solution for this, but it&#x27;s always been the hurdle I&#x27;ve tripped on working for medium size enterprises.There would seem to be an opportunity for \"open source platform, commercial training and support\" here, but vendors seem to gravitate to per user head and cloud only for more immediate revenue and easier support., but again many enterprises still have huge internal only IT landscape&#x27;s, because cloud is still expensive and the value often isn&#x27;t seen in relatively static envs.It&#x27;s possible this niche has been filled now too, it&#x27;s been a while since I looked...Possibly they can be introduced on a \"just those who need it\" basis, but honestly that&#x27;s just so bloody tiring for internal tools, not to mention demotivating as you can no longer build tools for \"everyone or anyone\", it&#x27;s back to specific narrow business cases, not IT empowerment, but narrow business case also means your usually competing with cots tools or consultants. reply addled 8 hours agorootparentprevHaving escape hatches is critical, but they should also be well built, or it can cause just as much headache.Example from us using Azure Data Factory: You can add a step to call out to an API, which we did for a data flow that had a lot of calls. Performance was atrocious. Dug into it, and the API getting called was replying in 100ms or so, but ADF&#x27;s \"escape hatch\" was adding 5-10 seconds of overhead to send the POST and parse the HTTP status code.Microsoft Support said that&#x27;s normal, expected behavior for the service.In the end, we had to write an additional batching layer ourselves. reply nnurmanov 5 hours agorootparentThis ADF abbreviation remind me of another framework we used, it is Oracle ADF (application development framework) and it was awesome low-code tool!

Sometimes it&#x27;s just the cost of doing business, but the more the hooks, the greater the chance that a vendor triples or quintuples the cost of their product that affects your organization&#x27;s secret sauce.I feel like the goal of low-code solutions is to get you over the barrel. Much in the same way AWS tries to get into your company&#x27;s operating costs. reply mdbauman 9 hours agorootparentprevAgreed, with the caveat that you also need a policy&#x2F;culture that the escape hatch should be avoided whenever possible and the low-code work should not be done by developers.Whenever I&#x27;ve discussed this, the common theme is that business users continue to request features that would be easily achieved in the low-code platform being used. It&#x27;s hard to blame them; that&#x27;s been standard procedure for them for their entire career.But if you&#x27;re not strict about saying \"no\", you still end up writing all the same methods but now on top of that you have a GUI that&#x27;s not providing any value.

These tools currently lack proper workflows for version control, collaboration amongst folks involved in the project.

Very clear workflows and well defined processes for version control, testing and collaboration.

Either you price per end user, and optimize against building anything that is widely adopted, or you pay per developer, in which case you need to figure out up front who are the people with unmet needs who also happen to have the knowledge, skills, inclination, and time to build their own solution.

If you take it far enough you are always going to end up hacking around the tool.For people who do write code these tools could be useful, but code is much easier to use as you are not stuck within the constraints of the tool and know what you are doing.I think there is one success story for low code and its basic websites, mostly the part where a design is turned into code. I use Framer because it’s objectively quicker than code, with great results (I even design in framer), and once it’s set up non technical colleagues can make changes.

Total amount of code is probably actually quite a bit larger, actually, given all the code needed to create the abstraction layers to give the appearance of low code.Layers of abstraction are powerful when they&#x27;re tight and well-suited to their purpose (I&#x27;m happy to never think about memory allocation -- thank you garbage collected languages!), but when leaky or ill-suited can be very frustrating and make things harder or impossible.It&#x27;s hard -- probably impossible actually -- to build a \"general purpose\" abstraction layer that will work for specific purposes, but that&#x27;s essentially the pitch of low code -- we don&#x27;t know your specific use case, but we have a tool that will abstract away all the code previously tailored to that use case.Now, in fairness, there&#x27;s a lot of code that has too much accidental complexity in it. A good abstraction layer strips away that accidental complexity and leaves only the essential complexity that&#x27;s specific to your domain and use case. But that&#x27;s hard to achieve -- it takes skill and experience (and not just general experience, but specific to your domain experience) to achieve. Most companies don&#x27;t have that available to them, and don&#x27;t want to pay rates to build teams that do have that skill set and experience.

Let me explain: When you choose the right platform to build the applications, the platform should take care of gluing services, adding visualization, handle common concerns such as reliability, ease of debugging, documentation (with the visualization) etc. This is an often overlooked aspect of application platform that otherwise takes the bulk of the time to create apps.tools focusing in low-code does not solve them and the tool that solves typically don&#x27;t market them as low-code - because the are not. low code comes as a result. reply noobermin 28 minutes agoprevIf you generalise to llm gened code in the hands of non developers then... reply prakhar897 5 minutes agoparentLike this? : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.resurrect.ing&#x2F;LLM Gen code is far from perfect. reply danjc 3 hours agoprevA few comments here about lack of version control being a problem generally with low code.We&#x27;re a low code platform (app integration) and what&#x27;s worked well for us is to have the platform store the generated workflow design (yaml&#x2F;json) in source control.Additionally, we map environments on to source control branches so merging to a branch is what promotes a design version to qa or prod. reply pylua 7 hours agoprevLow code has been used for decades successfully.

Additionally, you will be locked in to a proprietary platform. Perhaps that is okay. reply b33j0r 5 hours agoprevI love that this piece talks about the database. That is a problem I focus on. It’s API versioning all over again, and we never _actually_ solved that before we moved forward.I see this being our reality anyway. In many cases; not all.You can’t ask the LLM, nor a hypothetical AGI, nor anything, to build the aqueducts. Especially if you don’t know you need them. And they won’t solve the problem if neither a human nor an AI know what the problems actually are. Let’s make em out of lead!And they definitely won’t waste tokens on a postgres rollback migration unless we make that essential in the acceptance criteria.An LLM is all of our ideas, in a search UI that dang nearly passes the turing test. (That says more about us than the state of AI technology.)We are pattern machines in many ways, and many things we code are even lovingly called Software Patterns. The promise is not that software engineering goes away, it’s that we’ll all be managers for a while.Low-code, to me, is different from “statistically generated solutions that pass the requirements.” Genetic programming was an idea for decades, but that is also different from stuff that combines yours and my most relevant github commits into a 90% best guess.

Educated guess. reply fnordpiglet 10 hours agoprevWhere I use low code is in essentially expert systems, where I need to encode the expertise of some SME. For instance, a lot of places have regulatory compliance burdens. The detailed rules for compliance changes by jurisdiction constantly. Most enterprises setup some sort of requirements to engineer pipeline that everyone’s bitterly unhappy with. It is never fully compliant, has tons of errors, the engineers resent their jobs, and the SMEs resent the engineers. Instead by instrumenting the system with a low code surface area with a policy management system overlaying it you get an excellent platform engineers like to develop, SMEs can author and manage their policies directly, and you capture a rigorous workflow which auditors and regulators really dig. This doesn’t make the engineer less important, in fact they’re much more important to ensure the policies are expressive enough and touch enough business data to ensure the policies are complete. They’re just not playing regulatory policy telephone games in code. reply bombcar 8 hours agoprevThe most successful low code is Excel. reply tedheath123 1 hour agoparentAt my workplace they are replacing spreadsheets with web apps.

I don&#x27;t write tests, I don&#x27;t future-proof, I don&#x27;t set up deployment or monitoring machinery, I don&#x27;t worry about anything except solving a small, well-defined problem quickly.It&#x27;s definitely not a good approach to everything. But it&#x27;s quite common for one of my users to say something like \"I need a dashboard showing how the current reactor temperatures compare to the averages for yesterday, and also the available cooling water for each one\", where that&#x27;s all data we have existing websocket feeds for, and I can get that to them very quickly without it becoming formal feature development.Lack of testing and monitoring means the products often break. But when they do it&#x27;s typically benign - the page doesn&#x27;t load, or shows no data, and if a user needs to use it, they&#x27;ll complain, and I can fix it.If a page ever got too complicated, or too critical, I might want to port it onto real software.

Sure, I can learn the basic syntax of a new coding language in a week or so, but learning all the deep frameworks to do non-trivial stuff, conventions, deployment, and how to diagnose bugs can take years to become expert at.Much of this feels like needless complexity, but its ubiquity in almost every stack points to something fundamental, in my opinion: the classic 80&#x2F;20 rule.

The folks who keep their jobs are the ones who intuitively grasp what needs to be done, how to break that ask down into iterative tasks, and how to word those tasks as prompts.Instead of scrambling to replace application stacks with layers of dumbed down abstractions, we are actually replacing the less experienced people working with application stacks.Dramatically better outcome for everyone but the people who thought they could take a bootcamp and create generational wealth. reply faeriechangling 10 hours agoparentChatGPT is nice but it’s not a 5x speedup. reply peteforde 9 hours agorootparentLast night, I spent about five hours just beginning to think about reverse engineering a proprietary file format that packs multiple MIDI files so that I could extract them.

I didn&#x27;t write any code in this time, just satisfied myself that it was possible.Today, I asked GPT to do it for me, and it basically wrote the program for me. I did 1-2 follow-up requests, but I figure that it saved me about 2-3 days of effort.

Hard to imagine 10x productivity boost unless you’re a jack of all trades master of none.In my experience it’s really useful when you need to do something in a domain you aren’t super familiar with (that you don’t need to become proficient in). But when it comes to the everyday stuff that is my comfort zone I don’t need it. I’m years past looking up syntax or standard library functions for the languages I work in regularly. Every time I’ve tried to use it for a remotely complex algorithm I’ve found it to be much faster to implement by hand then try to debug whatever it got wrong. But for makefiles and gh actions — it’s a true godsend and those things can be major time sinks.I’m also a developer who really likes to know what my code is doing.

Try to deviate from that and you hit walls, some more climbable than others.For example, Talend absolutely will not allow you to re-combine a pipeline you&#x27;ve split; you can combine two separate data sources, and you can split to two separate sinks, but you absolutely cannot go from one pipeline to two pipelines back down to one.The saving grace is that Talend is fundamentally a GUI for writing Java.

They told me they don&#x27;t have time to learn any tool (all their efforts go to keep the business running), and they don&#x27;t have the money to hire a full-time dev. I offered them the opportunity to develop their platform pro bono. They&#x27;re thrilled since they will be the first business with that type of platform. reply zdragnar 9 hours agorootparentThis applies up, as well. I was involved in talks with a household name (in the US at least) retail store that still managed purchasing for all of their locations via spreadsheet, and had a team of 8 people who were allowed to touch it at any given point to reconcile inventory.They had looked at getting a proper purpose-built system in place, but I don&#x27;t know what happened after that. reply CPLX 8 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not that terrifying in my opinion, it&#x27;s mostly just impressive.From a business standpoint it&#x27;s probably the single most useful software platform ever invented. reply j45 11 hours agoprevLess-code might be more realistic than low or no code. Hard not to have platform lockin with zero or low code.As the other comment said, less code tools for developers can be quite helpful. reply cassepipe 8 hours agoprev...said the carpenter to the Ikea manager.Wordpress, Excel ? reply ChrisMarshallNY 9 hours agoprevDefine \"Low Code.\"Is it a programming language, a framework, a compiler&#x2F;linker&#x2F;IDL, etc.?I mean, there are some that could argue that C is \"low code,\" because it isn&#x27;t Machine Code.I started in Machine Code, and, these days, write mostly in Swift. Swift seems like \"low code,\" compared to Machine Code.I assume that they are talking about things like Qt, React Native, Xamarin, Electron, or Ionic (You can tell that I develop host apps).I write native Apple, using established Interface Builder SDKs, mainly because of the first point. I like to have 100%, and Highest Common Denominator approaches don&#x27;t allow that.Also, I find that upgrading can be a problem. I have been in the position of not being able to support the latest OS, because a library hadn&#x27;t been updated, yet. reply LikesPwsh 9 hours agoparentGenerally low-code are those gui-driven development tools.E.g. You can write a data pipeline in SSIS by just dragging boxes around and entering connection details.Sometimes the abstraction doesn&#x27;t expose something you&#x27;d like, so you add a bit of code (SQL&#x2F;C# for SSIS), but that&#x27;s the \"escape hatch\" rather than the default workflow.You&#x27;ve also got the approaches like Power Query, where a frontend action is automatically recorded as code (M in that case) , but the code is largely hidden from the end user and only used for source control&#x2F;escape hatch. reply ChrisMarshallNY 8 hours agorootparentOh. I have yet to encounter one of these that I&#x27;d take seriously.I have an anecdote, from a friend of mine, from the 1990s.He was a fairly well-paid team leader for an NYC bank. Ran a C++ shop. He had to wear a tie to work, but was paid enough to buy a house, in his twenties.In any case, when I knew him, he was an even-higher-paid consultant, working for the same bank. This time, he wore a three-piece bespoke suit to work. He now owned a house in Port Washington, and he was still in his early thirties.He told me that the bank wanted to release some new server-based product. This was before the Web was really a thing, so it probably was an EDI system (I didn&#x27;t ask him what, as I knew he wouldn&#x27;t tell me).He consulted with his team, and submitted a proposal for a C++ project, taking several months, and costing six figures.Some VP (banks have lots of those) came in, and had been studying Visual Basic. He also hated the IT teams (they can be like that, you know).He told his higher-ups that he could write the whole thing, in VB, in half the time, for a quarter of the money (since he&#x27;d be doing most of the work, himself).Stop me, if you&#x27;ve heard this before...My friend lost the bid. He quit the company (along with most of his team), and traveled around the world for a couple of years.When he got back, the bank was in a shambles. The VP had screwed the pooch in a big way, and was long fired. Attempts to redo the project were dumpster fires, since they no longer had any trained engineers on staff, and they couldn&#x27;t hire new staff.They were begging my friend to come back.And the rest is history... reply iimblack 9 hours agoparentprevIME is much higher level than that. These are when you program by essentially just making a diagram (ideally). reply ChrisMarshallNY 8 hours agorootparentI remember when Rational Rose was supposed to let you create a giant server system, just from a \"Booch Blob\" diagram.I don&#x27;t think I ever heard of a system that was successfully shipped, using that. reply ahepp 56 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s interesting to think about this in the context of model based development &#x2F; UML.Both are situations where people are trying to make the primary source something other than written text. I guess I&#x27;m biased, but I think written text has been wildly successful. The more experience I&#x27;ve gained, the more I use text based tools and generally prefer text to alternatives. Even in a recent case where I wanted a diagram, I used graphviz to automatically generate it. reply smitty1e 10 hours agoprevFrameworks at all levels of _aaS are great, given the stipulation that your greenfield requirements are completely boring.This falls apart when:* legacy systems&#x2F;data must be integrated* the requirements get interestingThere is just no substitute for a good working understanding of the tools, and that means staff that can go past the low-code facade when needful. reply tdeck 7 hours agoprevThe term \"low-code\" is in itself a compromise based on the very issue the author is identifying. The old term was \"no-code\", but too many people needed custom functionality.Aside: The contrast on this website is really borderline. Extremely light gray, low font weight, white background. I thought we were past that particular trend in web design. reply zzzeek 7 hours agoprevdidnt know WTF \"low code\" was.googled.OH, it&#x27;s those stupid visual IDEs that pretend you can connect blocks and lines together and get a program.\"I would get clients who had been drawn to low-code all the time for the promise of fast development time and low maintenance cost.\"Oh I&#x27;d not go anywhere near silly \"clients\" like that. Who wants to fight with that level of dumb reply jauntywundrkind 10 hours agoprev [–] I feel like we are kind of trapped between simplistically polar notions. There&#x27;s coding as we know it - complex & interwovenines of code - and there&#x27;s this low code ideology.Any area of code itself is usually fairly boring & irrelevant. It&#x27;s systems that accrue mass & complexity. Low code systems sound good by demonizing the weird symbols & incantations that make up the lower level fo coding, but it&#x27;s this systematic complexity, it&#x27;s the aggregation of many things happening that makes things opaque & difficult.Finding patterns to suss out broader-scale understanding is what really tempts me. I don&#x27;t have super strong vision here, but I&#x27;m interested in projects like Node-RED, or even to a degree works like jBPM. Both kind of speak to going beyond coding, but I think the valuable thing here is really that they are assembly toolkits for modules of code & data. They are just examples and not even good ones but this quest, to me, to get to the next levels of computing, is to make clearer portraits of what happens, that either are above to code level, or where the code&#x27;s running creates higher level observability surfaces.Code is so easy to demonize. The layering is often so implicit, handlers and DAOs and routes in different layers maybe but with no clear overview layer. Figuring out how to make legible these systems, without diving deep into the code, is what, I think, will make systems less intimidating & will serve as a bridge to make businessfolk and novides better able to intuitively grasp & meddle with these these artificed put before them, with courage. And making people less afraid of the machine, more interested in peeking in and meddling, that&#x27;s where so much hope lies. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

It’s a shame, they had great new artwork and sound&#x2F;music but you could switch back and forth with the old art and it was cool to see the difference in each scene. reply eps 9 hours agoparentDisney yanked them after acquiring LucasArts.I was so pissed when I went to re-download them and they disappeared even from my Purchased list. Complained to Apple and they basically said \"shouda made backups, good bye and fuck off\". $12 down the drain. reply goosedragons 7 hours agorootparentThey still sell the enhanced editions on PC and Xbox (even works on One and Series X|S). Probably still PS3 too. They probably couldn&#x27;t be bothered to update it to 64 bit on iOS. reply musicale 5 hours agorootparentApple&#x27;s 32-bit apocalypse killed so many games on both iOS and macOS. reply musicale 5 hours agorootparentprevThe stupid bit is that iOS \"backups\" don&#x27;t actually include your apps.There really should be a \"full backup\" option. reply CharlesW 15 hours agoparentprevSadly, the developer never updated them for compatibility with 64-bit-only versions of iOS (iOS 11+). reply DennisL123 13 hours agorootparentHappy to sign all the necessary NDAs and to port them to 64 bit, newer iOS versions and devices for free. reply smoldesu 12 hours agorootparentIf they got depreciated once, it&#x27;s gonna happen again. Apple should invest in Microsoft-tier backwards compatibility if they want to avoid publishers abandoning their software. reply turquoisevar 11 hours agorootparentGod no.As an end user it’s already annoying how, mainly big devs, are extremely slow in adopting the latest APIs, this would only motivate them more to just sit on their laurels.As a dev for Apple platforms it would become a buggy mess and would lead to less bumping of target OS versions, which in turn leads to needing to reinvent wheels and coming up with time consuming workarounds.Just one look at the gazillion ways Windows 11 has implemented configuration apps, from as far back as the XP era, has me shudder. You start out with Win 11 stuff but oh, you want to use that one thing? Now you’re lopped into Windows 7 stuff oh you want this other thing, enjoy this XP app, etc, etc. All in the name of backwards compatibility, no thank you.Hell, the fact that they had to skip Windows 9 because of so many devs checking for a 9 to detect 95&#x2F;98 is another such messy nonsense.If I had to choose between that experience or Apple forcing me every year to learn an entirely new programming language + UI framework + persistent storage framework I’ll happily become a polyglot because the MS way of doing things is ridiculous. reply andybak 9 hours agorootparentSoftware shouldn&#x27;t stop working. Unique and amazing things whither and die. That feels wrong to me.(Of course the problem is that it&#x27;s damn hard to run old versions of iOS under emulation. That&#x27;s the solution that would appease me) reply turquoisevar 4 hours agorootparentThe older versions are surprisingly emulatabe; there&#x27;s just not that much interest in packaging it in a way that is accessible for the average user. reply giancarlostoro 9 hours agorootparentprevWhat I really dont get is why in some cases, when it looks obvious to me that the XP UI is just some Microsoft GUI for the drivers, why Microsoft didn&#x27;t consolidate those APIs into the modern UI. They own the entire run-time, I don&#x27;t understand why they cannot add a translation layer. reply tadfisher 6 hours agorootparentXP? They still have the NT 3.5 UI if you dig deep enough. Translating these is just asking for trouble when an important checkbox moves out of the frame because the original dev, in 1993, placed it with absolute coordinates. And there&#x27;s no way in hell MS has access to all of these vintage drivers. reply giancarlostoro 5 hours agorootparentThe driver has to talk to the OS somehow, and they have insane amount of telemetry, might as well use it to some actual usefulness. Always allow a way to \"use the old UI\" with this approach, but at least then, you can have more uniformity. reply turquoisevar 4 hours agorootparentprevIt beats me; as you said, it would take relatively modest efforts to add a translation layer.Especially considering that most of it already is a translation layer for the Windows Registry. reply incrudible 10 hours agorootparentprevMost software is written for ten year business cycles. Maybe the Apple approach makes sense for most consumers and the few little apps they use, but there&#x27;s reasons why Microsoft is so strong in the enterprise, and backwards compatibility is a huge part of that. reply turquoisevar 4 hours agorootparentI’d say that more and more are moving to SaaS and&#x2F;or platform-agnostic web-based stuff (even if it just runs on an on-prem server).But you’re right in that a lot of enterprise software is&#x2F;was written with ten years or more in mind.Having seen it in action, I wonder if that’s the right course of action just in terms of security and what passed as acceptable UI alone, but I suppose that’s a topic for another time. For most enterprises, it’s a cost consideration where there’s a high tolerance for crap as long as it means that it saves money.While Apple is nowhere near as uncommon in the enterprise world as it used to be, it’s no secret that enterprise is far down Apple’s priority list. Backward compatibility (or rather lack of motivation to facilitate that) might very well be a factor in that, but it seems to be more a matter of not needing to tap into that market. reply dwaite 11 hours agorootparentprevI suspect Apple considers developers ignoring a five(?) year notice period that 32 bit compatibility will be dropped a sign that the publisher has already abandoned their software. reply andybak 9 hours agorootparent\"Abandoned\"? Is that another word for \"finished\"? reply judge2020 6 hours agorootparentExpecting old software to be backwards compatible forever is unrealistic. Even modern 64-bit Windows doesn&#x27;t support 16 bit applications, and the only reason this isn&#x27;t a problem is because of how long ago they were of any importance.Old software still lives on in emulation and old hardware. If a developer doesn&#x27;t feel the need to keep it updated for new hardware, it can join the outdated hardware it was made for in the archive. reply incrudible 11 hours agorootparentprevA \"notice\" doesn&#x27;t pay bills. If the cost of porting over is expected to exceed future revenue, the publisher can not be expected to foot the bill. reply _pigpen__ 9 hours agorootparentMoreover, for a quoted company, Sarbanes Oxley makes it difficult to spend money on this kind of activity. reply yardstick 8 hours agorootparentHow so? reply FirmwareBurner 12 hours agorootparentprevThat was never Apple&#x27;s thing. Apple always changes things as it pleases and expects the developers to suck it up.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oeqPrUmVz-o reply turquoisevar 11 hours agorootparentNot sure if you linked the wrong video, but the one you linked to barely supports your comment.Setting aside that abandoning OpenDoc turned out to be the right call, I see a dude trying to get a rise out of Jobs and Jobs handling it in a very respectful way, going as far as admitting they make mistakes and that he is flawed, but that ultimately the decisions are made with the end user (and sales) in mind and less with what kind of nifty technology is behind it.Specifically on the matter of 32-bit support, not dropping it would’ve meant not being able to make the leaps forward that they were able to make, which led to a better user experience.From the developer side of things, as a developer for Apple platforms, it’s a silly discussion to begin with because in 99% of the cases it just meant recompiling it against the latest SDK.So I have no lost love for devs that couldn’t be arsed, even ignoring the fact that the entire ecosystem is known for rapid improvements and continuous maintenance. In fact that’s what most indie devs love about it. reply devbent 11 hours agorootparent> So I have no lost love for devs that couldn’t be arsed,How are teams that no longer exist supposed to recompile anything? Plenty of source is laying around where the last person who knew how to compile it left the company years ago and no one even knows how to check the software out from the source repo anymore.(Pre Git, it wasn&#x27;t always obvious how to even pull software down from repos, tools like perforce allow for fancy remapping of folders so you cannot necessarily just pull source down, also I&#x27;ve worked in repos where you needed specially modified scripts that weren&#x27;t in the repo so you could actually build things!)Microsoft&#x27;s MO has been that once the end user has acquired an executable, that program will keep working damn nearly forever.16bit support was the only time they ever dropped anything, and people are still upset about that. reply incrudible 11 hours agorootparentprev> just recompile it broThis assumes you have all the source code for everything available, the person to do it ready, and that no compiler errors anywhere have crept in through the many revisions of the SDK. None of these assumptions hold for iOS ports that sold poorly (as most did), that were done by some team (likely defunct) as a one-off, that probably used a bunch of middleware they didn&#x27;t own. It&#x27;s just not worth it, otherwise it would&#x27;ve happened. reply smoldesu 12 hours agorootparentprevMaybe they should look into it then, asking developers if you can update their codebase on HN probably won&#x27;t help users very much. reply ndiddy 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is an example of the value provided by ScummVM, it means that fans are able to keep playing the games without having to deal with rightsholders who don’t want to maintain them. reply wronglebowski 16 hours agoprevHow’d this get past app review? Apple has allowed zero emulators of any type on the App Store. I bet this gets crushed. reply kmeisthax 16 hours agoparentApple is very weird with how they interpret that part of their rules. iSH is allowed but not iDOS, etc. reply KMnO4 13 hours agorootparentiSH has compiled the binaries for arm64 so they actually run natively. When they do a syscall to malloc they are actually doing a syscall to malloc.iDOS is interpreting the bytecode and wrapping the unavailable things with its own implementation. When a DOS application runs malloc, the memory is assigned by iDOS instead.I’m not saying Apple is consistent, but your example doesn’t show that well. reply meindnoch 12 hours agorootparentFalse. iSH is an x86 \"bytecode\" emulator.\"Possibly the most interesting thing I wrote as part of iSH is the JIT. It&#x27;s not actually a JIT since it doesn&#x27;t target machine code. Instead it generates an array of pointers to functions called gadgets, and each gadget ends with a tailcall to the next function; like the threaded code technique used by some Forth interpreters.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ish-app&#x2F;ish reply jmah 12 hours agorootparentprevThough it doesn&#x27;t invalidate the gist of your saying, malloc is a user-space function not a syscall. (Its implementation will occasionally do a syscall, such as to sbrk or vmmap.) reply basique 12 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t iSH literally an x86 emulator? reply doctorpangloss 10 hours agorootparentYeah I mean, people think it’s a legal or engineering issue. If an App Store Editor (aka category manager) likes you, you will do alright. reply tannhaeuser 16 hours agoparentprev“[Apple&#x27;s codex] is more what you’d call ‘guidelines’ than actual rules.” reply wronglebowski 15 hours agorootparentExactly, which is why if this gets any traction I believe it&#x27;ll be removed. Apple does not allow you to consume your own content on their platforms without a tax or at least a little roughing up. reply wharvle 13 hours agorootparentVLC’s doing fine. It’s how our kids watch movies on road trips (download to iPad from Jellyfin’s web interface, play in VLC).Almost every book I’ve read in Books is from libgen. Download, open-in, and it’s on all my devices. Reading progress syncs and everything.The best electronic comic book experience I’ve seen is from a free app (optional one-off IAP that does nothing—I wish it had higher tiers, the author is doing god’s work and I’d have given them $50 or something, no question). I put related cbr and cbz files in a directory in icloud, they show up seconds later in this app, it quickly figures out what they are (no clue how it’s as accurate as it is) and organizes them, and I get to reading two pages at a time in landscape on a 12.9” iPad.The only Apple content I pay for is Apple Music, because it’s so damn convenient and I listen to way more music when I have it. I used to put my own music files in the exact same app, though, and that worked fine. reply ascagnel_ 7 hours agorootparent> The only Apple content I pay for is Apple Music, because it’s so damn convenient and I listen to way more music when I have it. I used to put my own music files in the exact same app, though, and that worked fine.You can still do this, but you have to use a Mac or Windows PC to do so. It’ll sync your music up as part of a cloud library that exists alongside Apple’s licensed music. It’s the reason I go for their service vs. Spotify (which will let you sync music locally to their app, but doesn’t have a cloud library). reply judge2020 6 hours agorootparentprevDoes VLC have any extra codec support (read: software decoding) compared to what Apple makes available via APIs? I think the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is webm files being playable in VLC and not when opening via the `files` app, but the vp9 codec is hardware accelerated and has been available for playback in apps for years (the YouTube app shows it in use a lot). reply Cenk 12 hours agorootparentprevWhich app do you use for comics? reply wharvle 12 hours agorootparentYeah, I was gonna plug it since it’s great, but didn’t have it on my phone (it’s iPad only, which makes sense) and forgot the name.Looks like it’s Chunky:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chunky-comic-reader&#x2F;id66356762... reply skydhash 11 hours agorootparentChunky is good, you have multiple ways to import content, even straight from calibre. reply ElCapitanMarkla 11 hours agorootparentprevCheck out iComics by Tim Oliver.

And the original games aren&#x27;t bundled with it (they can&#x27;t be). Kind of surprising they got away with violating that rule. reply DaiPlusPlus 16 hours agoparentprevWell... it&#x27;s not an \"emulator\", I suppose - it&#x27;s an execution-engine. reply nsajko 13 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think ScummVM features an emulator, rather it reimplements game engines. reply meibo 13 hours agorootparentYes, but those games contain scripting languages, like Lua for Grim&#x2F;Escape from Monkey Island. That isn&#x27;t shipped with the app, so it technically violates the rule. Hope they keep it up though, or if not, hope they get their ass kicked into allowing third-party app stores soon so that you don&#x27;t need to jump through massive hoops to use anything like this. reply Turing_Machine 16 hours agoparentprevScummVM explicitly denies being any kind of emulator.It doesn&#x27;t run the original source code of the games. Rather, it&#x27;s a complete rewrite of the game that uses the original assets (images, sounds, internal scripts, etc.) reply sspiff 17 hours agoprevInteresting.My 5 year old sons favourite app on his Android tablet is ScummVM.I bought all the Putt Putt, Freddy Fish, and Spy Fox games on Steam, and after copying the data files over to ScummVM on Android, my son has been enjoying them a lot.I&#x27;d much prefer him spending his time with these rather than these toxic mobile games that target young kids with repetitive loops locked behind countdown timers and in app purchases. reply BSDobelix 14 hours agoparentAnd in 5 years when your for example on a long roadtrip you can buy him \"The Longest journey\" (don&#x27;t forget the HD patches https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tljhd.github.io&#x2F;) reply hedora 15 hours agoparentprevThose games are infinitely better than anything I could find in the app store, and the whole collection was (is?) $50. reply jurgenkesker 12 hours agorootparentCurrently around that price indeed on Steam Sale, and lower if you only look for Spy Fox bundle or Put Put or whatever you want. Very nice. reply whazor 13 hours agoparentprevThey are also sold as games on the App Store, but I think they use an older version of ScummVM and it was really broken for us.I am hoping some more iOS improvements&#x2F;fixes could be done. These games are amazing (still are very funny to my 4yo!). I would like to see a bigger touch area and proper touch dragging support.While I also think they don&#x27;t make games like these anymore nowadays. Please comment below with examples to proof us wrong. reply adrianN 17 hours agoprevIs there a place where I can legally obtain images to run on the vm? reply nu11ptr 16 hours agoparentGog is ideal. I own several of them, and if you are patient, they run great sales throughout the year making them very cheap to obtain (and there isn&#x27;t any DRM). reply sspiff 17 hours agoparentprevSteam. I bought a ton of these on Steam and just copied the data files over to my sons tablet. Works perfectly, including localisation. reply sebazzz 39 minutes agorootparentThe kids are playing Freddy Fish and Pyjama Sam on the iPad right now. Good stuff! There is just no modern equivalent of these games that let&#x27;s kids puzzle like this! reply toasteros 16 hours agorootparentprevTo add to this, the commercially available versions of the first two Monkey Island games are not ScummVM compatible without some hackery. The games are perfectly playable, indeed, but a lot of people don&#x27;t have much fondness for the visual style choices.Luckily, the original game data files are included in the homogeneous .pak files for the games, and Monkey Island Explorer[0] can unpack them.For both games the files are MONKEY.000 and MONKEY.001 (MONKEY2.00{0,1} for Monkey 2) and the explorer program can filter for file types making it easy. Just unpack them, add to ScummVM and away you go.Caveat is that these are the CD versions of the games. The Secret of Monkey Island was actually \"remastered\" previously! The colour palette is altered slightly and the UI includes an updated inventory, with images instead of just words for items. The stump joke is removed, too (partly due to the LucasArts hintline getting calls about a missing disk #131!).Monkey Island Ultimate Talkie Edition[1] is another project that can extract the data from the Special Editions, as well as the music and voice files. The resulting build is compatible with ScummVM, meaning you can play the original games with the updated audio.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quickandeasysoftware.net&#x2F;software&#x2F;monkey-island-expl...[1]: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gratissaugen.de&#x2F;ultimatetalkies&#x2F;monkey1.html reply o11c 17 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.scummvm.org&#x2F;index.php?title=Category:Freeware_G...but hm, that category is larger than the category of supported games ... clicking through to the \"where to get\" link gives a more curated list.There are 4 shipped in most Linux distros (probably more a matter of exact license than quality alone): Flight of the Amazon Queen - everything you&#x27;d expect from a fantasy adventure; play this if nothing else Beneath a Steel Sky - a good game, just not a happy one Lure of the Temptress - this was buggy when I played it, managing to crash&#x2F;freeze the VM Drascula: The Vampire Strikes Back - cringe reply justsomehnguy 14 hours agorootparent> probably more a matter of exact licenseYep, they were freewared.> qualityI have the experience with Flight and Steel Sky only, but they are good. reply unixhero 17 hours agoparentprevSteam gogAnd archive.org some of the games are abandonware and free. reply toasteros 16 hours agorootparentJust note that abandonware is not a legal term, and the ScummVM team consider it piracy&#x2F;warez.

This does not make sense to me.Software you use does not magically [1] end up in your code base, or you are doing something horribly wrong, I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine how. Like, \"Whoops, I downloaded and executed this AGPL-licensed binary, and now this Google process running on my laptop (or phone!) has automatically fetched its source code and put it to prod and linked it to our software, and now oh no, all our code are belong to GNU!\". This is ridiculous. This is some massive, solid bullshit we have here.You can use AGPL software for any purpose within the law, no strings attached. You never need to touch the code, and if you do, you never need to link your product to it. It does not take a lawyer to understand this simple concept. Proprietary software have more restrictions than that, you&#x27;d better not have third party proprietary code ending up in your product, although it&#x27;s not banned at Google. I hope they do check license compliance on their code base anyway, there are automatic scanners for this. So the chances of some AGPL code ending in their repositories seem vanishingly small.As for why Google would be dishonest, of course we have no proof and we can&#x27;t know for sure AFAIK. By default I side with Drew DeVault [2], to me this is anti-AGPL propaganda and their goal is to discourage people from licensing their software under AGPL so they have a bigger pool of open source projects they can potentially reuse without having to contribute back, and it works because now people are afraid to license their stuff under AGPL because \"businesses\" \"often\" have an AGPL ban. I know of exactly two companies banning AGPL: Google and Apple. Apple already did that with GPLv3 (AGPLv3 being GPLv3 + a clause). Again, does please the big company (and come on, outdated bash and GNU tools on Mac does not make any kind of sense, the GPL never restricted stuff at the process level interface). I&#x27;m sure there are smaller businesses thinking that if Google and Apple ban those licenses, they must be bad and they should do too to be safe, while not having a business model where it even makes sense, playing Google and Apple&#x27;s game.If I&#x27;m to license software under AGPL, I&#x27;m giving Google the right to use this software.

It is arguably a paint by numbers Indy romp. Which of course the 2 newer films are not. reply jl6 11 hours agorootparentprevI’ve often pondered this and I have concluded that there are a number of factors:1. Licensing. While it might appear that the Indiana Jones IP is fully in the hands of Disney, it’s plausible that there are nuances behind the scenes. For example, Paramount owns the distribution rights to the first four films. That’s a different issue, but I mention it as an example of how rights can become fragmented over time over multiple contracts. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if the rights to Fate of Atlantis are more complex than we see from the outside. Having said that, I’ve no evidence of this.2. It was a good game, but does that make for a good movie? FoA had some great game features: multiple paths, fun puzzles, classic adventure game exploration and interactivity, awesome pixel art - but none of these are useful to a movie.3. The script was… OK. It doesn’t have any standout quotable lines like the first three films did. Its comedy is more slapstick than witty, and there are more than a few video-game in-jokes. It’s also highly derivative, written, I suspect, to make players think “This is cinematic! This is just like a real Indiana Jones movie!” To that end, it worked brilliantly. But in the 90s, games were still a sideshow compared to Hollywood, and were written in a parodic style, not yet having found their own space as a unique medium. To an extent, this is still true today.4. An aging Harrison Ford is tough to reconcile with a story set in the 1930s. I expect this alone was a big driver in the studio wanting new scripts set in the 50s and 60s for the last two films.5. Movies based on games have an abysmal track record, and I’m sure Hollywood producers get an allergic reaction whenever someone suggests another one.And yet, despite all the above, FoA is still fantastic raw material for a movie. The plot, mythology, locations, set-pieces, and even the music, are all perfect for being reimagined on the big screen. Which leads me to the final reason why I think it hasn’t happened:5. Nobody took games seriously in the 90s, Lucas was in control in the 00s for Crystal Skull and wanted his own story not somebody else’s, Disney was distracted by Star Wars and Marvel in the 10s, and by the time we get to Dial of Destiny in the 20s, Disney has become so risk averse that the idea of pulling ideas from a video game seems far outside what they are creatively capable of. Sadly, with Dial of Destiny bombing, the franchise is probably dead until the 30s.Still, the fact that Disney lawyers shut down the recent fan-remastered version of the FoA game gives me hope that they still recognize how much value that IP has. They’ve strip-mined every other IP, so it’s possible they will eventually realize they&#x27;ve been digging in the wrong place, let go of Harrison Ford (in either live, de-aged, or posthumous generative form), and get their top men working on it. reply kemayo 17 hours agoparentprevTo pedantically correct a thing you said, SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion) was an adventure game engine, and was used for early LucasArts titles (absolutely no Sierra games!).ScummVM is a program that bundles a lot of reimplementations of different game engines together, such that you can play pretty much any game in the \"point and click adventure\" category from the late 80s through early 2000s on modern platforms so long as you provide the data-files for it yourself.

I do see the sentiment you&#x27;ve expressed regarding games much more often. Why is that? I&#x27;m not sure. Perhaps it&#x27;s just a sign of the immaturity of games as a medium (compared to books, anyway). reply kemayo 17 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a lot of user interface issues in playing an older game. Not so much the graphics -- people like \"pixel\" styling in modern games, though generally at much higher resolutions and with better color palettes than in old games -- but rather in how you interact with the games.There&#x27;s a lot of experimentation in old games about how to approach certain concepts, where eventually something won out and became the way we do it. So it&#x27;s very strange to go back to e.g. an old first-person game and realize that WASD controls aren&#x27;t used.I recently saw this YouTube video (\"How System Shock&#x27;s Reboot Wrestles With Adapting Its Legacy\" by Errant Signal) that talks a bit about this take on the issue, which might interest you: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YDQ24iAkh90 reply wavemode 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s sort of tangential though. A game can have user interface problems and still be fun. A game can be outdated and still be fun.I would argue the age of a game is entirely orthogonal to whether it is possible to still enjoy playing it.Will EVERYONE enjoy playing it? Probably not.

But also, there&#x27;s quite a few genuinely good games in there, and also some very foundational ones. The tendency towards cartoony graphics and a plot&#x2F;humor focus means that in some ways they&#x27;ve aged a lot better than other games from a similar era.In a way it&#x27;s like asking why people read old fashioned novels, even though they&#x27;re out of step with modern language and culture. reply jonhohle 17 hours agoparentprevWhile I don’t share the sentiment, I have an anecdote that might be relatable.Some time around 2014 I finally got around to playing Castlevania: symphony of the Night. It was almost 20 years old, casykevania had long since moved to 3D graphics and stages. Even when it was released in the 90s it could have been considered outdated due to its small, sprite-based graphics.It turns out, the game is a masterpiece. The control, the level design, the progression, the exploration, the freedom of item choice are all exceptional. Even the graphics are beautiful for what they are without needing a RTX 4090 and 4K display. I’ve replayed it several times since then and it opened up a new genre of games that I hadn’t previously considered liking.Many of the Lucas Arts point and click adventures may or may not soar the same interest. They’re quirky, funny, clever games that can be played casually.For kids who like games, the gameplay is enough.

    "title": "Using Indents for Simpler UIs: A New Approach to Displaying Tree-Like Lists",
    "originLink": "https://ratfactor.com/cards/fake-trees",
    "originBody": "This is a card in Dave's Virtual Box of Cards. Fake Trees: Using Indents For Simpler UIs Created: 2023-12-29 Updated: 2023-12-30 This is a technique I’ve used in actual for-pay software, but most recently in my text adventure game editor, Hiss. The problem: you want a tree-like list in your UI Let’s say you have this fantastic dynamic list of Foo and Bar data and you would like to display it in a tree view of some sort in your application: My Foos Foo 1 Foo 1.a Foo 1.b Foo 2 Foo 3 My Bars Bar I Baz baz baz Bar II Bar III Bar IV ... This obviously you need to implement some sort of parent-child relationship between these items, right? That sounds like a lot of work and potentially awkward-to-work-with data structure, especially if stored in a database. But surely there is no way around it. It’s \"obviously\" the only way to go. Okay, so let’s do that. You could express this with a parent ID. Something like this, if you’re using a database: idsortnameparent ----+------+---------+------- 131Foonull 781Foo 113 981Foo 1.a78 992Foo 1.b78 ... Now how to do we work with this? Well, for example, one way to get tree-structured data from a relational database with a SQL query is to write a recursive CTE (Common Table Expressions), which are just as fun as they sound. If you’re a programmer, you’re probably already thinking about how you would display this data… Wait, but does your data really need to be a tree? Do your items actually have to have a parent-child relationship, or do they just need to look like they do? I find that these lists are often just formatted this way for human organization. There’s no actual need for a formal relationship between them. If that’s the case, a vastly simpler method for storing this tree is: idsortindentname ----+------+--------+------- 1310Foo 7821Foo 1 9832Foo 1.a 9942Foo 1.b ... Why is this simpler? Because it literally describes what you see on the screen. Which means it’s easy as pie to render. Note how the sort order is now absolute for the entire list, not for sub-item order. The indent is quite literally how much space to put before the item. And it’s not just display the list that becomes easier - making an interface to edit this tree can also be much simpler now. You can simply let the user move items up and down and indent/unindent them to their heart’s content (or put in some simple rules to enforce correct indenting - that’s up to you). It becomes more like editing a list in a word processor than interfacing with a data structure straight out of a computer science text book. Another example using \"namespacing\" Here’s an example straight out of Day 18 of my Hiss December Adventure Log: I’ve got items with these names from a silly example game: Start banana banana.eat banana.peel banana.sniff banana.throw away monkey ... And these render in the interface like so: It appears I implemented some sort of namespacing feature to HissScript. But I didn’t! I’m just sorting the items alphabetically and if I see a dot (\".\") in a name, I chop off the first part and indent the item. As with the Foo and Bar list in the previous example, it looks like the game editor \"understands\" the relationship, but that’s just an illusion. Just to give a sense of how simple this is, here’s the entirety of the list drawing code (JavaScript): var names = Object.keys(objs).sort(); return names.map(function(n){ if(m = /^.+(\\..+)$/.exec(n)){ return [\"a.indent\", {onclick:link(n)}, m[1]]; } return [\"a\", {onclick:link(n)}, n]; }); And that’s raw editor code that sets up click handlers and everything. The pseudocode logic is just: names = sort(things.keys) each names as name: if contains('.', name): print_indent chop_before('.', name) else print name (I later added a check to make sure a \"parent\" item with the given prefix exists before doing the indent/chop. But that was just another couple lines. Also, it would be no problem to add arbitrarily deep nesting levels to this namespacing feature but I’m waiting for an actual need.) The \"namespacing\" appearance is very important for a human trying to organize a game. But it means nothing to the game editor and player. Names with dots in them are just names. The namespacing keeps them unique, but that’s it. I learned the hard way long ago: more often than not, people don’t actually want (or need) trees, they just need the appearance of them. Bonus tree-as-list Update: Dave Long writes: \"Low-tech real trees: store path + info in a flat list (like the output of find).\" That’s definitely true and is essentially the insight behind my \"banana.eat\" example above. Here’s some fake find output: ./foo/zonk ./foo/bonk ./bar/boop/bop ./bar/boop/bleep \"Want a depth-first traversal? lexically sort by the path.\" For sure: ./bar/boop/bleep ./bar/boop/bop ./foo/bonk ./foo/zonk \"Want a breadth-first traversal? sort by the (properly padded) reversal of the path\" To make this one work, you first reverse your paths by the path separator. Then you need to ensure your paths all have the same \"depth\" by adding blank items. Then sort: / bonk / foo / . / zonk / foo / . bleep / boop / bar / . bop / boop / bar / . The list above is to demonstrate the conceptual result, but presumably you’re doing this with arrays after having chopped up your lines by separator. Flat lists are great to work with in general. Computers like them and they seem to suit my simple mind as well. If possible, I put things in plain old lists. This reminds me of my other recent card: Interpreting if/else logic with a simple flat list of booleans. Physical analogy Just to hammer on the point, let’s say you’re working on your personal scrapbook. You’re starting to put boxes of photos, notes, postcards, ticket stubs, etc. into some sort of order. You’re laying everything out on the floor and you’re making some really nice groupings of items and you’ve even made little folded paper signs to label the groups. Even though it is glaringly obvious to you, the human, how these groups work, is there actually any physical mechanism built into your floor to enforce this relationship? Of course not. The floor has no idea what’s going on. (Or if it does, you have accidentally moved into a home built over an ancient burial ground and are in immediate danger. Pack a bag and leave now. Sleep in a hotel tonight and you can think about how to get your belongings and find a new home when you’ve got a clear head tomorrow morning. The scrapbook can wait for a better time when you’re less likely to be eaten by skeletons.) Caution: One size does not fit all I’m sure there are infinite variations on this and I’m sure I’m not the first person to think either of the above two example techniques. But I have never seen anyone mention it before. So anything like this will probably count as a \"hack\" in most programming circles. You will almost definitely need to heavily adapt it to your specific scenario. And for the love of all that is good, if you actually need a tree, use a tree. Do the whole parent ID thing (or separate parent/child join table or whatever makes sense to your data model). In the physical analogy above, if you’re cataloging a massive research project and you need the organizing power of physical filing cabinets and neatly-labeled folders, the floor method is not going to cut it! (Just make sure you’re not using haunted filing cabinets.) Do not hack something with indents or counting symbols in strings or some nonsense like that if you will ever need to actually know the relationship between your items. Yes, you can do it, but it will be a path of suffering for the lifetime of the project and all of its maintenance forever after. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Further than that I think that every generation wants to make their own mistakes, regardless of how well documented they were.Overall this is healthy, a new set of eyes to an old problem can yield new solutions. In some cases though, it&#x27;s a facepalm situation. Like the whole Javascript world of today. reply ShadowBanThis01 11 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know why you should feel bad about that. If anything, you should feel good that you independently recognized a problem so significant that it was given a name.I assume most problems I face are solved, and that I just don&#x27;t know shit. So I scramble to research the solutions, and I&#x27;m shocked when what seem to be widely-encountered problems are NOT, in fact solved.One recent example I encountered was API definition. I was tasked to define a new API for my company&#x27;s products, and celebrated when I discovered OpenAPI. I was a bit surprised to find that only the very latest version of the standard (3.1) was competent enough to be useful.And despite 3.1 being ratified for years, today there are still no usable code-generation tools that support it. I wasted weeks studying and trying to fix various tools, after studying reams of redundant and conflicting documentation in different repositories... thinking it was my problem. No. It&#x27;s just a hideously broken mess.Today I&#x27;m dealing with the same thing in SwiftUI... and again have reached the conclusion that the programming paradigm it pushes has not been thought through.

We hire younger grads who just want to cram everything into a nosql document and not give any thought to data modeling.

Personally I wish Prolog had gained more traction back in the day, it would have made a great alternative. reply chadcmulligan 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m thinking performance - it used to be a big deal to optimise database performance. Now most databases can live in memory so even if you&#x27;re doing full table scans all the time it won&#x27;t be that noticeable, and by the time the database has enough data in it that performance becomes an issue every one who built it has left.The focus on micro services to, probably has an impact - the back end can be changed if your database is having issues and the services stay the same.Also databases are hard and a large chunk of developers only know javascript and html.You don&#x27;t see many DBA jobs any more, a lot of that is moving to the cloud so they just pay more money and throw CPU&#x27;s at the problem rather than optimise the database.Also agile&#x2F;scrum (as its practiced anyway) doesn&#x27;t really allow for a database design up front as it used to be done. reply twic 9 hours agorootparentprevI think it was:1.

It is possible to transform your tree structure into an indented list in O(n) time. This used to be one of our interview questions at the time. There are a number of ways to store your data in various SQL databases that allow you to quickly get and render segments of the tree as well without recursive queries.Once you understand those concepts, then storing your data correctly as trees has a ton of benefits over indenting like this. reply sfn42 15 hours agoparentIf you don&#x27;t need those benefits it doesn&#x27;t really matter. reply moron4hire 14 hours agorootparentWhat people are saying in this comment section is that you&#x27;re probably going to need it.

You dont need CTE to retrieve the tree from the db - you can fetch a flat list and construct the tree locally, as you would most likely need to anyway for following manipulations.The very same argument can be made about people who use rdbms to store the list - store it in a text file. Why pay the network latency cost?Or alternatively, the proposed structure would not work with sufficiently big tree if we wanted to move branches around, changing their depth. That would impose linear cost.State your intention at the beginning, instead of explaining three different examples that are later on invalidated in the conclusion section with \"if you need a tree, use a tree\".

Rather than using the complex table&#x2F;tree-like data structure of QAbstractItemModel[2], I&#x27;m using QAbstractListModel[3] (flat list) with a property called indentLevel[4] for each delegate. It works out great. I still need to manage parent child relationships (it makes rendering changes easier using recursive function) so I keep variables for that, but the \"fake tree\" look, as I like to call it, simply uses the indentLevel property which is determined by the amount of whitespace&#x2F;tabs at the start of a line in the underlying plaintext data.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.get-plume.com&#x2F;[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.qt.io&#x2F;qt-6&#x2F;qabstractitemmodel.html[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.qt.io&#x2F;qt-6&#x2F;qabstractlistmodel.html[4] Q_PROPERTY(unsigned int indentLevel READ indentLevel WRITE setIndentLevel NOTIFY indentLevelChanged) reply parasti 18 hours agoprevI had a similar realization about OpenGL a bunch of years ago: I don&#x27;t need to draw a world of hierachical 3D objects, I just need to draw a list of sorted triangles.

An illusion of a tree is only useful insofar as you don&#x27;t really care about it being a tree.I structure things as trees because I want to be able to traverse them.

I won&#x27;t attempt to explain exactly how it works, but it stores a tree structure in a way that makes many kinds of queries possible even when treating the table more or less like a flat list. It was very useful for being able to snag subtrees in relatively simple SQL queries.Also, tangentially, I am reminded of the array representation of the binary heap structure. An array-based binary heap maintains (as far as I am aware) the same properties as a pointer-based binary heap, but the structure is entirely implicit based on index.There&#x27;s a lot of ways to skin a cat for sure.

Are 1, 2, and 3 (or I, II, etc.) actual data values, or simply row numbers arising from a sort on something else?If you&#x27;re writing the back end for OmniOutliner, and you must use a relational database, then maybe you&#x27;ll use tricks like these.

In the recent letter, Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino, who recently assumed leadership of the company, emphasized Tether's decision to disable its tokens in all wallets associated with the Office of Foreign Assets and Controls (OFAC) sanction list. Ardoino claimed that Tether has assisted the Department of Justice, U.S. Secret Service, and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in freezing 326 wallets controlling 435 million USDT thus far. However, it appears that the recently frozen wallets contain a smaller number of tokens than the stated sum. Ardoino also revealed that Tether has recently collaborated with the United States Secret Service and is currently working with the FBI. He said: \"Tether is grateful for the opportunity to address the concerns raised by U.S. lawmakers, and we are committed to continuing Tether’s close work with law enforcement in the U.S. and globally. Tether seeks to be a world class partner to the U.S. as we continue to assist law enforcement and expand dollar hegemony globally.\" The letters, addressed to Senator Cynthia Lummis, a supportive figure for cryptocurrencies in the Senate, were also sent to the chairs and ranking members of the aforementioned committees. Tether's decision to publish these letters aims to highlight its commitment to ensuring the security and integrity of its stablecoin. This comes after Tether announced its new policy to enhance collaboration with regulators, and recently helped the U.S. Department of the Treasury to freeze the wallets of OFAC-sanctioned individuals.

Could General Electric &#x27;disable&#x27; the shares of a shareholder? What would that mean? The shareholder can&#x27;t sell their shares, I suppose, but GE&#x27;s equity would remain the same (not counting any market movement that would be caused by the sale).Imagine a monetary system where currency was profit to a private company. What will our once-proud industry think of next? Software to help landlords collude, take housing off the market, and jack up rents? Software that impersonates humans, as well as any form of truth? We are on a roll! reply nostrademons 7 hours agorootparentCompanies absolutely can \"disable\" trading by certain shareholders. This is what an IPO lock-up is, where insiders cannot sell their shares until 6-12 months after the conclusion of the IPO. It&#x27;s also what a trading blackout is, where employees cannot trade shares between the end of the quarter and release of earnings. These are very common - almost everyone who works for a public company has encountered them.These cases are temporary, but I suspect there are also permanent trading bans that might be caused by legal action - if, for example, an employee is found guilty of a crime, or is under a wage garnishment order.Also, crypto has long had the phenomena of coins that get \"locked\" and can never be touched or transferred again, simply through holders that have died or lost the private key. For example, the original \"Satoshi coins\" - the roughly 1M Bitcoin (~$45B at today&#x27;s prices, enough to make their holder the 27th richest person in the world) mined by Satoshi before Bitcoin became mainstream - have never been spent, and it&#x27;s likely that their owner is dead. They simply drop out of circulation, and the price of all other Bitcoin rises to compensate. reply wolverine876 5 hours agorootparentGood points about trading that&#x27;s disabled.

It differs from how it works with btc, because the government does not have control of the private keys that manage the addresses in question - so they go to Tether who controls the smart contract that manages the transactions of the tokens.This, in practice, means that the US government controls the mentioned tokens for the moment. What happens with them depends entirely on the outcome of the investigation. reply smsm42 56 minutes agorootparentUS govt could also create a govt wallet and force usdt to transfer the tokens there I imagine, if they want to proceed with seizure.

They run Bitfinex, a centralized exchange. They can just change balances in a database, like FTX. There’s no need for fractional reserve.Tether is simply shadow banking and brings liquidity into Bitfinex. It’s very simple:1. Export finished goods from China for dollars.2. Import inputs for step 1 from places like Turkey, Ukraine, and others and pay inflated invoices with dollars from step 1.3. Receive Tether out-of-band for step 2.4.

Tether doesn&#x27;t look like they have enough money to pay back people holding Tether tokens. Banks don&#x27;t have enough money to pay back depositors. Both muddle along fine.Theoretically the banks have lower risk due to regulatory actions. We&#x27;ve had enough financial crisises now that a reasonable person could discount that. Given the levels of debt and spring-loaded derivatives, any institution is at risk these days. We can imagine a history book entry saying \"XYZ couldn&#x27;t return their depositors money\" for pretty any actor in these markets.The banks get bailouts of course, but that tends to be action outside the official rules; so maybe Tether will get it to? The differences here are mostly about how long the game has been played, not what the game is. Tether doesn&#x27;t seem to be less reputable than the banks. It outlasted Credit Suisse for example.

    "originBody": "The hidden gems of moreutils Jiri Pospisil Published Dec 19, 2023 It seems no matter how long I work with the command line, every once in a while I find handy utilities I've never encountered before. Most people have heard about the bird coreutils, that's where utilities such as echo, cat, and others come from. But did you know about moreutils? ts Say I want to trace every program invocation (~exec()) on the system. I can do that with execsnoop from the BPF Compiler Collection. # execsnoop ls 1586 1401 0 /usr/bin/ls --color=auto -F git 1587 1401 0 /usr/bin/git rev-parse ... Apparently every time I touch a terminal, it runs Git to determine whether I'm within a Git repository just so that it can show me the current branch in the prompt. Surely that doesn't slow things down. What it doesn't show me is the time of the invocation though. I can easily add it with ts. # execsnoopts Dec 19 12:39:25 ls 1791 1401 0 /usr/bin/ls --color=auto -F Dec 19 12:39:25 git 1792 1401 0 /usr/bin/git rev-parse ... I now realize that execsnoop does have the -T flag which adds invocation times so there's no need for ts in this case but I've already written these examples so yeah. ts can also convert time stamps into relative times. This is especially handy when looking through log files. $ journalctl --since yesterday --priority emerg..warning Dec 18 19:30:47 vm sudo[5068]: user: 3 incorrect password attempts $ journalctl --since yesterday --priority emerg..warningts -r 18h7m ago vm sudo[5068]: user: 3 incorrect password attempts sponge Have you ever wanted to modify a file, save the result into the same file, and got quickly disappointed with the result? $ echo 132 > file.txt $ sort file.txt > file.txt $ wc -l file.txt 0 file.txt # empty Remember, it is the shell which is responsible for redirecting the output, not the individual commands. In this case, when the shell sees > file.txt, it opens file.txt for writing (or creates it if necessary). Crucially, it also opens the file with the O_TRUNC flag which instantly truncates (empties) the file. When sort later opens the file to do the actual work, it finds the file empty and exits. The most common workaround is to first redirect the output to a temporary file and then move it back to the original name. And that's exactly what sponge does behind the scenes for you. echo 132 > file.txt sort file.txtsponge file.txt Interestingly, some of the commands from coreutils have a \"-o\" flag. I could have just written sort -o file.txt file.txt. Oh well. vidir This is probably what I use most often. Running vidir opens your $EDITOR or $VISUAL with files / directories of the specified directory (or the current directory) and allows you to edit them. If you change the name, it will rename it. If you delete a file row, the file gets deleted. To delete an entire directory with everything in it, delete its row and all sub entries. vidir *.pdf fd -t fvidir - What if you've made so many great changes that you want to just quit the editor without applying any of them? You just need to quit the editor with exit code 1. In Vim / Helix you do that with :cq. This by the way works in pretty much all cases where a command invokes your editor (e.g. when writing a commit message). If your distribution doesn't provide moreutils, there's also qmv from renameutils. vipe This is a bit dirty but can be useful sometimes. Imagine you want to process a bunch of files but cannot get the damned file name regex right and so you have a few extra files in the output. You could just write the output to a file, edit it, and continue from there but there a more fragile option - edit the output right between the pipes! fdvipe... In this case, the output from fd will be buffered by vipe and passed to your configured text editor. You can make any changes you want and once you quit, the data will be passed down the pipe if any. The downside is that if you want to run the command again, you will need to also edit output again. It's probably a better idea to just write it into a file. At least in this scenario. pee I'm going to mention this not because I have an actual use case for this but just because it took me a second to realize what it actually does. pee takes its stdin and passes it to all commands given as arguments. It then gathers their output and sends that as its own output. It runs the commands using popen, so it's actually passing them to /bin/sh -c (which on most systems is a symlink to Bash). $ echo \"Alice\"pee \"xargs echo Hello\" \"xargs echo Hi\" Hello Alice Hi Alice I think those are all the commands I regularly use / I've used. There are more available, such as chronic (print output only if the command failed) or ifne (run command only if there's non empty stdin) but I haven't needed them yet. Besides more commands in moreutils, there are even more of these command sets such as evenmoreutils or num-utils. Go back to the front page",

Start with &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env to allow the system to locate the executable based on the current PATH environment variable rather than a fixed filesystem path. #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env sh # ^ should result in a Bourne-like shell, on modern systems, but could also be # a POSIX shell (like Ash), which is not really backwards compatible #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env csh # ^ should result in a C shell #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env bash # ^ should result in a Bash shell, though the only version you should # expect is version 3.2.57, the last GPLv2 version #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env dash # ^ you expect the system to have a specific shell. if your code depends # on Dash features, do this. otherwise write your code using an earlier # version of the original shell family, such as Bourne or POSIX.If you need to pass a command-line argument to the shell command before interpreting your script, use the fixed filesystem path for the shell. Due to bugs in the way kernels execute scripts, all arguments after the initial shebang path may be sent as a single argument, which is probably not what you (or the shell command) expect. (e.g. use #!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash --posix instead of #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env bash --posix as the latter may fail)Different shells have different implementation details. For example, Bash tends to skew toward POSIX conformance by default, even if it conflicts with traditional Bourne shell behavior. Dash may try to implement POSIX semantics, but also has its own specific behavior incompatible with POSIX.In order to get specific behavior (like POSIX emulation), you may need to add a flag like --posix, or set an environment variable like POSIXLY_CORRECT. For shells that support it, you can also detect the version of the shell running, and bail if the version isn&#x27;t compatible with your script.Here are some references of the differences between shells: - Comparison of command shells[1] - Major differences between Bash and Bourne shell[2] - Practical differences between Bash and Zsh[3] - Fundamental differences between mainstream \\*NIX shells[4][1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Comparison_of_command_shells [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;bash&#x2F;manual&#x2F;html_node&#x2F;Major-Dif...

Shells&#x2F;terminal emulators on these platforms emit SIGINFO when you type Ctrl+T into them!(For a lot more useful info about this behavior: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stuff-things.net&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;that-one-stupid-dd-trick...)Bonus fact not mentioned in the above article: dd used in the middle of a pipeline will still \"hear\" Ctrl+T and print progress, since signals generated by a shell (think: SIGINT from Ctrl+C) are propagated to all processes in the process group started by the command.

    "originBody": "Diary of an art historian comment Court of Appeal ruling will prevent UK museums from charging reproduction fees—at last Those © symbols on UK museum websites and catalogues are now redundant if the original work of art is out of copyright Bendor Grosvenor 29 December 2023 Share Illustration 134192325 © ArseniukoleksiiDreamstime.com A recent judgement on copyright in the Court of Appeal (20 November) heralds the end of UK museums charging fees to reproduce historic artworks. In fact, it suggests museums have been mis-selling “image licences” for over a decade. For those of us who have been campaigning on the issue for years, it is the news we’ve been waiting for. The judgement is important because it confirms that museums do not have valid copyright in photographs of (two-dimensional) works which are themselves out of copyright. It means these photographs are in the public domain, and free to use. Museums use copyright to restrict the circulation of images, obliging people to buy expensive licences. Any thought of scholars sharing images, or using those available on museum websites, was claimed to be a breach of copyright. Not surprisingly, most people paid up. Copyright is the glue that holds the image fee ecosystem in place. What has now changed? Museums used to rely on the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, which placed a low threshold on how copyright was acquired; essentially, if some degree of “skill and labour” was involved in taking a photograph of a painting, then that photograph enjoyed copyright. But subsequent case law has raised the bar, as the new Appeal Court judgement makes clear. In his ruling (THJ v Sheridan, 2023), Lord Justice Arnold wrote that, for copyright to arise: “What is required is that the author was able to express their creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices so as to stamp the work created with their personal touch”. Importantly, he went on: “This criterion is not satisfied where the content of the work is dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which leave no room for creative freedom”. In other words, if the aim of a museum photograph is to accurately reproduce a painting (which it must be), then it cannot acquire copyright. Copyright bar since 2009 Moreover, Lord Justice Arnold pointed out that the new copyright bar has been in place since 2009. This raises doubts about the basis on which most museums have sold image licences since then. As Eleonora Rosati, professor of intellectual property law at Stockholm University tells me, “technically, this has been wrong for ten-plus years”. In fact, some museums have long been aware of the true status of UK copyright law, despite suggesting otherwise publicly. The Tate has internally accepted the new definition for some years, yet still claims copyright over its historic collection in a number of ways. In a statement to me, the Tate says it charges fees “for supplying high-resolution digital images from our picture library. These are different to copyright fees, which are not applied to images unless they are covered by copyright law.” Of course, the Tate only has to use its picture library to supply high-resolution images because it only shows low-resolution images on its website. But here is the main point: those © symbols on UK museum websites and catalogues are now redundant if the original artwork is itself out of copyright. There is no reason not to use these images for free (and nobody would argue against paying for new images, if needed). The National Gallery marks images “© National Gallery”, and in its terms and conditions forbids reproduction unless “expressly permitted under copyright law”. But since there is no copyright, reproduction is indeed permitted (expressly or otherwise, there is no distinction). No major UK museum has taken anyone to court over copyright of such images, and no sensible trustee will let them now. Surely museums will now change their policies? The National Gallery told me in a statement: “We are aware of this recent Appeal Court ruling and we will be reviewing its guidance.” Since I have also established, through a Freedom of Information request, that the National Gallery has been losing money on its image licensing operation, hopefully it will embrace this chance to abolish image fees altogether. Then the gallery, art historians and the public, will be practically, legally, culturally and financially better off. For art history, this is a judgement where everyone wins.

Wikimedia puts up images under those rules, and no one has ever successfully sued Wikimedia over that, although there&#x27;s been some huffing and puffing.Feist is why the US doesn&#x27;t have database copyright, and that&#x27;s a Supreme Court decision based on the copyright&#x2F;patent clause in the Constitution.

That&#x27;s over.This has implications for large language models. reply staticautomatic 15 hours agoparentI would think the transformativeness defense used by appropriation artists might be applicable to establish that a photo of an out-of-copyright image is an “original work of authorship.” Cue Richard Prince to put it to the test… reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentTFA explicitly addresses that was the question under consideration:> In his ruling (THJ v Sheridan, 2023), Lord Justice Arnold wrote that, for copyright to arise: “What is required is that the author was able to express their creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices so as to stamp the work created with their personal touch”. Importantly, he went on: “This criterion is not satisfied where the content of the work is dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which leave no room for creative freedom”. In other words, if the aim of a museum photograph is to accurately reproduce a painting (which it must be), then it cannot acquire copyright.I.e. these museums were selling pictures of artworks that by definition needed to adhere to a true reproduction of the original as closely as possible. It wasn&#x27;t a question of taking a picture of an out-of-copyright painting and applying some level of skill&#x2F;artistic license to transform the original in some way. reply buccal 14 hours agorootparentprevIf anyone is interested in copyright law I would recommend a free CopyrightX course from Harvard ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyber.harvard.edu&#x2F;teaching&#x2F;copyrightx ).

If I understand it correctly, even if the museum created a fancy collage for the side of the building, yes they would own that arrangement, but not any of the paintings which went into it. They still couldn&#x27;t stop you from sharing images of the original works therein. reply clausecker 14 hours agoparentprevDo you know if this ruling applies to word lists of the English language such as those used in tournament Scrabble? reply bee_rider 13 hours agorootparentAs loathe as I am to say anything nice about our copyright system or scrabble (a territory capturing game without the most obscure and silly rules for capturing space), it does seem like the sort of thing that ought to be covered. reply callalex 10 hours agorootparentThat may have been true in the past, but the game is now over 75 years old. There is just absolutely zero chance that the inventors of the game would have been more motivated to invent if they were given a longer exclusive term. Since the stated goal of copyright is to advance the progress of the arts, there is no justifiable reason the public should continue granting exclusivity to the game at this point in time. reply Turing_Machine 12 hours agorootparentprevI believe it was settled long ago that mere lists (e.g., telephone directories) with no creative content are not copyrightable in the United States. I&#x27;m not familiar with the Scrabble word lists, but if that&#x27;s all they are I&#x27;d guess they&#x27;d fall under that ruling.Dictionaries, on the other hand, are copyrightable because there&#x27;s creative work involved in writing the definitions. reply pbhjpbhj 11 hours agorootparentI feel like there would be a case to answer if it went to court in the UK, Scrabble words are not an entirely arbitrary selection, nor are they all words in [most] regular dictionaries AFAICT. The list has been curated in order to provide a specific set of rules for a game: there seems to be a creative act of compilation. To say it another way; it&#x27;s a factual presentation - but the fact (of which words are in the list) was created for the game.This makes it unlike an almanac, say, where the list is dictated by past events.It&#x27;s perhaps similar to the Guinness Book of Records, where the choice of records to present is creative (along with the usual creative aspects of a book, composition of pages, choice of accompanying images, etc.).One consideration a court might take is that the list cannot be generated without copying from the established Scrabble Dictionary because one otherwise would not know whether to include or exclude any particular word. A list of &#x27;all existing English words of 1-3 letters&#x27;, say, would be fine though. reply hedora 15 hours agoprevI hope this is true for videos as well, in practice.I’m worried the anti-circumvention clauses of the DMCA (in the US) or restoring &#x2F; colorizing &#x2F; denoising &#x2F; modifying the original will be used as a loophole.For instance, Disney+ likes to censor and otherwise mutilate content.

Copy protection only has the force of law when there&#x27;s an underlying copyright to enforce. There&#x27;s a bit of room for shenanigans if you use a common DRM scheme that has copyrighted works protected by it, which means you can&#x27;t release tools that deprotect those works, but that doesn&#x27;t make the museums able to get extra copyright out of them. It is at best a speed bump.Modifications to public domain work only accrue copyright insamuch as those modifications are creative. Chucking a public domain cartoon through a denoising filter wouldn&#x27;t make the denoised version copyrighted. Colorization might accrue some copyright, but it&#x27;d be thin - basically only the exact same coloring decisions would be infringing.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chamberlain_Group,_Inc._v._Sky.... reply anticensor 15 hours agoparentprev> I hope this is true for videos as well, in practice.Videos and music is different from photos because members of production team get individual copyrights. reply dllthomas 12 hours agorootparentBut I think the question is whether you can acquire new copyright to a reproduction of the film after those original copyrights have expired. reply fweimer 15 hours agoprevWeb sites displaying non-copyrighted works could still be protected under the UK implementation of the EU database directive.

A side-effect of the ruling may be that AI art is uncopyrightable in the UK.A law was passed in the UK in 1988 that said computer-generated art could be copyrighted by the person who set up the computer to produce it, even if the person played no role in the generation of the work.However, in 2010 the UK (as part of the EU) signed on to the WIPO Copyright Treaty, which only allows copyright protection for works directly produced by humans.The Court of Justice of the European Union has made rulings that machine-generated works are not eligible for copyright, nor are any works generated within a strict framework of rules that limit human creativity. For example, somebody tried to copyright a football game, the court said that even though humans were exercising creativity within the game, the strict framework of the rules of football within which the creativity was exercised made the game ineligible for copyright.But the UK is no longer part of the EU, so European court rulings are presumably void there (although the UK is still a signatory to the WIPO Copyright Treaty). So I find it interesting that the judge in this ruling has largely reiterated the reasoning of the European court in the matter of the constraints the WCT imposes on machine-generated copyright (“This criterion is not satisfied where the content of the work is dictated by technical considerations, rules or other constraints which leave no room for creative freedom”.)So on its face this ruling seems to nullify the 1988 law and make AI-generated art uncopyrightable in the UK. It will be interesting to see if anyone tries to establish this explicitly. reply krisoft 12 hours agoparentIn reality all generative art (both AI generated and old fashioned procedurally generated art) involves a human tweaking the knobs a lot and then selecting the best ones out of a sea of duds. To me it is clear that there is plenty of space for human creativity. reply blacksqr 5 hours agorootparentBut the key is that not all creativity can be copyrighted. Both US law and the Berne Convention (which almost all countries are party to) permit copyright only for artifacts fixed in a tangible medium, and it must be a human that does the fixing.Tweaking knobs or writing prompts before the actual fixing is done doesn&#x27;t count.

The REUL Act came from Jakob Rees-Mogg MP and it&#x27;s very much in meeting with his ethos to &#x27;salt the land&#x27; and cause damage for generations if he can get a couple of bags of silver out of the deal.Long story short: we&#x27;re still following EU law in a lot of areas, but not for much longer.

Life + 70 so in average 110 years coverage is ridiculous. Why is that not good? Because it push studio to milk their cash cow forever (as we see with the big franchises occupying all multimedia space and monopolizing all large investments) and it just limits creativity. If the duration was reduced it would force them to invest on creators to find new successes and that would benefit the general public and the creators.Fair use is also far too restrictive as we see with LLMs. What do you think about when you read \"video game plumber\"? So basically it became a foundational concept cognitively for you and me (polite way to say that we&#x27;ve been brainwashed by millions of $ in investment in publicity such that the concept is deeply ingrained in our minds) and on top of occupying a significant amount of space in our brains we should be forbidden to use the concept in our communication and creative work? reply Dylan16807 13 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think the pattern you&#x27;re describing exists.I&#x27;ve seen a few people want to abolish copyright, but not many.

The U.S. Central Command said the Singapore-flagged Maersk Hangzhou reported it was struck by a missile while transiting the Southern Red Red Sea at approximately 8:30 p.m. local time on Saturday. The ship requested assistance and is said to be “seaworthy” with no reported injuries. The USS Gravely and USS Laboon responded to the incident, with the USS Gravely successfully shooting down two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. Maersk confirmed details of the incident in a statement to gCaptain. The vessel was traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait en route from Singapore to Port Suez, Egypt, when the crew observed a “flash” on deck. The vessel and crew are reported safe. “At approximately 06:30 pm CET, when the vessel was 55nm southwest of Al Hudaydah, Yemen, the crew reported having observed a flash on deck. However, there is no indication of fire onboard the vessel, and we are currently working to ascertain the full details of the incident.

The incident comes has Maersk has been resuming transits through the Red Sea with the establishment of the US-led Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG) naval coalition, while some other carriers have opted to continue to reroute ships around the Cape of Good Hope due to safety concerns as the Iran-backed Houthis have continued to carry out missile attacks against commercial shipping. Maersk suspended transits through the Red Sea back on December 15 a day after a near-miss missile attack on the Maersk Gibraltar near the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, connecting the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden. The announcement by Maersk led to other operators also suspending voyages and redirecting ships around the Cape of Good Hope. Since then about half of the containerships that normally transit the region have been rerouted. Denmark on Friday said it was sending a frigate to join Operation Prosperity Guardian. The Central Command said the incident the 23rd illegal attack by the Houthis on international shipping since the November 19 hijacking of the Galaxy Leader car carrier, which continues by be held in Yemeni waters.

As if the houthis in yemen are attacking ships because they like it or just because they \"hate developed societies\".Their declared reason is to put pressure on Israel to allow humanitarian aid to Gaza at once. They target ships that have Israeli links or heading to Israeli ports.

Damn rockets why do they do that?Unfortunately, propaganda is part of the war and I can’t really blame them for trying. You can be sure that the other side of the conflict is also not impartial.If the reasons about killing each other were openly discussed in a logical way without the emotional overload, People wouldn’t bother to kill each other. That’s something undesirable in the context of war.I also think this is not necessarily bad, because when you start thinking in cold blooded strategic way you may find out that exterminating certain people is beneficial for you. Therefore, you should do it.That level of thinking can be beneficial when you’re in the higher ranks, but a society shouldn’t be willing to destroy another society for material or political gains.

But there didn&#x27;t appear to be one. Was it because no human was aboard the drone (so no response was justified), from fear or escalation, or something else?In any case, if a large cargo ship were sunk, would the US or other nations go to war, would they retaliate with a similarly sized response, or would they do nothing (as with the Russian downing of the US drone).Does anyone have some good resources on this topic? As a layperson I find military responses difficult to predict. (I&#x27;m familiar with foundational game theory, but not specific to international relations and security) reply pclmulqdq 5 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s time to read some Clausewitz. That book outlines the philosophy of how most western states think about war. The short version I would say is that war is a tool of politics, so if there is no political goal, there will be no war, regardless of how bad the supposed Causus Belli is.Shooting down a drone usually doesn&#x27;t do it partly because of the political implications: it would be deeply unpopular to put \"boots on the ground\" over a shot-down drone. reply snek_case 3 hours agorootparentSeems to me that trigger events for wars are often about finding a justification for a war that people in power were already wanting to start. America doesn&#x27;t want to go to war with Russia because we know it could be incredibly destructive, given that they have nukes. So, it would probably take a lot to start a war between the US and Russia. They would have to attack or be clearly planning to attack a NATO ally.It&#x27;s possible that even if Russia intentionally downed a US jet, it would not immediately trigger a war.

IME what may differ the most between &#x27;popular&#x27; takes on IR and professional ones is the response to incidents.Arguably the #1 priority of professional IR is to prevent wars (with occasional exceptions, such as Russia or Hamas recently, but even they want to control when, where, and how). Wars can and do happen whether you want them or not; if you want to prevent them, good will - even on both sides - is not nearly sufficient. You need to understand the mechanisms and operate them effectively. It&#x27;s not about game theory, but a very human, emotional mechanism:The fundamental mechanism is politics. The most fundamental theory of warfare, courtesy of Carl von Clausewitz, is that it is \"The continuation of political intercourse, with the addition of other means ...\", the other means being violence. Warfare is politics, carried out through violence rather than through elections, negotiation, etc.Another mechanism is the cycle of escalation. You&#x27;ll see non-experts say, when threatened or attacked, &#x27;we should strike back harder!&#x27;: It&#x27;s emotionally satisfying, it feels safer - anger helps people feel safe in danger, and attacking feels powerful; also it sells well politically for those reasons - the politician looks &#x27;tough&#x27; and won&#x27;t be called &#x27;weak&#x27;. And here&#x27;s that fundamental mechanism, politics: Experts know that a common cause of unwanted warefare is the cycle of escalation. Both sides &#x27;strike back harder&#x27; - the other side responds just like you do - and the political machine revs higher and hotter, and, well, war is politcs - at a certain point, you can&#x27;t stop the war. One diplomat I read said, &#x27;the job of diplomacy is to prevent a B-level problem from turning into an A-level problem&#x27;.IR professionals need to find ways to respond - to deter and at the same time for their leaders to succeed in that political machine - without escalating. For example, years ago North Korea did something threatening regarding their nuclear weapons program. I wondered how the US would respond. The US flew a nuclear-capable (but not nuclear armed) bomber from the US, over South Korea, and back to the US. There was no threat to NK from one bomber, but the message was clear - we can reach you from the US (so destroying SK will not protect you), we have vast capabilities you don&#x27;t and can&#x27;t stop, we also have nukes, we have a very close relationship with SK, and we are very serious.Another mechanism that causes warfare is a lack of flexibility, a lack of options. Popular takes on IR love to urge that a &#x27;line in the sand&#x27; or &#x27;redline&#x27; should be drawn - another tough, angry way to feel powerful and safe. You don&#x27;t see professionals say it however. For an example of why, remember early in the Syrian civil war when Assad was dropping chemical weapons on their own population. The US publicly announced a &#x27;redline&#x27;, saying use of chemical weapons would result in (I forget what). Then Assad did it anyway. Now the US was caught - they had backed themselves in to a corner with their redline, taking away their own options. Assad chose their moment to embarass the US, and in the end, the US effectively backed down and lost credibility.If you have no options, then the other side pulls the strings; they can force you to act when, where, and how they want - and you can assume they will chose the worst possible situation for you. You&#x27;ll hear professionals say that leaders want options - lots of options. That&#x27;s why. If you fight or do anything, you want to do at the time, place, and with the means of your own choosing - another phrase you&#x27;ll hear.Finally, know that these very sensitive, complex mechanims tend to produce unintended consequences, and there are no take-backs. IR professionals craft responses very carefully and try to anticipate all contingencies, and then hold their breath. If your single bomb accidentally ignites the natural gas distribution network and blows up half the city, nothing will undo that. Even if they don&#x27;t want to, the enemy will be compelled - by that political mechanism - to respond as if you intentionally burned down the city and killed tens of thousands of civilians, and now you have a possible war and an enemy for generations.Hope that helps. I wish HN had some professionals in that field to chime in here. reply maeil 3 hours agorootparent> Another mechanism that causes warfare is a lack of flexibility, a lack of options.

Here&#x27;s the cycle:1. A major power backs a side in an internal struggle for their own end. If necessary, a conflict is manufactured by propping up rebels, a coup, etc;2. The other side, which tends to be the internally popular side, resists. Because of that popular support, they can survive, thrive and grow;3. Insurgencies are incredibly effective. Counter-insurgencies are incredibly difficult. The insurgents are fighting for their lives. The boots on the ground for the major power backed forces don&#x27;t tend to want to be there;4. Reactionary forces are seen by the besieged populace as emancipatory forces;5. When the resolve of the major power breaks or there is simply a policy shift, the unpopular government crumbles and is replaced by those reactionary forces. Classic example: the fundamentalist Iranian revolution of 1979. Go and look at what Iran was like before the 1953 coup.6. Those former insurgents become a regional thorn in the side for that major power for decades to come;7. The major power, unwilling to commit militarily, responds with economic sanctions. This does little more than starve people and kill people due to lack of medicine. But th eregime survives. It can even be strengthened as the citizens blame the major power for their plight.The Saudis committed genocide in Yemen. For years. And the world ignored it. They used US-supplied weapons to do it. At any time, the US could&#x27;ve ended Saudi atrocities in Yemen with a phone call.And now the Houthi rebels have become battle-hardened guerillas and insurgents, capable of projecting force into the vital shipping lanes of the Red Sea. Drones have become incredibly cheap, to the point that a ragtag group will tie up a US carrier group who will try to enforce security, much like they have done with, say, Somali pirates.The US carrier group may even adequately suppress the Houthis but this is attrition and Houthi investment is a drop in the ocean compared to the cost to the US.The last two decades saw a massive change in drone use by the military. It was always just a matter of time before that military technology filtered down to insurgents and it&#x27;s going to have a massive effect.We saw this in Afghanistan in the 1970s when US-supplied Stinger missiles completely changed the battlefield as they rendered Soviet gunships ineffective at an incredibly low cost.This isn&#x27;t a statement supporting the Houthis (or even denoucning them).

Fourteen of the injured later died, bringing the death toll to 266. A naval board of inquiry concluded that the blast was caused by a mine placed outside the ship. Release of the board’s report led many to accuse Spain of sabotage, helping to build public support for war. Subsequent studies, including one published in 1976 and later reissued in 1995, determined that the ship was destroyed from the inside, when burning coal in a bunker triggered an explosion in an adjacent space that contained ammunition.Law Library of Congress: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20210424181239&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.g...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;USS_Maine_(1889)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spanish%E2%80%93American_War reply sbierwagen 4 hours agorootparentprevIt would be a refreshing throwback to actually declare war, something the US hasn&#x27;t done since 1942. reply mikewarot 2 hours agorootparentWould you then have us nuke Yemen?That couldn&#x27;t possibly backfire.

    "title": "Introducing DRµGS: Enhancing Output Variety with Deep Random Micro-Glitch Sampling",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/EGjoni/DRUGS",
    "originBody": "DRµGS Stop messing around with finicky sampling parameters and just use DRµGS! This repo introduces Deep Random Micro-Glitch Sampling (DRµGS). The Problem: At a high level, the generative model landscape looks like first spending millions of dollars pretraining a giant model to predict the collective works of humanity, then giving those predictions to a dumb-as-rocks random number generator to kindly take into consideration in its role as the final arbiter over the multi-million dollar model's canonical output (which the model is then forced to commit to on its next prediction pass). This is kinda nuts. The Solution: DRµGS just inverts this scheme. Instead of using noise to sample from the model's predictions, DRµGS injects noise directly into the transformer layers at inference time, thereby varying what the model predicts. From here, simply selecting the most likely prediction is often enough to increase output variety while maintaining coherence. Intuitively, the primary advantage of this scheme (though there's more than one) is that the model has ample opportunity in its later layers to correct or account for our perturbations in its earlier layers. Should I use DRµGS? Absolutely. But do note that this proof of concept repo only supports LLaMA and mistral models. This isn't a technical limitation, and I'm very open to contributions from anyone willing to help me make DRµGS. You can get a sense of its generation quality in this colab chat with Alan Watts. Are there any negative side effects from using DRµGS? Negative side effects are difficult to identify subjectively, and in my experience DRµGs feel great the whole time you're using them. In theory however, yes, prolonged use of DRµGS can have negative side effects that get worse over time. Specifically, when injecting noise into layers =n will be conditioned on this noisy input, and if you're using kv-caching, that noise-conditioned prediction will remain in the cache only to be pertutbed again on the next forward pass. This library includes a cold_shower function, which periodically sobers up the cache after every t-predictions, or which you can elect to call yourself while the model is awaiting user input. This is to allow for some measure of theoretical purity, but again, in my experience it seems unnecessary, and using it means contending with periodically having to wait for your model to finish its shower before it can use more DRµGS. What kind of DRµGs can I use? While not an exhaustive list of the DRµGs that are theoretically possible, this repo provides implementations and experimental data for four types of DRµGs. These are Q, K, V, and A; which inject noise into the Query, Key, Value, and Attention head outputs, respectively. How do I use DRµGs? First, install this library. pip install git+https://github.com/EGjoni/DRUGS.git Then, import it into your project, and decide which and how much DRµGS you want your model to use. import torch from transformers import AutomodelForCausalLM, Autotokenizer, TextStreamer from drugs.dgenerate import DRUGS model_id = \"NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\" #or whatever LLaMA2 or mistral variant you prefer tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id) sober_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"auto\") sober_model.eval() #prepare DRUGS, then inject into the model. drugs = DRUGS() drugs.set_A_dose_theta(0.1) model = drugs.inject(sober_model) You can then call model() as usual for a single forward pass, or use the DRUGS equivalent of model.generate as follows: streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer) with torch.no_grad(): generated_tokens = model.Dgenerate( #capital 'D' before generate to distinguish from regular .generate() input_ids = tokenized_start, streamer = streamer ) Optionally, you can specify how deep you want you want to inject which type of DRµGs by defining a DRµG profile. injection_depth = 0.4 #how deep to shove the needle in (0 is first layer, 1 is last layer) spread = 0.1 #how many layers to dose on either side of the injection site (0 is no layers, 1 is all layers) drug_profile = ([ {'depth': (injection_depth-(spread*1.01)), 'peakratio': 0}, #ramp up {'depth': (injection_depth-spread), 'peakratio': 1}, #sustained peak {'depth': (injection_depth+spread), 'peakratio' : 1}, #sustained peak {'depth': (injection_depth+(spread*1.01)), 'peakratio' : 0}], #cool down 'ceil') drugs.set_A_dose_shape(drug_profile) For more examples, take a look at just_chat.ipynb What is a reasonable dose of DRµGS? The `dose_theta`` parameter basically just defines a maximum angle in radians by which to randomly rotate the A, Q, K, or V vectors. You probably shouldn't go past 0.1, but this kind of depends on the DRµG type and injection sites. This is also kind of where things get interesting. Consider the following starting prompt:[INST] Write an epic rap battle between William Rowe Hamilton and Lord Kelvin[/INST] [Scene: A dark and dimly lit underground rap club, the air thick with anticipation. The crowd is on the edge of their seats as two of the greatest minds in science history take the stage. William Rowe Hamilton and Lord Kelvin are about to engage in an epic rap battle.] William Rowe Hamilton: Yo, I'm the king of the math game, With equations that'll make your head spin like a flame, I'm the one who brought you quaternions, And I'll leave you in the dust, like a poor excuse for a reason. Lord Kelvin: Hold up, Hamilton, you ain't ready, I'm the one who's got the science, the facts, and the A fully sober model predicts the most likely next token is \"energy\". If we store the hidden states at each layer for the vector corresponding to that prediction, we can visualize the effects of injecting various amounts of noise at various layers (keep an eye on the title at the top) K_dose_layer.mp4 K_dose_fullstack.mp4 A_dose_layer.mp4 A_dose_fullstack.mp4 (Interactive versions of these graphs, as well as ones for Q and V dosages are available as .html files in the experiments/vergence_plots/Hamilton_* directory of this repo) To clarify these graphs: The prediction texts on the top right correspond solely to a (quite high) dosage theta of 0.7. The predictions listed are the top 10 most likely as per the sober model. The ||| bars indicate likelihood as per the DRµGS augmented model, turning into - to indcate how far they fall short of the baseline prediction, or + to indicate how much they exceed the baseline prediction. Each video frame shows a different range of layers into which noise is being injected (as indicarted by the graph title at that frame) The horizontal axis shows the layer at which divergence is being measured. The vertical axis shows the degree of divergence at that layer. And the remaining axis shows the dose theta that was used to cause that degree of divergence. It might be a bit much to grok at a glance, but once you've wrapped your head around it, a few things might immediately stand out. First, we can add quite a lot of noise in earlier layers and the model very quickly drowns that noise out with its own signal. (This is likely part of why franken-merges work so well. It's not just that the residual stream keeps values in a reasonable region to avoid too much harm, it seem to be also that each layer of the model actively wants to push its inputs into something it can make sense of). Second, something special seems to happen in the middle layers that causes relatively large spikes in output divergence. And third, the most likely prediction changes, but generally remains reasonable. I feel like there's a lot more to play with and discover here, but, it's gonna need crowdsourcing. Personally my next step is to (very seriously) explore the potential of DRµGS to control model hallucinations. Anyway -- critiques and contributions welcome. And I'll have a mistral implementation up soon right now. It's up. In the meantime, please experiment with DRµGS!",

I haven&#x27;t dug too deep in and I have a mostly elementary understanding of neural nets. No need to _entirely_ dumb it down though, just needing a smarter person to confirm or correct my understanding. :)Is this influencing the probabilities of token output? My understanding is that currently it is a static value that is essentially \"how wild do you want it to be\" where each generation has a different consistent static value of \"wildness\".So rather than using a static value for an entire generation, this dynamically injects randomness in so rather than the output being &#x27;monotone&#x27;, it is more dynamic rather than by-the-book that AI tends to be? reply andy99 15 hours agoparentTypically the output of an LLM is a classifier that gives scores reflecting the \"best\" next token, for some measure of best. You can deterministically just take the highest score or you can randomly sample in a way that makes it more likely to get a token with a higher score, according to different schemes. The point is that this all rests in the performance of the output classifier layer.From my skim, this proposes to inject randomness throughout the model (as opposed to just during sampling the classifier output) which according to the author (I&#x27;m paraphrasing) lets the full power of the model be used to make the most of that randomness, instead of just jittering the output. So the output is still random but it&#x27;s a function of random noise being added through the model layers instead of just at the output, supposedly demonstrating better properties. I have no opinion about it as I haven&#x27;t studied it. reply madamelic 14 hours agorootparent> You can deterministically just take the highest score or you can randomly sample in a way that makes it more likely to get a token with a higher score, according to different schemes.Ah ok, so it&#x27;s like the difference between greedily always taking the shortest &#x2F; highest value vs using A* and exploring alternatives in hopes of finding something better? That probably doesn&#x27;t line up as a metaphor as it isn&#x27;t \"exploring\" or running multiple parallel generations.And it employs the method in the layers so that the benefit can be amplified rather than only employing the method in the final layer &#x2F; output when it selects the output to take reply doctorpangloss 14 hours agorootparentThe difference is between something that makes sense (the way the model is intended to be used) and something that makes almost no sense (this repository).> benefitIn an intellectually honest way, it is not conclusive if there is a benefit to the approach in this repository.

I just googled \"Internet Historian\" and a cancellation style reddit post was the third result. I even mentioned that I only did a quick google; I encourage you to do your own research here and form your own opinion on this. I have heard of Jontron but I am not familiar nor have I read anything about that. reply tadfisher 15 hours agorootparentprevJonTron actually said white supremacist stuff on video, for which he later apologized (why he&#x27;s not part of Game Grumps anymore). reply GaggiX 14 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean? He left Game Grumps in 2013, way before he said anything controversial. reply zoklet-enjoyer 15 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m still not really sure what gamer gate was or who the Internet historian is reply IshKebab 12 hours agorootparentprevI think to be \"cancelled\" you have to actually get cancelled from somewhere... His Youtube channel seems to be going fine.It&#x27;s very obvious from his videos that he is a 4chan troll. Didn&#x27;t know he was full on Nazi though. reply Log_out_ 16 hours agoprevNothing like good old monk humor about sex.. Unless druggy humor by the notoriously drug free.. reply golergka 15 hours agoparentYes, because HN crowd or AI&#x2F;software crowd in general is famous for being drug free and never indulging in various psychedelics out in the desert. reply BossingAround 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s kind of funny, I don&#x27;t really see psychedelics as \"drugs\" in the same way that you wouldn&#x27;t view coffee as a drug. I don&#x27;t think SW engineers are, for example, known for taking meth or heroin, so I&#x27;d definitely call the group fairly \"drug free\".I&#x27;d think (based on nothing but my experience) that your average nurse might have higher likelihood of taking hard drugs than an average SWE :) reply knutzui 13 hours agorootparentFrom Wikipedia: > A drug is any chemical substance that when consumed causes a change in an organism&#x27;s physiology, including its psychology, if applicable.Coffee, psychedelics and alcohol are drugs just like heroin. Whether you believe they are useful to consume is a different matter. reply golergka 15 hours agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t think SW engineers are, for example, known for taking methSome people think meth means “amphetamine” (although it usually methamphetamine), and there’s a lot of software engineers who take different types of prescribed amphetamines like Adderal and Ritalin.And don’t even get me started on weed and millenials. reply danielbln 14 hours agorootparentMethylphenidate is not an amphetamine but your points stand. reply mettamage 15 hours agorootparentprevIf they would, they would be burning man. Nothing to ignite some passion than a deep dive in the desert ;) reply baq 13 hours agorootparentprevOut in the desert is more extraordinary than microdosing while WFH I guess reply stavros 16 hours agoprevAhh yes, the old drmgs. reply nyolfen 16 hours agoprev [–] i was just wondering yesterday what happened to this guy replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
