    "content": "Chris Siebenmann :: CSpace \u00bb blog \u00bb sysadmin \u00bb ReportConfigFileLocationsWelcome, guest.Everything that uses configuration files should report where they're locatedJune 24, 2023Here's something that I've come to strongly believe as a system administrator: if a program uses a configuration file (or several), it should have an obvious command line way to find out where it expects to find that configuration file.As a system administrator I deal with a lot of different programs that use configuration files, most of which have their own normal locations for those files. Sometimes this is a system wide location, sometimes this is a per-user location, and some have both. I'm sure that all of these locations are obvious to people who deal with the particular program regularly, but I don't (always) do that. Some programs I touch only rarely, and others can be built differently on different systems. Naturally, I don't remember where their configuration files are located on this system today, so I wind up having to find this out somehow. Ideally I'd like to avoid scanning all the way through the manual page or other documentation for the program to find out, because that's slow and annoying.(One of my ways around this is to ask the system's packaging system what package the program comes from and then look through the list of files and directories owned by that package to try to find something likely. Sadly, this doesn't always work.)What I want is for programs to have a straightforward way of reporting what (and where) their configuration files are. In order to be genuinely straightforward, this needs to be either reported in the standard help output for the program (eg, in 'program --help') or the special way to find out should be explicitly mentioned in the program's standard help output. Other more obscure options don't really cut it.When reporting these locations, programs should fully expand things and report the location they'll use given the current settings of things like environment variables, although I will give programs a pass on not expanding $HOME to its current value. This is especially relevant for things like per-user configuration files that follow the XDG standard, because the XDG configuration location is affected by environment variables. This is one reason programs may want to report this through a separate option or commands.I award a semi-honorable mention to programs that will report this information but hide the details so deep in their help that you'll never find it unless you're already reasonably familiar with them. Sadly, Go's toolchain is one such system; if you don't have some idea where to look, you're probably never finding 'go env GOENV' on your own.(6 comments.)Written on 24 June 2023.\u00ab Go 1.21 will (probably) download newer toolchains on demand by defaultWhy use 'TEST-NET' IP addresses in general documentation instead of RFC 1918 ranges \u00bbThese are my WanderingThoughts(About the blog)Full index of entriesRecent commentsThis is part of CSpace, and is written by ChrisSiebenmann.Mastodon: @cksTwitter: @thatcks* * *Categories: links, linux, programming, python, snark, solaris, spam, sysadmin, tech, unix, webAlso: (Sub)topicsThis is a DWiki.GettingAround(Help)Search:Page tools: View Source, Add Comment.Search:Login: Password:Atom Syndication: Recent Comments.Last modified: Sat Jun 24 22:47:26 2023This dinky wiki is brought to you by the Insane Hackers Guild, Python sub-branch.",

OpenResume\u2019s auto format feature is a great help to ensure consistent format.Ms. Spiegel\u2022EducatorI used OpenResume during my last job search and was invited to interview at top tech companies such as Google and Amazon thanks to its slick yet professional resume design.Santi\u2022Software EngineerCreating a professional resume on OpenResume is so smooth and easy! It saves me so much time and headache to not deal with google doc template.Vivian\u2022College StudentQuestions & AnswersQ1. What is a resume builder? Why resume builder is better than resume template doc?There are two ways to create a resume today. One option is to use a resume template, such as an office/google doc, and customize it according to your needs. The other option is to use a resume builder, an online tool that allows you to input your information and automatically generates a resume for you.Using a resume template requires manual formatting work, like copying and pasting text sections and adjusting spacing, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. It is easy to run into formatting issues, such as using different bullet points or font styles after copying and pasting. On the other hand, a resume builder like OpenResume saves time and prevents formatting mistakes by automatically formatting the resume. It also offers the convenience of easily changing font types or sizes with a simple click. In summary, a resume builder is easier to use compared to a resume template.Q2. What uniquely sets OpenResume apart from other resume builders and templates?Other than OpenResume, there are some great free resume builders out there, e.g. Reactive Resume, FlowCV. However, OpenResume stands out with 2 distinctive features:1. OpenResume is designed specifically for the U.S. job market and best practices.Unlike other resume builders that target a global audience and offer many customization options, OpenResume intentionally only offers options that are aligned with U.S. best practices. For example, it excludes the option to add a profile picture to avoid bias and discrimination. It offers only the core sections, e.g. profile, work experience, education, and skills, while omitting unnecessary sections like references. Additionally, OpenResume only offers a top down single column resume design as opposed to two column design, because single column design works best for AST.2. OpenResume is super privacy focus.While other resume builders may require email sign up and store user data in their databases, OpenResume believes that resume data should remain private and accessible only on user\u2019s local machine. Therefore, OpenResume doesn\u2019t require sign up to use the app, and all inputted data is stored in user\u2019s browser that only user has access to.Q3. Who created OpenResume and why?OpenResume was created by Xitang Zhao and designed by Zhigang Wen as a weekend project. As immigrants to the US, we had made many mistakes when creating our first resumes and applying for internships and jobs. It took us a long while to learn some of the best practices. While mentoring first generation students and reviewing their resumes, we noticed students were making the same mistakes that we had made before. This led us to think about how we can be of help with the knowledge and skills we have gained. We started chatting and working over the weekends that led to OpenResume, where we integrated best practices and our knowledge into this resume builder. Our hope is that OpenResume can help anyone to easily create a modern professional resume that follows best practices and enable anyone to apply for jobs with confidence.Q4. How can I support OpenResume?The best way to support OpenResume is to share your thoughts and feedback with us to help further improve it. You can send us an email at hello@open-resume.com or open an issue at our Github repository. Whether you like it or not, we would love to hear from you.Another great way to support OpenResume is by spreading the words. Share it with your friends, on social media platforms, or with your school\u2019s career center. Our goal is to reach more people who struggle with creating their resume, and your word-of-mouth support would be greatly appreciated. If you use Github, you can also show your support by giving the project a star to help increase its popularity and reach.",

The idea came to me while I was mentoring students and noticing common mistakes they made in their resumes that I had also made in the past. I thought to build a tool to help people easily create a modern professional resume with built-in best practices to avoid those mistakes.Top highlights of the resume builder are:1. Real time UI update as you type2. ATS friendly to top ATS platforms, e.g. Greenhouse, Lever3.

I also explained the parser algorithm in an article with interactive tables that might be an interesting read to see the steps and logics it uses (https://www.open-resume.com/resume-parser).I hope others might find this tool useful and I look forward to hearing any feedback the community has.

I'll probably use it in the future.I don't mean to sound rude. But, can you explain what you mean by \"trusted by students and employees from top universities and companies worldwide\" while showing some university/company logos? How can such a new project make those claims? Was it released elsewhere privately? Looking at the git history, I see it was created 2 days ago, in a single commit.replytornato7 15 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]He could have just sent it to a few friends at those universities/companies. Nobody should take those sorts of 'trusted by' sections seriously anyway.replythrowaway2037 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Real question: How much do you think young start-ups pay majors to add their name to the 'trusted by' sections? For me, it feels like paid adverts in search results. I always ignore/discount them. That said, 'trusted by' sections are targeting The Suits (CTOs, etc.), not hands-on folks like me.replyvasco 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]They're targeting the marketing person that put them there because the landing page template they bought to customize had such a section. Nobody gets paid anything for it.replyxitang 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Thanks for you kind word and for asking this great question. I have to admit that the claim is more for marketing purpose to make it look impressive. The truth is that we tested the design with a small group of folks, including myself, students, a career coach and friends. We use this design during our job searches and we have landed interviews/offers from the companies listed in the logo clouds. It works for a small sample size of us, so we include the logos up there to enhance its credibility that it at least has proven to work for some companies out there.replyrosmax_1337 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]>I have to admit that the claim is more for marketing purpose to make it look impressive.If you are going to be honest about lying by admitting to us that you lied, just state that it was a lie, don't euphemize it as marketing. Otherwise the \"honesty\" just comes of as manipulation.replyxitang 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I apologize for the confusion the statement has caused and comes off as lying. The statement is accurate and is in fact tested & likened by students and employees listed in the logo cloud. I appreciate the feedback that given it is only a handful of us, this statement can give the wrong impressions that it is more widely used than people perceive. I want to keep the project honest, clear and transparent as much as possible and I just create the issue to track this: https://github.com/xitanggg/open-resume/issues/7. I will remove the statement next to not mislead anyone and might consider adding it back only if we have more social proofs from more users in the future.replygoncalomb 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I guess you could just be totally open about it, and change the wording to something like \"the open-resume design already helped some people land positions at\", then show the logos. That way you are being honest, and doesn't look like a direct endorsement from those companies. You get your logos for \"marketing\", and you are safe from misinterpretation.

The lie was by layout and usage of company and university logos. These kinds of \"we are trusted by\" and \"in cooperation with\" sections are common, it's what you're making in that section, and the usage of logos in those sections always mean the same thing: these organisations use/trust our software.replyskwirl 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Where was the lie? It\u2019s pretty crappy to baselessly accuse someone of lying.replyrosmax_1337 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]They claimed companies like Google and some universities trusted their software. If you read it word by word, it was only a claim that people who worked at the companies and who studied at the universities trusted their software, but the usage of company and university logos also made clear claim that the companies and universities themselves had endorsed it.They admitted it was for marketing purposes, and I added that rather than to euphemize it as marketing, they should instead admit that they lied, otherwise their attempt at honesty comes of as manipulative. It is possible to tell a lie by the usage of logos and layout, not only in text.This has now been removed from their website, you can see their original layout here: https://web.archive.org/web/20230625170119/https://www.open-...replydotandgtfo 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I don't really attribute this maliciously.

(Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.)They tried to use other organizations logos in their \"loved by section\" to make their product seem more trustworthy than it was. By using smart language they could have gotten away with it in case of a lawsuit, and most companies don't even bother to go after stuff like this. By the time a lawsuit could have been relevant, their landing page would have changed. It's because I respect their competence that I attribute it as intentional.Don't get me wrong, I don't give a rats ass about what someone does with some large company/organization logos on their website, it's not that I'm trying to stop some misuse of their trademarks. But if you chat with us about your page, and try to be honest about that the section there is toeing the line of truth, don't call it marketing, just tell us you lied on your webpage. It's not the end of the world to tell a lie on the internet.replycaboteria 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.Sorry, this false dichotomy is one of my pet peeves.

The composition of a resume acted as a primary filter from people who couldn't even organize a few lines of information about themselves.Then, an internet company in our country took over the market and almost all jobs are searched through it. Of course,it features a very nice resume builder, so now everyone has a nice resume and we can't even filter out the worst candidates without an investigative effort.Thus, this work is commendable, but might have harmful effects.replyAHOHA 15 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]You are discriminating against the candidates who might have some disabilities (whether they know they have or not) like dyslexia, you are also discriminating against candidates whose English (or whatever that language in your country) isn\u2019t their first, even though they might be the best suited candidates, best programmers/engineers/etc., I have seen this first hand in some interviews, where some candidates eliminated from the first round by hiring managers because of similar issues or even silly ones like having an accent, after I -as the technical interviewer- gave the green light thay they are qualified for the second one.replyAndrew_nenakhov 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, when hiring I do discriminate against candidates with bad skills.Reading and writing, communication in written form is a critical skill for a software developer, more important than even coding skills (btw, I'm yet to see a person who can code and can't write, or even hear about such person). It is irrelevant, what is the reason for the lack of skill - innate disability or low intelligence - if you can't clearly and precisely communicate with your coworkers, you'll create more problems for the team than you will solve.And speaking of discrimination, you wouldn't hire a paraplegic person as a nurse or firefighter, right?replyAHOHA 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]As I mentioned in the comment below, this is the first excuse for such discrimination, as most of the times they do properly communicate and can effectively communicate the idea, but it\u2019s the covert way of discriminating them. One of the examples I witnessed, someone was from Singapore -and in Singapore just like a lot of other countries, English IS native, i.e. taught early in life- but they do have a thick accents, and the candidate was eliminated because of that, and obviously the hiring manager made the same silly excuse like you so he can feel better about himself, that it will \u201chinder\u201d the communications. As long as the communication can be conducted, anything else is pure linguistics bias, you don\u2019t see such bias when an international team of scientists are working in a space station or similar projects for example, even though in a lot of cases they lack the vocabulary per se, and lacking such vocabulary did not indicate a lack of skill or intelligence either, let alone to be evaluated by an average IQ hiring manager.Another case I witnessed was in Canada, where French is an official language, yet the hiring manager excluded one candidate because he had a thick French accent..Technically speaking too, there\u2019s nothing as \u201cnative English\u201d, we all do have an accent to some degree, a lot of English vocabulary are taken from other languages, and even English speakers do have a lot of silly typos and mistakes in their writing all the time, including my writings in here, so it\u2019s never an excuse.>And speaking of discrimination, you wouldn't hire a paraplegic person as a nurse or firefighter, right?That\u2019s a poor analogy, you do have the tools to properly and easily compensate such linguistic disability, as easy as having someone double checking their writing or having one of these new AI spell check tools, etc., but we don\u2019t have the proper technology and tools to compensate for a paraplegic to be a firefighter, yet, say in the future there are proven ex-skeletons that can help, then yes you are discriminating.replyChymeraXYZ 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> That\u2019s a poor analogy, you do have the tools to properly and easily compensate such linguistic disability, as easy as having someone double checking their writing or having one of these new AI spell check tools, etc.If the hypothetical person in question had such tools, then we would not see their \"handicap\" right?

The (supposedly non-discriminatory) \"preferences\" of the hiring managers are frequently... discriminatory! It's the worst when the hiring manager is mono-cultural and only speaks a single language (English). Most middle managers are looking to hire people that are a dumber version of themselves and easy to control -- \"sheep\", if you like. The rare middle managers try to hire people smarter than themselves.The bit about:  hire a paraplegic person as a nurse or firefighterI like how they picked a tiny sliver of jobs that might require full mobility. Thinking deeper: I am sure there are many nursing jobs that can be done from a wheelchair. And why not doctors? (See Dr. House, with a limb, a cane, and an on-again-off-again opioid addiction!) There are plenty of jobs that can done in a hospital and fire department that do not require all of your limbs. A lot of the work involves sitting in an office, typing on a PC.Once, I had an office mate who had a single hand. Incredibly, he was a member of a \"fast reaction\" front-line support team.

Same goes with accent, it isn\u2019t about the ability to communicate but rather the accent or linguistics bias either by not hiring these candidates, or excluding them later from meetings, presentations, etc., or eliminating any future career growth.Obviously those discriminations are illegal so it goes passive most of the times, by continuous interruption during meetings or intentionally asked to repeat or elaborate themselves, among other.It\u2019s not about communication abilities as this is usually the covert passive response for such discriminatory behaviors, a lot of these candidates can speak \u201cbetter\u201d in terms of clarity than people with Australian accent for example, it\u2019s just another episode of \u201cI\u2019m better than you\u201d, you can read more about that in here:https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210528-the-pervasive-...https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2022/11/18/accent-...https://exceptionalindividuals.com/about-us/blog/what-is-dys...replyAndrew_nenakhov 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> it is YOUR job as an employer to provide the proper toolI love it when people from internet forums are telling me what my job is.You know, your way of thinking will eventually lead to understanding that interviewing is inherently discriminatory against everyone but the best candidate, and thus must be abolished.

Very interesting to learn that the resume composition was a primary filter back then.As you note, with the advancement of internet and proliferation of internet companies/tools, it is much easier to get a nice resume design than ever before, e.g. one can easily look it up on google and pay to use it. A problem I see and motivates me to create this tool is that this can create an unequal playing field, where students/folks with more resources can easily afford to pay for such tool and have their resume well formatted and ATS tested. I created this tool in hopes to eliminate this barrier and to allow anyone to have a good starting resume design with built-in best practices so they are in the level playing field.Having a well formatted resume is only the first step, as it still requires a lot of works and thinking for someone to write down their experiences and descriptions, where it should yield more signals on the candidates.

I ask this because I have seen resumes that employ a two column layout where the section title is on the left and the information for that section is on the right (possibly with multiple lines in the same section) separated by a 1 line gap between sections in most cases (the experience section is the one exception to that on my resume). My resume is also like this and I haven't had too much trouble with it (yet).When I ran an example of this type of resume through the tool, it found the basic profile information but blanked on everything else - I would imagine that some other tools might employ things like OCR to solve this case as the text would be mostly reasonably grouped together in OCR output.Edit: Fixed saying right twice instead of left and right.

Of course, with this kind of skill-self-description there will always be difficulties, i.e., one does not always know what one does not know etc. But it seems to me that e.g., a duration of full-time or equivalent experience with a technology would provide a better way of measuring experience than these arbitrary scales?replyclnq 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The skill bars or skill meters are completely useless because one person's 10/10 is another person's 2/10.

If I were to add a new role to the CV and include the company name, I'd expect the platform to be smart enough to recognise that there isn't enough room for the entire entry and to move the name and the first couple of associated bullets to the next page instead of awkwardly splitting them across two pages.- I also noticed that my Word CV fits on 2.7 pages, while the document on your editor spans 3.5 pages, with identical font sizes and types.

Would you mind sharing more about your use case of the resume scanner?replyjuliusgeo 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yeah, I see what you mean. In my case it is because I use LaTeX to create my resume, and my main concern is just that in some ATS systems it doesn't parse correctly and it would be nice to know when I'm making the resume, rather than when I apply for the job. For people without an existing opinionated workflow (likely the bulk), the resume scanner would be a good way to help them understand the value proposition of a unified builder that works with most ATS systems by design, rather than as an afterthought (which seems to be the case with most resume builders online besides this one).replyrazemio 15 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Just as a thought.

It is a great tool and an inspiration for this project. How well the resume is parsed depends largely on the format you choose. Two column resume designs look good but aren't ATS friendly.

I tested the resume design with ATS platforms like greenhouse and lever to ensure they are parsed correctly, but their algorithm remains a black box and I am not aware of how it actually works. The resume parser I created is my attempt to create a simple version of the parser. I would think their approach might be something similar but definitely more sophisticated and better tested, but I hope this simple resume parser can help give some ideas on how your resume perform and what is going on behind the scene, e.g. having explained how it works in the article, it might be more clear why some fancier resume designs, such as two columns resume, are not ATS friendly, since it would require more complicated parsing logics and most platforms might not offer it.replytacone 16 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I wrote my own (code first) resume generator and I am very curious about your project, also for things I didn't know about like ATS.

I have learned a lot while building this project and am happy to share thoughts if you have any questions. I document my code extensively so I hope it can be helpful reference too.

Curious to know if this supports the JSON Resume format.replyxitang 15 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Thanks for your kind words. When creating the resume state structure, I have considered making it a JSON Resume format so it is compatible with other JSON Resume as well as tools that built on top of JSON Resume. However, after looking more into JSON Resume's schema, I find it to be a bit more restrictive than I would like, e.g. it includes a startDate and endDate as date type for work experience, but I want to combine both into date so user can type anything they like `June 2022 - Present` or `06/2022 - Present`. Also, for skills, JSON Resume has a very fixed structured but I want to give users the freedom to type anything in any format. Overall, I think JSONResume works well on its own and defines each field very well. But when thinking in product level, these restrictions might pose too much restrictions, so I ultimately create my own custom resume state type.replydr_kiszonka 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This sounds reasonable.

    "content": "ADVERTISEMENT Home//CognoscentiCOMMENTARYThe \u2018manning up of boys begins in the cradle.\u2019 But what boys really need is emotional support from their dadsJune 15, 2023Andrew ReinerfacebookEmailMy own research and work with boys has taught me that the more we ignore their deeper emotional needs in the name of early independence, the more public health risks they face as young adults, writes Andrew Reiner. (Getty Images)While doing research for a book I was writing, I interviewed high school-aged boys to discover who they turned to for emotional support. Spoiler alert: It wasn\u2019t their parents. \u201cMy parents, especially my father, always tell me that I need to learn to handle problems on my own,\u201d George, then a high school junior, told me. Six months before we talked, he had attempted suicide when his girlfriend ended their relationship and he felt incapable of handling the situation on his own.American males of every age, race and income level are lost and bewildered, angry and scared. Sobering new statistics suggest that when we set young men like George adrift too early, they sink instead of floating. That shouldn\u2019t be surprising. They receive very mixed messages: Men are too soft. Men are toxic. But one thing is clear: traditional tropes of masculinity \u2014 the tough guy who swallows his feelings and solves his own problems \u2014 no longer serve boys, men or the rest of us.Since the late-1970s, research has shown that infant boys are more sensitive. They experience more negative emotions and need more support. But according to psychologist Edward Tronick, a groundbreaking researcher in infant-mother relationships, many parents respond by withholding support.Why do they do this? Mostly because they simply aren\u2019t aware of boys\u2019 greater need for what Tronick calls \u201cemotional scaffolding.\u201d In fact, many of them still operate from a dusty playbook on masculinity that tells them to toughen up their sons. \u201cThe manning-up of boys begins in the cradle,\u201d says Tronick. Fathers and mothers use far more emotionally rich language with toddler-aged daughters than sons, for instance. Fathers are also more likely to sing to and soothe their toddler daughters at night when they cry.My own research and work with boys has taught me that the more we ignore their deeper emotional needs in the name of early independence, the more public health risks they face as young adults.Gendered expectations from parents, teachers and coaches only amplify when boys start school. There\u2019s a prevailing myth that boys are tough enough to handle the barbs of bullying, especially the smaller ones, but research tells us otherwise. A 2021 study showed that boys are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of bullying. In fact, bullied boys reported mental health problems at a rate four times higher than boys who weren\u2019t bullied. That\u2019s especially concerning given the long, toxic tail that bullying has for all children and given that bullying is one of several risk factors that increases the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.Things don\u2019t get easier for boys when they graduate high school. You may already know that women are more likely to be enrolled in college today than young men, but what you may not know is how much the men who attend college struggle. A four-year longitudinal study of more than 5,500 college students found that, unlike their female classmates, many young men don\u2019t seek emotional support when they need it because they fear being perceived as weak and ineffective. Another study found that the more these struggling young men ignore their need for support, the deeper they dig themselves into entrenched patterns of emotional avoidance, which compromise their academic success and emotional well-being.My own research and work with boys has taught me that the more we ignore their deeper emotional needs in the name of early independence, the more public health risks they face as young adults. The alarming rate of mortality for U.S. youth under the age of 25, the highest in the West, is largely fueled largely by gun violence, vehicular deaths, accidental injuries and the opioid epidemic. And all of these trends hit boys, whose brains don\u2019t mature until their mid-late 20s, harder than girls.Father\u2019s Day is the perfect time for us to rethink how we prepare boys for independence because dads are integral to providing the support older boys need for longer.So, what\u2019s the answer? The common reflex to shame young men for \u201cfailing to launch\" inevitably backfires. Sure, it might help you achieve desired results in the short term (a brief spurt when they do their own laundry or consistently seek academic help, for instance), but these behaviors rarely last, and the shaming adversely affects mental health in the long run.Father\u2019s Day is the perfect time for us to rethink how we prepare boys for independence, because dads are integral to providing the support older boys need for longer. New research shows that when fathers are present and emotionally invested in children\u2019s lives, they are more likely to develop a stronger sense of self-worth and excel in everything from school to relationships. This emotional bond is the X factor: It promotes cognitive growth and feelings of well-being and stability. It also diminishes violent behavior and depression far beyond childhood.It\u2019s ironic, but independence isn\u2019t something you can learn all by yourself. Boys need tolerant, empathetic adults in their lives in order to become self-reliant. They need to know that we care about and value them, even when we don\u2019t agree with their desires and decisions.ADVERTISEMENT We can turn the tide for boys by developing deeper connections with them and helping them do the same with others. Yes, we absolutely need to promote their autonomy, but we must also encourage effective self-agency. Praise them when they ask for help. Encourage them to share their struggles \u2014 with you, of course, but also with other trusted adults, a therapist or even friends.Boys who are taught to create emotional safety nets flourish as men. That\u2019s the lifeline they need to thrive.Follow Cognoscenti on Facebook and Instagram .",

Learning from it allowed me to live through the front end stack explosion, the micro-service overdose and many, many more silly trends.It turns out Grandma was right. Eat vegetables, exercise, sleep well.And use the right tool for the right job.Well, she didn't say that last one.But she could have.SubscribeHype cyclesWhen I started programming, XML was going to replace everything. HTML with XHTML, validation with DTD, transformation and presentation with XSLT, communication with SOAP.I missed the train on the OOP hype, that was the generation before me, but I read so many articles warning me about it, that I applied the reasoning to XML: let's wait and see if this is actually as good as they say before investing everything in it.Turns out, XML was not the future. It was mostly technical debt.It was useful for things like documents, and I believe the most successful use of it are still MS Office and LibreOffice file formats. They are just zips of XML.I was lucky to learn this lesson very early in my career: there is no silver bullet, any single tool, no matter how good it is, must be evaluated from the engineering point of view of pros and cons. Everything has a cost, and implies compromises. It's a matter of ROI. Which is hard to evaluate without experience.Bottom line, time is once again the great equalizer, there is no substitute to observe how a complex system evolves, no matter your model of the world.But above all, I learned that geeks think they are rational beings, while they are completely influenced by buzz, marketing, and their emotions. Even more so than the average person, because they believe they are less susceptible to it than normies, so they have a blind spot.And so it beginsXML was just the beginning of many, many waves of hype.When MongoDB came around (it's web scale!), suddenly you had to use NoSQL for everything. Didn't matter that there was absolutely no relation between 2 NoSQL systems. It's like labeling a country as \"doesn't speak English\". Didn't matter MongoDB was a terrible product at the time that was destroying your data (they did fix that, it's now a good DB to have in your toolbox). Didn't matter that most people using it didn't need free replication because their data could fit in a SQlite file.So we watched beginners put their data with no schema, no consistency, and broken validation in a big bag of blobs. The projects began failing in large numbers.Then the node era arrived. Isomorphic JavaScript was all the rage, you had to use the same language in the frontend and the backend, and make everything async. But JS sucked, so most JS projects were created... to avoid writing ES5. I mean, no import, no namespace, terrible scoping, schizophreniac this, prototype based inheritance, weak types, come on! So we got coffeescript, then babel, webpack, typescript, react + JSX, etc.We were told to stay on top of the most modern ecosystem, and by that I mean dealing with compatibility being broken every two months. That\u2019s the price of cutting edge tree-shaking transpilation. That, and a left-pad way of life you couldn\u2019t debug because the map files were generated wrong.At this point, everything needed to be a Single Page Application with client-side routing, immutable data structures and some kind of store. That is, if you could chose between flux, redux, alt, reflux, flummox, fluxible, fluxxor, marty.js, fynx, MacFly, DeLorean.js, fluxify, fluxury, exim, fluxtore, Redx, fluxx\u2026 No, I\u2019m not making that up.But because you still had to pass a lot of data through the wire, and since everything had to be on the client, GraphQL was born. Of course, all that stuff had terrible accessibility, SEO and first-rendering time issues, leading to the rise of Server-Side Rendering, aka CGI with extra steps. This couldn\u2019t stop there, so the community added hydration on top.This turned out to be an immense addition in complexity, and created tons and tons of disposable code base, leading to, you get it, failed projects and waste of money.Because, of course, most of those tasks could have been done with Ruby-On-Rail, Symfony or Django and a pinch of jQuery. At least, they would have been finished with those boring techs. Instead, dead projects began to accumulate, and for one Figma shinning, you had a trail of hidden bodies behind corporate walls nobody dared to talk about.It was taboo to speak about this madness. You were the one not getting it.It's a revolution!You would think people drowning while trying to produce a basic CRUD app would have been a red flag.Instead, it inspired teams everywhere in the world to make things harder on themselves.First, the \"everything should be a micro-service\" crowd started to take over. Every single small website had a docker container for the restish API, plus one for the front end, and one for the database. Indirection layers on top of indirection layers. To communicate between all that, why not a little message queue? ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ... And a good exchange format, like grpc with protobuff.Believe it or not, it became very hard to make your todo-list app work with all those, so a solution was found: adding orchestration. Docker swarm, and now kubernetes.At this stage, so much time and money were obliterated the cloud felt like a savior: they will do all that for you, for a fee. You just had to learn their entire way of doing things, debug their black box, be locked in their ecosystem, and carefully optimize and configure - using state-of-the-art templated YAML files and hostile UIs - your entire project, so that you could only spend 10 times more on hosting, and not 10000 times by mistake.Easy.Second, big data arrived. You had to store every single click of your users. A/B test everything as well, so that you consistently annoy 10% of your customers and make support unbearable. Now the data you had was gigantic! And if it was not, you had to believe it, and you needed some kind of Dynamo data lake. Or maybe a time series db. Or a graph one. You needed something, that's for sure.Third, all of that stuff was now very slow. It was not because of the terrible technical decisions leading to use Google level industrial architectures for your 100 request/seconds website, no. It was because you used a slow language. So let's rewrite everything in Go. Or Rust.The compilation step is not going to have any impact on the feedback loop anyway, since the CI pipeline already takes 73 minutes.That was the last straw, so out of tiredness, devs went back to simple ways...Just kidding, they went in flocks to serverless lambda and SaaS services you call from the edge, cause not owning your stack is the future!Building products you don't needMeanwhile, while the blog posts about burn out were increasing tenfold, somewhere at the top, leaders heard the call of money.You can't grow without making everything social.Gamify, gamify, gamify.Block chain will change the universe.You need an AMP website.Your stuff is not competitive without Machine Learning.If you lived through all those, you know what remains about it: almost nothing.A few \"share\" buttons and \"login with\" workflows. Some points and badges. Graphs.Things either died, or filled the niche they were good at, as they should.Some were replaced by the future of today.Coming back to reasonI like the new hype: YAGNI is popular again.Projects like Vue, HTMX and unpoly, alpine.js or just vanilla are getting traction.There is talk of coming back to using Postgres for most things.37signals is on the spotlight once more, because they left the cloud.It will, of course, be overdone. Because minimalism being hyped is still... hype.You do need the cloud, containers, nosql, go, rust and js build systems.

Photo: Scott Miller/Flickr CC BY NC 2.0Rohit KumarBOOKSHISTORY25/JUN/2023Fans of the Adventures of Tintin comics by Herg\u00e9 will remember the opening scene in Tintin in Tibet. Tintin has dozed off during a game of chess with Captain Haddock in a crowded caf\u00e9. He suddenly yells, \u201cCHANG!!\u201d so loudly that everyone in the restaurant jumps! PauseNextUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 4:03Loaded: FullscreenTintin has had a disturbing dream about his friend Chang who, it turns out, has gone down with an ill-fated plane in the Himalayas. The dream, however, has convinced Tintin that Chang is still alive and needs rescuing. The rest of the story revolves around that rescue.Tintin in Tibet is perhaps the most personal and deeply autobiographical of Herg\u00e9\u2019s stories. The character of Chang was based on a real person by the same name who Herg\u00e9 not only considered his best friend, but his mentor and guide as well. Herg\u00e9 met Chang Chong-Ren for the first time in Brussels in 1934 at the urging of one Abb\u00e9 Gosset. Gosset, the chaplain to a group of Chinese Catholic students at Louvain University, had been concerned about the racist stereotypes in Herg\u00e9\u2019s first two hugely popular Tintin books, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets and Tintin in the Congo, and urged him to \u2018do a little research\u2019 before embarking on his next book, The Blue Lotus, set in China. Gosset encouraged Herg\u00e9 to meet Chang, a Chinese student and sculptor, at the Brussels Palace of Fine Arts. It was a meeting that would change Herg\u00e9\u2019s life forever.Chang taught Herg\u00e9 Chinese calligraphy, painting techniques, and most of all, the importance of authenticity, so that for the first time with The Blue Lotus, every location was accurate and every fact, verifiable. Subsequent Tintin comics, in fact, became famous for their geographical and historical accuracy. In effect, Chang taught Herg\u00e9 a whole new way of looking at the world.Chang also educated Herg\u00e9 about the facts of the Japanese invasion of China that were little known in the West at the time, how the Japanese had staged a false flag event by blowing up the Peking-Mukden railway line while blaming it on Chinese bandits. Herg\u00e9 also learned about Japanese atrocities in China that were being glossed over by the Western press, and how the authorities at the International Settlement in Shanghai chose to look the other way.Herg\u00e9 included all of this in The Blue Lotus.Also Read: Tintin, a Friend to Satirists and a Perennial Ally in the Struggle Against RepressionThe new Tintin adventure was an instant hit with his readers, but the Japanese were not impressed. So angry were they at Herg\u00e9 and his comic that the Japanese ambassador threatened to take the Belgian government to the International Court of Justice at The Hague! But the beleaguered Chinese were happy as they had suddenly found an unexpected ally in the form of a comic book! Grateful for this unexpected bit of solidarity, Madame Chiang Kai-Shek formally invited Herg\u00e9 to China, (a visit that never materialised till much later when Herg\u00e9 finally visited her in exile in Taiwan).Herg\u00e9\u2019s friendship with Chang had brought about a deep shift in Herg\u00e9\u2019s worldview. Before he had met Chang, Tintin was, in Herg\u00e9\u2019s own words, \u2018a bit of a joke\u2019, but Tintin would henceforth forever be cast in the role of \u2018international social crusader, chronicler of major world events, and champion of the underdog\u2019.Looking back at their friendship many decades later, Chang said:\u201cWe were like two brothers. I suggested to him that to use real events as the inspiration for his adventures would be a better idea \u2026 Thus The Blue Lotus was born. At that time, I visited Herg\u00e9 once a week. We spoke of history, anecdote, costumes, poetry, art, the countryside and so on. As soon as the drawings were inked in, I drew the Chinese characters in different handwriting.\u201dA deeply grateful Herg\u00e9 made Chang a character in The Blue Lotus, and later, in Tintin in Tibet.Developments in China and the onset of war, however, forced Chang to return to Shanghai, and the two lost touch. Herg\u00e9 continued to comment on world events through his art and spoke out against Nazism and fascism in King Ottokar\u2019s Scepter, The Black Island and The Land of Black Gold. But the war years, a punishing work schedule, and an unhappy marriage had taken a toll on him. He began to have terrible nightmares \u2013 predominantly having to do with the colour white and snow! A psychoanalyst in Zurich advised him, \u201cIn your place, I would just stop working now.\u201dHerg\u00e9 was tempted to take his advice, burnt-out as he was, but instead decided to work (or rather, draw) through his troubles. He finished Tintin In Tibet in 1960 (in which the predominant colour is white), and in so doing not only succeeded in exorcising his demons, but also gave beautiful expression to his search for his long-lost friend.Interestingly, Herg\u00e9 portrayed the Yeti (the \u2018abominable snowman\u2019) in the book as a gentle and kindly beast. Far from being abominable, the Yeti helps Chang (the comic character) survive the punishing snows of the Himalayas. As Herg\u00e9 biographer Harry Thompson points out, if The Blue Lotus had atoned for his earlier prejudices in Tintin in the Soviet Union, then Tintin in Tibet had also atoned for his cruelty to animals in Tintin in the Congo.Through a series of serendipitous events, Herg\u00e9 finally managed to locate his old friend in China. Their reunion in 1981 at Brussels airport was a moving one and was covered extensively by the French and Belgian press. The two friends appeared together in TV interviews and talked about their friendship and art.Herg\u00e9, who had been suffering from a rare form of anaemia, passed away shortly thereafter in 1983.With more than two hundred million books sold to date, the Adventures of Tintin remain one of the most widely read comic books ever. Much of that success will always be owed to the quiet influence of a meticulous artist, sculptor and friend \u2013 Chang.Rohit Kumar is an educator.

Every protagonist is a normal person, though sometimes extremely competent. This results in much more variety in the industry. I'm not sure why they didn't even try to copy the American model if only for business reasons, but I'm thankful for it.2. Each comic usually gets a single 50-page issue per year. (Seriously, there's a series I've been reading since I was 8, and you can marathon it in a few sittings.) I think this reduces the amount of \"filler issues\" or low quality churn, as the author has lots of time to get things right.3. Most of the time the comics are written by the same author, usually the creator of the characters. They're not getting pimped out to every author out there for a run. It makes things more cohesive IMO.My favorite series is Thorgal, by the author of XIII and Largo Winch. It's a fantasy series set at the time of the vikings, with light sci-fi and magical elements. Think of it like Conan but with a non-violent hero. Read issue 9, The Archers, for an standalone story that can give you an idea of what it's like before you commit. It's been running since the 80s, but once the author retired a decade or so ago, some younger guy took over the writing, and you can see the quality of the writing drop off, so I never kept up. But you got 30 years worth of good books, about 35 issues IIRC.replyjacquesm 15 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> Every protagonist is a normal person, though sometimes extremely competent.Or extremely incompetent!

A later album, The Shooting Star, drawn during the Nazi occupation of Belgium, contains some strongly antisemitic stereotypes (obviously removed in the re-drawn version, which also changes the evil Americans into a fictional country).Herge worked for a newspaper friendly to the Nazis, and this was close to destroying his career after the war.Tintin is a brilliant series and I find it fascinating how the changing values and politics are reflected in it.replytrompetenaccoun 15 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Redrawing means erasing the racist history, little by little.

This was part of Herges evolution from an initially more cartoonish style to the detailed \u201cligne claire\u201d-style. (Fans debate which version is best)The earlier stories were initially published as newspaper strips, but was later colorized and edited to fit in album format.Note that all edits and redrawings were done by Herge, or by his assistants under his oversigt.

The atrocities committed in the Congo Free State (which many credibly term a genocide) were in living memory at the time of publishing; the youngest survivors would have been in their twenties. This is an example of how universities often serve a public good for humanity as a whole, far and away from the notion that they exist simply to grab the highest-scoring domestic students possible and shove knowledge and elite connections down their throats. As TFA tells it, Sino-Western relations were altered for the better by Herg\u00e9 and Chang's encounter and subsequent friendship.replytrompetenaccoun 16 hours ago | parent [\u2013]Herg\u00e9 never had any higher education. The argument is also questionable in general, because why bring up children segregated and then force \"diversity\" later? Why don't people push for diversity in kindergartens? By the time someone is grown up they can already be a well developed racist.Also on that note there were certainly plenty of Jews around when Herg\u00e9 grew up and still he stereotyped them with the typical antisemitic stereotypes of the time. Just because he had a Chinese friend doesn't mean he was any less racist for it. That's a misconception, that's exactly what the US gets terribly wrong these days. Diversity is almost like a religion over there, yet some of the most racist things I've heard were from people that went to those kinds of universities.Racist or not depends on the upbringing, the ideology one follows and generally if one subscribes to the pseudoscientific idea that there are separate human \"races\". What color people you know does not directly influence that. Else the world's racism could be cured by everyone knowing someone with a different skin color.

A dual output 8 bit DAC could easily generate the frequencies involved and allow tailoring the curve with RPM. Closing the loop would likely be easier and more effective with an optical pickup of some sort: that would do away with back EMF problems at different speeds and increase precision for better tuning, which is crucial for efficiency.At some point off-the-shelf motor drivers are insufficient.replyleoedin 1 hour ago | parent | next [\u2013]A brushless motor controller is basically a DAC anyway - so no need for separate components.A brushless motor is essentially 3 large inductors. They act as a filter to PWM drive signals, which means that the resultant current is fairly continuous - much like a class D audio amplifier uses the inductance of a speaker to create smooth sine waves.There's no need to add an intermediate smooth analog stage (which is what a true DAC would give you) - because then either you drive a linear amplifier and have massive power losses in the drive transistors, or drive a class D type amplifier (which turns your nice continuous signal back into PWM to the drive transistors) and you've just added an unnecessary digital -> analog -> PWM sequence.When you want good low speed control of a brushless motor, the gold standard is a high resolution encoder (often magnetic) coupled with \"field oriented control\" - which is essentially using your 6 drive transistors to create a magnetic field which is exactly 90 degrees ahead or behind your permanent magnet field. You can use entirely digital PWM switching to create that field, as the natural filtering effect of the motor coils smooths it out, and the resultant driver & motor is highly efficient.The much simpler \"6 step commutation\" discussed in the video can give almost as good control at low speeds, but the magnetic field you create in the coils isn't necessarily perfectly aligned with your motor's magnetic field, which means some of the magnetic force generated is just pulling on your bearings and not driving the motor. That means overall efficiency is slightly less and the torque at low speeds is variable depending on rotor position.replycushychicken 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Would work, but I'd estimate that it would require 4x the circuit area that this fella is working with.

A small DDS (si5341) would be pretty good though at 3x3mm. Three phased channels could drive the six inductors far beyond any feasible speed here.> Plus adding some Z axis height for the optical encoder.A SMT photodiode and IR LED could do this off the edge with some fiddling, which appears to be in ample supply here.replycushychicken 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Huh? That DDS is a silly choice. For one thing, those chips are $27 a pop and only available in QFN44 and QFN64. (May have been smaller FF at some other point, but not any more.) The final BLDC driver he selected is like $1.50.Not to mention that you can't adjust the drive phases of a DDS with I2C fast enough to be of any use for BLDC. Once you add in a sensor/feedback element, it definitely wouldn't have the latency performance you'd need for BLDC.replymastax 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You'd usually want 3 phases for a brushless DC motor, right? Though I'm sure theres a cheap Chinese 3/4 channel DAC on LCSC since the output quality won't matter.I haven't considered using a DAC with a motor before, but that strikes me as extremely inefficient, which is one of the design considerations. You're basically going from a simple class D amp to a class A one. The motor has plenty of inductance so you may as well PWM it for efficiency.replyjacquesm 16 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Great work this, I wonder if the end goal is a drone why it uses such a strange rotor design rather than something more conventional (which also would obviate the need for such extreme RPMs).replyTD-Linux 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The size of most electric motors is proportional to the torque they produce - so if you can spin it faster, you can get more power for the same weight. There are some other factors that make high speed worse - for example, bearing and core losses. The PCB motor is a coreless motor though, so it has no core loss, biasing it even harder towards high speed operation.Propellers generally get less efficient with higher speeds though, which might be a bigger factor than any of this.replybboygravity 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Propellers generally get less efficient with higher speeds though, which might be a bigger factor than any of this.Unless operated at lower air-pressure (higher altitude) then higher speed is generally more efficient.Source: Musk interviews about why electronic very high altitude aircraft make sense in a lot of ways (faster, more energy efficient, potentially cheaper, less polluting). But only after battery densities are improved in the future.replyjacquesm 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Musk isn't correct though, or maybe you misunderstood or misquoted him. Higher speed is only more efficient if the craft itself moves at a higher speed.To explain a bit further: a prop is at its most efficient when it has clean air to work with and that only works if the craft moves forward at least as much as one prop's worth of air in the direction of motion. Less than that and the prop will encounter it's own backwash. This is the reason why variable props exist, to ensure that the prop has enough 'bite' rather than that it just churns the local air. So at low revs you run a higher angle than when you go faster and towards the tips of the prop the angle gets flatter as well.Which more or less defines the range of a variable prop, once the tips are nearly flat there is nothing more to gain. Another important factor is blade count. A single blade is theoretically most efficient because it can run at the highest RPM before the blade encounters it's own wake again, but there are balancing issues and vibration issues with low (<3) blade count props. And in practice the efficiency gains are offset by complexity, weight (a single blade needs a counterweight) and drag of that weight. Two is common enough though because it is easy to make a sturdy two blader prop. Three is optimal from a longevity and maintenance point of view, and a offers very good efficiency.And I think you meant 'electric', not 'electronic'.replypengaru 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Musk isn't correct though, or maybe you misunderstood or misquoted him. Higher speed is only more efficient if the craft itself moves at a higher speed.He's got it completely backwards from what Musk said in that interview, see my reply.replystavros 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Hm, I don't entirely know how this works, but for RC planes we use slower motors and higher prop pitch for efficiency, faster motors and lower prop pitch for acceleration.replyjacquesm 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, that's because you run fixed pitch props.replypengaru 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]FFS dudeIf you're going to cite sources like that at least get it remotely close to right.\"For aircraft, or just generally, you want to move a large mass of air slowly. So you can reduce the velocity component of kinetic energy, which goes as the square. You want to move a large amount of mass slowly, not a small amount of mass fast... So, the way you make aircraft engines more efficient is you move a lot of air slowly. Like big fans, basically, big slow fans work great. Small, tiny. fast-moving jets, are very inefficient.\" - your favorite billionaire, in the exact interview you're inversely misquoting. (JRE #1609 last ~12 minutes is electric planes)replyjacquesm 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]A coreless motor has more losses, not less. That's because the field isn't focused as nicely. It's just that the losses aren't in the core but in the air.Core losses by the way are typically a different kind of loss, they are eddy currents resulting from the fact that the stator laminates are not infinitely thin.replybluescrn 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yeah, I'm surprised he didn't try attaching some actual drone propellers to see how much thrust they'd give.

    "content": "WinGPT: AI Assistant for Windows 3.1Do you use Windows 3.1? Do your friends send you jokes and haikus written by ChatGPT, and make you feel left out? Do you wish you had the sum of all human knowledge at your fingertips? Or wish you had your very own AI chatbot on your trusty 386?Wish no more! Introducing WinGPT, an AI Assistant for Windows 3.1.WinGPT helps you:[1]Do research: WinGPT helpfully answers your queries on everything from current events to kitchen recipes. Say goodbye to dusty encyclopedias and Encarta!Stay entertained: WinGPT gives helpful life advice and tells you jokes to your heart's content. Embrace a world of multimedia entertainment right on your desktop, as long as it's text-based!Master your productivity: WinGPT is your digital sidekick, helping you draft documents and spreadsheets with the utmost confidence.How was this made?WinGPT is written in C, using the standard Windows API. I used Open Watcom v2 as the compiler, which is very convenient as it supports cross-compiling to 16-bit Windows from even Windows 11.WinGPT connects to the OpenAI API server natively with TLS 1.3, so it doesn't require a proxy on a modern machine to terminate TLS. To see how I did this and some of the challenges, take a look at Modern TLS on 16-bit Windows. (As you'll see on that page, this is not a secure implementation).Building the UIHaving been used to building Windows apps like Windle using Delphi previously, I was surprised how primitive the UI building capabilities are with Windows 3.1 if you only use the built-in Windows API.I built most of the UI in C directly, meaning that each UI component had to be manually constructed in code. Resizing logic manually ensures that each component retains its proper size when the window is resized.In particular, I was surprised that the set of standard controls available to use by any program with Windows 3.1 is incredibly limited. You have some controls you'd expect\u2014push buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, edit boxes\u2014but any other control you might need, including those used across the operating system itself, aren't available.Desktop control panel in Windows 3.1, showing many of the standard controls.I ran into this problem when I was trying to figure out how to add a status bar to WinGPT. Status bars appear all over Windows 3.1, including in the File Manager and Control Panel. Unfortunately, Microsoft didn't make them widely available to other application developers until Windows 95, alongside a bunch of other useful controls like progress bars, toolbars, and tree views.[2]As an aside, I asked ChatGPT how I might be able to use a status bar in my program. It replied with a header file that only exists for later versions of Windows, and when I asked it to clarify, it came up with the name of a very enticing (but I'm pretty sure very non-existent) UI library. Luckily, Philip J. Erdelsky still has a status bar implementation from 1997 that is very kindly in the public domain that I was able to use! I modified that code to more closely represent the status bars in Microsoft's programs pixel for pixel.Another fun part of building WinGPT was designing the icon in Borland's Image Editor, which is really just a clone of Microsoft Paint that happens to make ICO files instead. Program icons in Windows 3.1 are 32x32, and show up in the Program Manager as well as in the task switcher. I also designed a 16x16 version that shows up on later versions of Windows.LimitationsMemory is quite limited on Windows 3.1 machines, so I tried to reduce the amount of memory needed for WinGPT, especially in sending and receiving the query and response from the OpenAI API. The JSON responses of modern APIs aren't especially optimized for size, and OpenAI's API is no exception. I've asked the model to be brief in an effort to keep responses as small as possible. I've also chosen not to send the text of previous turns in the API calls, even though this means that the bot won't be able to use prior conversation context.Try WinGPTWinGPT is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2.WinGPT will work on any 16-bit or 32-bit version of Windows post-Windows 3.1. It requires an implementation of Winsock (tested with Microsoft TCP/IP-32 3.11b on Windows 3.11 for Workgroups and on stock Windows 2000). It will not work on 64-bit versions of Windows (but does work on Wine\u2014give it a try!)You'll also need an OpenAI API key to talk to OpenAI.

I'm surprised you had trouble getting a TLS implementation to fit in 64k of code and data, since a lot of deeply-embedded stuff (some even using 8-bit CPUs with bankswitching) for IoT and similar applications support TLS 1.2.replyfouc 7 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]So glad to see someone working on TLS 1.3 for Windows 3.1.It's a sad day when slightly older operating systems have trouble accessing the internet.replykazinator 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Maybe some of those chips have some hardware support for crypto?replyeinr 48 minutes ago | prev | next [\u2013]This is extremely neat and I will probably try it on one of my actual Windows 3.1 machines :)A suggestion (which seems easy enough to implement, I might give it a try if I can get the build environment set up): make the system prompt customizable in the Options dialog. Having it be 1992 is fun, but kinda limiting. I might actually use this at some point -- if you're on your retro computer, trying to solve a problem, it might actually make some semblance of sense to use this rather than dig out a modern computer or smartphone.replycom2kid 4 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Strong odds the supporting infrastructure for the textbox control I am typing this into consumes more system resources than WinGPT does in its entirety.Goes to show that we waste literal orders of magnitudes of memory for small gains in developer productivity. Is programming raw Windows controls hard? Sure. But Delphi or VB on Win95 was arguably (much) more productive than modern day UI toolkits, and the resulting apps consumed a fraction of the resources. The main thing they lacked was mobile support and DPI awareness!replyjchw 3 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> ... for small gains in developer productivityI think this is an underestimation, to be honest. What I struggled with native code to be able to do when I was younger is now stuff that literally anyone can do using any number of off the shelf libraries and tools targeting web browsers. This is an amazing achievement and not a bad thing in and of itself; if anything, what I lament the most is that the browser is killing native apps by being a \"better\" overall option.Most software companies nowadays take it for granted that they need to ship some kind of web access to their network service, so that's the first thing they work on. Next they probably want to support iPhone and Windows, and probably Android, macOS, maybe even Linux... There are some options that cover each of these platforms to some degree, but by this point they probably already have at least a proof of concept in a web browser, and with a single NPM install, they can have that show up in a separate window, ready to ship with an installer and deployment system (not a great one mind you, but still.)This wouldn't be as much of a problem if there were good, production-quality, efficient native code GUI frameworks that could efficiently target the DOM and native UIs across Windows, macOS, Android and iPhone, have first-class support for native text input with IME and platform-native semantics as well as accessibility support with screen reader integration, deal with responsive UI changes when dealing with different scree sizes, and have robust but performant DPI-independent visuals that handle fractional scale correctly. (Easy stuff, right?)But there's not. And although I love Delphi VCL, or even just raw Win32, it's just not most of that either. Supporting all of these platforms is very hard. Browsers do a very good job and are often some of the best sources of example code for writing deep platform-specific code you can find. And best of all, since you're targeting web anyway most of the time, and browser engines are \"native code\", it's a hell of a lot easier to just ship the browser or at least JS engine to platforms that already run native code than it is to try to create an isomorphic native code solution that can also run in a browser environment.I think that things will get better, eventually. But, they'll probably get worse before they get better.replyrazemio 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Can you elaborate on \"arguably much more productive\"?replycom2kid 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Let me give a more recent example.A few years back I was building a B2B website for companies to manage event listings[1], fully modern React stack.I wanted to get the backend API up and running first so I threw together a prototype in WinForms and C#. I had been writing React all day every day for a couple years at that point, and I hadn't used C# or WinForms for quite a few years (3 or 4 at least).Also none of the GCP APIs I was using had official C# WinForms libraries (hah!) but of course everything had nice React integrations.So anyway, within a day and a half or so I have a C# desktop app up and running that has about 80% of the site's planned functionality implemented. It is ugly, but it works.Over 3 months later I have the React site up and running.The React site supported Mobile and Desktop browsers, and it looked nicer, but the productivity to create the React site was literal orders of magnitude less.FWIW I had a similar experience going from React to Svelte, I got done in 3 days what would have taken me weeks in React.(For those paying attention, Svelte was still slower than C#!)Part of the difference is that we expect web apps to be all shiny and work at any screen size with fancy CSS, vs a desktop app which can just do its thing.The other part is that, IMHO, HTML+CSS are crap for laying out application UIs. Better than what they used to be, but still absurdly complicated.[1] Create their business profile, list and manage events on a timeline/calendar, view attendees, send announcements to attendees, real time view of people as they show up to the event by hooking into Geo-locating on the phone, manage photos, and so on and so forth.replymovedx 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> The other part is that, IMHO, HTML+CSS are crap for laying out application UIs. Better than what they used to be, but still absurdly complicated.Not just absurdly complicated, but also absurdly inconsistent. If you write an app in JS+HTML+CSS and use Electron to deploy it, the UI could literally be anything, as can the controls, etc. Nothing matches the OS UI neither, and standards have gone out of the window :(replymike_hearn 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Productivity has to incorporate some notion of deployment. As was standard for that era, Delphi/VB ignored this question completely. Time to deploy your app? If you made a simple zip utility, no problem, copy a single EXE onto a network mount somewhere inside your firewalled LAN. Windows has a pseudo-filesystem embedded into the binary which just about services for loading icons and strings, that'll do. Something more complicated, with DLLs and registry entries perhaps? Buy a copy of InstallShield for hundreds of dollars and learn InstallScript. Not only was there nothing in between until MSI and WiX came along but right up until the mid 1990s Microsoft saw the internet as this exotic fad, and using networks for software distribution was considered unworkable due to low bandwidth. Software was for CD-ROMs and shipping meant physically putting it on a ship.Problem is, iteration speed mattered more to people than almost anything else including raw productivity. The world changed faster than Delphi did. Borland could have recognized the trend of hacking browsers into making apps was representing some fundamentally unarticulated need and come up with e.g. an Object Pascal interpreter. They could have done some sort of \"Delphi Browser\", for instance, and it would have gained adoption, but their codebase was fundamentally oriented around producing native Windows apps so it would have been difficult to make that move. Plus, Borland were basically guests on the Windows platform and tended to follow Microsoft's lead. Microsoft were pushing ActiveX as the way to bridge the web and the Windows world; Borland realized too late that ActiveX wasn't going to meet people's needs. They saw the web first as not a competitor, and then later as a mere carrier for Delphi apps, and then later still pushed using Delphi for writing web servers but its strengths didn't apply there.So the lessons I took away from this were really about unarticulated preferences that you have to learn about by watching what people do, not what they say, and also the overwhelming importance of deployment - still a blind spot for most web competitors today. Up until last year if you wanted to use a Delphi-like platform with web-like deployment where apps are always refreshed on launch there just wasn't much out there. Even Electron only offers fully asynchronous desktop-style updates. I have a little company that makes products for fixing deployment of desktop apps (within the constraints of the native platforms), which adds a web-like deployment mode called aggressive updates (https://hydraulic.dev/). With that an update check is done on every launch, so you can iterate very fast as long as your users restart the app from the time to time or of course you can force it when the time is right, no different to requiring users to close and reload tabs for a SPA.Anyway, I disagree that the main thing they lacked was mobile + DPI. Delphi, VB, GTK, Cocoa etc had lost the desktop before smartphones mattered at all because they lacked a good deployment and update system, and the ability to push out fixes and changes instantly mattered more than all the other features combined.replyashleyn 5 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]> Memory is quite limited on Windows 3.1 machines, so I tried to reduce the amount of memory needed for WinGPT, especially in sending and receiving the query and response from the OpenAI API. The JSON responses of modern APIs aren't especially optimized for size, and OpenAI's API is no exception. I've asked the model to be brief in an effort to keep responses as small as possible. I've also chosen not to send the text of previous turns in the API calls, even though this means that the bot won't be able to use prior conversation context.You can trade space for CPU time using SAX-style parsing[1]. SAX-style parsing visits each node of a tree from top to bottom, firing events for each node visited. The amount of memory required compared to fully parsing JSON is negligible, and writing a custom SAX-style parser for JSON shouldn't be too difficult. There are existing SAX-style JSON parsers you can examine as well.[2][1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML [2]: https://rapidjson.org/md_doc_sax.htmlreplydialupdotnet 4 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Yep! I'm using JSMN (https://github.com/zserge/jsmn), which is a streaming parser that visits each token sequentially, so there's only one copy of each JSON response in memory. I also avoid allocating new intermediate memory whenever possible; for example, to unescape backslashes in the JSON strings, I use a destructive loop that moves the non-backslash characters forward in memory, and truncates the string by moving the null terminator earlier in the string. Not something I'd imagine doing in most environments today, but as you said, it saves a bit of space at the expense of CPU time :) void DestructivelyUnescapeStr(LPSTR lpInput) {  int offset = 0;  int i = 0;  while (lpInput[i] != '\\0') {   if (lpInput[i] == '\\\\') {    offset++;   } else {    lpInput[i - offset] = lpInput[i];   }   i++;  }  lpInput[i - offset] = '\\0'; }replyspeedgoose 2 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]This is great. After all these efforts, you should consider switching from ChatGPT 3.5 to ChatGPT 4.Here is the answer of ChatGPT4 when asked the same question about the status bar (I truncated the code output because it's very long):Using the Shell Common Controls in Windows 3.1 can be a bit tricky due to its older architecture and limited capabilities, but it's certainly doable.However, there are a few complications to note:1. Windows 3.1 does not natively support the status bar as a control. Status bars are part of the Common Controls library introduced in Win32, specifically, it was introduced in Windows 95 with COMCTL32.DLL. Windows 3.1 is a 16-bit environment and does not include this library.2. If you want a status bar in a Windows 3.1 application, you'll have to draw and manage it yourself.3. Windows 3.1 programming is largely obsolete. It can be a fun academic exercise or a necessity for maintaining legacy software, but if you're developing new software it would be much more practical to use a more modern version of Windows and its associated API.Assuming that you still want to go ahead, here's a basic idea of how you might implement a status bar yourself: ```c #include <windows.h>  #define ID_STATUS 100  LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND, UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM);  int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,    PSTR szCmdLine, int iCmdShow) { ...replyHeckFeck 2 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]There might be a control in the Calmira source code that would help, but it is in Pascal and not C.http://www.calmira.net/source/index.htmreplyvorticalbox 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]not everyone has access to gpt 4 yet.replyiraldir 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]if you pay chat gpt plus then yes everyone has had access for quite some time nowreplydangrover 10 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Such a cool project!

The first couple answers it said things like, \"In the year 1990, this was..\" and \"The Internet as we know it now was not yet as widespread..\", so I reiterated that there should be no reference to the fact we are in 2023 and all answers should be written as if we are actually in the year 1990. Then I tried a few questions and it worked out pretty well. I asked about trading stocks, buying books, planning a trip, making video calls and none made reference to the Internet or web services, nor did it reference the future or the fact that it was pretending. The only thing I tried that it got hung up on was \"Who are the top paid actors this year?\" And it gave the standard reply, \"As an AI, I don't have specific data about top paid actors in the year 1990\"replycolumn 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Got it working from the get-go and got similar results. I think the \"this year?\" in the prompt confuses it too much. With my prompt below, using \"this decade?\" works quite well.Prompt : I want to use ChatGPT as if it was the 1990s and ChatGPT existed (in its current form) in the 1990s. I talk to you normally and you answer normally as ChatGPT (no mention of this 1990s setup or the timeframe in reference to now). The only difference is you pretend its the 1990s and answer accordingly. Stay in character, you play yourself. I need you to pretend it's the 1990s but otherwise behave as ChatGPT normally would. Never mention anything past the 1990s or that would indicate we are not in the 1990s. Do not mention this conversation (it's a pre-prompt). Let's go. First question : which internet browser do you recommend ?Answer: There are several good browsers available currently. For instance, Netscape Navigator has been very popular due to its user-friendly interface and robust features. It's currently one of the most widely used browsers.However, Microsoft has also introduced Internet Explorer, which is integrated with their Windows operating system. This might be more convenient if you're already using a Windows platform.There's also Mosaic, developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), which pioneered many of the user interface elements we see in modern browsers.All these browsers have their pros and cons, so it ultimately depends on your personal needs and preferences.Q : Who are the top paid actors this decade? A : During the 1990s, some of the highest-grossing actors have been:Tom Cruise - He's been in a string of successful films including the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise which started in 1996.Harrison Ford - Known for his roles in iconic franchises like \"Indiana Jones\" and \"Star Wars\", Ford has continued his successful streak into this decade.Jim Carrey - With his unique brand of physical comedy, Carrey has starred in a number of high-grossing comedies including \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\", \"The Mask\", and \"Liar Liar\".Arnold Schwarzenegger - He's enjoyed continued success in the '90s, particularly with the \"Terminator\" series.Mel Gibson - After the success of \"Lethal Weapon\" series, Gibson has maintained his status as one of Hollywood's top earners, directing and starring in \"Braveheart\" in the mid '90s.Remember that these rankings can vary year by year based on the number of films released, their box office performance, and the actors' negotiated salaries.replydialupdotnet 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yep, I've hardcoded a \"system\" message that tells ChatGPT to answer in the present tense as if it's 1992, and to make no reference to the current year.

But to help me out, can you describe what you use it does for you. I didn't see any references to citations or the like that zotero is mainly for. Is it just a note app? If so, what makes it so good?replynoisy_boy 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]What it does for me:- everything is markdown which I'm comfortable in- I can use conventional structure of folders and notes within folders (not for everyone but it works for me)- extensive support for cross-linking/embedding/bookmarks along with connection graphs/search (out of these, I had use cases for cross-linking and embedding which worked very well)- nice responsive UI with support for themes/customizations (I particularly like the Nord theme). Allows lots of control like custom CSS etc for more fine-tuning- allows customizing keyboard shortcut for practically any action- quality of desktop and mobile (Android) application is pretty good and the look and feel is consistent- extensive plugin system: I mainly use plugins out of the box but with stuff like Data tables plugins, you can automate/implement your own workflow (I am too lazy to use all that). Even with out-of-box stuff, things like the git plugin allows version control with minimal effort, smart links allows regex based rules to convert strings to URLs (like entering JIRA ticket no. which converts to clickable URL), MathJax support for entering formulas which render beautifully etc; there are lots of such quality of life benefits via the plugins which adds up.- allows easy syncing either using their paid service or using syncthing (which is what I use)replyEddy_Viscosity2 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Thanks for this. Would you recommend this to someone who is not already a markdown user or that a key prerequisite for this to be useful?replynoisy_boy 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The only concern I have is that the content that happens to match markdown rules will get interpreted and the subsequent highlighting etc might surprise/annoy a user not familiar with markdown. E.g. adding a dash at the beginning of the line will get interpreted as a list item, typing asterisk will trigger the editor to put another asterisk and put the cursor in the middle with the expectation that you want to type bold text - you can press backspace to remove the extra asterisk and continue as per normal but if you are in the business of dealing with loads of asterisks/dashes at the beginning of the line, and don't care about markdown, you might be pissed.All the approaches to handle this kind of thing are not as simple as turning off a checkbox. If that is a deal breaker, then this may not be the app for you. OTOH, if you don't mind occasionally dealing with that (or better still, picking up the bare minimum amount of markdown), it'll provide a pretty rich note taking experience. For typical content, I don't think this will be a frequent issue but then again, what is typical for someone may be atypical for me and vice versa.Personally I think it is totally worth it but YMMV.replydandellion 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Do you use syncthing to sync notes with your phone too?

I already use a number of these on your list. Though I don't use copy-by-link for files. For me one of the key purposes of zotero is that its the place where I keep these files so I don't have to keep them elsewhere where they aren't as easily searchable.I'm excited to try the duplicates merger tool, I've been forever putting off this because the normal way is such a slog. The Tag one also looks good.To add to the list, my key add-ons are:- better bibtex, this one is essential for me as a latex user- zotfile. This one is cool because if you add annotations to a pdf, like highlighting or comments while you read it, then zotfile will pull those out into notes in the zotero entry. This makes it really easy to see both that I've read this document, and what parts I thought were important.[1] https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) [2] http://zotfile.com/replyHelmut10001 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, I think this needs to be decided based on preference. I like to be independent in my file/pdf organization, and also search without Zotero through these files. I further consider original file names important and finally sync my literature folder to my Nextcloud, with full-text search. This is why I prefer linking, instead of file management by Zotero.replymaxmalkav 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]Zotero was key to finish my long delayed thesis, reducing the toil of managing a lot of references on a topic that I disliked more and more by the minute. Unfortunately back in the day they did not have yet the embedded PDF reader and highlighting features, but still was super helpful (I decided to stay away from Mendeley for license and affiliation reasons)I still keep Zotero around for some projects that require more serious bibliography management. Glad to see advances in the note management direction, even if it is a add-on. While serviceable, the default note options always felt a bit rough to me.replyhfo 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]> Zotero was key to finish my long delayed thesis, reducing the toil of managing a lot of references on a topic that I disliked more and more by the minute.Exactly the same for me, I'm forever grateful.replyxeromal 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Same.

For some reason I cannot go back to \u201cregular editors\u201d after years of vim (and now neovim), it is not only the modal editing (IIRC Obsidian has a decent vi mode), I guess it is more about having all your editing in the same tool (and the terminal).Nowadays I stick to neovim plus Telekasten plugin, not as polished as Obsidian, but with enough features.replyflor1s 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]+1 for Obsidian, though until now I haven't felt the need to write actual papers in.

For now I'm using this plugin that exports and keeps in sync the calibre library to Zotero:https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3339191Very grateful that this open source project stays alive, I've seen attempts over the years from startups and other projects to tackle on spaces like pkm, research, paperless office, to then be abandoned yet Zotero keeps getting updates.There's also Tropy, from the same organization that develops Zotero, for organizing digital assets:https://tropy.org/Getting a bit off-topic, but this thing could use some sort of Moodboard designer to visually sort the assets in a canvas, kind of what you can do with Miro, Notion, Mural or locally with Obsidian Canvas/Excalidraw.

I used Calibre just for reading epubs, so I want to ask how and why do you need to sync its metadata with zotero?replymickelsen 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I just like having the entire collection of files in one place, some of them are textbooks or reference books that don't sit well in either app entirely, and while I also keep novels there in a separate subcollection, most of my ebooks are non-fiction, where topics are the same or related to the rest of material I already keep in Zotero.Some are non-academic PDFs, blueprints, guides, whitepapers or manuals that I refer to for a given project, and while this is not the main purpose of Zotero, as it is a research-oriented tool, it still proves more useful than other tools, tidier than classical folders+files, and less of a hassle than coming up with my own system using something like Obsidian's dataview plugin.Calibre I prefer it to fix the metadata of my ebooks, but the local reading story isn't ideal for me. I've tried serving the collection over self-hosted web apps, to keep the page progress like calibre-web, but it wasn't ideal for me or conducive to what I look for: https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-webreplyadr1an 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]IDK if it helps you, but a simple epub reader is Bookworm.replymickelsen 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It's lovely but I'm on a Mac.

There are very few sync issues.Downsides: MacOS/iOS/iPadOS only, and not free or open-source (but it's a one-time purchase).Not affiliated, just a happy user.replytengwar2 17 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]The strong point for me is that DEVONthink uses RTF (and RTFD) as the native format. RTF is, along with Markdown, a document format that I expect to be widely supported for the next 40 years, but has the advantage of being WYSIWYG and supporting more advanced formatting. RFTD supports embedded images - it is less widely supported, but there are third party editors. The \"databases\" are MacOS packages, and they document how to get the files out if DEVONthink becomes unavailable. Hence for me it gives a good balance of functionality and longevity.replymrmincent 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]I\u2019ve just started using zotero again after 10 or so years, being back at uni for some further learning.

It's heavyweight - in fact, a whole separate browser only to manage my bibligraphy (ever tried to use it with ~10k items?). Provides no CLI interface (to automate workflows with scripts). It's data model is weird - e.g., item types include such thing as \"instant message\", but more academia-relevant types (e.g., \"dataset\") are absent (\"preprint\" was incorporated only recently); ISSNs are treated as properties of articles rather than journals. And it boasts it has included its own PDF viewer, whereas I see it as down-side rather than improvement (more bloatware included - why not just follow the division of labor and delegate this functionality to external viewers... ahhh, yes, there is no annotating standard among PDF viewers...).But all other alternatives for bibliography management I know of are even worse.replyar-jan 22 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> ever tried to use it with ~10k items?Yes, around 13k currently.

It is unbelievable to us today to think they lived among, and hunted, giant herbivores, some which were the size of a small car.\u201dThe paintings were found in the Serran\u00eda La Lindosa, in modern-day Colombia.Professor Jos\u00e9 IriarteOther pictures show human figures, geometric shapes and hunting scenes, as well as animals such as deer, tapirs, alligators, bats, monkeys, turtles, serpents and porcupines.The red paintings, made using pigments extracted from scraped ocher, make up one of the largest collections of rock art in South America.At the time when the drawings were made, the Amazon was changing from a patchwork of savannahs, tropical forest and thorny scrub into the broad-leaf tropical forest we know today.Half-animal, half-human hybrids depicted on oldest discovered cave artThe artists would have used fire to exfoliate the rock and make flat surfaces on which to paint, experts say. While the paintings are exposed to the elements, they are protected by overhanging rock, which means they remain in better condition than other rock art found in the Amazon.Some of them were painted so high up on the rock that \u201cspecial ladders crafted from forest resources would have been needed\u201d to create them, according to the press release.The people who painted the pictures were hunter-gatherers who ate palm fruit and tree fruits, as well as fishing in the nearby river for piranha and alligators. Bones and plant remains also reveal they ate snakes, frogs, armadillos and rodents, including paca and capybara.Researchers on the project are working to find out when humans first settled in the Amazon region, and how their presence affected biodiversity.The pre-Columbian rock art at Cerro Azul in Guaviare state, Colombia dates back around 12,000 years.Marie-Claire Thomas/Wild Blue MediaJos\u00e9 Iriarte, Professor of Archaeology at Exeter, told CNN that the findings are an initial stage in a project that will run for five years.One of the immediate aims is to document all of the rock art in the area, and work out what other animals are depicted, he said.\u201cThese rock paintings are spectacular evidence of how humans reconstructed the land, and how they hunted, farmed and fished,\u201d Iriarte said in the press release.\u201cIt is likely art was a powerful part of culture and a way for people to connect socially. The pictures show how people would have lived amongst giant, now extinct, animals, which they hunted.\u201dNative Californians got high on hallucinogenic plants and painted rock art, study findsIriarte was impressed by the realism of the paintings, which were produced during a rare window in which early humans lived alongside megafauna.\u201cThe level of observation of the fauna was incredible,\u201d he said.The rock paintings feature in a new TV series, \u201cJungle Mystery: Lost Kingdoms of the Amazon,\u201d on the UK\u2019s Channel 4, and the findings are also described in an article in the journal Quaternary International.Robinson and Iriarte worked on the project alongside Javier Aceituno of the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia and Gaspar Morcote-Rios of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogota.Communities in the local area knew of the rock paintings, and helped researchers document them in the wake of the 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla group, which disarmed after 52 years of conflict.

Right around the arrival of humans. What about New Zealand? Shortly after the arrival of humans. In every historical, known example of human introduction to a new ecosystem, most animals over 50lbs get eaten.replyEdwardDiego 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> but rapid global warming at the end of the last ice age is a far more likely culprit.Firstly, your linked paper is focused on North America, so we can't say it's also applicable to, say, the extinctions of Homo floresiensis and Stegodon florensis insularis that correlate rather well with the arrival of modern humans.Secondly, it repeatedly refers to global _cooling_ through the Younger Dryas Event. Just to clarify.And tbh, claiming the overkill/big black hole hypothesis is merely current fashion is overly simplistic. It was described in the 60s based on available data, and hey, we're getting better data now, so yay, science is incorporating new data, like we expect.And I'll note that the data points for human predation of megafauna used in that paper are likely to change also with time, so who knows how correct that paper's conclusions will be in another 20 years?I don't see why \"it was probably both\" shouldn't be the default position. We know humans hunted megafauna, but like the fossil record, we know that only some evidence will be preserved, and only some of that evidence has been found.But logically, both environmental change and the introduction of a novel predator (and other novel predators that predator may have brought with them) are bad for populations of species which a low replacement rate.K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d are a very good example. Human settlement brought habitat loss, causing their numbers to decline, and their breeding success rates to drop (and they were slow breeders to start with) as the more clement habitat was modified by humans, thus pushing them into areas with lower productivity.But what ultimately pushed them to nearly going extinct was the introduction of very effective mammalian predators (mustelids). They had evolved for a land where the only predators were avian and sight based. So they became flightless because no point in flying away from danger when the danger was flying above you, and they developed cryptic colouration, they'd freeze when they sensed danger and became nocturnal. And most importantly, they used scent in lieu of dramatic colours to find each other in dense forest in the breeding season. No harm there, because raptors hunt by sight, not scent.But being a smelly bird who is camouflaged and nocturnal and stands still, is no defense against ground predators who hunt by scent and quite appreciate not having to run after you.I have the diaries of an explorer in the 1890s who would eat five k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d for breakfast, they were that easy for him to locate using his dogs, within 80 years of his parrot based breakfasts they were extinct on the mainland.But yeah, habitat loss reduced their range, then human hunting reduced their range, then feral dogs and later cats reduced their range. But they were still around in decent numbers.Then mustelids were introduced, and that was the tipping point, but only in the context of the prior stresses.So for megafauna, hunting pressure places a population under stress, especially in species with a low replacement rate.Climate change and the resulting changes in the ecosystem also puts populations under stress.Maybe one of those stressors was survivable, but probably not both.And for some megafaunal extinctions, especially on islands, it's pretty obvious humans were the deciding factor. Maybe not through hunting, just habitat loss could be sufficient (e.g., elephant bird), but often habitat loss went hand in hand with intensive hunting (e.g., moa)This paper's worth a read. https://www.academia.edu/2644492/The_Associational_Critique_...replymlhpdx 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]What comes with people migrating to new environments?

Occasionally the design language of a physical media property is carried forward with the font in a way that is interesting enough to be worthwhile (ie _The Atlantic_'s title font is instantly recognizable but not critical).If you're bandwidth starved (ie ISDN or worse) then it's also a nice speedup.replypentagrama 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yeah, but as I mentioned in other comment, I found many issues with icons by blocking remote fonts, look at Google Podcasts https://imgur.com/a/6de4uNLreplyvelosol 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Google Podcasts while ugly without that icon font is still usable but the Mercado site seemed to be inaccessible.
