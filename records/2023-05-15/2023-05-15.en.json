    "content": "Attorney General James Secures $615,000 from Companies that Supplied Fake Comments to Influence FCC\u2019s Repeal of Net Neutrality RulesThree Companies Supplied Fake Comments to FCC Impersonating Millions of Americans Without Their Knowledge or Consent to Influence Internet PolicyMay 10, 2023NEW YORK \u2013 New York Attorney General Letitia James today secured $615,000 from three companies, LCX, Lead ID, and Ifficient, that supplied millions of fake public comments to influence a 2017 proceeding by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to repeal net neutrality rules. Net neutrality prohibits broadband providers from blocking, slowing down, or charging companies to prioritize certain content on the internet. An investigation by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) found that the fake comments used the identities of millions of consumers, including thousands of New Yorkers, without their knowledge or consent. Collectively, the three companies have agreed to pay $615,000 in penalties and disgorgement. This is the second series of agreements secured by Attorney General James with companies that supplied fake comments to the FCC.\u201cPublic comment opportunities are a chance for Americans to give their input on important government policies, and these companies abused that for their own selfish purposes,\u201d said Attorney General James. \u201cNo one should have their identity co-opted by manipulative companies and used to falsely promote a private agenda. Through this agreement, we are holding three more companies accountable for impersonating Americans without their knowledge or consent. We will always fight to ensure that consumers\u2019 identities are protected and fraudulent companies are stopped.\u201dToday\u2019s agreements are the result of an investigation by OAG that uncovered widespread fraud and abusive practices surrounding efforts to sway the FCC in the agency\u2019s 2017 net neutrality rulemaking proceeding. As detailed in a report by OAG, the nation\u2019s largest broadband companies funded a secret campaign to generate millions of comments to the FCC in 2017. These comments provided \u201ccover\u201d for the FCC to repeal net neutrality rules. To help generate these comments, the broadband industry engaged commercial lead generators that used advertisements and prizes, like gift cards and sweepstakes entries, to encourage consumers to join the campaign. However, nearly every lead generator that was hired to enroll consumers in the campaign instead simply fabricated consumers\u2019 responses. As a result, more than 8.5 million fake comments that impersonated real people were submitted to the FCC, and more than half a million fake letters were sent to Congress. Two of the companies, LCX and Lead ID, were each engaged to enroll consumers in the campaign. Instead, each independently fabricated responses for 1.5 million consumers. The third company, Ifficient, acted as an intermediary, engaging other lead generators to enroll consumers in the campaign. Ifficient supplied its client with more than 840,000 fake responses it had received from the lead generators it had hired.The OAG\u2019s investigation also revealed that the fraud perpetrated by the various lead generators in the net neutrality campaign infected other government proceedings as well. Several of the lead generation firms involved in the broadband industry\u2019s net neutrality comment campaigns had also worked on other, unrelated campaigns to influence regulatory agencies and public officials. In nearly all of these advocacy campaigns, the lead generation firms engaged in fraud. As a result, more than 1 million fake comments were generated for other rulemaking proceedings, and more than 3.5 million fake digital signatures for letters and petitions were generated for federal and state legislators and government officials across the nation.LCX and Lead ID were responsible for many of these fake comments, letters, and petition signatures. Across four advocacy campaigns in 2017 and 2018, LCX fabricated consumer responses used in approximately 900,000 public comments submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) at the U.S. Department of the Interior. Similarly, in advocacy campaigns between 2017 and 2019, Lead ID fabricated more than half a million consumer responses. These campaigns targeted a variety of government agencies and officials at the federal and state levels.The agreements announced today require the three companies and their principals to pay penalties and disgorgement. LCX and its principals will pay $400,000 in penalties and disgorgement to New York and $100,000 to the San Diego District Attorney\u2019s Office. Lead ID and its principal will pay $30,000 in penalties and disgorgement to New York. Ifficient will pay $63,750 in penalties and disgorgement to New York, and $21,250 to Colorado. The OAG wishes to thank the offices of the Attorney General of Colorado and the San Diego District Attorney for their assistance in this matter.This matter was handled by Senior Enforcement Counsel Jordan Adler and former Assistant Attorney General Noah Stein of the Bureau of Internet and Technology, under the supervision of Deputy Bureau Chief Clark Russell and Bureau Chief Kim Berger. The Bureau of Internet and Technology is a part of the Division for Economic Justice, which is overseen by Chief Deputy Attorney General Chris D\u2019Angelo and First Deputy Jennifer Levy.",

LCX and Lead ID were responsible for the fraudulent actions used in approximately 900,000 comments submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at the US Department of the Interior, and more than half a million responses to government agencies and officials. The issue has raised concerns about the validity of anonymous online petitions and demands greater accountability. The scammers function by collecting the emails of people who have clicked on arguments they support and using fake profiles to post their arguments.New York Attorney General Letitia James has settled an investigation into fake public comments regarding net neutrality for $4.4 million with a public relations firm that produced them. The settlement follows a multi-year investigation by James' office, which found that millions of fake comments were submitted and used the identities of millions of consumers. The settlement also includes new measures to prevent fake comments. However, critics argue that the settlement is insufficient and that stronger measures are needed to address the issue of fake comments that manipulate public opinion.Verizon was found to have throttled firefighters during a major wildfire, leading to a new ruling in which the FCC can no longer limit state net neutrality laws. The issue of net neutrality became a debate over whether big tech should have to pay larger fees to big ISP to access their customer base. Some argued that the fight against net neutrality was a battle of big tech vs big ISP, with both sides looking out for their bottom lines. Netflix faced criticism for wanting to avoid paying their fair share for peering arrangements, but ultimately was able to move forward by creating a technical solution to the problem through caching. Concerns continue about ISPs wanting to charge differently for different content types and providers.Three telecom companies constructively engaged in identity theft and fraud by directing fake comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to influence its repeal of net neutrality; the New York Attorney General found each defendant contributed to more than two million fraudulent comments, and will pay $700,000 in penalties. Despite the lack of evidence that public comments influenced the FCC's decision or that net neutrality policies are necessary, activists call for harsher penalties and investigations. The comment section on Hacker News offers a glimpse into the debate over net neutrality, interconnection arrangements, and fake online reviews.The New York Attorney General secured $615,000 from three companies that supplied fake comments to influence the FCC's repeal of net neutrality rules. However, people on the thread have criticized the amount as a mere slap on the wrist. Many users emphasize the importance of public awareness to prevent such incidents from happening again, and some have even called for criminal prosecution and jail time. The discussion also touches on the issues of democracy, corruption, and the impact of net neutrality on end-users, ISPs, and internet companies. Overall, the thread emphasizes the need for transparency, accountability, and fair practices in government and the tech industry.- Three companies fined $615,000 for submitting fake comments in support of the repeal of net neutrality regulations.\n- Commenters question the significance of the punishment and call for civil lawsuits for damages.\n- Some suggest that online election donation systems are subject to the same type of fraud as the net neutrality comment system.\n- Commenters criticize the limited punishment and call for jail time for individuals involved and the release of victims' information. \n- Links to articles detailing how the fake comments were submitted are provided.",

Nietzsche sees that when we are at our noontide, we must realize how the sun has reached its highest point before it begins to fall down from its position: and we must understand that as a whole, our bodies are determined by something outside of ourselves - and that this always leads to more suffering within.Nietzsche's MiddayNietzsche expands upon the concept of noon in his book The Gay Science (1882), where he says:\"You want to learn how to read? Here is a short lesson for beginners. You must take hold of a word by its smooth or rough side; then, like the spider, you must spin out of it a web of definitions which will entrap every correct meaning that floats into view. Or again: you must take the word for a sleigh ride across country, over hedges and ditches, forests and glades, in short, you must drive the word home through all manner of weather.\"Here we see Nietzsche expand upon his concept of noon to include our ability to define what is right or wrong - it is only because we have this inherent sense that allows us to distinguish between two points.Nietzsche's TwilightNietzsche expands upon the concept of twilight in The Gay Science (1882), where he says:\"The man who is a \u2018philosopher\u2019 only by accident, but is, let us say, also a sculptor or painter \u2013 what does he then do? He does not make his thoughts subservient to the world; rather, he forces the world to serve as a pedestal and bearer for his thoughts.\"Here we see Nietzsche's concept of night begin to expand past an emotional state. We begin to see that night becomes more than just our inability to think clearly: it is now a worldview, one which he claims is best exemplified by the artist.Nietzsche's MidnightIn Twilight of the Idols (1889), we find Nietzsche's conceptualization of night reaching its zenith:\"Everything ordinary, everyday, common \u2013 in fact, everything that exists today has become dangerous; it is not innocent as was everything yesterday. For the most terrible thoughts have penetrated everywhere and even into the deepest sleep - thoughts which are awake, active, and powerful.\"",

However, challenges such as developing ground truth on divisive issues exist. Wikipedia's key to success is its finite goal and its no-engagement policy, which makes it anti-social. The non-commercial nature of Wikipedia has also contributed to its success. While Wikipedia collates narratives that can be drawn from citable evidence, there have been criticisms that its historical articles aren't always accurate. The success of Wikipedia is attributed to its many reads, few writes model and its collection of weirdos who are nerding out over collecting all information. Wikipedia is a quasi-religious calling that has earned a place in the temple itself.Twitter users are claiming that the US government pressured Wikipedia to change the definition of recession to fit its particular worldview. While there is no evidence of government intervention, there are groups of people known as \"Politburo\" in Germany who hold disproportionate influence over Wikipedia's content. Those groups are not necessarily working in the government's interests, but they still control what is said on Wikipedia. The discussion thread also delves into the topic of paid features on Twitter, which allow paying users' comments to appear first in response threads, minimizing other users' voices. It is suggested that Wikipedia has become invested in promoting certain biases and is no longer interested in representing the most accurate information.A debate about Wikipedia's content has emerged on Hacker News. Though some considered it an effective platform for balancing articles, others have criticized the visibility of conflicts within the community of editors, which influences content production. The topics of disputes are not limited to political conflict but extend to mundane facts, such as Kevin Durant's height. An empirical study supports the existence of a \"tiny minority of the userbase\" that has significantly influenced the production of Wikipedia's content. Despite the controversies, some users still value Wikipedia for its non-profit, community-based contributions to the documentation of human knowledge, which offer individuals here-and-now satisfaction in helping others without an intense need to earn money.The discussion revolves around the relationship between capitalism and non-profit organizations, particularly in the tech sector. The argument is made that capitalism often undermines ethical and sustainable products and services by driving them out of the market when competing with their free alternatives. The article explores the idea that non-profit enterprises can provide a more valuable internet service, as evidenced by the fact that the most valuable websites are non-profits. The discussion touches on the political nature of the internet and how different countries operate their own web services. Finally, the threat of state actors on user privacy and anonymity on the internet is considered, including government censorship and government spying.Elon Musk and Jimmy Wales debate Twitter censorship in Turkey. There are concerns over Twitter\u2019s latest agreement with Turkey. There is discussion of using Turk to post alternative content. Wikipedia is praised, however, there is criticism over their policy of using Western reliable sources for articles, leading to a bias. One person pledges to double their donation to Wikipedia. Concerns over censorship in Pakistan are highlighted.",

In this post, we'll go over how to use the networkQuality tool and some of its key features.Running the Default TestsTo access the Network Quality tool, open the Terminal app on your Mac and enter the following command:networkQuality -vThis command starts the tool and performs the default set of tests, displaying the results in the Terminal window.Example output:==== SUMMARY ====Uplink capacity: 44.448 Mbps (Accuracy: High)Downlink capacity: 162.135 Mbps (Accuracy: High)Responsiveness: Low (73 RPM) (Accuracy: High)Idle Latency: 50.125 milliseconds (Accuracy: High)Interface: en0Uplink bytes transferred: 69.921 MBDownlink bytes transferred: 278.340 MBUplink Flow count: 16Downlink Flow count: 12Start: 13/05/2023, 15:04:13End: 13/05/2023, 15:04:27OS Version: Version 13.3.1 (a) (Build 22E772610a)Usage:USAGE: networkQuality [-C <configuration_url>] [-c] [-h] [-I <network interface name>] [-k] [-p] [-r host] [-s] [-v]  -C: override Configuration URL or path (with scheme file://)  -c: Produce computer-readable output  -h: Show help (this message)  -I: Bind test to interface (e.g., en0, pdp_ip0,...)  -k: Disable certificate validation  -p: Use Private Relay  -r: Connect to host or IP, overriding DNS for initial config request  -s: Run tests sequentially instead of parallel upload/download  -v: Verbose outputUsing Private RelayThe Network Quality tool also supports Apple's Private Relay feature, which encrypts and routes all network traffic through two separate servers for added privacy and security. To use Private Relay with the tool, you can add the \"-p\" flag to the command:networkQuality -v -pCustomizing the ConfigurationYou can customize the configuration used by the Network Quality tool. By default, the tool requests a configuration file from Apple everytime via https://mensura.cdn-apple.com/api/v1/gm/config. However, you can specify a different Configuration URL using the -C flag.Apple's default config:{ \"version\": 1, \"test_endpoint\": \"uklon6-edge-bx-031.aaplimg.com\", \"urls\": {   \"small_https_download_url\": \"https://mensura.cdn-apple.com/api/v1/gm/small\",   \"large_https_download_url\": \"https://mensura.cdn-apple.com/api/v1/gm/large\",   \"https_upload_url\": \"https://mensura.cdn-apple.com/api/v1/gm/slurp\",   \"small_download_url\": \"https://mensura.cdn-apple.com/api/v1/gm/small\",   \"large_download_url\": \"https://mensura.cdn-apple.com/api/v1/gm/large\",   \"upload_url\": \"https://mensura.cdn-apple.com/api/v1/gm/slurp\"  }}Apple's test_endpoint changes on each request, selecting a different nearby server to reduce latency and distributing their server load.For example, if you have a custom configuration file located at https://networkquality.example.com/config, you can use the following command to run the Network Quality tool with your custom configuration:networkQuality -v -C https://networkquality.example.com/configThis command starts the tool and performs the tests using the configuration specified in the custom configuration file.Creating Your Own ServerIf you want to set up your own server for the Network Quality tool, you can find documentation on how to do so on the project's GitHub page at https://github.com/network-quality/server. This allows you to customize the tool to your specific needs and run it on your own infrastructure.Go Server: https://github.com/network-quality/goserverConclusionThe networkQuality tool in macOS is a powerful tool for measuring the performance of your network connection. The fact you can run the test via Apple Private Relay without iCloud+ is a neat feature. Next steps for me will be to self-host my own server which will be a good way to test network speeds locally.networkQuality Wiki/Community: https://github.com/network-quality/community/wikiIPPM Responsiveness Draft RFC: https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-cpaasch-ippm-responsiveness-00.htmlTagsmacOSUnixSubscribe to our newsletterGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox.Your email addressSubscribeAndyRecommended for youmacOSmacOS VMs on Apple Silicon with UTM9 hours ago\u20222 min read",

    "content": "In MemoriamHow I remember my father2023-04-23PreviousHome    This is a more personal post than the usual. My father passed away this week in India.My brother and I were remembering the many ways in which he touched our lives, as he had doubtless affected so many others.Baba was an old-school father, in an era when fathers didn't spend much time with their children. But when he did, he liked to show us a magic trick like cutting off his own finger, or a mathematical puzzle. He showed me how to use his slide rule, a Faber-Castell Aristo with beautiful red and green markings in a leather case.Very rarely, we talked about important things.He wouldn't hurt a fly, literally. If he caught a creature inside the house, he would carefully open the window and toss it out. Even when a cobra came out of the grass in the monsoons, he would not let us hurt it. Raised in a strict Maharashtrian Brahmin household and then in the College of Engineering in Pune, he was well-read but hadn't seen much of the real world before entering the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun. In the officers' mess they had arranged yellow flowers on the tables for the cadets to eat, which he discovered were boiled cut eggs.I had always wondered how a peace-loving, creative and bright mind like his had found itself in a rigid, top-down military bureaucracy. After getting his engineering degree, what had possessed him to become a commissioned officer?I did ask him once. He said he had been bored working for a public works department in a town in Gujarat and for the state-owned oil company ONGC. Besides, he said, one of his childhood buddies from New English School in Satara had entered the National Defence Academy and loved being an army officer. So, he decided to sign up, too.I wanted to know how it had turned out for him.The career of a Bombay SapperLike many regiments in the Indian army, the Bombay Engineering Group, a.k.a. the Bombay Sappers, is much older than the country, having been raised even before the British Indian army, in the days of the East India Company. These are combat engineers whose business is mines, bridges, and similar technical work.From his home base in the Bombay Sappers, Baba was often sent to faraway places. His postings read like a travelogue of the Indian subcontinent, a lot of it in the Eastern and Western Himalayas: Nagaland, Tezpur, Shillong, Mussoorie. He was often an instructor for project management or technical subjects at some institute or another.However, his official obituary from the Bombay Sappers has a few gaps during classified assignments. One of these gaps is for a few months starting in November 1971, the period of combat operations in the Bangladesh Liberation War.I had to dig a bit to find out what he did during the war.An engineers' warIndian troops invaded East Pakistan to help the Bengali rebels, forced the Pakistan military to surrender, and created the new nation of Bangladesh. If ever a war was justified, it was the Bangladesh war.Embedded within the invading Indian army brigades were engineering units. The engineers \"shape the terrain\" in battle. They plant or clear mines and lay down or demolish road surfaces or bridges, enabling their own side to make progress while hindering the enemy.East Pakistan was criss-crossed with rivers in loamy and marshy soil. It was difficult to move equipment and material. Many roads, bridges, and ferries had to be built and destroyed around the clock, often under enemy fire. Military historians called it an engineers' war.Baba was part of 268 Engineer Regiment, and he mentioned to me one particular bridge across the Kabadak river that had been destroyed by the Pakistani defenders. I was able to find a contemporary picture of it:The 268 Engineers had to rebuild the bridge temporarily using prefabricated parts carried into battle.I was able to find a picture of the rebuilt bridge. The broken sections of the original bridge lie undisturbed below.The new bridge is a simple, continuous type of \"Bailey bridge\" that spans the river from end to end, but this river was too wide, and the engineers had to support it in the middle by building a pier made of steel cages.My father designed a \"distribution beam girder,\" a rigid structure made of steel plates, to distribute the load on to the new pier. He got it made from a shipbuilding yard in Calcutta. They produced it overnight, and the army transported it and assembled it on site.Baba's comrade-in-arms, Major SS Rajan, who commanded the 268 Engineer company that built the bridge, took the picture below.You can see Maj Rajan directing the bridge placement on top of the new steel structure. Supported in this way, the bridge could span the river successfully.A life accomplishedThe war was over fourteen days after it was declared, a complete and rapid victory.Maj Rajan, who retired as a Colonel, told me this week that my father had designed the entire custom structure by himself and that it had worked the first time. \"He was a brilliant man,\" he said.I am sure it must have been a great feeling to have been useful, to have served your country and to have done it well.2023-04-23PreviousHome    (About) (LinkedIn) (Substack)All text and images Copyright 2020--2023 Sudheer Apte",

Thank you for your wishes.I do see that a short obituary like this needs some context. To address some of the comments:* Why choose to disclose that my father was a Maharashtrian Brahmin: being brought up in such a household in the early twentieth century implies a lot of things. For example, rigid rules about non-violence and purity; not being exposed to other people's food and customs; avoiding leaving your country and going far away from home. These are huge barriers for a twenty-something signing up for a commission in the military. It's very relevant to reveal who he was and what choices he made. I should note that historically, certain groups sign up in the Indian army, and many groups don't. [1]Regarding objections to the word Brahmin being mentioned, I should clarify: the caste system was evil, particularly in the nineteenth century, and the government of India made it illegal as soon as it became independent. Despite that, discrimination continues in many places today. But to understand people, you need to know something about them. The word Brahmin by itself is not a precise enough descriptor. Indian castes are much more local than that. \"Maharashtrian Brahmin\", in particular \"Chitpawan Konkanastha Brahmin\", is much more precise, and these gruops have their own history. In Maharashtra during this period, these groups gave up their land under the land reform movement [2]. Brahmins no longer owned property or exercised much real power, especially not over other groups. They tended to be well educated but middle-class. It would be quite different from being an upper-caste landowner in (say) Bihar during this period.* Why say that the Bangladesh war was justified: again, looking at it from my father's point of view, I think it would be an important consideration for him. Not that he would have a choice in the matter---once you sign up, you have to fight. But he would need to justify it to himself.[1] The Indian Army: its contribution to the development of a nation, Stephen P. Cohen. https://www.amazon.com/Indian-Army-Contributions-Development...[2] The \"Bhoodan movement\", (donate-your-land movement) by Vinobha Bhave in the 1950s: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhoodan_movementreplyrobertlagrant 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> the caste system was evil, particularly in the nineteenth century, and the government of India made it illegal as soon as it became independent.I've heard this before, but can't find evidence of it. Does the caste system not live on to this day? I thought caste is a protected class in terms of legally discrimination, and not a thing that's been banned.Any present-day Indians able to clarify? My dad left India when he was three, so my knowledge is not current :-)replyjitix 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Caste based discrimination is illegal in India, but erstwhile lower castes are given academic and job reservations as a form of socio-economic equity. But as with a lot of government schemes this provision gets abused to some degree and many upper caste people claim that as \"discrimination\".That being said, there is no enforcement of the \"no-caste\" policy so in many smaller towns/villages the caste system is still widely practiced and lower caste folks discriminated/beaten/killed/etc.replytoast0 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]As an outsider, here's my take. The historic caste system included many restrictions on what people could do and who they could do it with. That's what was banned.That said, there are a lot of ways to guess at caste if one is so inclined[1], and some people choose to use these guesses to discriminate. That's why it's a protected class --- it's not permissable to discriminate based on caste. There's also affirmative action for historically repressed castes, with all that comes with affitrmative action, for better or worse.[1] caste related surnames and diet are the most easily understood by an outsider like me, but I think there may be caste related firstnames and other cultural indicators that I'm not aware of.replymplewis 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The system even persists today outside of the continent: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-11/how-big-t...replyOJFord 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Discrimination based on race, gender, socio-economic class, age, ... is illegal in the UK, EU, and I think the US (or at least California).Does that help?

The first part is on the concept of probability and considers making decisions in conflict situations, optimizing queues, games, and the control of various processes, and doing random searches.The second part of this text shows how fundamental chance is in nature using the probabilistic laws of modern physics and biology as examples. Elements of quantum mechanics are also involved, and this allows the author to demonstrate how probabilistic laws are basic to microscopic phenomena. The idea is that the reader, passing from the first part of the book to the second one, would see that probability is not only around us but it is at the basis of everything.Translated from the Russian by Michael Burov First published 1988Revised from the 1984 Russian editionThis completely digital version typeset in using LaTeX with EB Garamond font by Damitr Mazanav damitr@proton.meIn this electronic edition all the figures have been reworked in the SVG format using Inkscape for a clearer presentation.Released on the web by http://mirtitles.org in 2023.Access the LaTeX project files gitlab.com/mirtitles/twibopAddeddate 2023-05-13 06:03:21Identifier lev-tarasov-the-world-is-built-on-probability-mir-2023Identifier-ark ark:/13960/s2j7r1hg8gkOcr tesseract 5.3.0-3-g9920Ocr_detected_lang enOcr_detected_lang_conf 1.0000Ocr_detected_script LatinOcr_detected_script_conf 1.0000Ocr_module_version 0.0.21Ocr_parameters -l engPage_number_confidence 90.30Ppi 300SHOW MOREplus-circleAdd ReviewcommentReviewsReviewer: Yagub Aliyev -favorite- May 13, 2023Subject: Why TeX?I agree that it is great to have this book in TeX, but what is the point of going through so much efforts to get this when you can just scan it.

In comparison, the level of bad bot sophistication in 2021 was 25.9%.Account takeover (ATO) attacks increased 155% in 2022 and 15% of all login attempts in the past 12 months \u2014 across all industries \u2014 were classified as account takeover.In 2022, 17% of all attacks on APIs came from bad bots abusing business logic. In addition, 35% of account takeover attacks in 2022 specifically targeted an API.Travel (24.7%), retail (21%) and financial services (12.7%) experienced the highest volume of bot attacks. Gaming (58.7%) and telecommunications (47.7%) had the highest proportion of bad bot traffic on their websites and applications.Of the 13 countries analyzed in the report, seven had bad bot traffic levels that exceeded the global average of 30.2%.

    "hn_content": "According to Security Magazine, 47% of all internet traffic came from bots in 2022. This has led some website owners to block every bot due to lowered search engine value and increased costs caused by scraping. Some website owners have noticed that Bing has been the biggest culprit of scraping and have chosen to block their IP ranges. Blocking bots has led to a reduction in traffic and associated costs. While blocking bots may lead to potential loss of data, some website owners are willing to take the risk to reduce costs. Caching and having a good open API can also help reduce costs and improve cache hit rates.Cloudflare's anti-bot measures can be turned off to decrease server load, as it is more efficient to serve bots from the cache. It is possible to block ASNs using firewalls and tools like bgp.he.net. Video streaming accounts for over half of internet bandwidth, with YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook video being the top three providers. Bad bots account for a significant portion of internet traffic and often scrape websites, while some bots watch YouTube and Twitch to boost viewership. There are concerns about search engines allowing scrapers to feature highly in search results. Paid proxy providers heavily charge bandwidth for mobile and residential proxies, which bots can use to view videos. A significant number of bad robots crawl non-video hosts, causing server overload and necessitating measures like rate limiting.A recent report by Imperva claims that 47% of internet traffic is automated and 30.2% of that is made up of bad bots, causing trouble for well-behaved scrapers. Cloudflare, however, claims that the percent of bots vs. humans is about ~29%, calling into question Imperva's definition of \"internet traffic.\" Much of this traffic is streaming video, and ad fraud is a significant problem in the space. The report also notes that 1-in-5 bad bots used Mobile Safari as their browser of choice in 2022, up from 16.1% in 2021. Additionally, the report found that certain cookies are required to navigate some sites, which may be in conflict with GDPR regulations. The report has been met with some skepticism for potentially conflating web traffic with all internet traffic.",

Because it depend on a package missing on some architectures, the autopkgtest check of the testing migration script did not understand that the tests were actually working, so the migration was delayed. A bug in the package dependencies is also fixed, so those installing the firewall package (opensnitch) now also get the GUI admin tool (python3-opensnitch-ui) installed by default. I am very grateful to Gustavo I\u00f1iguez Goya for his work on getting the package ready for Debian Bookworm.Armed with this package I have discovered some surprising connections from programs I believed were able to work completly offline, and it has already proven its worth, at least to me. If you too want to get more familiar with the kind of programs using Internett connections on your machine, I recommend testing apt install opensnitch in Bookworm and see what you think.The package is still not able to build its eBPF module within Debian. Not sure how much work it would be to get it working, but suspect some kernel related packages need to be extended with more header files to get it working.As usual, if you use Bitcoin and want to show your support of my activities, please send Bitcoin donations to my address 15oWEoG9dUPovwmUL9KWAnYRtNJEkP1u1b.Tags: debian, english, opensnitch.Archive2023January (3)February (1)April (2)May (2)2022February (1)March (3)April (2)June (2)July (1)September (1)October (1)December (1)2021January (2)February (1)May (1)June (1)July (3)August (1)September (1)October (1)December (1)2020February (2)March (2)April (2)May (3)June (2)July (1)September (1)October (1)November (1)2019January (4)February (3)March (3)May (2)June (5)July (2)August (1)September (1)November (1)December (4)2018January (1)February (5)March (5)April (3)June (2)July (5)August (3)September (3)October (5)November (2)December (4)2017January (4)February (3)March (5)April (2)June (5)July (1)August (1)September (3)October (5)November (3)December (4)2016January (3)February (2)March (3)April (8)May (8)June (2)July (2)August (5)September (2)October (3)November (8)December (5)2015January (7)February (6)March (1)April (4)May (3)June (4)July (6)August (2)September (2)October (9)November (6)December (3)2014January (2)February (3)March (8)April (7)May (1)June (2)July (2)August (2)September (5)October (6)November (3)December (5)2013January (11)February (9)March (9)April (6)May (9)June (10)July (7)August (3)September (5)October (7)November (9)December (3)2012January (7)February (10)March (17)April (12)May (12)June (20)July (17)August (6)September (9)October (17)November (10)December (7)2011January (16)February (6)March (6)April (7)May (3)June (2)July (7)August (6)September (4)October (2)November (3)December (1)2010January (2)February (1)March (3)April (3)May (9)June (14)July (12)August (13)September (7)October (9)November (13)December (12)2009January (8)February (8)March (12)April (10)May (9)June (3)July (4)August (3)September (1)October (2)November (3)December (3)2008November (5)December (7)Tags3d-printer (19)amiga (1)aros (1)bankid (4)betalkontant (9)bitcoin (12)bootsystem (17)bsa (2)chrpath (2)debian (192)debian edu (159)debian-handbook (9)digistan (11)dld (18)docbook (30)drivstoffpriser (4)english (448)fiksgatami (23)fildeling (14)freeculture (34)freedombox (9)frikanalen (20)h264 (20)intervju (43)isenkram (16)kart (23)kodi (4)ldap (9)lego (5)lenker (8)linuxcnc (5)lsdvd (2)ltsp (1)madewithcc (3)mesh network (8)multimedia (45)nice free software (14)noark5 (23)norsk (320)nuug (198)offentlig innsyn (40)open311 (2)opensnitch (3)opphavsrett (75)personvern (114)raid (2)reactos (1)reprap (11)rfid (3)robot (17)rss (1)ruter (7)scraperwiki (2)sikkerhet (59)sitesummary (4)skepsis (5)standard (74)stavekontroll (7)stortinget (14)surveillance (64)sysadmin (5)usenix (2)valg (9)verkidetfri (20)video (78)vitenskap (4)web (42)Created by Chronicle v4.6",

While the user interface can be finicky at times, it's generally working very well. My biggest annoyance would be creating robust rules for applications using runtimes like Python, Java, Node, Electron or even Wine.

It has a table with each host and the network horizon it can see. Then I create a virtual machine for each activity that needs a separate horizon.The one thing I'm missing is some way of securing the binding of hosts to addresses.

I discuss these theories in terms of two fundamentally different development styles, the ``cathedral'' model of most of the commercial world versus the ``bazaar'' model of the Linux world. I show that these models derive from opposing assumptions about the nature of the software-debugging task. I then make a sustained argument from the Linux experience for the proposition that ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow'', suggest productive analogies with other self-correcting systems of selfish agents, and conclude with some exploration of the implications of this insight for the future of software.Table of ContentsThe Cathedral and the BazaarThe Mail Must Get ThroughThe Importance of Having UsersRelease Early, Release OftenHow Many Eyeballs Tame ComplexityWhen Is a Rose Not a Rose?Popclient becomes FetchmailFetchmail Grows UpA Few More Lessons from FetchmailNecessary Preconditions for the Bazaar StyleThe Social Context of Open-Source SoftwareOn Management and the Maginot LineEpilog: Netscape Embraces the BazaarNotesBibliographyAcknowledgementsThe Cathedral and the BazaarLinux is subversive. Who would have thought even five years ago (1991) that a world-class operating system could coalesce as if by magic out of part-time hacking by several thousand developers scattered all over the planet, connected only by the tenuous strands of the Internet?Certainly not I. By the time Linux swam onto my radar screen in early 1993, I had already been involved in Unix and open-source development for ten years. I was one of the first GNU contributors in the mid-1980s. I had released a good deal of open-source software onto the net, developing or co-developing several programs (nethack, Emacs's VC and GUD modes, xlife, and others) that are still in wide use today. I thought I knew how it was done.Linux overturned much of what I thought I knew. I had been preaching the Unix gospel of small tools, rapid prototyping and evolutionary programming for years. But I also believed there was a certain critical complexity above which a more centralized, a priori approach was required. I believed that the most important software (operating systems and really large tools like the Emacs programming editor) needed to be built like cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation, with no beta to be released before its time.Linus Torvalds's style of development\u2014release early and often, delegate everything you can, be open to the point of promiscuity\u2014came as a surprise. No quiet, reverent cathedral-building here\u2014rather, the Linux community seemed to resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches (aptly symbolized by the Linux archive sites, who'd take submissions from anyone) out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles.The fact that this bazaar style seemed to work, and work well, came as a distinct shock. As I learned my way around, I worked hard not just at individual projects, but also at trying to understand why the Linux world not only didn't fly apart in confusion but seemed to go from strength to strength at a speed barely imaginable to cathedral-builders.By mid-1996 I thought I was beginning to understand. Chance handed me a perfect way to test my theory, in the form of an open-source project that I could consciously try to run in the bazaar style. So I did\u2014and it was a significant success.This is the story of that project. I'll use it to propose some aphorisms about effective open-source development. Not all of these are things I first learned in the Linux world, but we'll see how the Linux world gives them particular point. If I'm correct, they'll help you understand exactly what it is that makes the Linux community such a fountain of good software\u2014and, perhaps, they will help you become more productive yourself.

    "hn_content": "A controversial discussion on Hacker News critiques the value and validity of the tech classic 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar,' published in 1999 by Eric S. Raymond. Some users argue that the insights contained in the book's key tenets, such as 'release early, release often' and 'Linus' law,' are now outdated. Nonetheless, the discussion notes that the article was significant at the time as it chronicled the transition of the computing industry from hobbyists to open-source codes. Debate surrounds the value of 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar' as a commentary on software development and its place in tech history.A group of sociologists discovered that the averaged opinion of a mass of experts is a more reliable predictor of OS debugging than a single randomly-chosen observer, which is known as the Delphi effect. Linus Torvalds showed that the Delphi effect can tame OS development complexity through its application to operating system debugging. There were debates about the quality of open-source software and how its ubiquity would inevitably lead to fewer bugs. The argument presented here is that paying and training experts to look for bugs could result in better software quality, as it is something people do not like doing. Some disputed the claims made by the essay about the efficacy of open-source software and how it relates to the overall quality of software. The metaphor in 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar' captured the imaginations of many software developers when open-source software became mainstream, and open source was part of the dotcom bubble, capturing a new audience and promoting collaboration.An online discussion on the 1997 essay \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\" by Eric S. Raymond highlighted the changing landscape of open source and the challenges it faces, specifically in scalability, funding, and community management. The article is credited with capturing the zeitgeist of open source culture at the time and helped define the concept of the bazaar model versus the cathedral model. The discussion also revealed the limitations of the bazaar model, including issues with feature creep, bikeshedding, and a lack of holistic vision. Additionally, it showed the challenges of creating large-scale open-source projects due to design arguments, funding, and community management issues. Finally, the discussion highlighted the lack of clear rules and documentation in archaic things, leading to lost knowledge over time.The article discusses the differences between traditional software engineering and software development in an open-source environment. It argues that open source development exemplifies the Bazaar model of organization, which allows distributed coordination and long-running, complex open source projects. Some of the major open-source projects are collaborations with multiple large corporations. Large, successful open source projects are handled as large engineering projects, with architects and lead engineers for each area or feature at least. However, the open-source model is not immune to gatekeeping, and the largest open source projects have their own priesthoods. Corporations have become the biggest Linux contributors, proving that open-source software development has become increasingly industrial-commercial. Eric S Raymond's contention that the open-source model has made Linux hard to compete with ignores the role of commercial development; nonetheless, many successful open-source projects have been run well.There is no meaningful content in this text that can be summarized. The text contains racist, violent, and inflammatory statements made by Eric S Raymond, a well-known programmer and tech writer. It is not appropriate for use in any professional or educational setting.",

    "hn_content": "The post on Hacker News discusses the limitations of console programming and remote work, highlighting the need for tools like tmux that allow users to multiplex terminals, run long-term CLI and TUI applications, and split panels in various ways. The discussion touches on various alternatives to tmux, including WezTerm, dtach, and screen, with some users preferring one over the other. The post also references the frustration of users working on remote machines, unable to access advanced graphical features due to the limitations of terminal emulators. The conversation also touches on the sixel protocol, which enables graphical support in the console but is not universally supported.Tech enthusiasts discussed the Sixel encoding protocol and its limitations in displaying graphics, as well as its historical use in dot-matrix printing and glyph definition. The protocol's poor error-recovery characteristics and inefficient encoding are seen as downsides, while other alternatives like x11 are considered better. Some commenters pointed out that sixel is an art project rather than a practical engineering solution. Others mentioned the similar ReGIS and Tektronix graphics protocols, which could also be useful. Some terminal emulators like iTerm and Kitty support sixel, but there are bugs and limitations in how it is implemented. The discussion also touched on other modern terminal emulators like Alacritty, Terminology, and tmux, and ways to display images in terminals using imgcat or framebuffer overlays.GitHub users are discussing how to query the pixel size of a terminal window from within C programs. This would be useful for writing graphics software that needs to know the number of pixels per character cell. Any xterm-compatible terminal should be able to provide these details through the escape codes \"\\x1b[14t\" and \"\\x1b[18t\". These codes are documented in DEC STD 070. Support for the new feature is not consistent across all terminals. Conversations cover challenges facing libraries like Kitty and whether working with graphics in terminals is worth the effort when there are already robust GUI libraries available. Some users argue that terminal-based software has capabilities that GUI libraries do not, so adding bitmap images would be a natural progression.",
