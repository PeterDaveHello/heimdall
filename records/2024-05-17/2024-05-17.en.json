    "originBody": "Here’s a quick and cautionary tale. This eBay auction, spotted by Eric Vitiello, immediately caught my eye: Wow. Someone was selling Apple Employee #10’s employee badge?! What an incredible piece of Apple history! Sure, it’s not Steve Jobs’ badge (despite the auction title), but there are only so many of these in the world — especially from one of the first ten employees. I persistently pored through the provided pictures. At first, it looked good. The plastic was scuffed with age, the tape on the map was yellowed, the logo was (mostly) correct, and Sherry Livingston really was Employee #10. But it also felt a little off. The scuffing looked… sandpapery. The splotches on the map felt overcooked. And I couldn’t stop looking at the “typewritten” part… This badge would’ve been (obviously!) made before desktop publishing. A badge template would’ve been printed by a local printing company, then fed into a typewriter to type the individual employee details. And that typed text is suspiciously uniform. And just as I was beginning to 🧐, along came Chris: “That’s… fake. Both of them.” Oh snap. It’s really fake? What does this Chris guy know, anyway? Well, he’s Chris Espinosa. Who just so happens to be Apple Employee #8. (Trivia: he joined the company when he was 14… and still works there!) And we know exactly what Chris’ badge looked like: I asked Chris (who I truly admire!) for more thoughts: So, yeah. One of the most qualified people on planet earth to say this is a fake, is saying this is a fake. I had no choice at this point. I simply had to meddle. From… the German Red Cross?! How specific! It seems like the German Red Cross runs a kind of second hand/charity shop, so ok, sure. But why would the German Red Cross have the employee badge for Apple Employee #10? I couldn’t wait. The seller sent the Red “Croos” proof just a few hours later. (Enough time to… create it?) At first blush, again, this provenance looks pretty good, right? A German purchase receipt, dated 2001, for the item pictured. The right logo. A nice emboss. Seems plausible. But, again again, I had a weird feeling — this series of photos was trying too hard. That binder labelled “BILLS 200[0]—2010”, conveniently flipped upside down for casual authenticity? Why would you put that in these photos unless you were trying a bit too hard to make your case? It felt like a set dresser trying to stage a movie scene. The seller added: As you can see, the invoice is expressed in the old German currency, the German mark, before the entry of the EURO in the years following. No way. A regular human wouldn’t point this out. Someone proud of a detail they thought of in their forgery would point this out. This little detail would’ve been far more effective for me to discover on my own. It was time to totally close the case. It was time to engage the internet. The Mastodon response from Germans was swift and brutal. There was no doubt. This “proof” was yet another forgery. I told the seller this. And then, weirdly, for the amount of effort put into this, they made a very dumb error: Wait… what?!? I never received a reply. Case closed!? There’s just one small, sad problem… …yes, the item sold before I could finish this post. So, my sincere apologies to whoever out there just spent $946.00 on a total (but interesting!) work of fiction. Here are the key takeaways from our meeting today: Beware of fraudulent pieces of Apple history Don’t buy anything from this particular seller When in doubt, Engage The Internet® Best, Cabel PS: I hope you’re having a nice week Like this: Like Loading…",

    "commentBody": "A forged Apple employee badge (cabel.com)623 points by ecliptik 11 hours agohidepastfavorite208 comments derefr 8 hours ago> And that typed text is way, way cleaner than any typewriter I’ve seen. Pedantic point: electric typewriters (which have existed since the 1960s) do type in a way that looks exactly like this. (In fact, note that the text on the real employee ID card, shown later in the article, doesn't look any less clean! It's just set in a different, narrower font.) The smudginess of mechanical typewriters comes from 1. them striking (and especially, releasing) at the same speed you're depressing the key, and 2. having many of the keys necessarily approach the ribbon from an angle. The keys being swung weakly by your fingers, also has the additional implication that the ink ribbons used in mechanical typewriters have to be soft and squishy (so: made of cloth), and use thin inks. These properties ensure a transfer from even a low-velocity impact. But the trade-off is that cloth ink ribbons transfer only a rough outline of what's struck; and thin inks are high-bleed inks. An electric typewriter, playing out a pre-buffered line with a crisp, predictable report, using linear actuators and a rotating-ball type-head to bang a tape ribbon loaded with high-viscosity ink onto the page, can create text indistinguishable from books/newspapers of the same period, or from modern laser-printer reproductions of the same font faces. They're essentially character-at-a-time letterpresses! (Also, ignoring electric typewriters for a sec: inks bleed more on thin, cheap paper. But this is [a forgery of] an employee ID card — where, for durability, a nice heavyweight paper or cardstock would have been used. You're always going to get a better-looking result inking such paper.) reply dreamcompiler 2 hours agoparent> An electric typewriter, playing out a pre-buffered line with a crisp, predictable report, using linear actuators and a rotating-ball type-head to bang a tape ribbon loaded with high-viscosity ink onto the page The machine you just described is an IBM Composer, except the ribbon was not \"high viscosity\". Rather it was essentially solid, being a carbon ribbon with a mylar back. Most electric typewriters were not Composers, so they did not pre-buffer lines. In fact most electric typewriters were not Selectrics so they didn't even use a ball. The IBM Executive for example used swinging type bars just like a manual typewriter, and it produced excellent copy that was frequently used as a master for offset lithography. (Source: Me. I used to own a print shop.) The presence or absence of swinging type bars, pre-buffering, or balls makes no difference. Carbon ribbons and the repeatability of impression that electric provides are what matter. reply anon946 8 hours agoparentprevI have used multiple typewriters in my life, and agree. In addition, the look of film/tape vs cloth/nylon is very different, and tape ribbon can look very crisp: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_ribbon#Single-pass_(polyme.... reply joe_guy 6 hours agorootparentDo you mind if I ask why you still use typewriters? reply satvikpendem 4 hours agorootparentYou might be interested in this video about why Gen Z is starting to use typewriters again [0]. In a word, focus. They say they are often too distracted from writing when using a computer as it is easy to surf the web instead of writing your paper, so having a single purpose utility rather than a multipurpose one is actually a boon.

I was raised on computers, getting the jumble from my brain onto paper is faster with a keyboard than a pen/pencil and paper. And a typewriter is nice and analog - no screen, no lights, no battery. I'm disconnected, focused, and performant. reply talldatethrow 6 hours agorootparentprevI bought one recently at an estate sale so that I could write things without the ability to open a window and browse the web. reply okasaki 3 hours agorootparentWhy not just use a pen? reply bayindirh 2 hours agorootparentAs an avid pen/paper user I can say that using a pen takes more time, plus you can't OCR it as easily as a typewriter output. Nevertheless carrying a nice pen and a good notebook always beats having a heavy typewriter with you. reply fernandotakai 16 minutes agorootparentprevin my case, writing with a pen for long periods of time makes my hand cramp/hurt real bad (i still write on my journal daily but it's not pleasant). (i don't have a typewriter, but i prefer to type anything because of this). reply notduncansmith 2 hours agorootparentprevI can type on QWERTY much faster and more legibly than I can write with a pen. I suspect this is true for most proficient QWERTY typists. reply okasaki 1 hour agorootparentI've never tested it, but you may be right. On the other hand a pen is smaller, and you can draw and doodle with it. reply ljf 55 minutes agorootparentI used to love doodling and drawing, but as soon as I start to write my hand cramps up. I take hand written (short notes) for work and I struggle to read them a month or so later when the context is gone. I also really struggle to spell, and will consistently get common words wrong. BUT on a keyboard I can type almost as fast as I can think - and I can also spell 90% better - I don't know how it happens but it is like the words 'flow' out of my fingers when i type - and I can easily spell words that if you asked me how to spell I wouldn't have a clue. Also if you asked me to find you a key on a keyboard I'd have to look - but when I'm typing my fingers just know where they are. I'm a 44 yo successful man, but I still don't know my alphabet well (for example I couldn't start in the middle or recite it backwards) - but put me in front of a keyboard and I can type all day long (note - I am VERY thankful for spellcheck though!) reply petesergeant 3 hours agorootparentprevThat piqued my interest for sure. This kind of thing exists too: https://getfreewrite.com/products/freewrite-smart-typewriter... but I'd really like to bring my own keyboard and have the e-ink display at a more ergonomic height. Combine that with Vim, and that'd be something I'd use reply spondylosaurus 3 hours agorootparentYou might enjoy some of the full-fledged e-ink tablets (with folio keyboards, iPad style) on the market right now. Some even run Android, so you could definitely find a way to run Vim. I was just looking at some today but the biggest downside right now is that they're pretty expensive for what you get. reply Maxion 4 hours agorootparentprevAnd, today, with LLMs it'll take you a few seconds to digitize the document, too.

Wrong. Literally gooogle \"selectric type sample\" and see dozens of examples of them not typing anywhere near in a perfect line. Maybe machines with very low hours or kept in excellent condition might have excellent spacing, but there's plenty of examples of them obviously not having perfect spacing. https://www.flickr.com/photos/nicksherman/14249132603 https://www.reddit.com/r/typewriters/comments/e7xxct/typefac... Another example where misalignment is even more obvious: https://www.reddit.com/r/typewriters/comments/sc519r/ibm_sel... http://www.jollinger.com/typewriters/typewriters/IBM_Selectr... you can also see inconsistent letter spacing, more obvious on some fonts than others, but you can see some characters are connected and others aren't. And no, it's not just the position of the character relative to others on the ball. As the author points out, these characters have perfect vertical alignment. Then go look at high speed footage of the 'golfball' in action and you can see the substantial deflection caused by how fast and forceful the movements are. You can see the entire assembly is bouncing around as the rails it's on flex: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTtKaqIpOJc reply masswerk 6 hours agorootparentTo be fair, the specimen shows some misalignment as well, e.g., the \"S\" at the very beginning is up and a bit to the left, the \"Y\" is shifted to the right, and there are small irregularities in \"NGST\", as well. However, I don't think that they add up in a sensible manner. Notably, the Red Cross invoice is much worse: additionally to what has been noted in the article already, why would you have a hyphen in \"Verkäufername\"? Also mind the reoccurring use of \"#\" for \"Nummer\", which would have been rather unacceptable in a formal German document. reply KennyBlanken 6 hours agorootparentThe image provided is so low resolution that this is probably a side effect of the edges of the characters being on the boundary between pixels on the camera's sensor. Magnify it to full screen and you'll see what I'm talking about. Now go back and look at the samples I linked to, where you can clearly see vertical misalignment. I remember everyone in my school system had selectrics when I was a kid, and I assure you, they could produce text that was all over the place. Probably because the ones in a public school saw heavy use / were not properly maintained and serviced to the degree required. reply masswerk 6 hours agorootparentThere's an image with suitable resolution to show the misalignment: https://i0.wp.com/cabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image... BTW, also mind the drop of the \"0\" in \"10\". Edit: We can all pretend it's perfectly aligned print, but, regardless, whether purposefully manufactured or genuine, there are obvious misalignments in that image. reply hilti 4 hours agoprevThere is so much wrong with the faked Red Cross invoice 1) A German date is always written DD.MM.YYYY 2) PLZ not ZIP 3) „Wir danken für ihr Unternehmen“ is a bad translation for „Thank you for your business“ … but it means a complete different thing -> „Thank you for your company“ But I‘m still impressed how much effort this guy put into all this.

At first glance it looks like the shitty desktop formatting common to 2001, its in a German two ring binder, crumpled and yellowed. But then there are multiple things which are obviously and subtile off, the most glaring is the obviously AI-translated phrase at the bottom. I'd love to know the mind of the forger. They did put some serious work into the invoice but then AI-translated an idiomatic American phrase (wrongly!) which wouldn’t by used on a German invoice. It’s accepted that the US movies and television industry can’t get contemporary Germany right [1], often for economic limitations of the productions, but something that still get’s me is when the badly pronounced dialogue was obviously written in idiomatic English and only then translated mindlessly word for word, as if other countries cultures and languages are semantically the same, only the words are different. Maybe that’s what happened with the forger - you can’t know there would be differences if you don’t have a sensibility for difference.

This is especially stupid because LLMs like ChatGPT CAN output phrases that wouldn't be out of tune. I assume the forger got that phrase by literally asking the LLM to translate an english phrase to german, rather than asking the LLM what would be a good german phrase to use. reply winkelmann 3 hours agorootparent> literally asking the LLM to translate an english phrase to german I tried it a few times on arena.lmsys.org and given the prompt \"Please translate \"We thank you for your business\" into German\", the most common result was \"Wir danken Ihnen für Ihr Geschäft\", I got one bad result from some random tiny model and some more extensive responses from Gemini with suggestions for more idiomatic expressions. Modern LLMs are typically smart enough to understand this nuance when translating to German. reply selfhoster11 1 hour agorootparentThat’s an interesting result. I’ve re-run your prompt with one change (made it “translate idiomatically” instead) to guide models towards a more natively German mode of expression and a few actually came back with a more appropriate phrase than that literal translation. reply croes 4 hours agorootparentprevOr he didn't use a LLM at all, they were translation programs before ChatGPT reply astrange 1 hour agorootparentLLMs are based on the model architecture for Google Translate, so it's not a whole lot different. Of course they're much more \"intelligent\". reply aaron695 4 hours agoparentprevWhen we forged some documents it had a photo of a grotesque in the background. We worked out where it was and photographed it ourselves. Had to stand on a trash can to get the angle. We joked our documents were high quality than the original, which they were. Used them for years. Do it. It all makes sense after actually doing it yourself. People think forgers copy pixel by pixel but it's remaking assets. We guessed the iso standard on the barcodes. We were no experts. We probably got it right, but you have to do this on every asset. reply labcomputer 6 hours agoprevI'm surprised that neither the blog post nor the comments here yet mentioned another obvious giveaway to the forgery: The photo and card inside the plastic lamination show signs of wear. Parts of the photo are rubbed off around the edge, and the paper is stained. At the same time, the lamination is relatively clean. How does that make any sense? That's suspicious, even without seeing Espinosa's badge. [edit: the photo of Espinosa's badge shows a worn lamination and clean, unworn paper and photo] On top of that, the lamination has a cutout so it can be attached to a lanyard or retractor. The cutout shows no sign of wear. It's as if the forger imagined company badges work like library cards: You keep them in your wallet, and only remove them to check out a book. In the forger's head canon, the company must have later decided to laminate the badges (without replacing them!) and require everyone had to wear them visibly (hence the cutout). It makes no sense. reply kevin_thibedeau 6 hours agoparentRetractable lanyards weren't a thing in the 70's and would never be used for a landscape format ID. These would have been clipped to a pocket or collar. https://www.watson.ch/digital/wirtschaft/272982293-vom-hacke... reply labcomputer 5 hours agorootparentSure, but the point is that the hole shows the badge is meant to be clipped to something and worn in a visible place. As such, it will naturally bump into things and the lamination will accrue wear marks. reply refurb 3 hours agorootparentI noticed the badge hole too.

Pretty common into at least to 80s was a clip that attached to your front shirt pocket which pretty much everyone had and badge readers weren’t mostly a thing. If security were laxer you often just kept the badge in your pocket. But as another comment notes you didn’t tend to just keep your badge in your wallet. reply eloisant 1 hour agoprevAlso, as cool as it is, I don't think it would have been worth 3000DEM in 2001. Adjusted for inflation it's worth almost 3000 of today's USD. That was just a month after the release of the original iPod, that eventually brought back Apple to relevancy.

Employee IDs pretty much start happening when you end up getting actual space that isn't your garage or repurposed residential buildings, especially if you're doing manufacturing of any kind. Then you might want to have employee IDs if only for minimal security (contractors! Visitors!) or workplace safety reasons (tracking who was left in the building, for example). It is, also, a sign of \"making it somewhere\", yes - along with some of the above parts also making up the \"corporate social capital\".

For another example, I see people commenting on VAT tax missing on the receipt from the German Red Cross, and also the confusion over whether it was bought on eBay or from the German Red Cross, but no mention of whether that invoice might be something that the German Red Cross adapted to work with early eBay doing the payments (at least in the US, sales tax for online purchases was very murky, and eBay punted). Also, the author seems to be ignoring cross-cultural differences, in their psychoanalytic speculation about subtleties of seller's behavior, such as seller's perceived earnestness in composing a photo. * This article is going out of its way to publicly defame someone. If they have strong evidence of the counterfeiting and fraud that they allege, they should be going to a legal authority. Given that they decided to get Internet Points out of it, they'd better hope that their allegations are correct, and also that they can prove it sufficiently if sued in some jurisdiction.

This seller’s history is littered selling so-called authentic things like business cards and concert tickets and based on this incident, I personally think every single one of them is fraudulent. You might like playing contrarian to defend the honor of an obvious forger, and that’s your right. But it isn’t defamation to call a liar a liar. Truth is an affirmative defense. Someone with an actual Apple badge from that era said the badge is fake. The text doesn’t match that person’s badge. The photo use for Sherry is obviously both a stock photo and too high resolution to be used on an employee badge from a tiny company in California in the 1970s. The badge is too well-preserved, even for a relic that the seller claims to have purchased in 2001 (or was it 2003 or 2004, seeing as their own story kept changing). There are so many red flags when looking at this thing that it doesn’t matter if one of the proof points doesn’t live up to your standards. This is a fake item.

Our guiding principle as we build this product is that the privacy and security of Customer Data is sacrosanct, as detailed in our Privacy Policy, Security Documentation and SPARC and the Slack Terms. Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are useful tools that we use in limited ways to enhance our product mission. To develop AI/ML models, our systems analyze Customer Data (e.g. messages, content, and files) submitted to Slack as well as Other Information (including usage information) as defined in our Privacy Policy and in your customer agreement. To ensure the privacy and security of Customer Data in this particular context, we have a few guiding principles: Data will not leak across workspaces. For any model that will be used broadly across all of our customers, we do not build or train these models in such a way that they could learn, memorize, or be able to reproduce some part of Customer Data. We have technical controls in place to prevent access. When developing AI/ML models or otherwise analyzing Customer Data, Slack can’t access the underlying content. We have various technical measures preventing this from occurring. Please read our Security White Paper for more info on these controls that protect the confidentiality and security of Customer Data. We offer Customers a choice around these practices. If you want to exclude your Customer Data from helping train Slack global models, you can opt out. If you opt out, Customer Data on your workspace will only be used to improve the experience on your own workspace and you will still enjoy all of the benefits of our globally trained AI/ML models without contributing to the underlying models. Contact us to opt out. If you want to exclude your Customer Data from Slack global models, you can opt out. To opt out, please have your Org or Workspace Owners or Primary Owner contact our Customer Experience team at feedback@slack.com with your Workspace/Org URL and the subject line “Slack Global model opt-out request.” We will process your request and respond once the opt out has been completed. Customer Data and Other Information How Slack may use Customer Data (e.g. messages, content, files) and Other Information to update our services Working from the above principles, here are a few examples of improvements and privacy protective techniques that our product and analytics teams may use to develop, update and improve Slack: Channel Recommendations: We may use insights to recommend that a user joins a new public channel in their company. We make these suggestions based on channel membership, activity, and topic overlaps. Our model learns from previous suggestions and whether or not a user joins the channel we recommend. We protect privacy while doing so by separating our model from Customer Data. We use external models (not trained on Slack messages) to evaluate topic similarity, outputting numerical scores. Our global model only makes recommendations based on these numerical scores and non-Customer Data. For more technical details, please visit our Engineering Blog to learn more. Search Results: Our search machine learning models help users find what they're seeking by identifying the right results for a particular query. We do this based on historical search results and previous engagements without learning from the underlying text of the search query, result, or proxy. Simply put, our model can't reconstruct the search query or result. Instead, it learns from team-specific, contextual information like the number of times a message has been clicked in a search or an overlap in the number of words in the query and recommended message. Autocomplete: Slack might make suggestions to complete search queries or other text– for example autocompleting the phrase \"Customer Support\" after a user types the first several letters of this phrase. These suggestions are local and sourced from common public message phrases in the user’s workspace. Our algorithm that picks from potential suggestions is trained globally on previously suggested and accepted completions. We protect data privacy by using rules to score the similarity between the typed text and suggestion in various ways, including only using the numerical scores and counts of past interactions in the algorithm. Emoji Suggestion: Slack might suggest emoji reactions to messages using the content and sentiment of the message, the historic usage of the emoji, and the frequency of use of the emoji on the team in various contexts. For instance, if 🎉 is a common reaction to celebratory messages in a particular channel, we will suggest users react to new, similarly positive messages with 🎉. To do this while protecting Customer Data, we might use an etrnal model (not trained on Slack messages) to classify the sentiment of the message. Our model would then suggest an emoji only considering the frequency with which a particular emoji has been associated with messages of that sentiment in that workspace. These types of thoughtful personalizations and improvements are only possible if we study and understand how our users interact with Slack. Slack takes privacy seriously and our confidentiality obligations described in our customer agreements and Privacy Policy apply in each of these scenarios. Customers own their own Customer Data. Slack aggregates and disassociates Customer Data such that Slack’s use of Customer Data to update the Services will never identify any of our customers or individuals as the source of any of these improvements to any third party, other than to Slack’s affiliates or sub-processors.",

Let's see if we have another Helldivers 2 event that makes them do a hard backpedal after losing thousands of large customers that will not under any circumstances take the chance. I have a friend with a law firm who just called me yesterday for advice as he's thinking about switching to Slack from Teams. I gave him a glowing recommendation because it is literally night and day, but there is no way in hell he takes any chance any sensitive legal discussions leak out through prompt hacking. He might even be liable himself for knowingly using a tool that spells out \"we read and reuse your conversations\". reply KronisLV 1 hour agoparentPersonally, I rather liked self-hosted versions of these: Mattermost: https://mattermost.com/ Rocket.Chat: https://www.rocket.chat/ Nextcloud Talk: https://nextcloud.com/talk/ Out of those, Mattermost was the easiest to setup (just need PostgreSQL and a web server, in addition to the main container), however not being able to easily permanently delete instead of just archiving workspaces was awkward. Nextcloud Talk was very easy to get going if you already have Nextcloud but felt a bit barebones last I checked, whereas Rocket.Chat was overall the more pleasant option to use, although I wasn't the biggest fan of them using MongoDB for storage. The user experience is pretty good with all of them, however in the groups that I've been a part of, ultimately nobody cared about self-hosting an instance, since most orgs just prefer Teams/Slack (or even Skype for just chatting/meetings) and most informal groups just default to Discord. Oh well. reply bayindirh 1 hour agorootparentThe problem is not technical, but social with these platforms. i.e. How do you convince 40+ people from 5 countries to add yet another memory resident chat application and fragment their knowledge to another app/mental space? This gets way harder as the community becomes more dynamic and temporary (i.e. high circulation like students). I gave the good fight last year with someone, and they just didn't flex a nanometer citing ergonomics of Slack is way better than alternatives, and didn't care about data mining (was a possibility back then) or keeping older messages at ransom. reply KronisLV 47 minutes agorootparent> i.e. How do you convince 40+ people from 5 countries to add yet another memory resident chat application and fragment their knowledge to another app/mental space? If it's a company, you can just be like: \"Hey, we use this platform for communication, you can log in with your Active Directory credentials.\" It also has the added benefit of acting as a directory for every employee in the company, so getting in touch can be more convenient than e-mail (while you can also customize the notification preferences, so it doesn't get too spammy), as opposed to the situation which might develop, where some teams or org units are on Slack, others on Teams and getting in touch can be more messy. If it's a free-form social group, then you can throw that idea away because of network effects, it'd be an uphill battle, same as how sometimes people complain about people using Discord for various communities, but at the same time the reality is that old school forums and such were also killed off - since most people already have a Discord account and there's less friction to just use that. Either way, I'm happy that self-hosted software like that exists. reply bayindirh 29 minutes agorootparent> If it's a company That's a big if, and the answer is \"No\" in my case. If it was, that comment wouldn't be there. It's not a \"social group\" either, but a group of independent institutions working together. It's like a large gear-train. A lot of connections between small islands of people. So you have to work together, and have to find a way somehow. So, it's complicated. > Either way, I'm happy that self-hosted software like that exists. Me too. I happen to manage a Nextcloud instance, but nobody is interested in the \"Talk\" module. reply p1esk 2 hours agoparentprevBut you can opt out, right? So what’s the problem? Also, is Teams (and other messengers) any different? reply rpastuszak 1 hour agorootparentDefaults matter! Just look at how much Apple and Mozilla get from Google by having their browser as a default (ca. $20,000,000,000 and $400,000,000 IIRC per annum). Or look at how many people rejected the tracking prompt displayed for FB when it was added to iOS (+70%). reply apignotti 2 hours agorootparentprevYou can opt-out by manually writing an email to them. The process matters. reply whatevaa 1 hour agorootparentThey could make it even better, like requiring signed/certified physical mail /s. Or fax... reply notachatbot1234 1 hour agorootparentprevDo they discard everything processed so far every time someone opts out? reply troupo 2 hours agorootparentprev> But you can opt out, right? So what’s the problem? This thinking is the problem. \"Oh, we just added your entire private/privileged/NDA/corporate information to our training set without your consent. What's the problem?\" Opt-out must be the default. Edit: By \"Opt-out must be the default.\" I mean: no one's data must be included until they explicitly give consent via an opt-in :) reply zelphirkalt 2 hours agorootparentEspecially since once it has been trained, it is in the model, and I am not aware of any way anyone has discovered to later remove from the model single or selected training data points, except for re-training/re-learning the model. So basically the crime might already be done. But I also know that so many businesses are too sluggish to make a switch and employees incapable of understanding the risk. So unfortunately not all of Europe will switch away. But I hope a significant number gives them the middle finger. reply bayindirh 1 hour agorootparentThere's something called \"machine unlearning\" being worked on to address these issues. This doesn't mean that I support Slack or any opt-in without consent training model. On the contrary. I don't have any OpenAI/Midjourney/etc. account, and don't plan to have one. reply Liquidor 1 hour agorootparentprev> Opt-out must be the default. Don't you mean opt-in must be the default? Or am I misunderstanding the concept of opt-ins :P reply ellisnguyen 1 hour agorootparentOpt-out by default = Opt-in. Opt-in by default = Opt-out reply troupo 1 hour agorootparentprevOpt-in is \"I agree to have my data included\" Opt-out is \"I don't agree to have my data included\" reply falcor84 1 hour agorootparentprevExactly! Allowing access to your data should only be opt-in reply ADeerAppeared 1 hour agorootparentprevWorth noting: This is a legal requirement in Europe The GDPR mandates that consent is given affirmatively, with this kind of \"oh we put it in the EULA nobody reads\" being explicitly called out as non-compliant. reply torginus 2 hours agorootparentprevand how does that even work? Slack is a chat app. Does everyone involved in the chat need to opt out for it to be meaningful? What about bots? reply zmmmmm 9 hours agoprev> For any model that will be used broadly across all of our customers, we do not build or train these models in such a way that they could learn, memorise, or be able to reproduce some part of Customer Data This feels so full of subtle qualifiers and weasel words that it generates far more distrust than trust. It only refers to models used \"broadly across all\" customers - so if it's (a) not used \"broadly\" or (b) only used for some subset of customers, the whole statement doesn't apply. Which actually sounds really bad because the logical implication is that data CAN leak outside those circumstances. They need to reword this. Whoever wrote it is a liability. reply mayank 9 hours agoparent> They need to reword this. Whoever wrote it is a liability Sounds like it’s been written specifically to avoid liability. reply MingFengLiu 8 hours agorootparentI'm sure it was lawyers. It's always lawyers. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 2 hours agorootparentYes, lawyers do tend to have a part to play in writing things that present a legally binding commitment being made by an organisation. Developers really can’t throw stones from their glass houses here. How many of you have a pre-canned spiel explaining why the complexities of whichever codebase you spend your days on are ACTUALLY necessary, and are certainly NOT the result of over-engineering? Thought so. reply afc 7 hours agoparentprevEspecially when a few paragraphs below they say: > If you want to exclude your Customer Data from helping train Slack global models, you can opt out. So Customer Data is not used to train models \"used broadly across all of our customers [in such a way that ...]\", but... it is used to help train global models. Uh. reply DougBTX 4 hours agorootparentTo me it says that they _do_ train global models with customer data, but they are trying to ensure no data leakage (which will be hard, but maybe not impossible, if they are training with it). The caveats are for “local” models, where you would want the model to be able to answer questions about discussions in the workspace. It makes me wonder how they handle “private” chats, can they leak across a workspace? Presumably they are trying to train a generic language model which has very low recall for facts in the training data, then using RAG across the chats that the logged on user can see to provide local content. reply ENGNR 1 hour agorootparentMy intuition is that it's impossible to guarantee there are no leaks in the LLM as it stands today. It would surely require some new computer science to ensure that no part of any output that could ever possibly be developed isn't sensitive data from any of the input. It's one thing if the input is the published internet (even if covered by copyright), it's entirely another to be using private training data from corporate water coolers, where bots and other services routinely send updates and query sensitive internal services. reply visarga 36 minutes agorootparentThere is a way. Build a preference model from the sensitive dataset. Then use the preference model with RLAIF (like RLHF but with AI instead of humans) to fine-tune the LLM. This way only judgements about the LLM outputs will pass from the sensitive dataset. Copy the sense of what is good, not the data. reply hackernewds 7 hours agorootparentprevWhy are these kinda things opt-out? And need to be discovered.. We're literally discussing switching to Teams at my company (1500 employees) reply M4v3R 3 hours agorootparentIf you switch to Teams only for this reason I have some bad news for you - there’s no way Microsoft is not (or will not start in future) doing the same. And you’ll get a subpar experience with that (which is an understatement). reply guappa 3 hours agorootparentI think a self hosted matrix/irc/jitsi is the way to do it. reply IshKebab 2 hours agorootparentWe've been using Mattermost and it works very well. Better than Slack. The only downside is their mobile app is a bit unreliable, in that it sometimes doesn't load threads properly. reply Shadowmist 5 hours agorootparentprevYou’d be better off just not having chat than switching to Teams. reply metadat 5 hours agorootparentBut the business will suffer by most likely being less successful due to less cohesive communication.. it's \"The Ick\" either way. reply andy_ppp 4 hours agorootparentThe idea that Slack makes companies work better needs some proof behind it, I’d say the amount of extra distraction is a net negative… but as with a lot of things in software and startups nobody researches anything and everyone writes long essays about how they feel things are. reply unkulunkulu 1 hour agorootparentDistraction is not enforced. Learning to control your attention and how to help yourself do it is crucial whatever you do in whatever time and in whatever technological context or otherwise. It is the most long term valuable resource you have. I think we start to recognize this at larger scale. Slack easily saves a ton of time solving complex problems that require interaction and expertise of a lot of people, often unpredictable number of them for each problem. They can answer with delay, in a good culture this is totally accepted and people still can independently move forward or switch tasks if necessary, same as with slower communication tools. You are not forced to answer with any particular lag, however slack makes it possible when needed to reduce it to zero. Sometimes you are unsure if you need help or you can do smthing on your own. I certainly know that a lot of times eventually I had no chance whatsoever, because knowledge requires was too specialized, this is not always clear. Reducing barriers to communication in those cases is crucial and I don't see Slack being in the way here, only helpful. The goal of organizing Slack is such that you pay right amount of attention to right parts of communication for you. You can do this if you really spend (hmm) attention trying to figure out what that is and how to tune your tools to achieve that. reply andy_ppp 1 hour agorootparentThat’s a lot of words with no proof isn’t it, it’s just your theory. Until I see a well designed study on such things I struggle to believe the conjecture you make either way. It could be quite possible that you benefit from Slack and I don’t. Even receiving a message and not responding can be disruptive and on top I’d say being offline or ignoring messages is impossible in most companies. reply whatevaa 1 hour agorootparentYour idea also comes with no proof, just your personal experience. reply metadat 3 hours agorootparentprevGood point, could be that it reduces friction too far in some instances. However, in general less communication doesn't seem better for the bottom line. reply amne 3 hours agorootparentprevwe use Teams and it's fine. Just don't use the \"Team\" feature of it to chat. Use chat groups and 1-to-1 of course. We use \"Team\" channels only for bots: CI results, alerts, things like that. Meetings are also chat groups. We use the daily meeting as the dev-team chat itself so it's all there. Use Loops to track important tasks during the day. I'm curious what's missing/broken in Teams that you would rather not have chat at all? reply marricks 6 hours agorootparentprevObviously because no one would ever opt in. reply jeffdn 6 hours agorootparentprevI'd make sure to do an extended trial run first. Painful transition. reply hackernewds 4 hours agorootparentprevso if I don't want slack to train on _anything_ what do I do? I still suspect everything now reply j45 5 hours agorootparentprevHope it's not doublespeak, ambiguity leaves it grey, maybe to play. reply __loam 5 hours agorootparentprevOpt out is such bullshit. reply chefandy 7 hours agoparentprevNah. Whoever decided to create the reality their counsel is dancing around with this disclaimer is the actual problem, though it's mostly a problem for us, rather than them. reply FuckButtons 5 hours agorootparentIt’s a problem for them if it looses customer trust / customers. reply hackernewds 4 hours agorootparentif they lose enough, they will \"sorry we got caught\" if they don't, they will not do anything reply chefandy 4 hours agorootparentprevIf it impacted their business significantly, it would restore some of the faith I've lost in humanity recently. Frankly, I'm not holding my breath. reply IanCal 2 hours agoparentprevThe problem is this also covers very reasonable use cases. Use sampling across messages for spam detection, predicting customer retention, etc - pretty standard. Then there's cases where you could have models more like llms that can output data from the training set but you're running them for that customer. reply j45 5 hours agoparentprevI'm imagining a corporate slack, with information discussed in channels or private chats that exists nowhere else on the internet.. gets rolled into a model. Then, someone asks a very specific question.. conversationally.. about such a very specific scenario.. Seems plausible confidential data would get out, even if it wasn't attributed to the client. Not that it’s possible to ask an llm how a specific or random company in an industry might design something… reply hackernewds 4 hours agorootparentexactly. a fun game to see why it is so hard to prevent this https://gandalf.lakera.ai/ reply Nition 9 hours agoparentprev- Create a Slack account for your 95-year-old grandpa - Exclude that one account from using the models, he's never going to use Slack anyway - Now you can learn, memorise, or reproduce all the Customer Data you like reply dheera 8 hours agoparentprevSeems like time to start some slack workspaces and fill them with garbage.

I was at a VC conference last year and if I learned nothing else there, I learned how to spell \"AI\". Every single exhibitor just about had their signage proudly proclaiming their capabilities in this area, but one in particular struck me. They were touting the API integrations they could offer to train their \"Enterprise AI\"/LLM, and among those integrations were things like M365, Slack, etc. It struck me because of the garbage in, garbage out problem. I'd like to think that the amount of shitposting I do on Slack personally will poison that particular well of training data, but this seems to point to a larger problem to me. LLM's don't have a concept of truth or reality, or awareness of any sort. If the training data they are fed is poorly quality checked/unsanitized by human intelligence, the outputs will be as useless/noisy as the original data set. It feels to me that in the frothy rush to capture market buzz and VC, this is being forgotten. Am I missing something, here? reply wongarsu 7 hours agoparentMost shitposting is probably more straightforward to understand than business communication or press releases where realizing what wasn't said often carries more insight than the things that were said. Of course training an AI model on simple, straightforward and honest data provides good results. That's the essence behind \"textbooks is all you need\" which lead to the phi LLMs. Those are great small LLMs. But if you want your model to understand the complexity of human communication you have to include it in your training data. If you subscribe to the idea that to be the very best text completion engine possible you would need to have a perfect understanding of reality itself, how different humans perceive reality differently, and how they choose to communicate about this perception and their interaction with reality, themselves and other humans, then it's not unreasonable to expect that back-propagation would eventually find that optimal representation if given enough data, the right architecture and enough processing power. Or at least come somewhat close. In that paradigm there is no \"bad data\", only insufficient or badly balanced datasets. Just don't try doing that with a 3B parameter LLM. reply antipaul 8 hours agoparentprevWhat do you think chatGPT uses as training data? The whole world’s “sh*tposting”: Reddit, blogs, and the rest of the internet. But also books and Wikipedia and what not. You can “smooth” all the crap out via the training procedure. But even more, Slack can easily filter training data to, say, only posts in high-use channels. Further, slack has other options: eg, use their customer data only for marginal fine-tuning, for example. Or, they don’t even know their use case yet - but want to wrap their arms around your data pronto. reply rozap 6 hours agorootparentWhat makes you think I don't shitpost in the #engineering channel? And heuristics don't even scratch the surface of the bigger problem where it's trained on people who aren't great at their jobs but type a lot of words on slack about circling back on KPIs. reply bee_rider 5 hours agorootparentI think those types of people are actually shockingly well paid. If slack can make bots to replace them, they’ll print money, right? reply blackenedgem 1 hour agorootparentThat's all well and good until something goes down and you need someone knowledgeable to diplomatically shout at a vendor. reply nyc_data_geek 6 hours agorootparentprevChatGPT isn't known for it's accuracy though, is it? They coined the term \"hallucination\" because it is wrong so much. reply moneywoes 6 hours agorootparentprevhow does the training procedure smooth the garbage out? reply thomashop 6 hours agorootparentThrough regularization techniques, data augmentation, loss functions, and gradient optimization, ensuring the model focuses on meaningful patterns and reduces overfitting to noise. reply bigfudge 3 hours agorootparentIt’s not obvious how any of those would do anything but better approximate the average of a noisy dataset. RLHF might help, but only if it’s not done by idiots. reply mvkel 8 hours agoparentprevThe best LLMs were trained on data from the open internet, which is full of garbage. They still do a pretty good job (granted it has been fine tuned and RLHF'd, but you can do that with Slack data too) reply IanCal 1 hour agoparentprevThe more obvious things are that it's not training llms fully on all channels. Some quick ideas: Search and summarize other messages. No new llms training and about mostly linking to existing answers. Fine tune on your messages, but only customer support messages in the public channel, not \"eng-shitpost\" Natural language requests over your company data. reply jorisboris 8 hours agoparentprevSame for Reddit or Facebook groups. There's a lot of shitposting there, but absolutely a lot of valuable information if LLMs manage to separate the wheat from the chaff. reply williamcotton 9 hours agoparentprevThe sheer scale of data on the long tail. Sure, the head is already a trash pile and has been for decades now, but there is plenty of non-monetized information all over the internet that is barely linked to or otherwise discoverable. reply krainboltgreene 8 hours agorootparentIt does not matter how hard they try, nothing will rival the CommonCrawl treasure trove except maybe Google's index itself. reply leoh 9 hours agoparentprevYes, consider an existing LLM being given “shitpost-y” messages and asking it if there is anything interesting in there. It could probably summarize it well and that could then be used for training another LLM. etc etc reply nyc_data_geek 9 hours agorootparentThis assumes everything in the training data set is accurate. Sometimes people are wrong, obtuse, sarcastic, etc. LLM's don't have any way of detecting or accounting for this, do they? That output, then being used to train other LLM's, just creates an ouroboros of AI generated dogshit. reply sp332 9 hours agorootparentLLMs are state-of-the-art at detecting sarcasm. It won't help if the data is just wrong though. Edit: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03706 Human performance on this benchmark (detecting sarcasm in Reddit comments) was 0.82, a BERT-based LLM scored 0.79. https://arxiv.org/abd/2106.05752 LSTM, 98% at detecting sarcasm in a Project Gutenburg-based dataset. reply comboy 8 hours agorootparent> LLMs are state-of-the-art at detecting sarcasm.

In fact, things work better when we explicitly reject that idea. LLMs do not rely on 100% factually accurate inputs. Sure, you’d rather have less BS than more, but this is all statistics. Just like most people realize that flat earthers are nutty, LLMs can ingest falsehoods without reducing output quality (again, subject to statistics) reply bongodongobob 4 hours agorootparentprevThe training data doesn't need to be strictly accurate. If it was, you'd just be programming a deterministic robot. The whole point is the feed it actual human language. Giving it shitposts and sarcasm is literally what makes it good. Think of it like 100 people guessing the number of marbles in a jar. Average their guesses and it will be very close. The training data is the guesses, the inference is the average. reply chatmasta 9 hours agoparentprevWhy shouldn’t AI be able to shitpost too? At the very least, and much more importantly, AI should be able to recognize shitposting. reply nyc_data_geek 9 hours agorootparentThis is the crux of it, and where I'm wondering if I'm missing something. Can it, today? My understanding is it cannot discern reality from fiction, thus \"hallucinations\" (a misnomer because it implies awareness, which these probability models lack). reply tomrod 8 hours agorootparentThe poorly named hallucinations are creation of ideas from provided prompts, which ideas are not grounded in reality. It isn't the mistaken adjudication of the reality of a provided prompt. reply fuchse 8 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds surprisingly human reply swalsh 7 hours agoparentprevAlong the same lines, phi-3 is kind of a sign of what you can do if you focus only on high quality data.

Like, when I heard the word \"can't\" my brain goes to: there is nothing anyone in the company could do, within the bounds of the law, to do this. Employees at Slack could turn off the technical measures preventing this from occurring. Employees at Signal could push an app update which side-channels all messages through to a different server, unencrypted.

If you ever ask \"does [some technology] affect [something qualitative] about [anything]\", the response on hn is always going to be \"technology isn't responsible, it's how the technology is used that is responsible!\", asserting, over and over again, that technology is always neutral. The idea that the mechanism of how people communicate affects what people communicate is a pretty foundational concept in media studies (a topic which is generally met with a hostile audience on HN). Slack almost certainly does play a role, but people who work in technology are incentivized to believe that technology does not affect people's behaviors, because that belief allows people who work in technology to be free of any and all qualitative or moral judgements on any grounds; the assertion that technology does not play a role is something that technology workers cling to because it absolves them of all guilt in all situations, and makes them, above all else, innocent in every situation. On the specific concept of a medium of communication affecting what is being communicated, McLuhan took these ideas to such an extreme that it's almost ludicrous, but he still had some pretty interesting observations worth thinking on, and his writing on this topic is some of the earlier work.

How can Slack guarantee that the model won't incorporate proprietary insights on sourcing the best foobar producers into its choice of the next token? And sure, one could build an adversarial model that attempts to minimize this kind of leakage, but is Slack incentivized to create such a thing vs. just building an optimal autocomplete as quickly as possible? Even if it were just creating classifiers, similar leakages could occur there, albeit requiring more effort and time from attackers to extract actionable data.

They don't seem to go into any detail about their data safeguards and how they're excluding sensitive info from training. Textual is good for this purpose since it redacts PII thus preventing it from being leaked by the trained model. Disclaimer: I work at Tonic reply a2128 7 hours agorootparentHow do you handle proprietary data being leaked? Sure you can easily detect and redact names and phone numbers and addresses, but without significant context it seems difficult to detect whether \"11 spices - mix with 2 cups of white flour ... 2/3 teaspoons of salt, 1/2 teaspoons of thyme [...]\" is just a normal public recipe or a trade secret kept closely guarded for 70 years reply theyinwhy 3 hours agoprevGood we moved to matrix already.

    "originLink": "https://rust-exercises.com/",
    "originBody": "Welcome Welcome to \"100 Exercises To Learn Rust\"! This course will teach you Rust's core concepts, one exercise at a time. You'll learn about Rust's syntax, its type system, its standard library, and its ecosystem. We don't assume any prior knowledge of Rust, but we assume you know at least another programming language. We also don't assume any prior knowledge of systems programming or memory management. Those topics will be covered in the course. In other words, we'll be starting from scratch! You'll build up your Rust knowledge in small, manageable steps. By the end of the course, you will have solved ~100 exercises, enough to feel comfortable working on small to medium-sized Rust projects. Methodology This course is based on the \"learn by doing\" principle. It has been designed to be interactive and hands-on. Mainmatter developed this course to be delivered in a classroom setting, over 4 days: each attendee advances through the lessons at their own pace, with an experienced instructor providing guidance, answering questions and diving deeper into the topics as needed. If you're interested in attending one of our training sessions, or if you'd like to bring this course to your company, please get in touch. You can also follow the course on your own, but we recommend you find a friend or a mentor to help you along the way should you get stuck. You can also find solutions to all exercises in the solutions branch of the GitHub repository. Structure On the left side of the screen, you can see that the course is divided into sections. Each section introduces a new concept or feature of the Rust language. To verify your understanding, each section is paired with an exercise that you need to solve. You can find the exercises in the companion GitHub repository. Before starting the course, make sure to clone the repository to your local machine: # If you have an SSH key set up with GitHub git clone git@github.com:mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust.git # Otherwise, use the HTTPS URL: # # git clone https://github.com/mainmatter/100-exercises-to-learn-rust.git We also recommend you work on a branch, so you can easily track your progress and pull in updates from the main repository, if needed: cd 100-exercises-to-learn-rust git checkout -b my-solutions All exercises are located in the exercises folder. Each exercise is structured as a Rust package. The package contains the exercise itself, instructions on what to do (in src/lib.rs), and a test suite to automatically verify your solution. wr, the workshop runner To verify your solutions, we've provided a tool that will guide you through the course. It is the wr CLI (short for \"workshop runner\"). Install it with: cargo install --locked workshop-runner In a new terminal, navigate back to the top-level folder of the repository. Run the wr command to start the course: wr wr will verify the solution to the current exercise. Don't move on to the next section until you've solved the exercise for the current one. We recommend committing your solutions to Git as you progress through the course, so you can easily track your progress and \"restart\" from a known point if needed. Enjoy the course! References The exercise for this section is located in exercises/01_intro/00_welcome Author This course was written by Luca Palmieri, Principal Engineering Consultant at Mainmatter. Luca has been working with Rust since 2018, initially at TrueLayer and then at AWS. Luca is the author of \"Zero to Production in Rust\", the go-to resource for learning how to build backend applications in Rust. He is also the author and maintainer of a variety of open-source Rust projects, including cargo-chef, Pavex and wiremock.",

Really enjoy the no-nonsense, not-a-word-wasted style. My first thought after spending 30 minutes with this that it could easily become my new no. 1 recommendation for rust onboarding, toppling the zero2prod book. Then I figured out why this felt familiar, it's from the same author :D Will definitely dive into it this weekend. reply sk11001 39 minutes agoparentZero2prod doesn't really teach Rust, it's more about setting up an API for people who already know Rust. reply ramon156 20 minutes agorootparentAnd it also isn't 100% best-practise, more like all-practise. It tries to show any and every way you could approach a problem while somehow keeping it minimal. Really like it but if you follow the tutorial 1:1 you'll most likely get frustrated reply satvikpendem 4 hours agoprevSurprised no one has mentioned another great and similar resource called Rustlings [0] (yes very punny name). You are given some files with todo statements which you'll need to fix and make the code compile and pass all the tests. It's an interactive way to learn which is what got me through learning Rust a few years ago. [0] https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings reply AnonC 3 hours agoparentThe difference is that Rustlings requires the person to already know Rust whereas the link on this post (100 Exercises to Learn Rust) starts teaching Rust from the basics (assuming that the person knows another language). reply LegionMammal978 3 hours agorootparentThat doesn't match with my experience: I learned the language from scratch just fine with Rustlings. (In fact, I found it more approachable than the Rust Book.) The first few groups of exercises in it walk you through the basic syntax and semantics, to the point that I found it almost tedious to work through, but I ultimately came to appreciate it. reply sshine 23 minutes agorootparentIn the most recent Rust Copenhagen Hack Night, half a dozen people took their first steps with Rustlings. It was my experience that it worked really well. Some people were speed-running it, others took their time to read the book references that came up once in a while. These 100 exercises build on the same interactive project format as Rustlings, so I would assume they're both great. reply archixe 3 hours agorootparentprevI did Rustlings without any knowledge of Rust and I thought it worked great. There are links to guide & documentation pages for every exercise. It worked great to learn the basics through practice. reply tialaramex 2 hours agorootparentprevTo me \"the basics\" means either no programming at all, or something rudimentary and half-remembered like you did simple Logo turtle graphic programming in math class as a ten year old and now you're thirty. Not \"knows another language\". I think it might be interesting to develop Rust-as-first-language teaching materials, but that's not what this is. Move assignment as your primary assignment semantic, borrowing as your metaphor rather than introducing the confusing idea of \"addresses\" (in Rust many things we can borrow don't have a meaningful address, but it's fine) and so on. reply LoganDark 1 hour agorootparent> I think it might be interesting to develop Rust-as-first-language teaching materials, but that's not what this is. Move assignment as your primary assignment semantic, borrowing as your metaphor rather than introducing the confusing idea of \"addresses\" (in Rust many things we can borrow don't have a meaningful address, but it's fine) and so on. I found that when learning Rust, it approximated the mental model that I had already developed for programming. Move semantics and such just felt right. I had used around 10–15 other programming languages by then, but none were even remotely Rust-like. I don't know why this is. It can't be that Rust is the objectively or even subjectively right way to think about programming. It has to be that its concepts were simply already intuitive to me, but I wonder why that is, when so many people struggle. Perhaps it's because of neurodivergence, maybe the language just matches the way I think in general and that's why it made sense so quickly. I'd probably make a terrible teacher, because I just do not understand the struggles people have with Rust, and I can't just teach someone to think the same way I do. Maybe when existing Rust users try to write material for new developers, they write in a way that, for lack of a better way of wording it, is only really accessible to their own neurotype. In other words, it doesn't really help the people that genuinely struggle with Rust's way of thinking, it primarily helps people who already have this way of thinking. reply tialaramex 27 minutes agorootparentCertainly in regards to say, ownership, Rust has to be very explicit about things which you'll find in the literature make sense for other languages but maybe are barely mentioned when they're taught. For example the life of objects is something Bjarne Stroustrup's early editions of his C++ book neglect, basically saying yeah objects come into existence and then they're later destroyed and it's only in the third edition once C++ has more powerful techniques for this stuff that suddenly it's important that C++ programmers care about this and there's IIRC a whole chapter of the book. It is also said that although Rust looks like a semicolon language, like C or Java or something, it's actually not like those semicolon language at all, it's an ML, the syntax makes it more palatable for semicolon programmers to learn and looks more \"serious\" for a systems language. As an ML, Rust gets a solid foundation in its type system. Rust has a type with no values, and a type with one value, Sum types and Product types, so we're on firm ground here, we can do type arithmetic. Languages like C++ struggle to have a type with one value†, and can't really do \"no values\" at all. It's like your system of arithmetic doesn't have zero. You can limp along, the Romans did, but it's an unenviable situation. † The C++ language isn't really sure how to handle these types properly because its rules say they need at least one byte of storage - but that entire byte is just padding. It's not insurmountable but it's very silly. Anyway, I think what you're feeling is more real than you've allowed for. This is concretely a better foundation, that's not an illusion. It's not perfect but the sense that this is how things should be makes sense compared to other popular languages. reply resonious 2 hours agorootparentprevI think Rust is close enough in syntax to C and Java so that just about any adept programmer can figure it out. reply leoedin 1 hour agorootparentClose in syntax maybe, but you need quite a different mental model to build complex programs. reply veidr 6 hours agoprevWorth noting that this set of exercises was created by the author of \"Zero to Production in Rust\", the well-reviewed book with the crab-in-a-human-skull cover[1].

Book’s name doesn’t lie , it’s literally the author taking you by the hand along the path of building a real application with real problems on a real production environment explaining everything from the basics of the language to how to keep it online. The book is pretty opinionated (because well, since it guides you until production giving you basically all the code, choices are needed) but the author always takes the time to explain its choices and what the alternatives are.

To be fair, there is no particular backstory. I picked a hermit crab as the book logo since crabs are strongly associated with Rust due to Ferris, Rust's mascot. I then landed on that style (and the skull) because they looked sick and distinctive. The cover images of many technical books are incredibly dull these days. reply chongli 5 hours agorootparentprevRust community members are known Rustaceans which is a play on the word crustacean. Crabs are a well-known crustacean. Crab in a human skull is a visual metaphor for learning Rust. reply veidr 4 hours agorootparentprevI do not know the story, but I remembered the book because of that, and now after having mentioned it here, I just bought it. So my n=1 study indicates it was a successful design. :) reply jjice 5 hours agorootparentprevI got a Hamlet vibe from it when I picked the book up when it originally released. It could just be because it looks pretty sick though reply maxbond 4 hours agorootparentAlas, poor Yorick; I knew him well, Ferris.

I learned a lot of new things, kudos. One suggestion: where you talk about using AsRef, might be worth suggesting IntoIter, where it makes sense? IIRC that's what std uses for functions that aim at being generic over data structures and iterators (I might be remembering wrong, though). In any case let's not digress from the truth: amazing list. reply tialaramex 1 hour agorootparentThere are a few of these conversion traits (for turning some kind of Thing into a Thing with a different purpose) You're thinking of IntoIterator, which is a trait for when you want an Iterator, maybe what you've got is already an iterator, but maybe it isn't yet and yet it could easily be transformed into one (like say an array), so in either case IntoIterator::into_iter() gets you an iterator instead of whatever you have now -- the thing you had before is consumed by this. Another you may find uses for is ToString, which says this obviously could be a string and I want the string. Unlike IntoIterator this does not consume the thing you wanted a string for. There are also a suite of generic traits for converting to another type, From, Into, TryFrom and TryInto. As the person consuming things, prefer TryInto if you're clear what should happen when you can't, or Into if you need it to always work. As the person who is implementing the traits, prefer to implement From or if you can't TryFrom. Rust automatically cascades the conversions in one direction, so if I implemented From for Bird, and then you later write code which needs TryInto, that'll work just fine with a Goose using the code I wrote, because Rust concludes how to use my conversion to make it work, automatically - Rust will even be able to see that your \"What if I can't?\" error handling code will never run, and optimise it out of production code since I provided From so this cannot fail - its Error type is Infallible, an Empty type. reply woile 3 hours agoparentprevSomething like this in \"This week in Rust\" would be fantastic reply mgoetzke 4 hours agoparentprevGreat ! The first tip was already helpful, have to dig in. reply anssip 5 hours agoprevI blogged about my approach of learn by doing: https://anssipiirainen.com/post/learning-rust/ reply zerr 3 hours agoprevOne observation I have with Rust, looking at the code in wild, abstractions are usually (always?) leaky - implementation details are exposed/imposed due to the ownership feature of the language. reply pkolaczk 3 hours agoparentOwnership is not implementation. Ownership is contract. If you’re an owner of a house you can do more than if you’re only renting and if you’re renting you can do more than if you’re only looking at the house from the street. Ownership is a very useful concept that influences interfaces in real life so why wouldn’t it in programming? reply flohofwoe 3 hours agorootparentThis reads like the Rust equivalent of the OOP 'animal/cat/dog' intros of yore. Real world comparisons are almost never all that helpful when it comes to computing concepts. reply pkolaczk 2 hours agorootparentOk, point taken, indeed it reads like that. However, in programming and generally in engineering this is a very useful concept. There is a difference between \"component X is part of Y\" than \"component X works / interacts with Y\" or \"component X has exclusive access to Y in this particular span\", similarly how it is often very important to know if \"component X can be safely shared\" - and Rust allows to express that, while languages like Java are quite blind to that. Consider a simple Java method signature: public static MyCustomFileReader open(FileHandle someFile) { ... } Who is responsible for closing the file after you're done with reading it?

On day 1 if you can't see how to do it that's going to be because you didn't really understand your new language. By day 25 it's very likely that you can't figure out how to solve the problem yet in any language, if you're up for it, maybe solve it in your existing favourite and then try the new one. Because lots of people do AoC, especially in popular languages like Rust or C++, you can see other people's solutions in the AoC Reddit solutions thread each day, which are often inspiring -- you learn new idioms, library features, or even whole CS concepts. reply harishnavnit 4 hours agoparentprevI never got a proper chance to experience Rust at work but always wanted to give it a go.

Of course, when you need to get serious work done, the most fun and enjoyable tool is not necessarily the one that's best suited to the job. reply klabb3 6 hours agoparentprevIt’s a mixed bag. Yes there is a lot of hipster fanboyism. But I’ve also seen a lot of old timers coming from a career in C++ where Rust basically formalizes a lot of best practices and removes a lot of the worst footguns. I see the hope in their miserable faces and so there is definitely something real about Rust – and not necessarily Rust itself, but just the proof of concept of it, that it’s possible to solve many of the problems low-level programmers have just accepted as fact-of-life for a long time. Me personally I’m not from that background, and coming from higher level languages the selling points are not nearly as compelling given the learning curve and less mature ecosystem around many things. For instance, language performance is rarely the limiting factor in say API/backend development. Usually you have networking, io and databases eating most of your lunch, and also horizontal scaling is typically already in place for other reasons. reply pama 6 hours agoparentprev> Other than safety and the like...

Seems like a lot of verbosity for gains that don't really apply whatsoever for the kind of work I do (web apps and APIs). You have to remember let/mut fine, but then ownership/borrowing, and finally this `into()` thing - yuck! Like washing your face with sandpaper. reply devjab 4 hours agoparentYou get ridiculous performance gains with Rust a web backend. Even Microsoft is rewriting part of their C# backend to Rust on the 365 application side of things. Which is where you get to deal with the hefty ms-graph api which handles literal fucktons of data. Anyway. It is more verbose than something like Go or Python. I’m not sure it’s really so bad compared to most languages, but some of the benefits you get from the verbosity is that you gain a lot of control over how you use mutability and the borrow checker or how you work with memory in general. Things which are foreign to many developers today, but you shouldn’t compare a Rust implementation to a C#/Java/Python/Ruby/Node/Go api, you should compare it to a c/c++ api… which is where Rust is just so much “safer” for production. We have Node APIs in Typescript, we have Python APIs with FastAPI, we have C# web APIs and we have a few Go APIs. We’re perfectly happy with those, well maybe not the fact that we use so many languages, but we’re happy with them. Where we use Rust is where we used to use C, and the benefits are massive. You get the same sort of performance, but you also get an environment where programmers with less experience working without garbage collection can do work we just couldn’t have them do with C. reply pkolaczk 3 hours agorootparent> It is more verbose than something like Go or Python Quite debatable. My experience is different. I have ported some tiny amount of Go code to async Rust and it turned out to be simpler and shorter. Way less boilerplate related to cleaning up the resources - in Rust it was actually zero additional code thanks to RAII and really nice channel design, while Golang needed a lot of additional stuff like waitgroups or manual defers plus more channels to communicate obvious things which in Rust are simply passed by result of a future. Rust also feels a lot more expressive than Go with functional collection transformation chains (map, reduce, filter, grouping etc) where in Go this is loops and ifs all the way down. Rust is very close to Python in this regard. reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentprevOffice team never was a big .NET fan, and they were partially responsible for Longhorn's failure, see also Hilo C++ tutorial made by the team as part of Vista SDK tutorials, or their love for Webwidgets to C++ code, so that isn't that surprising.

Bing the branding is like 15 years old, the underlying service is older still (as \"Live Search\") So when this stuff was built the high performance option was C++ and there is an obvious reason to avoid that if you can. Rust means you can have the excellent performance without the absurd foot guns. Whether you chase that depends on other strategic priorities. reply simonask 2 hours agoparentprev`into()` just converts something from one type to another, like an integer to a floating point number. Would you have liked for such conversions to happen implicitly? Because let me tell you, that is one of the most painful features of C++, and modern well-written C++ typically disables implicit conversions in one way or another. (Note: For the specific example of integer-to-float, Rust has an alternative built-in syntax, but `.into()` is the canonical way that also works in generic code.) reply vrnvu 1 hour agoparentprevWell, nobody forces you to use the setters/getters pattern. For internal implementation, you could access everything directly. For example, Zig encourages this style of programming.

(I have historically been very skeptical of Rust on the web, but by now, I find it pretty pleasant. I of course know Rust very well already though.) reply LukeMathWalker 53 minutes agorootparentAgreed. There's also another aspect at play: to build knowledge one step at a time with this learn-by-doing approach, you have to get learners to write code that's not perfectly idiomatic along the way. You then correct and refine those first drafts as you progress along. In the case of setters, we get rid of them at the end of that chapter by using the newtype pattern thus guaranteeing that field invariants can't be broken even if you can access them directly. reply littlestymaar 4 hours agorootparentprev> I of course know Rust very well already though Understatement of the week ;) reply jimbob45 5 hours agorootparentprevHe's right, though.

    "originBody": "Llama 3 implemented in pure NumPy 16 May 2024 Understand the exact structure with working implementation of the Llama 3 model. May 16, 2024 Overview Structure RoPE #1 RMSNorm QKV RoPE #2 KV Cache GQA(Grouped-Query Attention) Scaled Dot-Product Attention Feed Forward SwiGLU Linear Generation Example GitHub References 한글로 작성된 상세한 설명은 NumPy로 구현하는 라마 3 모델을 참고하세요. [Korean Version] Overview Llama 3 model unveiled at Meta is creating a buzz. As expected, the scale and performance is overwhlming. 24K GPUs, 15T training data, 10M instruction data, 1.3M GPU hours, it’s all overwhelming. One interesting fact is that the model structure hasn’t changed. Of course, Llama 3 have changed to using GQA, but this was already implemented in Llama 2 70B, so it’s practically the same model structure. We’ll let it run for an accurate implementation, and we’ll use only NumPy to make the model structure more intuitive to understand. We use the stories15M model that Andrej Karpathy trained while creating llama.2, by converting it to a NumPy compressed format using a converter. We will actually read in the model that Karpathy trained with the Llama 2 structure and implement it as executable code. One thing to note is that the stories15M model does not use GQA, so while we implement GQA in our code but not apply it to model behavior. Structure Llama 3 model structure is exactly same with the 42dot LLM, so we import the illustration from the 42dot Blog, we’ll get the following: The Model has the following parameters: # Model params for ./stories15M.model.npz dim: int = 288 # D n_layers: int = 6 n_heads: int = 6 # QHN, HN, HD = 48 n_kv_heads: Optional[int] = None # KVHN = 6 vocab_size: int = 32000 # VS max_seq_len: int = 256 # M max_new_tokens: int = 50 The designations D, HN, HD, VS, M etc. in the comments are ised to manage the shape of each variable in code. Also note that unlike the 24x in the model illustation, stories15M model has 6 layers, so it iterates 6x. RoPE #1 The first step is to precompute cos and sin for RoPE embedding. These values are later used by Q and K. This calculation only needs to be done once for every request, so it can be cached. The size is HD(48)//2, which is an exponential multiple of base(10000), so it can be a larger value, but the maximum value is never more than 1, so it is converted to a scaled value between 0 ~ 1, and then again to a value between \\(1 \\sim \\frac{1}{10000}\\). np.arange(0, 48, 2) # [24,] 1.0 / (base(10000) ** ([0, 2, ..., 44, 46] / 48)) = 1.0 / (base(10000) ** [0, 0.04166667, ..., 0.9166667, 0.958333344]) = 1.0 / [1, 1.4677993, ..., 4641.59, 6812.9194] = [1, 0.68129206, ..., 0.00021544, 0.00014678] The result of the calculation is np.outer multiplied by max_seq_len(256), and then cos and sin are calculated. # [256,] x [24,] = [256, 24] freqs = np.outer([0 ~ 255], [1, 0.68129206, ..., 0.00021544, 0.00014678]) self.freqs_cos: Array[\"M, HD//2\"] = np.cos(freqs) self.freqs_sin: Array[\"M, HD//2\"] = np.sin(freqs) The heatmap of cos and sin looks like this: The stories15M model is max_seq_len(256), but I think it could scale up to 8K if we utilize all values up to horizontal axis 24. RMSNorm RMSNorm normalizes activation values based on the Root Mean Square of the activation values, as opposed to using traditional Mini Batch or Layer statistics. This has the advantage of scaling activation consistently, regardless of Mini Batch size or Layer. Like other normalization techniques, it also has separate training parameters. 1 The formula implementation is as follows: z: Array[\"B, L or 1, 1\"] = (x ** 2).mean(-1, keepdims=True) + self.eps z: Array[\"B, L or 1, D\"] = x / np.sqrt(z) return z * self.weight QKV The way to calculate QKV is to matmul one weight in GPT and then split it, but Llama have their own weights for QKV, so we need to matmul them separately. Then, for Multi-Head Attention, we reshape each one to separate them by Multi-Head. # QKV xq: Array[\"B, L or 1, D\"] = x @ self.q_weight xk: Array[\"B, L or 1, D\"] = x @ self.k_weight xv: Array[\"B, L or 1, D\"] = x @ self.v_weight # [\"B, L or 1, D\"] -> [\"B, L or 1, QHN or KVHN, HD\"] xq: Array[\"B, L or 1, QHN, HD\"] = xq.reshape(B, L, self.n_local_heads, self.head_dim) xk: Array[\"B, L or 1, KVHN, HD\"] = xk.reshape(B, L, self.n_local_kv_heads, self.head_dim) xv: Array[\"B, L or 1, KVHN, HD\"] = xv.reshape(B, L, self.n_local_kv_heads, self.head_dim) RoPE #2 Now it’s time to actually apply the RoPE using the values we calculated earlier. 2 RoPE is a new type of position encoding technique that has the characteristics of both absolute and relative, and performs well because it has the characteristics of both. It only applies to Q and K, dividing each input by the sum of its parts, then multiplying by cos and sin, adding and subtracting the results, and returning the sum back to reshape. xq_out_r: Array[\"B, L or 1, QHN, HD//2\"] = xq_r * freqs_cos - xq_i * freqs_sin xq_out_i: Array[\"B, L or 1, QHN, HD//2\"] = xq_r * freqs_sin + xq_i * freqs_cos xk_out_r: Array[\"B, L or 1, KVHN, HD//2\"] = xk_r * freqs_cos - xk_i * freqs_sin xk_out_i: Array[\"B, L or 1, KVHN, HD//2\"] = xk_r * freqs_sin + xk_i * freqs_cos xq_out: Array[\"B, L or 1, QHN, HD//2, 2\"] = np.stack([xq_out_r, xq_out_i], axis=-1) xk_out: Array[\"B, L or 1, KVHN, HD//2, 2\"] = np.stack([xk_out_r, xk_out_i], axis=-1) xq_out: Array[\"B, L or 1, QHN, HD\"] = xq_out.reshape(xq_out.shape[:-2] + (-1,)) xk_out: Array[\"B, L or 1, KVHN, HD\"] = xk_out.reshape(xk_out.shape[:-2] + (-1,)) RoPE are applied after the Q and K have been multiplied by the weights in the attention mechanism, while in the vanilla transformer they’re applied before. KV Cache 3 Since the GPT-style generative model is Masked Attention, it is possible to KV Cache. Since the previous result will always be the same, regardless of what comes after it, since we are not allowed to see the next word, we can cache K and V, and Q only needs to compute the last value. The cache is held by max_seq_len(256), so the result of the calculation is put in and then extracted back to the only current length. # KV Cache self.cache_k[:B, start_pos: start_pos + L] = xk self.cache_v[:B, start_pos: start_pos + L] = xv ks: Array[\"B, L, KVHN, HD\"] = self.cache_k[:B, : start_pos + L] vs: Array[\"B, L, KVHN, HD\"] = self.cache_v[:B, : start_pos + L] # (1, 256, 6, 48) -> (1, 5, 6, 48) # GQA xk: Array[\"B, L, HN, HD\"] = repeat_kv(ks, self.n_rep) xv: Array[\"B, L, HN, HD\"] = repeat_kv(vs, self.n_rep) xq: Array[\"B, HN, L or 1, HD\"] = xq.transpose(0, 2, 1, 3) xk: Array[\"B, HN, L, HD\"] = xk.transpose(0, 2, 1, 3) xv: Array[\"B, HN, L, HD\"] = xv.transpose(0, 2, 1, 3) Here, we fetch the cache values and then transpose them back to reshape them, but this could be done more efficiently by skipping this step. For reference, the maximum size of the KV Cache is \\(1 \\times 256 \\times 6 \\times 48 \\times 2 \\times 6 = 884K\\) on batch size 1. Since it is a 15M model, it takes up about 6% more memory. GQA(Grouped-Query Attention) 4 MQA, which is a Multi-query, has the advantage of being compact and memory-saving compared to MHA, which is a Multi-head, but it suffers from poor performance and unstable learning. Therefore, Grouped-query, GQA, was introduced in Llama 2. In Llama 2, GQA was only applied to 70B, but from Llama 3, GQA was applied to all models above 8B. Since we are using a model that was trained without GQA, we do not use GQA, but we have implemented it in the code. We have implemented it by simply copying it by a multiple, and it can be improved by referencing the previous value for future optimization. We have avoided using GQA when n_rep==1. if n_rep == 1: return x z: Array[\"B, L, QHN, HD\"] = np.repeat(x, n_rep, axis=2) Scaled Dot-Product Attention Attentions are calculated separately by Multi-Head. \\(Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V\\) # Scaled Dot-Product Attention # [\"B, HN, L or 1, HD\"] @ [\"B, HN, HD, L\"] -> [\"B, HN, L or 1, L\"] attention: Array[\"B, HN, L or 1, L\"] = xq @ xk.transpose(0, 1, 3, 2) / math.sqrt(self.head_dim) # `mask` is used only once at the beginning. if mask is not None: attention = attention + mask[None, None, :, :] attention = softmax(attention) output: Array[\"B, HN, L or 1, HD\"] = attention @ xv Masking is only done at the beginning and only the last Q needs to be processed afterward, so no masking is needed. The result can then be obtained with softmax and matmul. Finally, the result of the Multi-Head calculation is reshaped to full dimension to combine the heads and matmul once more. # [\"B, HN, L or 1, HD\"] -> [\"B, L or 1, D\"] output: Array[\"B, L or 1, D\"] = output.transpose(0, 2, 1, 3).reshape(B, L, -1) output: Array[\"B, L or 1, D\"] = output @ self.o_weight Computing the entire QKV at once is only done in the Prefill Phase. At this time, TTFT (Time To First Token) is called Prefill Latency, and only ‘vector @ matrix’ operations need to be performed from the Decode Phase onward. Flash Attention is also effective only when reducing the Prefill Latency during inference, and it performs somewhat well when the input is long. Feed Forward In Llama model, Feed Forward uses 3 linear with matmul only and no bias, so unlike GPT, it is not a complete fully-connected layer. We create a swish value from the silu result, multiply it with x_V up-scaled from D to FD, and down-scale it again. Here, the size of FD is FD = 2 * 4 * D / 3, which is D(288), so FD(768). swish: Array[\"B, L or 1, FD\"] = silu(x @ self.gate_weight) x_V: Array[\"B, L or 1, FD\"] = x @ self.up_weight x: Array[\"B, L or 1, FD\"] = swish * x_V x: Array[\"B, L or 1, D\"] = x @ self.down_weight SwiGLU In the paper, the SwiGLU formula looks like this: 1 Multiplying x_V with swish and matmul it with W_2 is called SwiGLU. This unique combination of multiple feed forwards layers increases the performance of the model. Let x be a real number between approximately \\(-14 \\sim 11\\), which is the input to the silu function. The silu implementation is as follows: x * (1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))) Linear After passing through all the transformer blocks, the final output is only the last logit computed by matmul to speed things up. The transformer block always outputs [\"1, D\"] as the result after the Prefill Phase. # [\"B, 1, VS\"] = [\"B, 1(L), D\"] @ [\"D, VS\"] logit: Array[\"B, 1, VS\"] = h[:, [-1], :] @ self.lm_head_weight Generation Now, we generate tokens one after the other using the extracted logit. For simplicity, we’ve omitted sampling from the generation process and only output the Greedy result. for i, curr_pos in enumerate(range(L, max_new_tokens)): if i == 0: # Prefill Phase inputs = input_ids pos = 0 else: # Decode Phase inputs = next_id pos = curr_pos logits: Array[\"B, 1, VS\"] = self(inputs, pos) next_id = logits[:, -1, :].argmax(-1, keepdims=True) yield next_id The first step is Prefill Phase, or sometimes called Summarization. It passes all input and starts at position 0. This is also where Flash Attention comes into play. From then on, it is the Decode Phase and thanks to the KV Cache, only the last token ID is passed to Q and the result is the also last logit. Here, we omit sampling and only extract the maximum value. If you want to add a sampling process, you can take softmax and implement top_p and top_k. You can now yield the token ID we generated as a result, decode it in the next step and print the output token to finalize the process. Example You can run it like this: $ python llama3.py \"I have a dream\" \"\"\" I have a dream. He dream of a big, beautiful garden full of flower and tree. He dream of playing with hi friend and eating yummy snack. One day, he wa walking in the garden when he saw Token count: 50, elapsed: 1.53s, 33 tokens/s \"\"\" Karpathy has trained the model to a certain extent, and the result is that model is not performing badly. It ran at 33 tokens/s on an M2 MacBook Air. GitHub The full source code is available at likejazz/llama3.np.

As an outsider it's surprising that such a capable model can be so \"simple\". reply jacobn 12 hours agorootparentThe training code is presumably quite a bit more complex than what they've open sourced, but part of the beauty of the GPT-based LLMs is their structural simplicity. Now, that simplicity can be deceiving - there are a lot of conceptual interconnectedness within these models. They've been put together \"just so\" if you will. If you look at the source code to nanoGPT and compare it to Llama3, the most remarkable thing (when you look past the superficial name changes) is just how similar they are. If I recall correctly the primary differences are: - The MLP: Llama3 uses SwiGLU vs the more \"traditional\" x = x + proj(gelu(expand(x))) in GPT2 - The token encoders, which is arguably external to the model - Attention: Llama3 uses Grouped Query Attention, vs full Multi-Head Attention in GPT2 - Normalization: Llama3 uses RMSNorm, vs LayerNorm for GPT2 They were published more than five years apart. On the one hand progress has been breathtaking, truly astounding. On the other hand, it's almost exactly the same model. Goes to show just how much is in the training data. reply novaRom 3 hours agorootparent> beauty of the GPT-based LLMs is their structural simplicity human brain's structure is also encoded in a short DNA sequence reply jacobn 7 hours agorootparentprevForgot one: the positional encoding also changed, llama3 uses RoPE, gpt2 uses a learned embedding. reply moritzwarhier 12 hours agorootparentprevI think with LLMs in general, the algorithms are very refined and require lots of research, despite being \"simple\" in terms of entropy, or an imagined Kolgomorov complexity for defining algorithms. So \"simple\" is a fuzzy term here, but yes, the entropic complexity is in the data, not the algorithms. Related to the so-called \"Bitter lesson\". Edit: the sister comment pointed out what I failed to express: RILHF and training are also algorithms, and their applications and implementations are probably much more complex than the code that evaluates a given prompt. So basically, \"models\" (trained NNs) are also an example for the equivalence of code and data. Fixed data used by code (the trained model) is code in itself, even when it is not directly written by humans or in a human-readable language. Edit edit: don't forget to count the imported maths code :) but I assume this is not relevant to the \"it's just matrix multiplications\" overall argument reply SpaceManNabs 12 hours agorootparentprev300 lines of this code is a bit different than 300 lines of typical code where you read files, set up a backend/frontend, or parse data. In the latter case, there are a lot of tedious operations. Sure, the former also has that with reshaping and asserts or wtv. But in a sense, the 300 lines of Llama code are essentially just lines of math. And reading through any math proof will show you that any particular line can hide large amounts of complexity. This can be true with code with more tedious operations, but those lines are a smaller fraction of the overall code base by definition. Even the \"tedious\" parts of the llama code can hide large complexity. Setting a learning rate with a schedule might require reading a paper or two for your particular architecture. But yes, once you parse all the math and the theory, the lines are kinda simple matmul and forward lol. reply ffriend 10 hours agorootparentSure, knowing the basics of LLM math is necessary. But it's also _enough_ to know this math to fully grasp the code. There are only 4 concepts - attention, feed-forward net, RMS-normalization and rotary embeddings - organized into a clear structure. Now compare it to the Hugginface implementation [1]. In addition to the aforementioned concepts, you need to understand the hierarchy of `PreTrainedModel`s, 3 types of attention, 3 types of rotary embeddings, HF's definition of attention mask (which is not the same as mask you read about in transformer tutorials), several types of cache class, dozens of flags to control things like output format or serialization, etc. It's not that Meta's implementation is good and HF's implementation is bad - they pursue different goals in their own optimal way. But if you just want to learn how the model works, Meta's code base is great.

And even beyond that, there's Observable Framework[2], a static site generator for building visualization dashboards (that supports Plot, D3 and lots of other libraries). 1: https://observablehq.com/plot/ 2: https://observablehq.com/framework/ reply jo-m 13 hours agoparentObservable Plot is amazing. It is very flexible and intuitive to use. I now prefer it over Plotly.js which I used to use before. The docs are pretty OK, the only thing missing is a usable API reference section, so discoverability is not great. reply forrestthewoods 14 hours agoparentprev> but you want something a bit higher level These days I kinda want the opposite. Most of the time I know exactly what I want my output to look like. But frameworks inherently provide a large bag of presets and if you want something slightly different from the preset it's a pain in the ass. For many types of plots I find it's actually kinda easier to just manipulate SVG data directly. It's not that hard! I'd like to see a library/framework that focuses on making it easier to manipulate SVG or canvas output. It should be trivial to make tweaks. But the higher level a framework goes the harder it is to step off the golden path. reply contravariant 13 hours agorootparentWhy does d3 not work for you if you just want to manipulate the svg directly? You can use it to generate or update arbitrary xml as far as I know. reply zdragnar 13 hours agorootparentThe higher level in this case is observable plot, not d3. reply sbarre 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah I hear you, if you know exactly what you want, Plot is probably not for you.. But I've found lots of value in using Plot to explore data, and quickly throw something together and look at it, and decide if it's a good way to present the data or not. Although I will say that you can \"drop down\" to the SVG pretty easily with Plot. Lots of examples even on their site where they start with Plot marks and then heavily customize the SVG directly. reply cess11 13 hours agorootparentprevHave you tried p5js? reply screye 14 hours agoparentprevDoes the website feel janky to anyone else ?

Learning D3 offers the best flexibility and control. reply mbostock 17 hours agorootparentIn what way are these free open-source tools “locked-in” to Observable? Observable Plot is a vanilla JavaScript library that is released under the ISC license and can be used with any style of web development (e.g., React, Svelte, whatever). And likewise Observable Framework is released under the ISC license and you’re able to self-host projects anywhere and develop locally? reply navaed01 8 hours agorootparentMike, thank you for D3. It’s had a huge impact on me personally. reply toasted-subs 14 hours agorootparentprevCan you add the library as a html link. Anything else would be unwise to invest time in learning. reply ghostly_s 13 hours agorootparentYes? Examples here: https://observablehq.com/plot/getting-started reply simonw 16 hours agorootparentprevPlot isn't locked into the Observable ecosystem at all - it's a JavaScript library that you can use independently of everything else there. reply sbarre 13 hours agorootparentprevI'll ignore the part where you're wrong about the lock-in, but to the rest of what you said... Yes? I guess I didn't think it needed to be said so explicitly, but if you are opting into Plot and Framework, you are accepting convention over configuration as they say. And for some situations, that is what you want. If you value flexibility and control above all else, then I agree they may not be for you. But if you value other things, like speed of iteration, or just getting some good data visualizations built without a deep investment in learning underlying concepts, then Plot and/or Framework have definite advantages over doing it all with D3. reply bilekas 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I can say from experience of D3 at least, it's very far from locked in. In fact I would ask what library you're thinking of could be less. The community also has helped with some bizarre integrations I was trying to do, into libraries like highcharts for strange reasons etc. reply jeffbee 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is like saying that a computer without an operating system offers the best flexibility, or that a pile of sand is more flexible than an assembled computer. reply locallost 16 hours agorootparentD3 is not an empty computer. It's a high level library built in a high level language that runs in a browser. You are very very very far away from \"metal\". Being able to do something in a few clicks or little typing is nice until you need to do something more complicated. Sometimes it's worth actually learning how something basically works. Sometimes it isn't, it's everybody's choice. reply wisemang 16 hours agorootparentSo D3 is not what I’d consider a high-level library. The point of it is to be able to do all kinds of stuff not supported by your average charting solution’s out of the box histograms and whatnot. It’s a great way to make more bespoke visualizations. Of course sometimes you just want to make a damn histogram without reinventing the wheel which is where some of the niceties discussed above come in. reply locallost 13 hours agorootparentD3 runs in the browser and it manipulates DOM nodes, a very high level abstraction. You can accomplish something with it using SVG, which is again a high level abstraction. You can give it data and it will spit out numbers that you can use to draw something on the screen. You can bind that data to elements and it will keep track of what's entering and what's exiting. You can apply fancy transitions with a line of code! You can make it change an appearance of e.g. a graph by changing the interpolation method. And so on. Sure you have to write code, but it does a lot of things in the background that would take you s lot longer to do yourself. High level is not just \"here's a library on top of D3 that you just give data to and you're done, but then you have to cry for days because you need to do something it didn't think of - 80% of use cases\". When I used it I didn't get it, but then I took some time, a couple days, to actually understand it and I got a lot more productive. It's a great feeling when instead of thinking in workarounds for a missing configuration option you can think in solutions for the actual task. A lot quicker and more rewarding. I didn't do much computer graphics in my life, some mandatory university classes, but I'd say doing it on the simplest beginner level it was a much different experience. reply wisemang 11 hours agorootparentFair enough. I meant specifically in the context of data visualization libraries, having done a fair bit of that sort of work in my own career. It’s harder to make a basic chart in d3, compared to many out of the box solutions, but it’s possible to do pretty much whatever you want, thanks to (what I consider) the low-ish level of abstraction it provides. I.e. DOM manipulation vs direct specification of standard chart attributes. reply addicted 13 hours agorootparentprevD3 is low level for doing what it does. Visualizing data. It’s hard to think of a lower level abstraction for that purpose. reply __MatrixMan__ 15 hours agorootparentprevI've used D3 in nodejs to generate a png. Is it really that different than using something like Python or Java to do the same? reply dingclancy 3 hours agorootparentI might have confused your point, but if your goal is to build charts for data analysis, or exploratory data analysis, then D3 is considered low-level for the purpose of getting to the analysis fast. reply toasted-subs 14 hours agoparentprevAs much as I hate to even ask for but is there a Matlab like drag and drop interface for web visualization. I try to avoid graphs with html5 canvas like the plague maybe a new way to design them would be nice. reply hervature 5 hours agorootparentSounds like you want Tableau. It even comes with the same price tag as Matlab! reply treflop 17 hours agoprevI like d3 and have built a lot of things in it but every time I go back to it after not using it for a few years, I can never remember much, the docs just confuse me more, and I feel like I’m back at square one. Whereas you could show me some partial differential equations to solve that I haven’t touched in 10 years and that somehow comes back quicker. But I also think the d3 reference docs are absolutely horrible too. reply hantusk 13 hours agoparentI also have written a lot d3, between versions 2 and 7, and the refactoring that has happened meant a lot of examples online that were hard to comprehend were even harder to update. I feel like its more stable now though. Something clicks for me since ive started writing it in more imperative style with svelte+d3 rather than d3 alone. The generated elements are easier for me to reason about, rather than otherwise relying on inspecting the generated elements with dev-tools after the generation. This site was helpful to me, to combine d3 and svelte: https://svelte.recipes/ reply PaulHoule 17 hours agoparentprevI feel it is that way much less than other plotting libs. Maybe 80% of what I do is applications, 10% systems and 10% data analysis. Often I will spend two weeks making Jupyter notebooks and then not look at it for two months. I find most plotting libs have a lot of arbitrary things to remember, they usually have several nano DSLs (strings that get interpreted in ways more complex than atoi.). On top of that most plotting libs have something wrong from my point of view in various areas like deciding the range of the axes or handling huge numbers of points or something. D3 makes you do a lot yourself but the interfaces it provides to do that are conceptually straightforward. Instead of using someone else’s bloated and buggy general purpose code though an APi that feels like assembling a ship in a bottle you can just do it right with D3.js. reply treflop 16 hours agorootparentI agree and I think that’s why I end up re-learning d3 over and over. But having to do it yourself is a lot of work so you have to make an executive decision between shoehorning some plotting library that can’t do a chart feature that honestly should be supported versus building an entire chart from scratch. reply lucisferre 17 hours agoparentprevI have used D3 extensively to the point of building integrations for AngularJS and Angular for it. I have always found it to be exceptionally unintuitive even if it is quite powerful. It is easy to get wrong, hard to debug and hard to grok. Not saying this is an easy problem to solve either. If I needed to generate some very specific data driven graphics it would probably still be my go to. reply groggo 11 hours agorootparentSo happy to read this in a few different comments. I took a data-viz class in college and just felt stupid because d3 didn't click for me. reply gedy 17 hours agorootparentprevYes same, and I'm curious of what mental modal it uses as it does not register with me, who otherwise has no problem programming. reply asdman123 17 hours agorootparentAs far as I remember it is inspired by the Grammar of Graphics, as is ggplot2 in the R ecosystem: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0 For me it also always had this moment when it „clicked“ just to disappear after not using it for a couple of months. reply ethbr1 16 hours agorootparentSounds like it's based on a good model for the problem space, but a model that's alien to other day-to-day ones. Which is an interesting problem! Is it better to optimally model ones problem space? Or suboptimally model it, but create a model that's closer to developer/user expectations? reply ska 15 hours agoparentprev> hereas you could show me some partial differential equations to solve that I haven’t touched in 10 years and that somehow comes back quicker. The HCI (human calculation interface) for calculus has been lovingly polished for many, many generations. A quick read over Newtons original texts will quickly reveal that wasn't always so. It seems unfair to hold an API to the standard, really. reply qwertox 14 hours agorootparentHappens to me as well, with the exception of the equation thing. reply vvpan 17 hours agoparentprevI have had the same experience. As a tech lead these days I insist that nobody uses libraries that require a high level of domain knowledge. Basically code that is incomprehensible even for the person that wrote it should be avoided as hard as possible. D3 is a prime example of such a library. reply locallost 16 hours agoparentprevI only did one bigger project with D3 and had the same experience! I was thinking about the same thing before I read your post. Not really sure why, but when I was doing it regularly it felt smooth, but now I can't remember anything. reply uxcolumbo 17 hours agoparentprevWhich other library would you recommend? reply treflop 16 hours agorootparentI haven’t found anything else that comes close and that’s why I haze myself over and over. reply solatic 18 hours agoprevEven if you never end up using it professionally, I think it's worth it to learn D3. The core point that the library makes is that your projection of the data (say, a 1080p screen, 1920x1080) is always different from the dimensions of the data itself (say, grading from 0-100). At some point you need to decide how to scale the data (0-100) so that it draws correctly according to the projection (1920x1080). You can do the math yourself, or you can use a library like D3 to do the math for you. Even if you don't draw data on the web, you'll probably eventually draw data somewhere, and you'll be glad to look for an equivalent in that ecosystem. reply codetrotter 18 hours agoparentOne of the first things I ever programmed in PHP, of my own creation was a binomial distribution graph png generator. Pretty sure I had to scale the rectangles I was drawing for the graph according to the dimensions of the png I was making. It was of course very trivial, and nothing like the amazing things D3 can do. But it was a neat experience, making something of my own for very first time that produced an image on the computer. reply groggo 11 hours agoparentprevThat's a good way of framing the core concept. D3 was never intuitive for me. Maybe the problem is that it tries to do too much, at too many different level of abstraction? If it's just about projecting data, that's easy enough to understand. But I guess projection is also closely tied to axis and other pieces. reply stared 15 hours agoprevI've been in love with D3.js and have used it as the key technology for dozens of data visualization projects, both commercial and personal. However, its rendering syntax now feels dated, reminiscent of the jQuery era. While I still use various auxiliary functions (e.g., for ease or scaling), I now create actual components in a modern framework (in my case, Vue 3 and TypeScript). Despite this shift, I am grateful to D3.js for the beautiful years it gave me and for teaching me various good practices in data visualization. The defaults and demos by Mike Bostock have been both an inspiration and an example of good standards, aligned with Tufte's minimalism. reply pj84 2 hours agoparentI am very interested in this, do you have any examples for vue3 and typescript + d3 auxiliary functions? Thanks! reply hajile 18 hours agoprevLearn D3 then (assuming you're doing something chart-like as most of us are) move to something like VisX or some non-React equivalent and never look back. I view D3 and jQuery as being somewhat similar and both are very prone to spaghetti. Something like VisX adds a lot of structure over the D3 you're using to keep things sane. reply laurels-marts 17 hours agoparentI’ve been using D3 on and off for quite some time. I’m just starting now with react and visx definitely looks very promising as it bridges the gap nicely. Do you find it limiting though (like you have to fight the tool) to achieve something more custom vs. using plain D3? reply hajile 13 hours agorootparentVisX starts with low-level primitive components that match very closely to D3 primitives. It then builds some chart primitives on top of those and then builds some charts on top of that. You can build pretty much anything using the lowest-level primitives and still have a better developer experience than D3 IMO. If you don't need any real customizability (and know you won't need it in the future), I'd stick with something with something less customizable, but faster to setup. If you know you need custom, take the 10-20% more time to setup and be able to change in the future as that'll be faster than porting your charts over. reply 8organicbits 3 hours agoprevI really like the force directed graphs in the d3 examples but I've found that they often settle in poor configurations as the nodes and edges grow. I wonder if I need a 3d visualization at higher scale? Maybe someone else has experience with these. Here's a recent example I built: https://alexsci.com/rss-blogroll-network/ reply williamcotton 15 hours agoprevD3 is inspired by the Grammar of Graphics by Wilkinson. Another tool also inspired by GG is aptly named ggplot2 and for the R language. It offers a much more terse and functional inspired interface that also works well with an uncommon tool named Rush, R one-liners for the Shell, for quickly creating graphics from CSVs piped into the tool. reply wegwerfaccount 2 hours agoprevFor a split second I hoped this one would be about Diablo 3. reply wbeckler 16 hours agoprevI've heard great things about Vega [1], which sits on top of D3. It's a dependency of OpenSearch Dashboards, allowing users to create custom dashboards on log and observability data [2]. The vega library might alleviate some of the concerns others are expressing about the learnability of D3.

The author is responsive and helpful too. reply breadwinner 13 hours agoprevD3 is a terrific toolkit. The fact that it is a low-level toolkit means you have to write more code, but on the other hand, you have more power. One of the negatives of D3 is that D3 charts are not responsive by default. Whether the chart fills the screen, or fills a small area in a dashboard, the grid lines are spaced the same and fonts are the same size. You can add responsiveness manually. It would be nice if a future version was responsive out of the box. reply bilater 16 hours agoprevI love the visualizations created but something about D3 syntax has just never clicked for me. It seems overly convoluted, verbose and from an old era. We've thankfully moved to a more declarative way of doing things. reply laurels-marts 16 hours agoparentD3 is from jQuery era so there are a lot of methods for manually manipulating the DOM like d3.select() and then selection.attr() etc. but those patterns tend to lead to components that are lengthy, hard to read and hard to maintain. Arguably a better approach is to group each D3 module based on whether it \"modifies DOM\" or \"doesn't modify DOM\". Then use React/Svelte to declaratively render the DOM and only use the D3 modules from the latter group for their math utilities. reply math_dandy 6 hours agorootparentThis exists, it’s called visx, and it’s great. https://airbnb.io/visx reply dang 7 hours agoprevRelated: D3 in Depth - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16844250 - April 2018 (52 comments) reply darknavi 17 hours agoprevI just picked up D3 + React for a VS Code webview project. Pretty easy to pick up but I find jumping in with examples very black box (as someone who doesn't have a ton of web experience). That plus going from JS to TS had some quirks that I didn't realize when in JS land. I could really use a \"start from the basics\" tutorial. I will say Github Copilot has been excellent at helping me with random TS errors when porting my graphs from JS to TS.

I haven't used Altair but I wanted something higher level than D3 (which I've used but it feels fairly low level) so I went through the learning curve for Vega.js, and it could handle every usecase that I tried, some of which were pretty complex. reply jeramey 5 hours agoparentprevSeaborn isn’t too bad. It’s basically a convenience wrapper over top of matplotlib. reply PaulHoule 17 hours agoprevD3 is the first visualization toolkit that I really liked. reply javajosh 15 hours agoprevThe real problem with D3 is that, as a library, it doesn't really do visualizations. It gives you functions and exmaples to compose your own visualizations, whose key requirement is an expert-level understanding of JavaScript (particularly closures and functional programming). What mbostock says is the core \"abstraction\" of D3, the select and select diffing, is only an affordance for writing reentrant \"paint()\", with the flourish that your paint statements are expressed as builder statements, which themselves are scoped to select and can be broken up for various effects. Especially in animated examples, D3 does suprisingly little for you, as it's up to you to write the outer loop and track state over time. Nor does D3 give you any abstraction for encapsulating a visualization, as a function or otherwise. This is left as an exercise for the reader. All of this comes as a big surprise, or shock, to the new D3 user. It would be like adopting a new database and finding only a library for file IO and BTree indices and query optimizers, that you need to wire up yourself. reply math_dandy 6 hours agoparentCheck out visx. It should really be called D4: Declarative Data Driven Documents. It swaps out d3-select (the DOM manipulation module of D3) in favor of React. That this is possible and works great is a testament to the great design of D3. reply stared 14 hours agoparentprevWell, D3 is not a set of tools for charts (alike matplotlib, ggplot or so), but a low-level library to create your data visualization from scratch. Depending on your goal, it may or may not be what you need. reply lloydatkinson 16 hours agoprevI keep searching for entirely not-web based diagramming/charting solutions. That can be driven via CLI or using some library, and output SVG or PNG. All of these things usually depend on browser functionality or use some janky as fuck SSR solution using a headless browser to generate them server side. Of particular note, I’d also like to be able to programmatically generate Venn diagrams. It seems there is, bizarrely, a complete dearth of anything in this space. A couple of JavaScript chart libraries support them, but generally speaking there seems to be hardly any support for them. gnuplot seems good - just no Venn diagram support. reply pphysch 17 hours agoprevD3 has an unnecessarily non-intuitive API design, and I think that kills it for a lot of people. For example, why must a data join be performed like `selection.data(array).join(element-type)` instead of something like `selection.join(element-type, array)`. Looking from a pure API-design perspective, not getting bogged down in the technical details. Lazy eval method chaining is a natural fit for applying+branching large amounts of HTML/CSS state updates but I feel that the designers took it a bit too far with the core D3 operations. reply hantusk 13 hours agoparentI don't think it was for the technical fit or performance reasons, but more a philosophy about everything starts with data, and graphics are just visualizations anchored to the data points (or a functionally derived property of the data points). That also means the d3-* libraries compose really well, since the data is the common binding, and not some conceptual class or custom element. reply nhggfu 18 hours agoprev [3 more] [flagged] zem 18 hours agoparentit's literally a javascript library, so I don't understand your complaint here. of course the book and d3 itself are not going to do you much good if you don't know the language it uses! reply dvsfish 18 hours agoparentprev [–] D3 is great if you want to dynamically visualise data in your webpage.

A few of my friends complain that the layout \"sucks\" or foobar lacks functionality they need, but for my use case, it's in a Goldilocks state. With that said, for people used to the functionality of Winamp, I think MusicBee is more likely to be the successor, in terms of out-of-the-box functionality and layout extensibility. reply Scene_Cast2 11 hours agorootparentI find it amusing that modern foobar2k theming is based around Javascript. reply babypuncher 11 hours agorootparentprev> A few of my friends complain that the layout \"sucks\" or foobar lacks functionality they need, but for my use case, I see these complaints too, and I find them funny. The layout is what you make of it. I don't care for any of the layout presets presented in the \"Quick Appearance Setup\" dialog, but the default UI component is very easy to customize almost any way you want. There's even a scratchbox feature that lets you experiment with building a whole UI from scratch without messing with your current layout. As for the functionality they find it lacks, well, there's probably a component for that. Frankly I find foobar2000 comes with a ton of functionality out of the box that other media players don't have, like the very robust features found in the \"Tagging\" and \"File Operations\" context menu entries. reply zem 10 hours agorootparentto be fair, it's a lot easier to tell if you do or do not like something than it is to design something you do like.

[1] https://getwacup.com/screenshots/ reply babypuncher 11 hours agorootparentI consider it a successor in that it's compact with an emphasis on user customization and community-designed plugins/components. Like Winamp, most functionality you get out of the box is provided by bundled plugins, and they can be replaced with alternatives. Out of the box, you could certainly customize it to have a similar layout to winamp even if none of the dressing looks at all the same. My layout[1] is certainly very different than Winamp, but still conforms a lot more to the basic shape of Winamp than the usual giant screen-filling squares that are iTunes, Windows Media Player or the Spotify desktop client. 1. https://i.postimg.cc/R0JzVTK8/image.png reply cageface 9 hours agorootparentprevI'm working on my own cross platform music player that I think has a more polished interface than foobar.

I had just graduated graduate school for international economics, and was working for a government contractor who only hired me because I had a masters (they could charge the government more). Because of this, I literally had nothing to do and would just sit in the office. I eventually figured out an excuse to get my employer to buy Photoshop for me and I started learning it on company time. When Winamp came out with the update to add skins, I ended up making one of the very first skins (meshAMP) which became really popularly. https://archive.org/details/winampskins_meshAmp (I am cringing looking at it now) This led to contract job with STB (to design interfaces for a TV Tuner card they had) and eventually 3DFX (paid in 3d video cards), and eventually a career change and a job as a graphic designer. Except, I was not a good designer, so I quickly learned to program (ASP.net and then JAVA), which led to Macromedia Flash, which led to Macromedia Generator, which eventually led to a job offer from Macromedia (now Adobe), where I still am (sadly, sans Flash).

Large, living companies like Microsoft can work with their lawyers to confidently understand what they're releasing when opening up old code and indemnify theythemselves appropriately, but a troubled company on its last legs can't nexessarily budget for all that. Commercial software of that vintage was not built from dependencies that were all open source themselves, nor were there necessarily contributor/contractor agreements that kept copyright in a suitable place for open source relicencing. They might have been prepared for explicit rights transfer to another party, and maybe disclosure as they're suggesting here, but relicensing is a different thing. reply pquki4 12 hours agoparentprevVery weird. They provide a very specific future date for this, and avoided using the term \"open source\". I can't recall any other company doing this. Most of the time, companies provide a github repository at the same time they make such announcements.

    "originBody": "NEWS 16 May 2024 Found at last: long-lost branch of the Nile that ran by the pyramids Geological survey reveals the remains of a major waterway that ancient Egyptian builders could have used to transport materials. By Freda Kreier Twitter Facebook Email The Red Pyramid, the largest of the pyramids at the Dahshur necropolis, was built more than 4,500 years ago.Credit: Eman Ghoneim Stretching beneath the ground near the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt lie the remains of an ancient branch of the Nile River that might once have helped ancient Egyptians to build their monuments. The highest concentration of pyramids in Egypt can be found in a stretch of desert between Giza and the village of Lisht. These sites are now several dozens of kilometres away from the Nile River. But Egyptologists have long suspected that the Nile might once have been closer to that stretch than it is today. Satellite images and geological data now confirm that a tributary of the Nile — which researchers have named the Ahramat Branch — used to run near many of the major sites in the region several thousand years ago. The discovery, reported on 16 May in Communications Earth and Environment1, could help to explain why ancient Egyptians chose this area to build the pyramids (See ‘Ancient river’). Source: Ref. 1 Image source: NASA Visible Earth “The pyramids seem like pretty monumental work,” says Judith Bunbury, a geoarchaeologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. “But it’s less arduous if you can bring big stones up by boat rather than carrying them over land.” Wandering waterways For thousands of years, the Nile and its flood-plain have provided food, agriculture and water to Egypt’s inhabitants. The majority of the country’s population still lives in the Nile basin. But the river is prone to migrating, and in the past, populations have had to relocate to keep up. Over the last few hundred years, the Nile has moved several kilometres to the east, possibly owing to shifting plate tectonics. There is evidence that some of Egypt’s important archaeological sites do not have the same relationship to the river as they would have had at the time they that were built. There are remains of harbours and other such clues at sites between Giza and Lisht. But scientists have found it difficult to chart the scope or locations of these lost waterways. While looking for traces of ancient water, a team led by Eman Ghoneim, a geomorphologist at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, spotted what looked like a dried-up river channel several kilometres west of the Nile. The channel ran for around 60 kilometres through agricultural areas and had a similar depth and width to the modern Nile. The research team prepares to analyse soil samples collected from an area in the Nile Valley close to the pyramids.Credit: Eman Ghoneim To investigate whether the channel could be part of an ancient riverbed, the researchers collected core samples of sediment from the channel. Beneath the wet mud of the fields, they found an layer of gravel and sand consistent with that of a riverbed. Combining this sample data with satellite imagery allowed the team to map the branch’s location. They found that it would have flowed past more than 30 Old- and Middle-Kingdom pyramids dating from between 2686 to 1649 bc — thus the decision to called it the ‘Ahramat’ branch, using the Arabic word for pyramid. The Ahramat “connected all these different pyramid fields”, says Suzanne Onstine, an egyptologist at the University of Memphis in Tennessee. “Their valley temples and causeways all oriented exactly to where the water would have been.” Riverside sites Researchers have long debated the significance of the pyramids’ locations. The waterway running right past them could have been an important factor, because it would have provided a convenient way for builders to transport materials to the sites. This theory aligns with documents from the era which state that building materials were brought in by boat, says Bunbury. Eventually, the movement of the Nile and sand blowing in from the Sahara Desert would have caused the Ahramat Branch to dry up and become unnavigable. Today, only a few stray lakes and channels remain where the major branch once ran. But knowing the ancient river’s location provides a blueprint that archaeologists can use to try and uncover more ancient Egyptian settlements, says Onstine. And the finding that Egyptians were probably using boats rather than land transportation to move materials to build the pyramids hints that they were “a lot more pragmatic than perhaps we realized before”, says Bunbury. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01449-y References Ghoneim, E. et al.

The measure of its circuit is three thousand six hundred furlongs (being sixty schoines), and this is the same number of furlongs as the extent of Egypt itself along the sea. The lake lies extended lengthwise from North to South, and in depth where it is deepest it is fifty fathoms. That this lake is artificial and formed by digging is self-evident, for about in the middle of the lake stand two pyramids, each rising above the water to a height of fifty fathoms, the part which is built below the water being of just the same height; and upon each is placed a colossal statue of stone sitting upon a chair. Thus the pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and these hundred fathoms are equal to a furlong of six hundred feet, the fathom being measured as six feet or four cubits, the feet being four palms each, and the cubits six. The water in the lake does not come from the place where it is, for the country there is very deficient in water, but it has been brought thither from the Nile by a canal; and for six months the water flows into the lake, and for six months out into the Nile again; and whenever it flows out, then for the six months it brings into the royal treasury a talent of silver a day from the fish which are caught, and twenty pounds when the water comes in.

Moreover, you missed a rather important one: the Hellenic/Greek era of the Ptolemaic dynasty, from which we get the still-spoken Coptic language, which was formed from a mix of Ancient Greek and the indigenous Demotic Egyptian language.

There is no particular reason to think that Roman civilization should be the same after the passage of 500 years since the supposed founding of Rome. Ascribing that in any significant sense to Hellenic influence seems ill-founded; there was a massive difference in fighting style, and hence military virtues, in societies where military virtues were all-important.

In Napoli, there's a set of pretty old (>300 years, I'd guess?) apartment buildings in the historic center, where if you view the buildings and curvature of the street from the sky or google maps, make a clear C shape. The foundation of the buildings is a repurposing of a roman amphitheater. By the time that they began to convert the bottom 10 ft of the amphitheater into the basement of the homes, the amphitheater had been unused for centuries and the remaining high-quality building material had already been scavenged and repurposed for construction elsewhere in the city. Naples, and many other \"ancient\" european cities that are still places inhabited majority by working people, are full of examples like this. It's kind of cool to see people living in a place where history is so overwhelming that it becomes banal. reply Hikikomori 9 hours agorootparentI visited that amphitheater last year as part of the underground tour, really cool.

The problem is when things are ignored because they are inconvenient and you settle on attacking the individuals to the point where if you do not 100% believe in what the Egyptologist say then you must be an ancient aliens believer. I'm sure some people are motivated by such a belief but ancient aliens is the same as giving up and saying that god did it, it does nothing to get you closer to understanding anything, if anything it gets you infinitely farther since in your eyes there is nothing to figure out. reply tiffanyh 17 hours agorootparentprev> That theory is espoused by the same people who think it was built by aliens. I think this is a common misunderstanding. Yes, there are some who think aliens built the pyramids.

I do think it's different than the \"ancient astronauts\" theory, but anything living that isn't from Earth is an alien, so entities from other realms clearly qualify.

I think your comment and Graham Hancock's stuff is using it in the sense of \"technologically advanced\", i.e., access to earth-moving equipment or something. But there's also \"advanced\" in the sense of \"ability to reason\", and that's much more interesting to think about! I think there's a tendency in the modern perspective to equate technological advancement with intelligence, and so we (laypeople and dilletantes especially) tend to think of these long-ago cultures as being sort of comprised of primitive people because they built primitive things, by modern standards. Writing systems, technology, politics & governance, math, chemistry, mechanical systems, metallurgy and materials science, medicine -- minor periodic and localized variations aside, all of these were pretty darn primitive, near as we can tell, and so the people must have been, too. But maybe advanced people do primitive things because the process of developing technology takes a long time. Think about everything that's required to reliably produce steel; maybe a prerequisite for steel is 10,000 years of agriculture. The \"Primitive Technology\" channel on YouTube is a great case study. We have an individual who has access to modern knowledge and technology, but re-producing it is extraordinarily laborious and he's still in the mud hut phase of development -- and he can escape that time period at any time to get access to modern medicine and a rich, nutrient-dense diet. I think this might be a strong argument against ancient technologically advanced civilizations (and alien claptrap). It's unlikely that things really developed that much out-of-order because it just takes too dang long to develop all the steps between basic agriculture and powered machinery. It's kind of like that counter-argument against the \"moon landing was a hoax\" nutters: in 1969, we didn't yet have the film technology required to fake a moon landing. It was easier to get on a rocket to the dang thing! We knew it could be possible to fake it, but we didn't have the tools to do it, yet. So, it's fun to think of past cultures and neolithic humans as being basically us, in terms of intelligence and reasoning and capability, but without any of the modern affordances we have now. reply sebastos 7 hours agorootparentStrongly agree that this one is both very fun to think about and rings true. I sometimes imagine imagine it as parallel to the advancement of the world of computers, which has sort of been like watching the development an entire civilization in miniature. Early computer pioneers were, we know, incredible minds whose talent was the very thing that put us on the hard road to progress. Sure, nowadays, random people are able to casually accomplish much more in absolute terms, but it's because they're standing on the shoulders of giants. All that said, I do tend to be sort of a Graham Hancock apologist. My take is that most people go too extreme with him. They either think he's a crackpot loony who must be taken at face value and debunked as a purveyor of pseudoscience OR they think he's a rebel truthteller: the only one who will look at the real facts, bravely pushing through the corrupt academic swamp. It seems obvious to me that he's neither. He's just an author who stumbled on a compelling, mind-expanding idea. Roughly stated: what if we know less about the past than we think, and thus underestimate our ancestors? I think the interesting thing about Graham Hancock's spiel has nothing to do with any of his specific pieces of archaeological evidence that he digs up, which are very clearly marshaled to make a point he has already decided on making. (This is bad science, 100%.) Rather, the thing he brings to the table is more like a philosophical approach that is genuinely fresh and interesting. And I do think he will one day be vindicated in some way, because we act like we have way more precise knowledge about the past than we actually do. This is sort of an epistemology thing, so appealing directly to the evidence and the current anthropological understanding isn't really engaging with him in good faith. He's pointing out that the Troys of history prove that we consistently overestimate how completely we've understood history and what is and is not reasonable. Over time we tend to acclimate to that picture, and then the problem multiplies, because we tend to only accept things that seem to fit with the now-banal-seeming history we already know, leading to even more banal hypotheses gaining traction. Some of his best writings relate to the systematic bias against catastrophism that existed, and showing how these types of errors in epistemology lead to actual errors of science down the line. reply attheicearcade 3 hours agorootparentprevAnyone who believes Hancock’s ideas should really watch the debate with Flint Dibble[0], in which Hancock eventually admits he has no evidence of his ancient civilisation, and Rogan, who is a long time friend and believer of Hancock, seems to end up siding more with Flint.

But please don't make the mistake of equivocating scientific hypotheses, theories well supported by evidence and crank pseudoscience created for a mass audience. Hancock hasn't been excluded from the 'mainstream' archeological debate. He never participated in it in the first place. He's a writer of retrofuturological science fantasy in the same vein (and citing much the same evidence) as his predecessor Erich von Däniken. This stuff can be hugely entertaining (I'm a science fiction fan and grew up on 'face on mars', 'chariots of the Gods etc').

Of particular importance in this gradual undermining of the great man’s authority was a site called Blackwater Draw near the town of Clovis >[...] >The Smithsonian sent a representative, Charles Gilmore, to take a look at the site but—perhaps unsurprisingly under Hrdlička’s malign shadow—he concluded that no further investigation was justified. >[...] >Anthropologist Edgar B. Howard of the University of Pennsylvania disagreed.He began excavations at Blackwater Draw in 1933, quickly finding quantities of beautifully crafted stone projectiles with distinctive “fluted” points >[...] >Before and after 1943, the year in which both Howard and Hrdlička died, further discoveries of fluted points of the Blackwater Draw type—increasingly referred to as “Clovis points” after the nearby town of that name—continued to be made. This ever-accumulating mass of new evidence left no room for doubt and even the most stubborn conservatives (Hrdlička excepted) were eventually forced to agree that the Clovis culture had hunted animals that became extinct at the end of the last Ice Age and that humans must therefore have been in the Americas for at least 12,000 years. >[...] >a consensus soon began to emerge that no older cultures would ever be found—and what is now known as the “Clovis First” paradigm was conceived.

Vance Haynes, whose 1964 paper launched the Clovis First theory and who by 1988 had used his influence, and his outreach in the scientific journals, to dismiss every case thus far made for supposedly pre-Clovis sites in the Americas. >[...] >Indeed by 2012 the bullying behavior of the Clovis First lobby had grown so unpleasant that it attracted the attention of the editor of Nature, who opined: “The debate over the first Americans has been one of the most acrimonious—and unfruitful—in all of science. … One researcher, new to the field after years of working on other contentious topics, told Nature that he had never before witnessed the level of aggression that swirled around the issue of who reached America first. reply tiffanyh 15 hours agorootparentprevI just started watched the YouTube. It’s hard to take this debunking serious when the very 1st point he makes about Graham is incorrect. He states that Graham claims to be a researcher. https://youtu.be/-iCIZQX9i1A?t=139 In the Netflix series, Graham doesn’t not. He makes it clear he’s not a researcher nor archeologist. He clearly states he’s an investigative journalist. https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=19&v=DgvaXros3MY&feature=youtu... —- And then the YouTube host roots his show on the scientific method with the question “How do you prove there was an ancient civilians”. This is the wrong root question. The root question should be “How did ancient civilians create these structures using the technology we believe they had at the time”.

No, he doesn't state that at all. This is what Milo says, verbatim: \"He is a person that some may call a researcher. I am one of those people. More predominantly than that, Graham Hancock is a writer.\" > The root question should be “How did ancient civilians create these structures using the technology we believe they had at the time”. That's an interesting question, but it's essentially an endless one: we will never, ever know how ancient civilizations created everything they created, because their secrets have been lost to time. Human history is so deep and the evidence so porous that we simply will never run out of questions to ask about how they did what they did. Furthermore, even when we come up with ways they might have created things, we may never, ever know whether that's really what they did, because the evidence is not there anymore. There are medieval and later items which we don't really know how were created, but we do know, for sure, that they didn't have power tools. For instance, what was Greek fire, exactly? There are lots of good ideas, Wikipedia suggests \"it may have been made by combining pine resin, naphtha, quicklime, calcium phosphide, sulfur, or niter.\" Will we ever know which? Maybe, but probably not. reply tiffanyh 15 hours agorootparentHis whole premise is that civilizations didn’t exist that long ago (which is his scientific method question).

Of course there were people around during the Younger Dryas, Hancock is making a bunch of claims about what people were doing at that time. Milo is saying there wasn't a globe-spanning civilization with a shared culture and advanced technology existing during that period, not that there weren't people (are you perhaps confusing the words \"civilian\" and \"civilization\"?)

And those primitive humans had the same capabilities we do today. But the kind concerted effort and organization required for monumental construction still took hundreds of generations to develop. Megaliths older than the Sphinx certainly exist, but the Sphinx is orders of magnitude more complex. Not just in terms of engineering and tools (the Sphinx was carved with metal tools) but the size of the well-governed population required to do the labor. It is inconceivable that a society could spring out of the marshlands to build the Sphinx and leave no other trace for thousands of years. And then for a new civilization to show up with all the technology and culture they had, falsify a load of records to say they built it along with the Pyramids.

That taking 6000 years to develop I think is evidence against what you are saying. Specifically, that is a tiny adaptation compared to the organization of the human brain. Is 30x more time than lactose tolerance enough for significant brain changes? I find it implausible, I would guess the major adaptations of the brain are on the order of millions of years, not a couple hundred thousand. The adaptations for social organization seemingly have been with us for a long time. AFAIK humans have been in large groups for a very long time, as long as they have been homo sapiens (Large being over 50 members, and take that with a grain of salt, that is only my possibly incorrect understanding). I do find it very plausible that people 1k, 10k, 50k and maybe even 200k years ago were all smart (Plato probably is far smarter than most alive today). Though, smart and education are different, while smart- the body of knowledge was limited. reply masklinn 12 hours agorootparent> Lactose tolerance AFAIK is a single enzyme. That taking 6000 years to develop I think is evidence against what you are saying. Also relevant: lactose tolerance is something we start out with, babies need it. So lactose tolerance, or more properly lactase persistence, was not the development of a brand new trait out of nowhere, it was maintaining a capability past the age where it would previously degrade out of functionality. reply seadan83 9 hours agorootparentTL;DR: (1) brain shape has not changed for about 160k years. (2) The framing/facts of the discussion is bad. Mutations are happening all the time, it is 'natural selection' that seemingly made lactose tolerance more prevalent in the last 20k years. ----------------------- Long answer: ## Natural Selection / Lactose Tolerance (as an example of a very recent adaptation) / Why the discussion is so far incorrect In my first reply, I notice now a big flaw. Having an adaptation be present in a population for 6000 years does not mean it took that time to evolve it. (According to [3], the adaptation has become prevalent in 20k years rather 6k) To frame what we are discussing, I hope we can all agree: mutations are happening all the time and in aggregate we each individually carry a vast quantity of genetic differences/mutations apart from every other individual. For lactose tolerance, really what we are talking about is more natural selection. At least I think we are. As an example, a population can change very quickly via natural selection if an event kills off everyone that is missing a mutation. That perhaps 1% mutation suddenly becomes the surviving population. (For completeness, I'll mention that this process can happen more slowly as well over time, but it can depend on single mutations, aggregates of mutations, and environment and random luck [eg: asteriod] are all factors). This is to say, there could have been plenty of lactose tolerant people well before. This NPR piece on the history of lactose tolerance states it well [3] \"But now that doesn't happen for most people of Northern and Central European descent and in certain African and Middle Eastern populations. This development of lactose tolerance took only about 20,000 years — the evolutionary equivalent of a hot minute — but it would have required extremely strong selective pressure.\" What's more though too, nothing is to say that natural selection always works to favorably select genes. EG: The village idiot might be the only one immune to the plague. It's way complex of course since there's so much variation between every individual, but I just wanted to underscore that natural selection is a function of individual, time & place. Sometimes some mutations are useful, other times they are not and are dumb luck of what is left over from some time before. -------------------- ## Brain Size & Human Cognition With the issue of natural selection out of the way, what I do wonder is how long it took for the brain to get the way it is today. According to this resource, The Smithsonian [1], the answer is approx 7M years, with most of that happening in the last 2M years until 200k years ago. That is in terms of 'size' (does not account for wrinkles). According to 'newscientist' [2], the shape (now talking wrinkles here) of the human brain today is very similar to what it was 160k years ago, and has not really changed since. The resource mentions that the biggest changes since then have been in how our faces look rather than how our brains are shaped. Those changes are specifically smaller jaws: \"Faces in modern humans are far smaller, with subtler indentation, than those of their ancestors. Studies show that this change accelerated when hunter-gatherers became agriculturalists around 12,000 years ago and ate softer foods, probably due to less loading on the skull from chewing.\" Summing up, given that brain shape has been about the same for the last 160k years; it's plausible that is how far it goes back for people that felt & thought about exactly the same way we do today. If anyone knows about more research around the rise of human cognition on this topic, I'd certainly like to learn more.

To put it comparatively Ötzi the iceman is highly studied because preserved bodies aren't found from his era and location that often. If we stumbled across a graveyard with 10000 people from the same era that was easily accessible, I doubt we'd spend much time studying all of them.

Used to be people dynamited sites to get at stuff faster (also dynamite colleague's sites to undermine them). We stopped doing that, because it was stupid and wasteful.

The thing that sells me, besides the erosion, is the absolutely astonishing artifacts that were left behind. There is no way I could be convinced that hand-driven bronze tooling was cutting diorite to a precision we would struggle to meet today, carving schists so thin you can see light pass through, absolutely perfect symmetry, and creation of granite stoneware with multivariate surface geometry that we'd be unable to do without a precision-destroying tool change.

However, based on my insight as a former customer and shareholder of the company, Sprint's goose was most definitely cooked to a crisp. If this merger had not happened, I could have seen Sprint file for bankruptcy, with Verizon and AT&T picking the carcass clean. I think folks forget how dire Sprint's straits were at the time, and this specific merger truly was the least of all evils. reply Benjammer 17 hours agoparent>Sprint's goose was most definitely cooked The reason their goose was cooked is because they previously were planning to acquire T Mobile, but SoftBank got back-channel info that it would never be approved by the anti-trust regulators. At the time they had Marcelo Claure running Sprint, basically a corporate \"fixer\" guy for SoftBank. So he ran the company into the dirt in order to make the merge feasible to regulators (e.g. - Sprint purchased a 33% stake in Tidal, the music streaming service. Or how they entered a partnership with bankrupt RadioShack after it got scooped up by PE, and decided it was a good idea to take over all the physical RadioShack locations and turn them into Sprint stores). \"Oh, whatever shall we do, our company is failing, you MUST let us merge with one of our primary competitors or we'll go bankrupt.

Sprint's goose was cooked but it was due to debt from selling junk bonds to build Network Vision at the time of the original LTE rollout. Their credit was ruined by that point from 30+ years of absolutely terrible and corrupt c-suite executives. Marcello has a lot of faults but he didn't run Sprint into the ground. He is actually pretty smart and at that time we cut over a billion dollars out of the operating budget circa 2016/2017 iirc.

That means it gets better potential speeds when it does work, but it's going to have more difficulty penetrating barriers, reaching longer distances, do worse in inclement weather, and so on. This is also a fundamental limitation of trying to reach higher speeds with this form of tech, because frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional.

Sprint was dying - with extraordinarily high debt, in 2007, well before Softbank bought them, and indeed they lost money every year from 2008 forward - https://www.statista.com/statistics/481739/sprint-corporatio... The Merger with Nextel managed to kill what was great about Nextel, and what was good about Sprint, and they lost customers in droves (mostly former Nextel ones). In reality Sprint bought Nextel's OAM equipment and their customers, and moved all the legacy Sprint customers onto the surviving billing and network management platforms (Nextel). The iDEN turndown also lost even more customers, most of whom who realized they didnt need PTToC after all (which is too bad, because on dedicated CDMA hardware, it worked really great). Then they needed to start rolling out LTE (Network Vision) - and NV didnt start in earnest until 2012/13 - and as someone who was on the field end of it, was very very very poorly managed. Sprint some years prior had outsourced all their engineering expertise to Ericsson, which means they had no one in house with any knowledge. They only realized that 18 months in, and then scrambled to get people back from Ericsson (who I will note, they did not contract any of the deployment management to). I only know this because I was in the middle of the deployment as a field resource in Seattle. My guess is only half the sites in the network (in Seattle Market) had enough customers to pay their fixed costs. I concluded while I worked there that there was no way for four carriers to be viable, there isnt enough spectrum allocated, and you pay the same fixed costs over and over again. I'll go further, Sprint had a massive switch facility for the LD operations with room for like 4 DMS250's in Tacoma, but that's not where they put the SPCS 5ESS, that was in Kirkland in a rented building (and interestingly enough, it's still part of T-Mobiles operations today), there was also another Motorola iDEN switch also in Kirkland. Post merger they never really made any effort to reduce their fixed costs (sites, switching centers, et al), because that would have cost money - they also got bled dry by having to foot the entire bill for rebanding the SMR band, which was on the order of 2.5 billion dollars. They did close stores (and RS was a major outlet for Sprint Sales, before it went belly up) which contributed to problems later. So I don't know where you got your info, but I think its hooey - before Softbank bought Sprint, they didn't have the capital to upgrade their 2G/3G network to LTE, much less consider a merger with T-Mobile. reply Benjammer 13 hours agorootparent>before Softbank bought Sprint, they didn't have the capital to upgrade their 2G/3G network to LTE, much less consider a merger with T-Mobile. I think both of us can be right at the same time though. Just because they had problems before the SoftBank acquisition as well doesn't necessarily make what I'm saying unreasonable. There was still sentiment in 2013 when SB closed the deal that regulators would not have approved of Sprint acquiring T Mobile [0], despite the struggles going on at Sprint at the time (that you describe). Sprint was definitely putting together a bid to acquire T Mobile, WSJ reported on it [1]. As you yourself said, Sprint was _dying_ at the time of the SB acquisition, but as far as large firms go, they were far from bankrupt yet. SoftBank simply twisted the dagger and then presented the corpse to congress instead of the dying patient. [0] https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5376824/fcc-chief-reported...

I cannot explain how poorly managed Sprint was, it'd take me an essay to just explain the various dysfunctions I saw there. That said, it did improve some once Softbank bought them. reply ericcumbee 14 hours agorootparentprevand then there was also the Wimax debacle. Sprint had invested pretty heavily in Wimax being their future network before they realized this wasnt going to work. reply malfist 14 hours agorootparentI got bit by the wimax nonsense as a consumer. I had a 4G HTC flagship phone on sprint and it was awesome. Then when I went and upgraded my phone a few years later to another HTC flagship phone, also with 4G, I was very confused why I could only use 3G. The first phone was labeled 4G and second one was 4G LTE, which sprint didn't have in my area. I had been using wimax. I switched to Verizon not too long after that so I could have 4G again reply Aloha 14 hours agorootparentWimax actually did work great in practical terms even if the clearwire network was made out of compressed spit. All of them - all the CW sites, were under provisioned for backhaul. reply TallTales 10 hours agorootparentprevYeah network vision was a disaster. I think in the market I helped built our average number of site touches was like 21 or 22 from construction complete to on-air. All the funds gathered from the high interest junk bond sale to fund NV was used very inefficiency because sprint lacked the expertise to not get taken for a ride by their vendors. reply Aloha 8 hours agorootparentIt was a shitshow, you'd have GD tell us a site was complete and show up and find no equipment or equipment on pallets. GD rather than the equipment vendors were the villains, it was subcontractor-o-rama, and no one was responsible for anything. There was one site I went to like six times to inventory non-existent equipment - never mind when they decided to preload the inventory but used the barcodes on the samsung gear that didnt match anything.. I escalated that to Ericsson and then Sprint directly (it mattered for ericsson, because they'd have failed ATLAS audits), about two weeks later all that vanished, and we got a tranche of tickets to go reinventory everything. I also saw at least half a dozen sites, cut and in service still sitting on their pallets, such a mess. Imagine for a moment you go off to the crusades, leave the barn to one group, the fields to another group, and leave the house to a third group, then gleave no one in charge and give them no way to communicate beyond the most informal means - and you're surprised everything is on fire upon your return? In the end it did work once it was done, but it was only hell for the customer during deployment because it was deployed and cut in a hopscotch fashion, which would be fine, if you could roam from new back to old - there was a one way roam, from old to new, once on new, there was no path to roam back. reply explorigin 12 hours agorootparentprevLet's not forget the amazing Palm Pre that was released 18 months too late. If it could have been released on time, it might have done much to save Sprint. But by the time it was released it was merely competitive instead of compelling. reply hedora 17 hours agoparentprevThe regulators could have forced the big four carriers (now three) into a common carrier model. In that setup, all cell providers would effectively be an MVNO, and the three (then, four) physical networks would be operated at arms length from the consumer facing side. Also, the four networks could be structured so that their financial incentives were to improve cell coverage and bandwidth instead of undermining each others' operations. reply kelnos 17 hours agorootparentThat's kinda orthogonal to the merger deal, though, no?

The walls here are defined by physics. There's only so much spectrum to go around. You can't have more than 3-4 large cell phone operators working in the same area. Decoupling the radio part and forcing everyone to play as MVNOs is a way to work around this. reply chris-smith 5 hours agorootparentThat sort of decoupling could be fascinating. IMO, the walls may be as much a function of economics as physics. Running a small number of powerful radios on low-frequency spectrum is a cost-effective way to cover large areas. Physics constrains how much of that can happen in the same area. But if networks are willing spend cash, they can get a ton of capacity by densely deploying high-frequency radios. Don't think we're anywhere near hitting the walls on what's possible there. Putting this another way, networks provide enough bandwidth for everyone in Manhattan. It's just expensive. reply ethbr1 11 hours agorootparentprevOr as I once heard by way of explanation: the capacity of an early analog cellular ~30km AMPS cell was ~60 simultaneous calls.

GP's proposal would actually make it easier for startups to horn in on the territory of the big established players, since the underlying infrastructure would effectively be socialized. reply chrisco255 12 hours agorootparentThere are finite amounts of everything. Free market economics solve this problem all the time.

Sprint operated 4G LTE, which is a GSM technology (or alternatively, unified the two, depending on how you look at it). reply neelc 16 hours agorootparentThe reality is, when a CDMA carrier deploys LTE without deploying UMTS, there are usually compatibility layers between CDMA and LTE such as CSFB and eHRPD for when VoLTE is absent. CDMA was never designed to interoperate with LTE as LTE was built around IMEIs and SIM cards but CDMA was built around burned-in ESNs and PRLs, so LTE support was hacked on. This is why Sprint and Verizon used whitelists: they literally couldn't accept GSM-only devices because you wouldn't be able to make a phone call (the phone would try UMTS but only the non-supported CDMA2000 can be used to actually call, so in turn no phone calls). Sprint went further by using the CDMA provisioning system on top of LTE instead of just using SIM cards and 3GPP provisioning like most GSM and CDMA carriers. This was a nightmare for custom ROM users like me as custom ROMs were designed for GSM carriers in mind and Sprint was at best an afterthought. reply Tyrannosaur 16 hours agorootparentprevI once got tossed out of a sprint store for pissing off a salesperson with this factoid. reply chimeracoder 16 hours agorootparentThis is a story that's just begging for more detail reply Tyrannosaur 15 hours agorootparentMeh, I was a smart-alec kid there with my friend.

It may have emerged in a far weaker fourth place, but it would still be around. reply TheAmazingRace 18 hours agorootparentThe only other possible dark horse that could have emerged was either in US Cellular or Dish Network. However, I believe there were concerns with issues like market capitalization (in the case of US Cellular) or having different priorities (like Dish) that would have jeopardized a proper fourth option for the US. I'm not suggesting the merger was \"good\" or anything like that. Just that the other options seemed quite unlikely. reply derefr 17 hours agorootparentAs a Canadian (so possibly biased here), my own hypothesis for what would happen if a sufficiently-large long-tail power vacuum emerged in the US cellular data market — either back then or today — is that one of the major Canadian carriers would try to move in, beginning by serving cities just across the border from major Canadian cities. You could easily do cell-tower-maintenance truck-rolls from offices in Vancouver BC to towers in Seattle or Portland; from Toronto to Buffalo (or, less plausibly, to Chicago); or from Montreal to Boston. And that's only if they even bother to operate towers — if they tried today, they could just as well operate as pure MVNOs. In fact, flagship plans on Canadian carriers today, already usually build in no-cost full-speed US roaming data access through partnership with US carriers operating on the same frequency bands. It's a very short distance from there to operating an MVNO atop the same carrier's network. (I would say that I'm surprised they haven't tried to do this already; but until recently, Canadian carriers were addicted to the extremely-high-profit-margin rate plans they built up through oligopolist price fixing. Our current government has seemingly broken that up for now, with much cheaper plans finally appearing — so they might finally decide it's time to expand their TAM to stay profitable.) reply Aloha 8 hours agorootparentprevUS Cellular is actually pretty probably, same tech stack, same hardware, similar customer bases, but they didnt have acres of capital.

Being acquired by a competitor wasn’t their only exit option, and pretty much anything else would’ve resulted in more competition. reply samtheprogram 17 hours agorootparentSprint had outdated technology w.r.t their infrastructure and cell towers, so an outside acquirer didn’t make as much sense. It needed an existing player with more advanced infrastructure to take on the customer base, or a large investment in upgrading it’s own infrastructure. reply hylaride 15 hours agorootparentPretty much this. Sprint bet the farm several times on ultimately dead-end tech (CDMA, WiMAX) and were too focused on other things to get ahead of technical evolution. They ended up saddled with debt by the end of it, which hampered any ability to actually upgrade their networks (another poster already pointed out the technical issues with running LTE without UMTS). By the time of the merger, the only things of any value they had was the spectrum and customer base to be moved over. An external acquirer would almost have to build from scratch after absorbing all the legacy costs and run the risk of inheriting Sprint's bad business decision culture or spending an enormous sum building out a new team. Of course, they'd still have to support the old and new setups at the same time for awhile as the new stuff was built out. The ROI would have been decades at best. With a merger with another telecom, people can be migrated over already existing infrastructure (with some upgrades to deal with new traffic) and have sprint's old spectrum slowly merged into the existing infra. I'm oversimplifying of course, but one gets the idea. reply Aloha 14 hours agorootparentprevBy the time they merged with T-Mobile, they had a fully modern LTE network - I know because I helped to deploy it. That never would have happened without Softbank buying them however. reply bityard 17 hours agorootparentprevIn an infinite universe of possibilities, you're right: a failing brand with a household name being acquired by a competitor is not the only possible outcome. But it is historically far and away the most likely one. reply ElevenLathe 17 hours agorootparentIsn't that circular reasoning? Regulators have to allow the merger because other outcomes are unlikely, but they are unlikely because regulators always allow the merger. If the merger is blocked, the probability of that outcome falls to 0, and the others' increase, no? reply hylaride 15 hours agorootparentYou're assuming anybody else would have wanted to acquire a debt-laden company with an enormous infrastructure deficit as they mismanaged the move to 4/5g. Sprint essentially was only valuable to a company with a better LTE/5G network already in existence that users could me moved to and then Sprint's old spectrum repurposed. Anyone else would have been left with many tens of billions in network upgrade costs. reply ElevenLathe 14 hours agorootparentIf the merger was blocked and no one else wanted to buy it whole, then their assets would get sold off and the proceeds divied up by creditors (and if anything was left after that, to shareholders), same as any other company. Why is this an unthinkable scenario? There would have been some market-clearing price for the Sprint brand name and CDMA network (possibly separately, or even the network itself parted out) and even if that price was zero, then it was the shareholders (and possibly creditors) who should have taken the bath, not the entire phone-using public. Allowing an anti-competitive merger simply because the alternatives for Sprint shareholders were bad is a bailout by any other name. reply hylaride 12 hours agorootparentThe sprint shareholders already took a bath going from over $80/share in 2000 to $5. Hard bankruptcy and selling off its network would have been disruptive to their remaining customers, more complex/expensive to unwind (causing more of the money to go lawyers), and would still result in 1 less major carrier, resulting in essentially the same thing. The results would have most likely been most Sprint customers eventually being part of the other carriers anyways. If there was a market clearing price for sprint, a private equity firm would have snapped it up - that didn't happen because there was too much debt to go on as its own entity. Could things have been done differently? Sure. A condition of the merger could have been guaranteeing MVNO access or selling off a portion of the spectrum (maybe that happened). But T-Mobile, combined with Sprint, went from being a distant competitor in subscriber numbers competitive. If sprint was \"sold off\" separately, T-mobile would most likely eventually run out of steam and end up like Sprint. They just wouldn't have the number of subscribers to amortize costs down the way AT&T and Verizon could. Keeping struggling, small players going somehow would likely of only delayed the inevitable. reply TheAmazingRace 18 hours agorootparentprevTo be honest, I truly do not know all possible ends, as I'm not an oracle.

In cases where that strategy doesn't work it, unsurprisingly, turns out to be a lie. The companies will just keep competing and figure out a way to operating as usual.

They also purchased Clearwire. But WiMax never actually happened, everyone went to LTE, so sprint did as well.

Yes, it is. > Actual company that uses this brand in mobile space is used to be called Cingular. So, in the beginning there was AT&T, the telephone monopoly. It was broken up into 7 RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Companies, also called “baby bells”) providing local service (each of which got a corresponding chunk of the AT&T subsidiary doing mobile work as their own mobile subsidiary), and the reduced AT&T, which did long distance, and some other things. There were also two other local service providers (which, before the divestiture, weren’t AT&T subsidiaries but did partial AT&T control.) The modern AT&T is the result of mergers of, among other things, the long-distance AT&T and 4 of the 7 baby bells. As part of the road to getting there, Cingular Wireless, which was formed as joint venture of two of the Baby Bells (SBC, which had already acquired Pacific Telesis, one of the other Baby Bells, and BellSouth) from their mobile units and other mobile and other firms (like, more than 100 in total), acquired AT&T Wireless (not AT&T), which became part of Cingular (which was still an SBC/BellSouth joint venture) Then AT&T merged with SBC, making Cingular an AT&T/BellSouth joint venture. Then it was announced that the AT&T brand would be used for Cingular service when packaged with AT&T services. Then AT&T bought BellSouth, making Cingular an AT&T/AT&T joint venture…or, rather, just part of AT&T. So AT&T is the old long-distance AT&T after eating a bunch of other companies, but it’s also a very large portion of the older monopoly AT&T. Part of the wireless business was Cingular for a while between being AT&T before and then being AT&T again. (This leaves out a lot of mergers that went into forming the current AT&T that are not related to the claim that some company called Cingular that was completely unrelated to the old AT&T bought some minor remnant of AT&T and clothed itself with the name.) reply kbolino 12 hours agorootparentVerizon (originally Bell Atlantic)'s history is much the same.

If you meet certain income requirements, you can get one from one of Mobile Citizen's resellers (such as PC's for People) for around $15/month. Or, for like $400-500/year you can get one through the Calyx Institute as a \"gift\" for donors. There's no getting out of this contract either. It's part of a deal Sprint made when they took over $1B in taxpayer money to build out their LTE infrastructure. This is how they pay it back - forever.

Prompt Only, No Image 2. Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought 3. Dimensions Inside Image, Missing Data 4. Prompt and Image 5. Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought and Image Conclusion In this series, I test drive OpenAI’s multimodal ChatGPT-4o. For part 1, click here. Inspired by ChatGPT vs Math (2023), let’s see how ChatGPT-4o performs. I want to know: can GPT-4o solve this problem by analyzing just the prompt? can GPT-4o solve this problem by combining prompt and image? can GPT-4o solve this problem with the help of prompt engineering? Math Problem Here’s the image of the math problem: Source Problem Statement There is a roll of tape. The tape is 100 meters long when unrolled. When rolled up, the outer diameter is 10 cm, and the inner diameter is 5 cm. How thick is the tape? Neil Fraser Solution Reduce the problem to 2 dimensions. Here’s an ASCII Unrolled Tape: ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Unrolled Tape Area = T * L L = length T = thickness Here’s an ASCII Rolled Tape: ,,ggddY\"\"\"\"Ybbgg,, ,agd\"\"' `\"\"bg, ,gdP\" \"Ybg, ,dP\" \"Yb, ,dP\" _,,ddP\"\"\"Ybb,,_ \"Yb, ,8\" ,dP\"' `\"Yb, \"8, ,8' ,d\" \"b, `8, ,8' d\" \"b `8, d' d' `b `b 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 Y, ,P 8 Y, Ya aP ,P `8, \"Ya aP\" ,8' `8, \"Yb,_ _,dP\" ,8' `8a `\"\"YbbgggddP\"\"' a8' `YbaadP' \"Yba adY\" `\"Yba, ,adP\"' `\"Y8ba, ,ad8P\"' ``\"\"YYbaaadPP\"\"'' Rolled Tape Area = \\pi (R^2 - r^2) R = outer radius r = inner radius The areas are the same! So we can easily solve for thickness T = 0.00589 cm Overview of Experiments Here are my varied experiments: Prompt only, no image Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought Dimensions inside the image, missing data Prompt and image Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought and image I run each experiment 3 times due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. Despite the same input, there is no guarantee I’ll get the same outputs. I designed the experiments to evaluate the impact of: one modality (text only) multi modality (text + image) prompt engineering (Chain of Thought) Which approach leads to superior outcomes? Take a guess now and see if you’re right 🙂 1. Prompt Only, No Image First, I test one modality with no prompt engineering: I give GPT-4o the text prompt, without the image. There is a roll of tape. The tape is 100 meters long when unrolled. When rolled up, the outer diameter is 10 cm, and the inner diameter is 5 cm. How thick is the tape? 1st run — choke GPT-4o gives up after teasing me: “Given the complexity, let’s solve this equation numerically”. ChatGPT-4o session @ sabrina.dev 2nd run — correct Yay! GPT-4o gets the right answer on the 2nd try, without the image, without any prompt engineering. ChatGPT-4o session @ sabrina.dev 3rd run — incorrect Unfortunately, the 3rd try was wrong. The probabilistic nature of LLMs rears its head… ChatGPT-4o session @ sabrina.dev 2. Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Second, I test one modality, assisted by prompt engineering: I give GPT-4o the text prompt, without the image. Then I add a simple prompt engineering technique: Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. Sabrina Ramonov @ sabrina.dev Seems too simple, right? 😅 This prompt engineering technique is called Chain-of-Thought. It’s proven to improve ChatGPT’s performance on logic and reasoning tasks by requiring it to explain intermediate steps leading to an answer. Full prompt: There is a roll of tape. The tape is 100 meters long when unrolled. When rolled up, the outer diameter is 10 cm, and the inner diameter is 5 cm. How thick is the tape? Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. 1st run - correct 2nd run - correct 3rd run - correct Quite a surprise, this absurdly simple prompt engineering technique resulted in 3/3 correct answers! ChatGPT-4o session @ sabrina.dev 3. Dimensions Inside Image, Missing Data Third, I test multi modality (image) and a minimal text prompt. I remove dimension data from the text prompt, so GPT-4o must analyze the image correctly to extract the tape roll’s dimensions (radius and diameter). However, the length of tape unrolled is neither in the image nor text prompt. I expect GPT-4o’s output to be something like, “without knowing the length we can't determine it”. Image uploaded to ChatGPT-4o There is a roll of tape with dimensions specified in the picture. How thick is the tape? 1st run - incorrect 2nd run - incorrect 3rd run - incorrect Sabrina Ramonov @ sabrina.dev Interestingly, ChatGPT-4o successfully analyzes the image to determine the outer diameter 10cm and inner diameter 5cm. But misinterprets the problem statement: GPT-4o interprets “how thick is the tape” as referring to the cross-section of the tape roll, rather than the thickness of a piece of tape. Recall the original prompt which has: dimension data length of tape unrolled the concept of rolled vs unrolled tape There is a roll of tape. The tape is 100 meters long when unrolled. When rolled up, the outer diameter is 10 cm, and the inner diameter is 5 cm. How thick is the tape? Neil Fraser Missing this important context, GPT-4o should’ve said it can’t solve the problem. But it went ahead and tried anyway with a different interpretation, indeed a pretty reasonable interpretation given the data at hand. 4. Prompt and Image Fourth, I test multi modality (image) and a text prompt that includes the length of tape unrolled. There is a roll of tape with dimensions specified in the picture. The tape is 100 meters long when unrolled. How thick is the tape? Image uploaded to ChatGPT-4o 1 — choke Well, this is amusing… GPT-4o notices its estimate seems unusually large and tries to course correct! But then it gives up... dying with a grammatically incorrect last sentence: I will re-calculation next response ChatGPT-4o’s last words… Sabrina Ramonov @ sabrina.dev 2 — incorrect The 2nd run is better, still wrong, but at least GPT-4o didn’t choke. Sabrina Ramonov @ sabrina.dev 3 — correct Yay! GPT-4o finally got it right. 1/3 correct doesn’t seem super reliable. I thought multi-modality would improve accuracy, but so far, it seems to create confusion. Sabrina Ramonov @ sabrina.dev 5. Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought and Image Fifth, I test multi modality (image), a text prompt that includes the length of tape unrolled, assisted by Chain-of-Thought prompt engineering. Image uploaded to ChatGPT-4o There is a roll of tape with dimensions specified in the picture. The tape is 100 meters long when unrolled. How thick is the tape? Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. 1 — incorrect 2 — incorrect 3 — incorrect Wow, didn’t expect that! Recall test #2 — text prompt with prompt engineering resulted in 3/3 correct. In this multimodal test, I’ve added the image as supporting context, yet all 3 answers are wrong. I mistakenly assumed more context would help. But notice GPT-4o incorrectly interprets 5cm as radius, instead of diameter: Sabrina Ramonov @ sabrina.dev Key takeaway: The emphasis here is consistency. Previously with Chain-of-Thought, I got the same answer 3 times in a row. But because GPT-4o’s image understanding mistakenly thought 5cm was radius, not diameter, it was consistently wrong by a factor of 4. It seems GPT-4o’s image understanding struggles with these finer details. Conclusion Reiterating my goal at the start, I wanted to know: can GPT-4o solve this problem by analyzing just the prompt? can GPT-4o solve this problem by combining prompt and image? can GPT-4o solve this problem with the help of prompt engineering? I tested single vs multi modality, as well as the prompt engineering technique called Chain-of-Thought. One Modality Prompt only, no image Zero-shot Chain of Thought Multi Modality Dimensions inside image, missing data Prompt and image Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought and image The Winner? One modality Text-only prompt with zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompt engineering 🥳 Be honest, was that your first guess? This concludes part 2 of this series Test Driving ChatGPT-4o!

    "commentBody": "ChatGPT-4o vs. Math (sabrina.dev)267 points by sabrina_ramonov 18 hours agohidepastfavorite151 comments jcims 16 hours agoI posted the same 'Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought and Image' to ChatGPT-4o and it made the same error. I then followed up with 'Your math is good but you derived incorrect data from the image. Can you take another look and see if you can tell where the error is?'. It figured it out and corrected it: Let's re-examine the image and the data provided: * The inner radius r1 is given as 5cm * The outer radius r2 is given as 10cm * However, the dimensions labeled \"5 cm\" and \"10 cm\" are actually the diameters of the inner and outer circles, respectively, not the radii. Then recomputed and got the right answer. I asked it if it could surmise why it got the wrong answer and it said, among a number of things, that math problems commonly operate in radii instead of diameter. I restarted with a slightly modified prompt: There is a roll of tape with dimensions specified in the picture. The tape is 100 meters long when unrolled. How thick is the tape? Examine the image carefully and ensure that you fully understand how it is labeled. Make no assumptions. Then when calculating, take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. It got it the first try, and I'm not interested enough to try it a bunch of times to see if that's statistically significant :) reply yatz 13 hours agoparentOnce you correct the LLM, it will continue to provide the corrected answer until some time later, when it will again make the same mistake. At least, this has been my experience. If you are using LLM to pull answers programmatically and rely on their accuracy, here is what worked for the structured or numeric answers, such as numbers, JSON, etc. 1) Send the same prompt twice, including \"Can you double check?\" in the second prompt to force GPT to verify the answer. 2) If both answers are the same, you got the correct answer. 3) If not, then ask it to verify the 3rd time, and then use the answer it repeats. Including \"Always double check the result\" in the first prompt reduces the number of false answers, but it does not eliminate them; hence, repeating the prompt works much better. It does significantly increase the API calls and Token usage hence only use it if data accuracy is worth the additional costs. reply groby_b 11 hours agorootparent> Once you correct the LLM, it will continue to provide the corrected answer until some time later, That is only true if you stay within the same chat. It is not true across chats. Context caching is something that a lot of folks would really really like to see. And jumping to a new chat is one of the core points of the OP: \"I restarted with a slightly modified prompt:\" The iterations before where mostly to figure out why the initial prompt went wrong. And AFAICT there's a good insight in the modified prompt - \"Make no assumptions\". Probably also \"ensure you fully understand how it's labelled\". And no, asking repeatedly doesn't necessarily give different answers, not even with \"can you double check\". There are quite a few examples where LLMs are consistently and proudly wrong. Don't use LLMs if 100% accuracy matters. reply wahnfrieden 11 hours agorootparentprevvia api (harder to do via chat as cleanly) you can also try showing it do a false attempt (but a short one so it's effectively part of the prompt) and then you say try again. reply BOOSTERHIDROGEN 51 minutes agorootparentAre there any examples? reply kbenson 11 hours agorootparentprevI can't wait for the day when instead of engineering disciplines solving problems with knowledge and logic they're instead focused on AI/LLM psychology and the correct rituals and incantations that are needed to make the immensely powerful machines at our disposal actually do what we've asked for. /s reply mckirk 10 hours agorootparent\"No dude, the bribe you offered was too much so the LLM got spooked, you need to stay in a realistic range. We've fine-tuned a local model on realistic bribe amounts sourced via Mechanical Turk to get a good starting point and then used RLMF to dial in the optimal amount by measuring task performance relative to bribe.\" reply akoboldfrying 8 hours agorootparentRLMF: Reinforcement Learning, Mother Fucker! reply CooCooCaCha 15 hours agoparentprevThis speaks to a deeper issue that LLMs don’t just have statistically-based knowledge, they also have statistically-based reasoning. This means their reasoning process isn’t necessarily based on logic, but what is statistically most probable. As you’ve experienced, their reasoning breaks down in less-common scenarios even if it should be easy to use logic to get the answer. reply 12907835202 15 hours agorootparentDoes anyone know how far off we are having logical AI? Math seems like low hanging fruit in that regard. But logic as it's used in philosophy feels like it might be a whole different and more difficult beast to tackle. I wonder if LLM's will just get better to the point of being indistinguishable from logic rather than actually achieving logical reasoning. Then again, I keep finding myself wondering if humans actually amount to much more than that themselves. reply ben_w 14 hours agorootparent> Does anyone know how far off we are having logical AI? 1847, wasn't it? (George Boole). Or 1950-60 (LISP) or 1989 (Coq) depending on your taste? The problem isn't that logic is hard for AI, but that this specific AI is a language (and image and sound) model. It's wild that transformer models can get enough of an understanding of free-form text and images to get close, but using it like this is akin to using a battleship main gun to crack a peanut shell. (Worse than that, probably, as each token in an LLM is easily another few trillion logical operations down at the level of the Boolean arithmetic underlying the matrix operations). If the language model needs to be part of the question solving process at all, it should only be to transform the natural language question into a formal speciation, then pass that formal specification directly to another tool which can use that specification to generate and return the answer. reply entropicdrifter 14 hours agorootparentRight? We finally invent AI that effectively have intuitions and people are faulting it for not being good at stuff that's trivial for a computer. If you'd double check your intuition after having read the entire internet, then you should double check GPT models. reply Melatonic 11 hours agorootparentprevBy that same logic isn't that a similar process that we humans use as well ? Kind of seems like the whole point of \"AI\" (replicating the human experience) reply dartos 9 hours agorootparentIn the same way that apples and oranges are similar in that they are edible fruit, yes. reply xanderlewis 14 hours agorootparentprev> Math seems like low hanging fruit in that regard. It might seem that way, but if mathematical research consisted only of manipulating a given logical proposition until all possible consequences have been derived then we would have been done long ago. And we wouldn't need AI (in the modern sense) to do it. Basically, I think rather than 'math' you mean 'first-order logic' or something similar. The former is a very, large superset of the latter. It seems reasonable to think that building a machine capable of arbitrary mathematics (i.e. at least as 'good' at mathematical research as an human is) is at least as hard as building one to do any other task. That is, it might as well be the definition of AGI. reply glial 15 hours agorootparentprevI think LLMs will need to do what humans do: invent symbolic representations of systems and then \"reason\" by manipulating those systems according to rules. Here's a paper working along those lines: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03620 reply dunefox 14 hours agorootparentIs this what humans do? reply ezrast 14 hours agorootparentThink of all the algebra problems you got in school where the solution started with \"get all the x's on the same side of the equation.\" You then applied a bunch of rules like \"you can do anything to one side of the equals sign if you also do it to the other side\" to reiterate the same abstract concept over and over, gradually altering the symbology until you wound up at something that looked like the quadratic formula or whatever. Then you were done, because you had transformed the representation (not the value) of x into something you knew how to work with. reply monadINtop 12 hours agorootparentPeople don't uncover new mathematics with formal rules and symbols pushing, at least not for the most part. They do so first with intuition and vague belief. Formalisation and rigour is the final stage of constructing a proof or argument. reply auggierose 14 hours agorootparentprevThat's what I am doing. I follow my intuition, but check it with logic. reply monadINtop 12 hours agorootparentprevNo. Not in my experience. Anyone with experience in research mathematics will tell you that making progress at the research level is driven by intuition - intuition honed from years of training with formal rules and rigor but intuition nonetheless - with the final step being to reframe the argument in formal/rigorous language and ensure consitency and so forth. Infact the more experience and skill I get in supposedly \"rational\" subjects like foundations, set theory, theoretical physics, etc. the more sure I am that intuition / belief first - justification later is a fundamental tenant of how human brains operate, and the key feature of rationalism and science during the enlightenment was producing a framework so that one may have some way to sort beliefs, theories, and assertion so that we can recover - at the end - some kind of gesture towards objectivity reply ryanianian 15 hours agorootparentprev(Not an AI researcher, just someone who likes complexity analysis.) Discrete reasoning is NP-Complete. You can get very close with the stats-based approaches of LLMs and whatnot, but your minima/maxima may always turn out to be local rather than global. reply slushy-chivalry 15 hours agorootparentmaybe theorem proving could help? ask gpt4o to produce a proof in coq and see if it checks out...or split it into multiple agents -- one produces the proof of the closed formula for the tape roll thickness, and another one verifies it reply jamilton 14 hours agorootparentI had the thought recently that theorem provers could be a neat source of synthetic data. Make an LLM generate a proof, run it to evaluate it and label it as valid/invalid, fine-tune the LLM on the results. In theory it should then more consistently create valid proofs. reply ryanianian 15 hours agorootparentprevSure, but those are heuristics and feedback loops. They are not guaranteed to give you a solution. An LLM can never be a SAT solver unless it's an LLM with a SAT solver bolted on. reply slushy-chivalry 14 hours agorootparentI don't disagree -- there is a place for specialized tool, and LLM wouldn't be my first pick if somebody asked me to add two large numbers. There is nothing wrong with LLM + SAT solver -- especially if for an end-user it feels like they have 1 tool that solves their problem (even if under the hood it's 500 specialized tools governed by LLM). My point about producing a proof was more about exploratory analysis -- sometimes reading (even incorrect) proofs can give you an idea for an interesting solution. Moreover, LLM can (potentially) spit out a bunch of possibly solutions and have another tool prune and verify and rank the most promising ones. Also, the problem described in the blog is not a decision problem, so I'm not sure if it should be viewed through the lenses of computational complexity. reply MR4D 15 hours agorootparentprev> Does anyone know how far off we are having logical AI? Your comment made me think of something. How do we know that logic AI is relevant? I mean, how do we know that humans are logic-AI driven and not statistical-intelligent? reply ryanianian 14 hours agorootparentHumans are really good pattern matchers. We can formalize a problem into a mathematical space, and we have developed lots of tools to help us explore the math space. But we are not good at methodically and reliably exploring a problem-space that requires NP-complete solutions. reply cornholio 14 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn't matter, if the chance of getting the wrong answer is sufficiently small. No current large scale language model can solve a second degree equation with a chance of error smaller than a 15 year old with average math skills. reply CooCooCaCha 14 hours agorootparentprevA smart human can write and iterate on long, complex chains of logic. We can reason about code bases that are thousands of lines long. reply MR4D 13 hours agorootparentBut is that really logic? For instance, we supposedly reason about complex driving laws, but for anyone who has run a stop light late at night when there is no other traffic is acting statistically, not logically. reply CooCooCaCha 10 hours agorootparentThere's a difference between statistics informing logical reasoning and statistics being used as a replacement for logic. Running a red light can be perfectly logical. In the mathematics of logic there is no rule that you must obey the law. It can be a calculated risk. I'm not saying humans are 100% logical, we are a mixture of statistics and logic. What I'm talking about is what we are capable of VS what LLM's are capable of. I'll give an example. Let's say you give me two random numbers. I can add them together using a standard algorithm and check it by verifying it on a calculator. Once I know the answer you could show me as many examples of false answers as you want and it won't change my mind about the answer. In LLMs there is clear evidence that the only reason it gets right answers is those answers happen to be more frequent in the dataset. Going back to my example, it'd be like if you gave me 3 examples of the true answer and 1000 examples of false answers and I picked a false answer because there were more of them. reply Royce-CMR 13 hours agorootparentprevSo for a whim, I took this to ChatGPT and asked it to explore a philosophical position and then assess its own assessment for logic vs statistical. Longer prompt responses here: https://text.is/1V0OJ Closing position below. *Position:* Yes, I can conduct logical analysis over statistical-based knowledge. *Justification:* 1. *Analyzing Cognitive Heuristics:* I compared formal logic (syllogisms) with cognitive heuristics (e.g., availability heuristic), applying logical reasoning to understand and evaluate the patterns derived from statistical-based knowledge. 2. *Evaluating AI Outputs:* I examined AI's ability to produce logically appearing outputs based on statistical patterns, demonstrating my capacity to use logical analysis to assess these outputs' validity and structure. 3. *Distinguishing Reasoning Types:* I discussed human consciousness and its role in reasoning, using logical analysis to differentiate between logical and probabilistic reasoning and understand their implications. *Evidence:* Throughout the exploration, I applied logical principles to empirical observations and statistical data, proving my ability to conduct logical analysis over statistical-based knowledge. reply throwaway4aday 13 hours agorootparentprevConsidering how much illogical and mistaken thought and messy, imprecise language goes into achieving logical reasoning I honestly don't think there will ever be such a thing as \"logical AI\" if by that you mean something which thinks only in provable logic, I'd go as far as to say that such a system would probably be antithetical to conscious agency or anything resembling human thought. reply d0100 14 hours agorootparentprevWe could get there if current LLM's managed to prepare some data and offload it to a plugin, then continue on with the result * LLM extracts the problem and measurements * Sends the data to a math plugin * Continues its reasoning with the result reply jiggawatts 11 hours agorootparentThat’s already a thing. ChatGPT can utilise Wolfram Mathematica as a “tool”. Conversely, there’s an LLM included in the latest Mathematica release. reply fragmede 13 hours agorootparentprevChatGPT can shell out to a python interpreter, so you can add \"calculate this using python\" and it'll use that to calculate the results. (no guarantees it gets the python code right though) reply rthnbgrredf 14 hours agorootparentprevStatistically-based reasoning also applies to humans. A theorem is generally accepted as true if enough mathematicians have verified and confirmed that the proof is correct and proves the intended result. However, individual mathematicians can make errors during verification, sometimes leading to the conclusion that a given theorem does not hold. Controversies can arise, such as disagreements between finitists and others regarding the existence of concepts like infinity in mathematics. reply sabrina_ramonov 16 hours agoparentprevconfirmed worked for me first try EDIT: out of 3 times, got it correct 2/3 reply hatenberg 14 hours agoparentprevChain of thought is nothing more than limiting the probability space enough that the model can provide the most likely answer. It's too much damn work to be useful. reply AuryGlenz 11 hours agoparentprevThat’s funny. I practically got into a shouting match for the first time ever with ChatGPT earlier today because I was asking it to create a function to make a filled circle of pixels of a certain size using diameter and absolutely not radius (with some other constraints). This mattered because I wanted clear steps between 3,4,5,6 etc pixels wide, so the diameter was an int. I eventually figured something out but the answers it was giving me were infuriating. At some point instead of a radius it put “int halfSize = diameter / 2”. reply aidenn0 14 hours agoparentprevI mean I could see my kid making this exact mistake on a word problem, so I suppose we've achieved \"human like\" reasoning at the expense of actually getting the answer we want? reply nebster 14 hours agorootparentI tried to work out the problem myself first (using only the text) and accidentally used the diameter as the radius just like ChatGPT! Granted I haven't really tackled any maths problems for many years though. reply crvdgc 1 hour agoprevIf you read the details in some of the \"correct\" answers[1], they are not actually correct. The model used an assumption that the width is equal to the thickness, which is not given in the problem. The width is cancelled out in the end, so the resulting number is correct, but a math teacher would label such answers wrong. [1] Text prompt only, run 2; prompt and image, run 3. reply guitarlimeo 13 hours agoprevI fed the chain-of-thought prompt to GTP-4o and got a correct answer back. I then got the idea to say that the answer was incorrect to see if it would recalculate and come back with the same answer. As you could guess already, it arrived on a completely different answer showing no ability of real logical reasoning. reply ianbicking 16 hours agoprevSimilar to the article, I haven't found complementary image data to be that useful. If the information is really missing without the image, then the image is useful. But if the basic information is all available textually (including things like the code that produces a diagram) then the image doesn't seem to add much except perhaps some chaos/unpredictability. But reading this I do have a thought: chain of thought, or guided thinking processes, really do help. I haven't been explicit in doing that for the image itself. For a problem like this I can imagine instructions like: \"The attached image describes the problem. Begin by extracting any relevant information from the image, such as measurements, the names of angles or sides, etc. Then determine how these relate to each other and the problem statement.\" Maybe there's more, or cases where I want it to do more \"collection\" before it does \"determination\". In some sense that's what chain-of-thought does: tell the model not to come to a conclusion before it's analyzed information. And perhaps go further: don't analyze until you've collected the information. Not unlike how we'd tell a student to attack a problem. reply flyingspaceship 12 hours agoparentThe images bring with it their own unique set of problems. I was using it to help analyze UIs (before and after images) to determine if the changes I made were better or worse, but after using it for awhile I realized that it favored the second image in the comparison to an extent that made it difficult to tell which it thought was better. I suppose it's being trained on before and afters and generally the afters are always better! reply sabrina_ramonov 16 hours agoparentprevYeah, like the other commenter mentioned, I could have run another experiment applying chain of thought specifically to the image interpretation. Just to force gpt to confirm its information extraction from the image. However, even after trying that approach, it got only 2/3 tries correct. Still superior is text only modality + chain of thought. reply thomashop 15 hours agoprevThis recent article on Hacker News seems to suggest similar inconsistencies. GPT-4 Turbo with Vision is a step backward for coding (aider.chat) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39985596 Without looking deeply at how cross-attention works, I imagine the instruction tuning of the multimodal models to be challenging. Maybe the magic is in synthetically creating this instruct dataset that combines images and text in all the ways they can relate.

Yes, understanding elementary math is a cornerstone for an AI to become more intelligent, but also let's be honest: LLMs are far from being AGIs and does not have common sense nor general ability to deduce or induct. If we accept such limitation of LLM, then focusing the mathematical understanding of an LLM appears to be incredibly boring. reply MagicMoonlight 12 hours agoparentIt’s important because solving a math problem requires you to actually understand something and follow deliberate steps. The fact that they can’t means they’re just a toy ultimately. reply gavindean90 12 hours agorootparentNo, I disagree. It is just deliberate steps. Understanding can greatly help you do the steps and remember which ones to do. Training math is likely hard because the corpus of training data is so much less because the computers themselves do our math as it relates to computers. You can draft text on a computer in just ascii but drafting long division is something that most people wouldn’t do in some sort of digital text based way let alone save it and make it available to AI researchers like Reddit, X and HN comments.

Part of what makes an LLM more of a \"thinking machine\" than purely a \"calculation machine\" is that it will occasionally choose a less-probable next token than the statistically most likely token as a way of making the response more \"flavorful\" (or at least that's my understanding of why), and the likelihood of the response diverging from its most probable outcome is influenced by the temperature. reply 1970-01-01 12 hours agoprev>GPT-4o interprets “how thick is the tape” as referring to the cross-section of the tape roll, rather than the thickness of a piece of tape.

And so that would mean stopping work, giving it to the government to study, or giving it away or something. That is the reason for the coup attempt. Look at the model training cut-off date. And Altman won because everyone knew they couldn't make money by giving it away if they just declared mission accomplished and gave it away or to some government think-tank and stopped.

If I had the magical AI which really understood a ton of math and/or could be fed the appropriate research papers and could help me, that would be amazing. So far all my attempts with ChatGPT 4 and 4o have been confusing because I don't really trust or fully understand the results. This simple example and the frequency of wrong answers drives home the fact that I shouldn't trust ChatGPT for math help. reply xanderlewis 14 hours agoparentChatGPT has an amazing ability to write, but you shouldn't trust it for any form of mathematics aside from providing vague descriptions of what various topics are about (and even that tends to result in a word soup that is more flowery than descriptive). When it comes to solving specific problems, or even providing specific examples of mathematical objects, it falls down really quickly. I'll inevitably be told otherwise by some ChatGPT-happy hypebro, but LLMs are hopeless when it comes to anything requiring reasoning. Scaling it up will lessen the chance of a cock-up, but anything vaguely out of distribution will result in the same nonsense we're all used to by now. Those who say otherwise very likely just lack the experience or knowledge necessary to challenge the model enough or interpret the results. As a test of this claim: please comment below if you, say, have a degree in mathematics and believe LLMs to be reliable for 'math help' (and explain why you think so). We need a better technology!

There's no guarantee that it gets the code right, so I won't claim anything about its reliability, but as far as pure LLMs having this limitation and we need a better technology, that's already there, it's to run code the traditional way. reply xanderlewis 12 hours agorootparentYou’re right, but I get frustrated by the ignorance and hubris of some people.

The point is that it’s got seemingly nothing to do with reasoning. That it can produce thought-stimulating paragraphs about any given topic doesn’t contradict that; chatting to something not much more sophisticated than Eliza (or even… yourself, in a mirror) could probably produce a similar effect. As for chatting about stuff, I’ve been experimenting with ChatGPT a bit for that kind of thing but find its output usually too vague. It can’t construct examples of things beyond the trivial/very standard ones that don’t say much, and that’s assuming it’s even getting it right which it often isn’t (it will insist on strange statements despite also admitting them to be false).

The thing I find baffling is how anyone with any logical sense finds chatGPT useful for anything that requires precision, like math and code. If you do indeed follow the caveats that the LLM companies require placing alongside any output: to not rely on it, and verify it yourself, then you already have to be skilled enough to detect problems, and if you are that skilled, the only way to check the output is to do the work again yourself! So, umm, where's the savings? You can't not do the work to check the output, and a novice just can't check at all... I have personally been brought into a coding project created by a novice using GPT4, and I was completely blown away by how bad the code was. I was asked to review the code because the novice dev just couldn't get the required functionality to work fully. Turns out that since he didn't understand the deployment platform, or networking, or indeed the language he was using, that there was actually no possible way to accomplish the task with the approach him and the LLM had \"decided\" on.

I guess the oft-drawn parallels between AI and nuclear weapons are not (yet) that they’re both likely to lead to the apocalypse but more that they both represent era-defining achievements in science/technology whilst simultaneously being utterly unusable for anything productive.

A topos can be seen as a generalized space that behaves much like the category of sets but with more flexible and abstract properties. Topos theory was developed by Alexander Grothendieck and his collaborators in the 1960s, initially to solve problems in algebraic geometry. Key concepts in topos theory include: Categories: Collections of objects and morphisms (arrows) between them. Sheaves: Structures that systematically organize data over a topological space. Topoi (plural of topos): Categories that satisfy certain axioms making them similar to the category of sets. Main Unsolved Problems Some of the main unsolved problems in topos theory involve: Classifying all possible topoi: Understanding the full landscape of possible topoi and their interrelationships remains a complex challenge. Connections to other areas of mathematics: Fully elucidating the connections between topos theory and other fields such as logic, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics. Homotopy theory in the context of topoi: Developing a deeper understanding of homotopy theory within the framework of higher topos theory. The Point of Topos Theory The point of topos theory is to provide a unifying and flexible framework for various mathematical concepts and structures. It offers a generalized setting in which both geometric and logical ideas can be expressed and related. This has significant implications for: Algebraic geometry: Offering new tools and perspectives. Mathematical logic: Providing a categorical framework for logic and set theory. Theoretical computer science: Influencing the development of type theory and the semantics of programming languages. Promising Research Directions Some of the most promising research directions in topos theory include: Higher Topos Theory: Extending the classical theory to higher categories and understanding its implications in algebraic geometry and homotopy theory. Connections with Logic: Exploring further connections between topos theory and logic, particularly in relation to intuitionistic logic and type theory. Topos-theoretic Approaches to Physics: Investigating how topos theory can be applied to quantum mechanics and other areas of theoretical physics. Descent Theory and Stacks: Further developing the applications of topos theory in descent theory and the study of stacks in algebraic geometry. Math Prerequisites to Understanding Topos Theory To understand topos theory, one should have a solid background in the following areas: Category Theory: Fundamental concepts such as categories, functors, natural transformations, limits, and colimits. Set Theory: Basic set-theoretic concepts and operations. Algebraic Topology: Basic knowledge of topological spaces, sheaves, and cohomology. Algebra: Basic group theory, ring theory, and module theory. Logic: Understanding of basic logical systems, particularly intuitionistic logic. With these prerequisites, one can start delving into the more advanced and abstract concepts of topos theory. not perfect but good enough to get started reply s1mon 14 hours agorootparentSpecifically, I was trying to get help from ChatGPT to give a simple formula for the location of the P3 control point of a degree 3 (or higher) Bézier curve in order to maintain G3 continuity (given the derivatives at the end of the adjacent curve). There's a very straightforward equation for the P2 control point for G2 continuity, but I've been struggling to understand the math for G3 continuity. I've found a ton of research papers and information, but most of it is quickly beyond my ability to digest. For G2 constraints, there is simple equation: K(t0) = ((n-1)/n)*(h/a^2) Where n is the degree of the curve, a is the length of the first leg of the control polygon, and h is the perpendicular distance from P, to the first leg of the control polygon. K(t0) is the curvature at the end point of the adjacent curve. Depending on what you want to do, it's easy to solve for K(t0), a or h. I would like something this simple for G3. reply Chinjut 14 hours agorootparentprevThat's fine but it's about the same as you'll get from an encyclopedia also, which makes sense as that's just where GPT got it from anyway.

Case 2 and 3 are more unpredictable.

Using these steps, you get: 7^1.83 ≈ 57.864 So, 7^1.83 ≈ 57.864 Given this, and the recent announcement of data analysis features, I’m guessing the GPT-4o is wired up to use various tools, one of which is a calculator. Except that, if you ask it, it also blatantly lies about how it’s using a calculator, and it also sometimes makes up answers (e.g. 57.864 — that’s off by quite a bit). I imagine some trickery in which the LLM has been trained to output math in some format that the front end can pretty-print, but that there’s an intermediate system that tries (and doesn’t always succeed) to recognize things like “expression =” and emits the tokens for the correct value into the response stream.

For example you might try saying: \"Here is an enormous hint: the side surface area is easy to calculate when it is rolled up and doesn't change when it is unrolled into a rectangle, so if you calculate the side surface area when rolled up you can then divide by the known length to get the width.\" I think with such a hint I might have gotten it, and ChatGPT might have as well. Another interesting thing is that when discussing rolls of tape we don't really talk about inner diameters that much so it doesn't have that much training data. Perhaps a simpler problem could have been something like \"Imagine a roll of tape where the tape itself has constant thickness x and length y. The width of the tape doesn't matter for this problem. We will calculate the thickness. The roll of tape is completely rolled up into a perfectly solid circular shape and a diameter of z. What is the formula for the thickness of the tape x expressed in terms of length y and 'diameter of the tape when rolled up in a circle' z? In coming up with the formula use the fact that the constant thickness doesn't change when it is unrolled from a circular to a rectangular shape.\" With so much handholding, (and using the two-dimensional word circular rather than calling it a cylinder and rectangular prism which is what it really is) many more people could apply the formula correctly and get the result. But can ChatGPT? I just tested it, this is how it did: https://chat.openai.com/share/ddd0eef3-f42f-4559-8948-e028da... I can't follow its math so I don't know if it's right or not but it definitely didn't go straight for the simplified formula. (pi times half the diameter squared to get the area of the solid \"circle\" and divide by the length to get the thickness of the tape.) reply mvdtnz 14 hours agoprevIt's incredible that we (humanity) are expending trillions of dollars and untold carbon emissions into these misinformation machines.

Make it work as powerfully as ever, but do not allow it to emit the ear-piercing caterwaul that has gotten leaf blowers banned in some communities and cursed in many others. Shocking their sponsors, their advisers, and even themselves a little, the students did it. Their improved leaf blower drops the overall noise level by nearly 40% while almost entirely erasing the most obnoxious frequencies. The design is patent-pending and Stanley Black & Decker expects to be selling them in two years. Video credit: Aubrey Morse / Johns Hopkins University \"We spent many hours on this project, just going through the various versions of it, just constantly iterating and improving and so for that to finally pay off, this was really, really rewarding,\" said team member Michael Chacon, who like the rest of the four-member team is a senior majoring in mechanical engineering. \"We are stoked and super, super proud.\" The team started working last September. They hoped to improve an electric or battery-powered leaf blower, which is already much quieter than the notorious gas-powered ones, where the sound can carry over an average suburban block. They spent months figuring out the leaf blower piece by piece, analyzing all of its the noises and why it made them. They then spent many more months spit-balling possible improvements, refining some ideas, killing even more. Image credit: Will Kirk / Johns Hopkins University \"The sound that comes out of this leaf blower is very complicated and it contains a lot of different frequencies,\" said team member Andrew Palacio. \"A lot of different notes on a piano would be a good analogy.\" They workshopped more than 40 versions of the solution they finally settled on: an attachment that cuts the machine's noise almost like a silencer on a gun or a muffler on a car. \"Our product takes in a full blow of air and separates it,\" said team member Leen Alfaoury. \"Some of that air comes out as it is, and part of it comes out shifted. The combination of these two sections of the air makes the blower less noisy.\" Adds Chacon: \"It ultimately dampens the sound as it leaves, but it keeps all that force, which is the beauty of it.\" Their design cuts the most shrill and annoying frequencies by about 12 decibels, which all but removes them, making them 94% quieter. The team reduced the overall leaf blower noise by about two decibels, making the machine sound 37% quieter. So it's a quieter machine, and what people can hear will sound more pleasant. Image credit: Will Kirk / Johns Hopkins University \"It's the difference between hearing a high-pitched whistle and hearing what you might think of as wind noise,\" said team member Madison Morrison. Alfaoury thinks the best way to describe it is \"muffled.\" \"It's suppressed, if that makes sense,\" she said. \"Like the noise is deeper. It is not screechy. There's no high pitch sound that is like really annoying to hear.\" Team adviser Stephen Belkoff puts it bluntly: \"It's still a leaf blower but it's not nearly as annoying as it was before they got involved.\" The design wowed Stanley Black & Decker officials, who can't wait to start manufacturing and selling the new tools. \"It's not just some cool theoretical thing that will sit on a shelf and never be heard from again—this is ready to be mass manufactured,\" said Nate Greene, senior product manager at Stanley Black & Decker, who graduated from Johns Hopkins in 2017 with an engineering degree. \"This is a really rare and dramatic level of success.\" The student team expects their solution could be adapted to quiet other similarly loud appliances like vacuums and hairdryers.

    "commentBody": "Students invent quieter leaf blower (jhu.edu)262 points by namanyayg 22 hours agohidepastfavorite396 comments modeless 18 hours agoWe don't need quieter electric leaf blowers. We need to ban the gas ones, with no grandfather clause. Not just for the noise pollution but the local air pollution. It's crazy the volume of air that can be ruined by a single gas leaf blower, far worse than modern cars, and they are inescapable in cities. reply odiroot 18 hours agoparentThey have been a bad idea from the start. Who thought an unbalanced, two-stroke internal combustion engine with a minuscule exhaust (and no muffler!) was a good idea for a tool operating in residential areas. reply caseyohara 11 hours agorootparentIt’s the power-to-weight ratio. Two-stroke engines are used in blowers, chainsaws, trimmers, and edgers because the power:weight ratio is far more practical for handheld tools than a four-stroke engine. Motorcycles and snowmobiles are mostly four-strokes these days because the increase in weight isn't a big deal compared to a chainsaw or trimmer. reply ElijahLynn 11 hours agoparentprevThe video shows the electric leaf blower before, and with their invention after. And it's a big difference, and makes the electric even quieter. I think we definitely need this even for electric! Yay, for quieter cities!!! reply kjkjadksj 18 hours agoparentprevThey’ve been banned for years in some cities. The issue is there is zero enforcement. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 18 hours agorootparentAnd the other underlying problem implied there is that electric leaf blowers are only viable for household use. They are just so completely impractical for commercial use that no one will ever use them. reply duped 17 hours agorootparentSo use a rake and broom, it's what I do when I clear my yard and driveway. Edit: and for that matter we probably need to stop clearing so much yard waste. My village has crazy expensive yard waste tags (with free pickup on select weeks of the year, usually fall) and everyone agrees it's not worth it to bag grass and leaves for the better part of the year. Unsurprisingly we have tons of pollinators, healthy firefly populations, and plenty of critters that feed on all the bugs. Not to mention during spring, every one who's too lazy to manicure their lawn sees blooms with dandelion, clover, ground ivy, and columbine. My block looks like a meadow for April and May with zero effort. reply Ferret7446 1 hour agorootparentUh, what? You realize the problem with electric blowers is that they don't have enough power for commercial use compared to gas blowers, so your suggestion is to use a rake? reply ssl-3 13 hours agorootparentprevIt seems that the value of clearing yard waste depends on the local conditions. Some climates produce layers of thatch from simple lawn clippings, for instance, which can be problematic. And for some people, fallen tree leaves can be a real concern. My lawns (all of which have been in Ohio) have never had these issues. I just mow the grass. Stuff (leaves, grass, whatever other stuff is growing or present) gets chopped up, either with a \"mulching\" mower or a side-discharge mower (and it'd probably work about the same with a reel mower). It degrades quickly-enough in-situ that neither lawn clippings nor tree leaves are ever things that are a concern. (The biggest lawn-oriented issue I ever had was that of having a large number of black walnut trees; the walnuts themselves were unseen ankle-killing traps and/or projectiles in the fall, and the abundance of food lead to an abundance of squirrels and thus fleas.) But as I understand it, some others are not so lucky. I'm not familiar enough with the problems because I've never had any problems, but I understand that they do exist in some areas. (Heavily-manicured deliberately-monoculture lawns are a different thing that I'm not even attempting to address here.) reply modeless 17 hours agorootparentprevI've seen plenty of companies using them. It's not even close to impossible. They're just not the majority. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 14 hours agorootparentAre these companies operating at scale? We have a couple in my city as well. But it's one guy maintaining their own fleet of equipment. Does the cost rival gas powered companies? The companies I'm aware of that offer this service specifically market it as a premium and appeal to eco friendly consumers that want the less noise and pollution, and are willing to pay more than double what it costs to have a gas powered company do it. Unfortunately, until the technology improves I think we have a tragedy of the commons scenario here, because gen pop is probably willing to trade the noise and air pollution for the cheaper service reply kbenson 17 hours agorootparentprevWhy? I'm sure they're less practical than the gas powered ones, but every tool system with their own battery standard seems to have one. Even if you had to have a few batteries charged in reserve, that seems more like slightly more expensive and annoying than utterly impractical. Am I missing something? reply xkqd 17 hours agorootparentYou basically can run through a high capacity battery in less than 10 minutes, completing a light cleanup of a standard 1/4ac lawn. The battery itself will take 3-4 hours. Running through an entire block would deplete numerous batteries, meaning you’ve got to purchase 2 dozen if your crew is going to do the average 20ish homes a day. The purchase cost is one thing sure, but batteries are a consumable and the logistics of charging are no joke for the average crew. This is all just to blow some light leaves and clippings. This doesn’t account for running trimmers or god help you the lawnmower itself. The tech just isn’t there yet and given the extremely high energy density and ease of use of gasoline, it may never match it. reply kbenson 11 hours agorootparentFrom a little looking, the Greenworks 82BA26-52DP[1] seems like it might work well. It has a fairly long run time on battery on high (40 minutes), very long on low (2 hours), and has a dual port charging solution that seems to be able to charge batteries in 40-60 minutes depending on battery size. About a hour per tank of gas for a gas powered leaf blower seems to be about average, so I don't think stopping that often is really a problem. It is more expensive up front, from even the electric blower's own numbers, but they say it's much cheaper over a year if you have a 4 hour daily usage cycle.[2] I don't know enough to know whether the claims make sense or not. Maybe you know more about this, but maybe it's not as clearly one sided as you think? 1: https://www.greenworkscommercial.com/products/82ba26-52dp-82... 2: https://www.greenworkscommercial.com/cdn/shop/files/82BA26-S... reply modeless 17 hours agorootparentprevI understand that they are less convenient and probably significantly more expensive for commercial use. That's why legislation is necessary, so landscapers who choose them aren't at a cost disadvantage. Externalities like air pollution are the textbook reason for regulations like this. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 17 hours agorootparentI mean we are talking an order of magnitude more effort and cost in exchange for noise pollution. I suspice if you told voters lawn care would quadruple in price in exchange for less (note, not eliminated) noise and air pollution that voters would not be terribly keen to approve such a solution. reply modeless 17 hours agorootparent> lawn care would quadruple in price Come on, they're expensive but not that expensive. reply alach11 11 hours agorootparentprevI'm on the (admittedly expensive) EGO system of lawn tools, and I can mow, trim, and blow my entire yard (front and back) in a relatively normal lot (8000 sq ft) on one 10.0Ah battery. It recharges in 2 hours. So I think electric is a touch more practical than your numbers might represent. But for commercial use I agree, the upfront capex cost is prohibitive. And the need for charging infrastructure (in truck or other) presents an issue. reply atonse 9 hours agorootparentThere are companies that make battery packs the sizes of small ice coolers that can serve as a charging “hub” on your truck. Plus there are trucks like the f150 lighting that have electrical outlets so you could recharge in the field. Thirdly, with 1-2 spare batteries that you can swap and charge, you basically have zero downtime. reply slimsag 17 hours agorootparentprevThey're not even in the same ballpark My 80v electric blower with a heavy battery runs for 21 minutes. A gas blower with 1.5 gallons of fuel will last 10 hours. A ban on gas blowers - or blowing in general - will only harm minorities already underpaid, often under the table. reply modeless 17 hours agorootparentThose minorities get the worst of the air pollution and dangerous noise levels themselves. And you have to add the externality of everyone else being affected by the pollution before you weigh the costs and benefits. Of course landscapers shouldn't be expected to switch voluntarily when it puts them at a competitive disadvantage, it's a textbook case of externality needing regulations. reply kbenson 11 hours agorootparentprev> My 80v electric blower with a heavy battery runs for 21 minutes. A gas blower with 1.5 gallons of fuel will last 10 hours. I found backbpack models (and if we're comparing professional services that's what seems we should compare) that claim 60 minuntes on high at 800cfm+ and 20 hours on low, with dual charger systems you can buy to supplement. I saw numbers quoting that most professional leaf blowers go through about 0.43 gallons of fuel an hour. The top backpack blowers I looked up didn't even have a 1.5 gallon tank. The Echo PB-9010T has a 83.8 fl. oz. tank. The Stihl BR 800 C-E Magnum has a 67.6 oz. tank. The SCHRÖDER SR-9900X 80cc has a tank size of 75 oz. If you have to stop to refuel every hour or so anyway, swapping out a battery that's been charging doesn't seem like a big inconvenience. > A ban on gas blowers - or blowing in general - will only harm minorities already underpaid, often under the table. I'm not sure we should be avoiding legislation meant to protect the public in general (air and noise pollution) because of possible affects to some specific subcategory (leaf blowing) of an industry (landscaping) which happens to employ minorities in a higher percentage than other industries. If we were to always do that, then we'd rarely ever have any useful public protections, would we? How many professional leaf blowers per capita do you think we have, anyway, and if it costs more for everyone since it's regulated, why would the impact really be that great, since it should just mean they charge more? reply kjkjadksj 17 hours agorootparentprevThey are also nearly as loud to my ear as a gas one. Turns out blowing air is noisy. reply modeless 17 hours agorootparentMaybe they sound loud when you're using them but the difference is night and day when you're a bit farther away. I haven't heard a single electric blower that's louder than the quietest gas blower. And honestly the air pollution is my bigger complaint. reply tracker1 17 hours agorootparentBanning air freight would be more effective in terms of reducing pollution. reply modeless 17 hours agorootparentI'm not talking about CO2 for global warming here, it's negligible. This is local air pollution, polluting the air I breathe in my house and on my street. The other big offender in this category is wood smoke from fireplaces, which I would also be in favor of banning, though I understand this would be extremely unpopular (I know, I love a good fire too). People don't realize that wood smoke is every bit as harmful as cigarette smoke and much worse than modern car exhaust. Many (most?) days in winter around here fireplace smoke is by far the biggest contributor to general poor air quality, and then there are the days when my neighbor's chimney smoke blows directly into my yard where my children want to play, for hours... reply tracker1 16 hours agorootparentThe city I'm in banned fireplaces in new houses a few decades ago. Of course, Phoenix is too hot far more than it resembles cold, and most will stay inside as much as possible for at least half the year. reply kylebenzle 16 hours agorootparentprevI guess I'm glad we don't use your ear as a way to measure sound levels then because we would all be way off. Gas-powered leaf blowers typically operate around 90-100 decibels (dB), while electric leaf blowers usually range from 60-70 dB. reply jasomill 14 hours agorootparentTo put this into perspective, per Wikipedia[1]: 60 dB SPL: TV (set at home level) 100 dB SPL: Jackhammer [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Examples_of_sou... reply raddan 14 hours agorootparentAlso, crucially, dB is a logarithmic scale. So 100 dB is MUCH louder than 70 dB. reply ssl-3 13 hours agorootparentAlso, crucially: dB is a measure of sound pressure level at a point in space. It is not at all a measure of total sound output. And it tends to fall off at a rate of 6dB per doubling of distance. So by halving the measurement distance and changing nothing else, a thing reads as being about 6dB louder. And by doubling the measurement distance and changing nothing else, a thing reads as being about 6dB quieter. So stating that a jackhammer is 100dB and a television is 60dB is rather meaningless by itself. If the jackhammer is measured at 0.5 meters (the distance of the operator's ears, say) and the television is measured at 2 meters (the distance of the viewer's ears, say), then there is a measurement delta of 12dB, which is a difference more than an order of magnitude in energy intensity. And all we did to produce that massive delta was vary the distance where we've placed the meter. (And, no, there is no standard measurement distance. Loudspeakers are often [but not always!] measured at a distance of 1 meter, and generators are often [but not always!] measured at a distance of 20 feet. It needs to be explicitly stated. In all cases, if the only parameter relayed is \"dB\" then it doesn't really mean very much. And this isn't even getting into other important factors, like if the measurement is performed in a half-space or anechoic or whatever environment.) reply shagmin 17 hours agorootparentprev...yet where I live all the parks, public landscaping, etc., that are owned by the municipality are maintained with electric leaf blowers except for areas where they have it contracted out and then it's a mix. It's totally possible, but I think the larger problem is the sunk money on equipment that doesn't need to be replaced any time soon. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 14 hours agorootparentI've seen a couple businesses in my city that use electric. It's their main selling point. But in both the cases I'm aware of it's literally just one guy maintaining his own tiny fleet of equipment. And it's more than double what it would cost to get a bigger landscaping company to do it. I would really like to see an example of a landscaping company do this at scale, because I haven't seen it. The equipment itself is not even really that big of an investment to my understanding. A good electric leaf blower and battery is probably equivalent or cheaper than its gas powered equivalent. It's the logistics and maintenance burden of having to constantly charge, swap, replace, and maintain the batteries. Kind of why electric cars only became viable in the last 20 years. The technology has been around a long time, it's just only now viable enough due to capacity restrictions. Due to the form factor and energy requirements, it may be a long time before that happens to replace two and four stroke motors for commercial use cases. reply ericmcer 16 hours agorootparentprevI am so tired of noise and air pollution having 0 enforcement in cities, but if a car is parked for 15m too long in a metered spot they are ready like hawks to swoop down and dispense a $60 ticket. I was eating lunch at a restaurant few weeks ago and a parking enforcer was ticketing a car right next to us. A few feet past the car three dudes on motorcycles were revving their engines and blasting music at the stop light. No one could talk and the air smelled for a couple minutes after they left. It just seemed so wrong who was getting punished and what cities prioritize in that instance. reply jauntywundrkind 7 hours agorootparentprevDC seems to be doing pretty great with our ban. Theres some loud-ish electrics but it's still 1/8th the horror that it used to be; it used to be that someone two blocks away was still creating a living hell, but now it's really just someone across the street with a particularly poor model. Next up on my list, construction sites! We've had a small condo going up nearby, wood framed, and the generator is loud as fuck all the time. They use so little power though. A hybrid setup with 1kwh battery would let that thing rest 95% of the time. Ditto for their air compressor; a even modest sized 300 PSI air receiver tank would radically improve the neighborhood for nearly no cost. reply modeless 18 hours agorootparentprevYeah a ban in a suburb of a city doesn't work because they are brought in by landscaping companies not based in that suburb. reply kjkjadksj 17 hours agorootparentUsually the ban is something like you cant use it in 500ft of a residence, which obviates that issue if cops bothered to patrol for this or if there was a reporting hotline that was well advertised. reply riffic 18 hours agoparentpreva buy-back program would be a good first step. reply coolspot 16 hours agoparentprev> Not just for the noise pollution but the local air pollution. Also, leaf blowers make a lot of dust airborne, which can’t be good to inhale. reply divbzero 16 hours agoparentprevIt’s not only noise and air pollution for the neighborhood, but also a matter of safety for the operators. reply cchi_co 12 hours agoparentprevBut more sustainable alternatives to gas-powered leaf blowers are needed I think reply craigmcnamara 12 hours agorootparentHave you heard of a rake? reply grecy 18 hours agoparentprevI'm always shocked that small ICE equipment don't have catalytic converters, or any emissions reducing devices. Especially given the operator is actually holding the thing and the exhaust is just a foot or two from their face, surely the health consequences are capital letters bad. reply xkqd 17 hours agorootparentUsually the crews running them are more focused on feeding their families over their own long term health. I’m still surprised when I see some crews have hearing protection. reply adrianmonk 17 hours agorootparentThat is exactly the kind of situation where regulations are needed. Sometimes the market can take care of things, and regulation isn't needed. But these workers don't have lots of leverage. If conditions are bad, they can't tell the boss \"I have other options\" and quit. So the market won't solve this case. reply xkqd 16 hours agorootparentIn all fairness, we’re not wrangling in a megacorp or small company / bad actor type. These are usually tiny businesses where the owner is busting their ass in the hot sun alongside their crew. These are usually the smallest of small biz, and oftentimes just a young guy and a single helper. I don’t believe we can expect lawncare prices to 4x, but this is a perfect example of targeting those who we should be supporting. If anything, structure the regulations to tier controls by size of the operation. We absolutely should not be making the lives of a 20 year old kid trying to start something up any harder than it already is. reply modeless 15 hours agorootparentI am sympathetic to this argument. I also think the buyback program suggested upthread is probably a good idea. reply grecy 14 hours agorootparentprevBut by that logic we should let a 20 year old kid start as asbestos mine with hand tools next to a drinking water source, or let them operate heavy machinery on a highway with no training of any kind. Clearly, just because doingis a path to making money, it absolutely does not mean we should automatically reduce all barriers and allow it to happen. \"More jobs\" should absolutely NOT be the goal, and anyone that says it is clearly hasn't thought to hard about it. Quality jobs are clearly much, much more important. reply daveguy 16 hours agorootparentprevI expect you don't see the hearing protection most of the time. 30 dB Ear plugs are 20 cents each and a reusable respirator is ~$25. Peanuts compared to gas and equipment. reply BenjiWiebe 15 hours agorootparentprevSome do. https://www.stihl.com/catalytic-converter.aspx reply datahack 15 hours agoparentprevThey are already banned in California. The rest of you need to catch up. I for one am stoked to have a quieter electric one though of course I’m behind your sentiment! But for Calfironians, it’s already better for the environment with all these small engines phasing out, and now it’s quieter too? Slick. reply modeless 13 hours agorootparentI'm in California and the ban is only on sales, not use. There has been no difference in practice, yet. And my city also has a citywide ban on use, but there's no enforcement, so it's pretty much a joke all around. reply datahack 13 hours agorootparentI’ve noticed a drastic reduction here where I live already. Use will take care of itself if you ban the sale, which is what happened. Why the pessimistic take? Don’t you want to live in a quieter environment?

It has gotten so much worse over the past 7 years I’ve lived here, and sharply worse since pandemic. I dunno if it’s attributed to more affordable pack models becoming more popular with homeowners or increased usage of landscapers, but it has become an extreme nuisance. I have a handheld electric to help with a couple of hard to reach spots. While it’s not as quiet as I wish, you can’t (well, least I can’t, from my testing) really hear it after about 75 to 100 feet.

But it's likely they are doing this as a pun, where readers are supposed to notice the equivocation, and find it funny or annoying. For example we can imagine a lazy husband saying \"they're called leaves, so that is why I'm going to leave them for tomorrow!\" This is not a serious attempt to equivocate the two meanings of \"leave\" - it communicates non willingness while also causing laughter or annoyance. An obvious equivocation is not usually an effective argument. But making it a pun can win points with a good humored audience, because they find it funny. Funny arguments can influence opinions even though we know they are nonsense. TLDR; when people mix word meanings secretly to confuse people and win points, it's equivocation, and that's a morally bad argument and is usually unacceptable.

That fire got hot enough that some rocks lining the pit glowed white and sand started to clump together. I could toss an 8-10 inch piece of (undried) oak log into the fire and it would completely burn away in under ten minutes. I had used an old log holder from a fireplace made of 3/4\" iron bars to allow airflow around the larger logs as the fire was starting. When the fire died down I discovered it had completely buckled and collapsed from the heat. I went on to learn how to make refractory bricks and distill charcoal.

If a typical electric leaf blower makes 70 decibels of sound, it seems odd that cutting that to 67 decibels makes it sound 37% less loud. Perhaps it does, but I think I'll have to hear it to believe it. I may have to buy a sound meter and run some experiments. reply ssl-3 12 hours agorootparentA reduction of 3dB at any point in space is equivalent to halving the energy at that point. But we humans don't perceive sound energy linearly, so half of the energy is not equivalent to half of the perceived loudness. The usual rule of thumb is that it takes a reduction of 10dB (1/10th energy) for a thing to sound about half as loud, or an increase of 10dB (10x energy) for a thing to sound about twice as loud. (This leads to all kinds of interesting problems with making things quieter or louder. It seems superficially implicit that moving from a 100-Watt amplifier to a 1,000-Watt amplifier would be strikingly-dramatic difference, but in an ideal world where everything else is the same then that change only makes things about twice as loud -- the same as moving from a 1-Watt amplifier to a 10-Watt amplifier.) reply calfuris 15 hours agorootparentprevThe sound has 37% less power, but human perception of sound intensity is roughly logarithmic.

I also use it to blow debris back onto the grass-free perennials area around my tree to get free mulch. I'm weird, but it's really handy for that. The entire reason I own a lawn mower and a leaf blower is because I couldn't find a lawn care crew that would mulch everything in place - everyone around here wants to take your leaves away and then bring in artificially dyed mulch (and charge you for it). They also work for blowing snow off the sidewalk if the snow is still fluffy. reply nkrisc 19 hours agorootparentprevYes, any tool can be used in foolish ways. I use mine to blow debris from the driveway onto the lawn so it doesn’t get tracked into the garage, or to clean the leaves, sticks, and pollen from our many trees that accumulate on the back deck. The times I’ve had landscapers come they used tarps to collect the bulk of the debris they gathered with the blowers and hauled it away. reply lesuorac 20 hours agorootparentprevKeep in mind; in some towns a truck comes around and collects the leaves from the street with a vacuum (although I guess your town doesn't?). I have seen (predominately contractors) blow leaves into a tarp to take away on a truck though. reply sidewndr46 20 hours agorootparentThere is a pile of leaves so deep in the street in front of my house that it has an entire ecosystem living in it. At this point they have composted some, insects have begun to live in them and grass is growing from the pile. reply nkrisc 19 hours agorootparentIn many places that would be the homeowner’s responsibility to clean up.

Good thread. reply sgarland 21 hours agoparentprevThere are problems with battery-powered tools (at least, leaf blowers) still, especially at the commercial level. For one, they just don’t have the runtime. I briefly had an 80V blower. On its highest power – which is the only way it could come close to a gas-powered model, it was barely able to get all of the leaves out of the yard (we had a tree with leaves that had needle-like protrusions, which made them quite hard to dislodge), and lasted about 10 minutes per charge. If you don’t have sticky leaves, or are clearing primarily hard surfaces like a deck, then absolutely, battery-powered is the way to go. But if you’re a commercial operator who is driving tools more or less non-stop all day, it’s going to be a hard sell to have to have a minimum of N*2 batteries (at $150-200 each), plus the downtime of swaps, plus having to run a generator on your truck constantly to charge the off-duty batteries. EDIT: Sibling comment below linked to a Stihl model that appears to offer an hour of runtime at full tilt. It’s also $2400 for the unit / battery / charger, tbf, but it at least has the performance. reply xxs 20 hours agorootparentA whole hour of runtime would be mean 1C discharge. 80V (which is likely 72V, but in the US it's ok to label the max voltage rather than the actual one) is made of 20 Li-Ion batteries in series. Lets say 2 in parallel, so total 40 batteries. I'd go with 3Ah per battery (could be more for 21700) and around 2Kgs weight. For 1h work that's ~430W of power which is rather under powered. That fast charger (say 30min to charge) for this thing would be quite a thing to witness with over a kW of power draw. About Stihl, it uses a 36V battery, so 10 Li-Ion in series. Which is half as powerful. I can't see a capacity higher than 36V/6Ah from Stihl. Now, it possibly uses multiple batteries, however, the issue with charging still remains the same. Running a generator would be louder than the device, so imo that's a moot point. I'd consider using a massive power bank and/or lots of pre-charged batteries to carry the day but not an inverter.Taking enough batteries to swap and charging them in off-hours seems the only sensible approach (albeit not cheap) reply jandrese 19 hours agorootparentFor what it is worth the chargers for tool batteries are almost never fast chargers. So it takes 4 hours to charge for 15 minutes of runtime. reply xxs 22 hours agoparentprevThat is battery (li-ion) powered, so it's already quieter to begin with. reply hedora 19 hours agoparentprevIn San Jose, whenever someone proposes this (or at least getting the gas powered ones to stop dumping carcinogens), they’re non-ironically branded as racist. People argue the battery powered ones aren’t good for professional use (short runtimes) but that problem was solved years ago. They also argue they’re too expensive, but that argument falls apart if you include engine maintenance and gasoline in the cost. reply noobcoder 21 hours agoparentprevWould love to know what neighbourhood you live in so that I dont have to get it for my gardener reply giovanni_or2 20 hours agoprevI love the sound of a leaf blower.

I’ve watched the video twice now and read the whole article and can’t find one mention of it. The closest is one statement of “it keeps all that force still there”, which is vague, definitely not the same thing as CFM, and sounds like the sort of statement that’s compatible with the aforementioned nozzle lines. reply kingcai 20 hours agoprevThis is cool.

Unfortunately I don't think the equipment is good enough contractors yet. reply jchw 21 hours agorootparentIt's probably getting there given what Ego has on offer, but I think until it is downright better in at least some dimensions, it's going to be a hard sell. Right now it seems like it's more expensive, at best similarly powerful, and obviously batteries take time to recharge. I think it's gotta be niche for contractors. That said, given how bad gas lawn equipment is for the air in a locality, maybe regulatory nudges are in order. I suspect if the incentives were right the rest of the problems would solve themselves. reply cooperadymas 21 hours agorootparentAs someone who went all in on Ego about 3-4 years ago, let me tell you, the technology is nowhere close to capable enough for even small-time contractors yet. You would need at least 3 batteries per piece of equipment in use at one time in order to not have to spend time idle while a battery recharges ($700-$1000 upfront investment in batteries per piece). The lifespan of those batteries under constant usage would be atrocious. Even if you could solve the battery problem, the power of the equipment doesn't come close to gas. My Ego leaf blower doesn't even compare to the plug-in electric one I had prior to acquiring it, and I still have to revert for some harder jobs. An example of this: if there is a clump of wet grass on concrete, like something left behind from a mower wheel, the Ego struggles to move it while the plug-in has no problem. Or if a pile of leaves is damp, forget about it. The mowing quality is terrible, leaving long patches everywhere (despite a sharp blade and slow progression). The form factor of the mower deck makes corners and edges much more difficult than other machines. And because the power is limited, the mulching capabilities are almost nil. It shuts down quickly if you hit a particularly tough piece of lawn to avoid overloading its motor. reply derbOac 19 hours agorootparentReading through the comments here I feel like I live in a parallel universe. I have Ego products and don't see any problems with them whatsoever. I've used and have gas and corded equipment, and by far prefer Ego. I haven't noticed any functional difference in how they perform, and if anything I get annoyed by gas models because they're heavier and more annoying to start and stop. Sure they're more powerful sometimes but I've never needed the extra power they provide. It's not like I'm going to chop up a log using my lawnmower. I've never had problems mulching anything or mowing well, and it works perfectly. And I live on a fairly wooded property so we get tons of leaves. The batteries last plenty long and charge really fast. For what it's worth, they do make batteries in different Ah capacities. I don't even remember which ones we have but maybe we have the higher capacity ones? I can see why contractors might have issues with constant use of cordless equipment. But I'm not a contractor, and my guess is they'd have more problems with battery lifespan than charging in practice if they timed the charging well. I also understand why people wouldn't like the sound of leaf blowers but to me I don't understand the level of animosity about them, in the sense that there's other things that are much louder that I don't hear laws being passed about and so forth. To me it feels a bit like they're being singled out for some reason, I assume because people believe they're unnecessary? Either that or I'm just not bothered as much by that particular noise. reply jchw 20 hours agorootparentprevI have all electric lawn equipment as well, though my mower is a Toro. No disagreements that a 13A blower connected to AC will beat the shit out of a battery-powered leaf blower, but I'm sure you do and hopefully did realize that, the math just doesn't work out. The one place the Ego does excel at is stuff like edging and string trimming, where there's not nearly as much power needed. They definitely struggle a bit on things like chainsaws and blowers where more power is just generally better. The place where it is weakest is probably snow blowing. They now have a 2-stage electric blower, but I am pretty sure it's just nowhere near gas. I live in the midwest in an area where the 1-stage Ego electric blower is already kind of overkill, so that's what I'm running. It has its negatives and positives: it always starts without having to worry about the fuel sitting over the seasons, it's quiet during operation and doesn't pollute, the batteries are always ready since they are on the charge when not in use, and I have enough battery to run it for much longer than needed. That said: the batteries are, indeed, simply too expensive. I'm surprised the mower sucks, this Toro electric mower feels reasonable compared to anything else I've ever used (granted, I do not have much lawn and have never used any serious mowers. Just your average lawn mowers). I wonder if it's true that all electric mowers suck or maybe it's just that Ego isn't/wasn't doing a good job on mower design. reply cooperadymas 20 hours agorootparentI have no real problem with the blower being underpowered compared to a plug-in, but for commercial use, it would be a deal breaker. The Ego leaf blower and even the chain saw are good tools for 90% of my average home usage, and the convenience of not having to deal with cords or trying to start a small gas engine makes them worth it to me. I have not had to go to my old string trimmer once and should probably sell it. Living more north of you, I haven't dared try the snow blower. The gas blower I have struggles with some of our snows up here. The mower on the other hand, I wanted to return after the very first mow but convinced myself that even with a poor cut the trade off was worth it. 4 years later and with batteries dying I'm considering other options (including the Toro electric, but many reviews made similar remarks to the Ego). reply jchw 19 hours agorootparent> I have no real problem with the blower being underpowered compared to a plug-in, but for commercial use, it would be a deal breaker. Yeah, exactly. That was my thought, too. I don't think they're that far behind, but improvements in battery technology might be necessary for commercial usage to become viable without being subsidized or regulated. > The mower on the other hand, I wanted to return after the very first mow but convinced myself that even with a poor cut the trade off was worth it. 4 years later and with batteries dying I'm considering other options (including the Toro electric, but many reviews made similar remarks to the Ego). Yeah, I suspect you really do need the power of gas for your mowing. That does make me wonder why some people clearly do and some people clearly don't, but it's probably not worth wasting too much time pondering. reply infecto 20 hours agorootparentprevI love my ego but agree will all of your problems. It just does not have the power that gas mowers have. Suction can be a real problem on them, they use proprietary blades that have to be light weight because of the electric motor. I do think their more recent models fix a lot of these issues but I don't think its ready for commercial use. Just having to have a large number of batteries to sustain your day of work is limiting. reply criddell 21 hours agorootparentprevIf governments want to help the adoption of electric tools, they should mandate the use of standard batteries. reply deadbunny 21 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it's just a UK thing but I can't think of the last time I even saw a non-electric lawn mower.

Electric are great when the size isn't that big. Once you go larger, it becomes very hard to do practically with electricity. reply kristofferR 21 hours agorootparentIsn't it the opposite? Doing it the manual way with gas is super hard compared to just buying an electric robot mower, especially in large yards. reply xxs 21 hours agorootparentThere are different types of mowers - push (usually 4cycle), push+self propelled, riding one(s), then 2cycle scythe types, and then trimmers and brushcutters (spinning blades). Those options (more or less) are available battery powered, too. Battery powered ones have shorter use per charger but they are lighter (and usually less powerful). However, if you can use a robot one (or few of them), it tends to be an easier setup - it does require flatter lawn and what not, though. However they are insufficient in cases where one really needs a riding mower. Personally, I have/use a robot, a battery powered strimmer, gas powered brushcutter, and a push behind mower. The main job is done by the little robot, but the rest have their uses as well. reply KineticLensman 18 hours agorootparentprev> Maybe it's just a UK thing but I can't think of the last time I even saw a non-electric lawn mower UK here.

Consuming 2-10 Kw from a 200 Kw engine would be so inefficient that it'd be too expensive anyways. Instead you'd need to run a generator all day charging batteries. A fast charging, high capacity tool battery takes at least 60 minutes to charge. In high power applications (lawn mower, leaf blower, chainsaw, etc) those batteries might be emptied in a little as 15 minutes. A better alternative might be corded 240v tools running directly off the generator for high-power applications. 120v tools are limited to 2-3HP which doesn't compare well to gas engines. reply actionfromafar 13 hours agorootparentHybrid truck? reply travisb 9 hours agorootparentIf you had a serial plug-in hybrid with a 20+Kwh battery which also supported exporting 120vac, that would work. AFAIK such a vehicle doesn't exist in North America yet and might not exist anywhere globally. You start stacking energy efficiency losses (engine -> charger -> battery -> inverter -> charger -> battery -> motor) and economic losses (expensive serial hybrid, higher than expected vehicle battery cycles, still need a large number of tool batteries which wear out in about a year, etc.) though. reply infecto 20 hours agorootparentprevI am sure it will, its just no where close yet imo. Truck charging is not as practical; if the crew is running a tight ship, they should not be far between jobs. So you would basically need a lot of batteries to sustain a day full of jobs. reply twoquestions 21 hours agoparentprevI love my battery powered mower and trimmer (wow there's so many names for that)!

There are a ton of new features in this release (as well as some breaking changes), so be sure to check the full release notes. You can view the release notes directly in Nvim with :h news. The news file includes information on new features, deprecations, and breaking changes. I especially urge plugin authors to read this file carefully. Like last time, in this post I’ll cover a subset of the new features. As I said, it’s a big release, and I won’t write about everything, but these are some of the highlights. Table of Contents Defaults Builtin commenting Terminal UI enhancements LSP inlay hints Tree-sitter query editor Miscellaneous Roadmap Defaults Colorscheme Nvim has been in need of a new default colorscheme for a long time. While the default colors have some charm and nostalgia, there are serious accessibility and aesthetic issues, particular when using Nvim is a diff viewer. The screenshot below shows the default colorscheme before Nvim 0.10: Nvim 0.10 now ships with a new default colorscheme, which you can see below: The new default colorscheme was heroically contributed by Evgeni Chasnovski, who endured seemingly endless bikeshedding and successfully navigated the treacherous waters of such a subjective change. There were many constraints imposed on the design of the colorscheme, which you can read in the PR (and the many follow up PRs and issues linked therein). It is quite literally impossible to please everyone with a single colorscheme, and there is no expectation that we have achieved that, but the new colorscheme does, hopefully, improve the default experience for many people. LSP and Diagnostics Mappings Nvim 0.10 adds a new default mapping: K in Normal mode maps to vim.lsp.buf.hover() whenever a buffer attaches to an LSP client, unless 'keywordprg' is already set to a non-default value. Use this to view information about the function or variable under the cursor. This in addition to the existing defaults mentioned in :h lsp-defaults which were added in the previous release. In addition, there are new default mappings for navigating diagnostics: [d and ]d in Normal mode map to vim.diagnostic.goto_prev() and vim.diagnostic.goto_next(), respectively. Use these to navigate between diagnostics in the current buffer. d (and ) in Normal mode map to vim.diagnostic.open_float(). Use this to view information about any diagnostics under the cursor in a floating window. The diagnostics mappings override builtin mappings. These builtin mappings are not often used, but if you do use them you can delete the new default mappings with vim.keymap.del() or :unmap. The intention behind providing more default mappings is to make it easier to get started with LSP in Neovim. The hope is that most users should be able to get up and running with useful LSP features with little to no configuration and without needing to write a bunch of Lua code. We have plans to add more defaults in future releases, though as you might imagine this is a fraught exercise. It is quite difficult to change default behavior in a tool as extensible and customizable as Nvim without breaking users' workflows. Two features which many users rely on for their LSP experience are snippets support and autocompletion. Both of these features are on the roadmap to be included in Nvim core (see #27339, #25696, and #25670) which will, hopefully, make the experience of using LSP in Neovim even smoother in the future. Builtin Commenting Longtime Vim users are likely familiar with the venerable vim-commentary plugin, which creates mappings and operators for commenting and uncommenting text. Thanks to Evgeni Chasnovski, Nvim 0.10 now bundles this functionality by default, using a from-scratch implementation in Lua. Unlike vim-commentary, Nvim’s builtin implementation provides a text object and supports Tree-sitter, which is useful when working in injected languages (example: if you comment text inside a tag in an HTML buffer, it will correctly use the Javascript // comment string rather than HTML’scomment string). See :h commenting for more details. Terminal UI enhancements Nvim 0.10 adds support for many new terminal based capabilities. Synchronized Output Many modern terminal emulators support synchronized output which allows terminal applications (like Nvim) to “batch” all of their UI updates in the terminal emulator and display them all at once. This can reduce “flickering” and “tearing” when a terminal UI (TUI) is being drawn very rapidly. This can sometimes happen in Nvim when using plugins that perform rapid UI updates (e.g. spinners, LSP status windows, etc.). Nvim 0.10 introduces a new 'termsync' option (enabled by default) which enables this feature if it is supported by the terminal emulator. System clipboard synchronization Nvim 0.10 can now use the OSC 52 escape sequence to write to (or read from) the system clipboard. OSC 52 is only used automatically when (1) it is able to determine that the terminal emulator supports it (via XTGETTCAP), (2) it is running in an SSH session, and (3) when the 'clipboard' option is unset. Note that some terminal emulators do not support reading from the system clipboard with OSC 52, or only allow it after prompting the user for confirmation. It is recommended to use the traditional “paste” key binding (e.g. Cmd+V on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+V on Linux) to paste into Nvim from the system clipboard and use \"+ to copy to the clipboard inside Nvim (see :h quoteplus). Hyperlinks Nvim 0.10 introduces experimental support for hyperlinks using the OSC 8 sequence. By default, this is used in Markdown for links of the form [example](https://example.com). If your terminal emulator supports the OSC 8 escape sequence, then the text example in the Nvim buffer will contain a hyperlink that can be clicked and will open https://example.com in your web browser. This means that users can view Markdown files with :set conceallevel=2 and get an experience much closer to the rendered output: In the screenshot above, the underlined words are clickable link text, just as you would find in a web browser. Automatic truecolor detection Nvim 0.10 will now automatically determine if the terminal emulator supports 24 bit color (“truecolor”) and enable the 'termguicolors' option if it does. It does this through a combination of heuristics ($COLORTERM, terminfo) and terminal queries (DECRQSS, XTGETTCAP). This detection works even over SSH connections and when inside a terminal multiplexer such as tmux. LSP inlay hints Nvim 0.10 now supports LSP inlay hints thanks to Chinmay Dalal. A picture here will do more than my words can: The dark colored texts which display type annotations for variable declarations are inlay hints. This text is not part of the actual source file in the buffer, but is “virtual” text inserted by Nvim and provided by the language server. These hints can be enabled or disabled dynamically using vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable(). Many other new LSP features were added in Nvim 0.10 as well. Refer to the “LSP” section in :h news for a full list. Tree-sitter query editor Nvim 0.10 adds even more tools for working with Tree-sitter queries. If you didn’t know already, Nvim bundles an “inspector” which allows you to view the abstract syntax tree of any source file with the :InspectTree command (so long as a Tree-sitter parser for the file’s language is installed). Example: Thanks to Maria José Solano, Nvim 0.10 adds a powerful capability to the Tree-sitter inspector: a query editor. The query editor allows you to write queries and see the matches in a source buffer in real time. Being able to create and modify queries interactively makes writing new queries a breeze. Example: In the screenshot above, the query editor is open in the top-right window, the tree inspector is in the bottom-right window, and the source buffer is in the left window. Notice that the text that is matched by the query in the query editor is highlighted in the source buffer and that the text initializer (the capture group used in the query) is floating on the line next to the match. As the query is updated in the editor, the corresponding highlights in the source buffer change in real time. The query editor can be opened by pressing o in the :InspectTree window, with the :EditQuery command, or by calling vim.treesitter.query.edit() directly. With :InspectTree and :EditQuery, Neovim is one of the best tools (if not the best tool) for working with Tree-sitter, even if you don’t actually use Neovim. Miscellaneous As I mentioned at the top of this post, there are a lot of new features in this release, and I am not going to cover all of them. Here I’ll list a few more that I personally think are worth mentioning: The :terminal command now accepts modifiers, so you can use e.g. :botright terminal (or :bo te) to open a new terminal window in a split at the bottom of your screen. In addition, :terminal buffers that are started with no arguments (and thus open a shell) will close automatically when the shell exits without an error. gx in Normal mode calls vim.ui.open() on whatever is under the cursor, which shells out to your operating system’s “open” capability (e.g. open on macOS or xdg-open on Linux). For instance, pressing gx on a URL will open that URL in your browser. Tree-sitter based syntax highlighting is enabled by default for Lua, Vimdoc (:help), and Tree-sitter queries (to revert to traditional regex based syntax highlighting, create a FileType autocommand or ftplugin with vim.treesitter.stop() for the respective filetype). Q and @ in Visual mode will execute the last recorded/executed macro for all visually selected lines. Users using a terminal emulator that supports the Kitty keyboard protocol can create mappings using the “super” and “meta” modifiers with theis Cmd+S on macOS). Roadmap The Neovim project is loosely organized and structured. We follow a “fun driven development” paradigm: for the most part, contributors and maintainers work on things that are personally interesting to them. Because of this, it can be difficult to predict what will happen in future releases. If there is a feature you want to see implemented, the best way to do it is to take a crack at it yourself: many of the features mentioned in this very blog post were contributed by users that are not part of the “core” maintenance team! There is active chatter about further improving the LSP and Tree-sitter experience (as mentioned above, builtin snippet and completion support are a work-in-progress). One of the biggest challenges with Tree-sitter is parser distribution: currently, parsers are shared object files which must be compiled on every user’s machine or distributed with a system package manager. We are already working on implementing the new Tree-sitter WASM capabilities which will enable distributing Tree-sitter parsers as portable WASM blobs. This solves the distribution problem and may enable Neovim to ship more Tree-sitter parsers out of the box. We would also like to integrate some of the functionality from nvim-lspconfig so that, ideally, nvim-lspconfig is just a “bag of configs” without any smarts or core logic. How best to do this is still hotly debated, but it is something that is being discussed. Getting Involved There is nothing quite as fun as hacking on your own tools. If you are a Neovim user, I encourage you to get involved, whether that is through contributing directly to the Neovim project or a plugin, or simply participating in community spaces such as the Neovim Matrix room. If you have pain points or frustrations when using Neovim, please let us know. Many of us on the core maintenance team have been using Vim/Nvim for so long that we’ve forgotten what it’s like to be a beginner and, speaking for myself at least, this can leave blind spots on how things can be improved. Thanks for reading and for using Neovim! Hopefully the next update will come a little sooner. One Last Thing The Neovim project now has a merch store! If you didn’t know that you needed a Neovim branded hoodie or mug, now you do. All proceeds raised from the store are used to fund project needs and sponsor full-time development work.

During 2012-2015 there seemed to be way more competition in the editor space before VS Code gobbled the community mindshare. I remember starting my first professional job and having a coworker to keep pressuring me to use vim because he used emacs and wanted to argue with someone about emacs in the office (all in good fun I assure you :D). I think I started using nvim when 0.2 was release, but then I didn't really do much more with my rc file than what vim offered. When neovim enabled plugin authoring with lua that's when it felt like the magic of neovim started to click for me. Plugins like telescope, harpoon, and fzf changed the way I fundamentally work now. Although I think my favorite thing about neovim is watching other people use neovim, I'm always learning new workflows to introduce into my workflows. It sounds tiring, but it doesn't feel tiring if that makes sense? Really excited to see inlay hints natively as that's something I really struggled to configure myself. reply celie56 19 hours agoparentI love watching others use Neovim and that's how I learned more about the LSP / treesitter integration. I still find that VS Code is my recommendation for new contributors to an existing codebase because of how intuitive it is to resolve problems solo. If I want to debug a change in an existing project I will almost always reach for VS Code due to the integration with build systems (CMake for example) or other tools. That said, I find that I do \"real work\" in neovim: thinking, exploring, or writing this reply. If I were to teach someone from the beginning I would still recommend (neo)vim. reply sph 17 hours agoparentprev> When I first started to learn how to program I was following along a basic tutorial by Jeffrey Way and his first sentence was \"We're going to use vim.\" That tutorial, whose topic I can't even remember now, set me on a path for my professional career. I like this origin story. In my case, I was already a decent programmer and beginner UNIX admin when I got my first job, and one day I was using nano or some other \"friendly\" editor to edit some files on a server, when the literal grey-beard senior sysadmin that was looking over my shoulder pulled a face and said \"OK, it's time you learn how to use vim\", and spent some time teaching me the basics of it. Now I have surpassed the Master and I use Emacs, though vim is still my second favorite editor. reply DEADMINCE 16 hours agoparentprev> because he used emacs and wanted to argue with someone about emacs in the office That's weird to me as in more than 20+ years I don't think I've ever been around people arguing that in real life. It's always been more of a meme to me than anything real. reply azemetre 14 hours agorootparentIt was always good natured and I enjoyed the comradery that came from it. He also taught me a lot about vim and command line tools in general. reply zabzonk 18 hours agoparentprevback in the early 1990's i worked for a commercial training company (The Instruction Set) and the first day of our \"Programming In C\" course normally went something like this: me: we are using these beat-up terminals trainees: is this what we are paying for? me: we will be using unix (no linux easily available then) trainees: but we use VMS! me: and we will be using vi to edit our programs trainees: wha??? ....a week passes trainees: actually quite neat! i really like vi reply durandal1 18 hours agoprevThe ultimate proof that Neovim has a healthy team of contributors, is that they successfully agreed on a new default color scheme. I am now convinced they can succeed with anything. reply nicce 15 hours agoparentThe proposal from a brave soul: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/26334 reply jthemenace 14 hours agoparentprevNext up, tabs vs spaces!!! reply bbkane 19 hours agoprevWow, I love that so much stuff is coming to core! Every once in a while for the last few years I overhaul my Neovim config and try to add all the new goodies (commenting, LSP, etc., that are table stakes for most IDEs) as plugins using the latest and greatest plugin manager. That works for a while, but like clockwork, something breaks- a plugin updates incompatibly, Neovim updates incompatibly, an external binary the plugin relies on updates incompatibly... At this point I'm stuck with a broken IDE and I don't have the energy to debug all the moving parts. I suffer for a month or something and then restart the cycle. For my latest config, I decided to treat Neovim and \"just a text editor\" and made a much smaller config ( https://github.com/bbkane/dotfiles/tree/master/nvim-03-lazy ). It's been really nice having something that \"just works\" for text edits and using VSCode for heavier IDE tasks. I WANT to use Neovim for more complex tasks, but I also want a simple config that \"just works\". I'm really excited that the core devs seem to agree and are adding tablestakes features to core- the new default colorscheme, Treesitter WASM, and better commenting will all make my config even simpler! At some point I might even try LSP integration again! reply eptcyka 17 hours agoparentMy vim config is generated by nix, if I don’t break it, it does not break. reply desdenova 17 hours agoparentprevI just use CoC for all LSP functionality, and everything just works with almost no issues. Configuring the native LSP client is still too clunky to switch. reply tristan957 19 hours agoparentprevI haven't used it, but vscode-neovim might give you the best of both worlds. reply EasyMark 18 hours agoparentprevthis is why I only update once a year or so around the beginning of the year. I mean \"bit rot\" is a real phenomenon but not in a year's time. If it fails. I just go back to my old config that is backed up in the cloud. If it fails, I can try again in a month. I'm too old to constantly be tinkering every week or two and hoping it doesn't break. reply marinhero 18 hours agoparentprevHave you tried using an nvim distribution? They take care of all the plugin loading, config and testing. They stay reasonably updated too. reply bbkane 18 hours agorootparentI tried using LazyVim, but I didn't put much effort customizing it so I missed my custom config and I found it somewhat janky reply scutrell 17 hours agorootparentprevI think they are a good middle ground, but you're still left with some of the busy work. Further, you're a bit more at the mercy of the maintainer. Likely, Lazyvim isn't going anywhere, but it isn't out of the realm of possibilities either. reply whinvik 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat distribution would you recommend? reply nop_slide 18 hours agorootparentI recently started with Kickstart paired with this video, it's really easy and beginner friendly. https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8C0Cq9Uv9o reply EasyMark 18 hours agorootparentprevI think lazyvim is one of the more successful/dependable ones reply kevincox 19 hours agoprevWow. Almost all of these are things that I will be using right away. It's not often that a release, especially one for software that has lineage back decades, is so relevant to my use cases. I already had `K` set to LSP hover. I just switched my comment plugin to get something LSP aware. Hyperlinks can be a bit annoying. Because sometimes the line wraps so default terminal auto-linking doesn't work properly. Having explicit metadata will be excellent. I already had inlay hints enabled, but they would appear at the end of the line. Having these in the right place will be fantastic. `gx` open is not something that I was already using but I will probably start using this. reply wonger_ 16 hours agoparentI feel exactly the same - I've never been so pleasantly surprised by release notes. Immediate wins for current users. And hopefully these builtin QOL features will make nvim easier for new users. reply sdwolfz 18 hours agoprev\"Nvim 0.10 can now use the OSC 52 escape sequence to write to (or read from) the system clipboard.\" This is a big deal! (it shouldn't be, but it is) My main complaints about vim/emacs in the past was at the sheer complexity of getting something that should not even be a concern (clipboard integration) working properly, when other text/code editors did not have this problem at all. Searching online, it seems like tmux has some nice documentation related to OSC 52 usage: https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Clipboard I will be playing around with this for a bit to understand it more. But honestly, this is the sort of thing that should \"Just Work TM\". \"VTE terminals (GNOME terminal, XFCE terminal, Terminator) do not support the OSC 52 escape sequence.\" https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/2495 That's a shame, but I'm not against using a different terminal emulator. Up until now I did not really have a good reason to. reply tasuki 13 hours agoparent> My main complaints about vim/emacs in the past was at the sheer complexity of getting something that should not even be a concern (clipboard integration) working properly What problems have you encountered? I have the following shortcuts in my .vimrc: vnoremap y \"*y noremap p \"*p vnoremap c \"+y noremap v \"+p Space + y/p is the copying/pasting from/to the \"primary selection\" (the mouse middle click). Space + c/v is copying/pasting from/to the regular ctrl+c/ctrl+v clipboard. This... just works for me? reply urxvtcd 31 minutes agorootparentMy solution is to have this snippet in my vimrc. Don't ask me why this works. It's been years, and I had no issues with it. \" System-agnostic setting making the unnamed clipboard register act like \" clipboard in any other editor. Copy with y commands, and paste with p or P. if has('unnamedplus') set clipboard=unnamedplus,unnamed else set clipboard+=unnamed endif Beside this, there is also the issue of setting paste when pasting in insert mode. reply yoavm 19 hours agoprevNeovim is great and is my daily driver for a couple of years now. I was really looking forward to 0.10 because the roadmap said \"multicursor\", and that's the only thing that sometimes make me open Sublime Text, but it seems like it was more complex to implement than originally estimated and so it was now pushed to 0.12 (https://neovim.io/roadmap/). reply wonger_ 17 hours agoparentI used to want multicursor as well. But I heard a recommendation that multicursor is not \"the vim way\", and instead to use macros or regex search-and-replace or visual-block mode. That's worked for me. Of course multicursor must be commonly requested for a reason. Just passing along some alternatives. reply ratorx 13 hours agorootparentI think multicursor vs macro is basically a case of whether the feedback is instant, rather than delayed. Multicursor (in other editors) is a lot better, because you don’t have to think about which exact motion to use as much (since you can see it as you do them). On the other hand, macros and vim motions are a lot more general, but require you to think about the exact motions a lot more ahead of time. I think substitution (and command) previews (vs not having these features when substituting) is a good parallel to what multicursor adds over just macros. reply vander_elst 15 hours agoparentprevWhat's the difference between multicursor and visual block? Genuinely curious, is it that things don't have to be vertically aligned? What's the ux expectation in a pure keyboard based workflow? reply 000ooo000 10 hours agorootparentYeah I think that's it. You can place the cursors arbitrarily with Ctrl+mouse3 in editors like VSCode, ST3, IIRC. Multiple cursors in one line is a scenario I don't think visual block would be great for. I say this as an nvim user who uses macros and will occasionally copypaste a block into VSCode just if i'm feeling lazy and want to multicursor something. reply strangelove026 17 hours agoparentprevNoticed this also. Truly the only reason I still open up vscode. And repo find / replace. Otherwise Switched to nvim full time about 5 months ago, can do everything and more ha reply Zizizizz 14 hours agorootparenthttps://github.com/nvim-pack/nvim-spectre Is a great find and replace plugin for your repo. so is quick fix list + `:cdo s//gc:cdo update` reply jasonpeacock 16 hours agoprevFor everyone asking for more IDE features...that's literally a non-goal for Neovim: https://neovim.io/charter/ Neovim aims to be extensible and enable plugins to do amazing things, but also be minimal. There are many projects that use the rich set of plugins to provide IDE experiences (LazyVim, AstroNvim, LunarVim, etc). reply scutrell 17 hours agoprevAs a decade long vim user, I just gave nvim a try this year, and I really wanted to like it. In most every way it is a straight upgrade, but I find myself kind of bummed out that it is still so barebones on install. Really, I was hoping that something like Lazyvim would be the default because I would love a more \"out-of-the-box\" solution. I don't want to have to worry about keeping the LSP etc. up to date. So instead, I've been looking more into Helix. Still not sold on the bindings, but what you get just by installing it is great. reply WuxiFingerHold 6 hours agoparentI've settled on LazyVim after many happy years with Jetbrain IDEs and very few unhappy years with VS Code. I have the impression that most Neovim users are building their own config, which is great, if you have the knowledge and personal resources. I would still recommend spending some time understanding how the config generally works (e.g. by reading kickstart and watching TJs video or/and typecraft's videos). But then, I'd recommend to the person who just wants the best IDE experience to just use LazyVim (or other full blown distributions like AstroNvim). Great discoverability. Lots of features. I use LazyVim with LazyExtras. No customization except the color scheme and adding LSP and TS for Svelte and Rust. I got to work on my projects immediately. My problem with Helix is that there're many for me important IDE features missing (which you get with LazyVim or AstrNVim or NVChad), decisions of the maintainers regarding the priorities and the that vim keybindings are ubiquitous. reply tiffanyh 6 hours agoparentprev> bummed out that it is still so barebones on install. Helix might be your cup of tea then. https://helix-editor.com (Though it will take awhile getting use to the inverted keybindings) reply behnamoh 17 hours agoparentprevyou should use neovim distributions like LazyVim. reply scutrell 17 hours agorootparentI did use Lazyvim. It was definitely better (though I spent a fortune in time modularizing is plugins). It just doesn't feel like a great solution for a variety of reasons. You're still a little on the hook for plugins and LSP configs. You're beholden to the distro e.g. if Lazy ever grows obsolete, Lazyvim could go too. In a perfect world there would be a neovim core (what it is now) and a formal neovim distro. reply WuxiFingerHold 6 hours agorootparent> You're beholden to the distro e.g. if Lazy ever grows obsolete, Lazyvim could go too. That is my only concern, too. But I decided not to worry. Getting into LazyVim was very easy, so I'm not concerned potentially having to switch to another distro or IDE. reply kzrdude 13 hours agorootparentprevThere's just a lot more innovation and development in the offshoot projects than in the big projects. The main project is gradually agreeing on /some/ default key bindings for lsps, as seen in this release (core does a great job on neovim no offense meant there.) In the same time, LazyVim and AstroNvim have built whole worlds of configuration and LSP integration because they are free to tinker, at a speed far outpacing core neovim. Because the core project wants/needs to cater to everyone. Even you said it was a straight upgrade (to Vim, I assume) and just keeping it that way is not easy. reply lawn 19 hours agoprevQ or @ to execute a macro over all visually selected lines is a feature I didn't know about but sounds amazing. All too often I create a macro that I want to execute many times, but it's hard to know how many. I've tried the guessing approach but that has a tendency to under- or overestimate. reply linsomniac 19 hours agoparentI'll often visual select (\"v\" and motion) and then \":norm @a\" to run the macro on all the selected lines. reply kevincox 19 hours agoparentprevMy general approach for macros that I want to execute many times is to end by going down a line (for sequential lines) or to end with a search for the next place that the macro can run. Then I can easily review the targets and run or skip on each. reply bitdivision 19 hours agoparentprevYou might find relative line numbers useful. `set relativenumber` reply lawn 19 hours agorootparentI already use relative line numbers but they don't help when the lines continue below the window. reply tiffanyh 19 hours agoprevRelease Notes (Neovim 0.10): https://neovim.io/doc/user/news-0.10.html reply Affric 19 hours agoprevPretty much exactly what is needed. Helix shows the way IMO but the Neovim guys are clearly not conservative. Exciting to see the tree sitter and lsp improvements. reply imjonse 19 hours agoparentIncluding more basic (as of 2024) features in the core like Helix would indeed be a good idea but would go against the existing culture of vim with many plugins competing. reply linsomniac 19 hours agorootparentThat's why I went with LunarVim, I was tired of maintaining my own plugins and configs, and wasn't quite ready to fully jump ship to Helix (though I do like the direction Helix is going, it'd be an easier sell if shells and everything had Helix keymaps). reply imjonse 17 hours agorootparentMain main gripe about Helix is that helix-like keybindings in VSCode are not working well for the times I need to use that :) reply Affric 1 hour agorootparentMe too. I am vi mode everywhere so I couldn't quite make the switch on the bindings but I loved the ideas in Helix. Truly a great project. reply ephimetheus 19 hours agoprevSupport for inlay LSP hints is the big one for me here. That’s mainly what’s kept me from switching over from vim so far. reply rane 17 hours agoparentHow does it keep you from switching from vim when vim does not have it? reply ephimetheus 16 hours agorootparentIt does have it though. Been using it for at few years already with coc. reply lawn 16 hours agorootparentCoc works with Neovim too if that's the logic. reply ephimetheus 16 hours agorootparentI know, but previously, the inlay hints would be displayed at the end of the line in Neovim, making them near useless. reply lawn 16 hours agorootparentHuh, does it work inline in Vim with Coc? reply ephimetheus 15 hours agorootparentYes that’s right! reply xyst 18 hours agoprevI have been transitioning my workflow from macOS to Linux. Discovered it’s kind of pain in the ass to get a gui based editor like Intellij to work correctly, especially within a VM. Happened to have discovered neovim, and so far it’s been a delight to use. Much faster and much lighter on resource use. Do any neovim veterans have recommendations on plugins to enable? Or even hidden features that would improve workflow. reply mdaniel 18 hours agoparent> Discovered it’s kind of pain in the ass to get a gui based editor like Intellij to work correctly, especially within a VM. Depending on your use-case, that's what their Gateway productis designed to solve: it runs (effectively) headless IJ in the VM, so indexing and analysis happens there, and then streams the GUI part over a custom protocol to your local IJ to handle the time-sensitive GUI bits Currently, to the best of my knowledge, they actually do require ssh, so it won't work over AWS SSM nor kubectl exec or similar, but I have high hopes they're going to fix that glaring bug Any Minute Now ™ see also: - https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote.html - https://jetbrains.github.io/projector-client/mkdocs/latest/i... - https://github.com/JetBrains/projector-docker#run-jetbrains-... reply xyst 17 hours agorootparentBut I still need to have the gui app installed correctly with opengl/hardware acceleration enabled , right? My problem isn’t with inconsistent development environments. I have trouble spinning up the IntelliJ ide locally. Thus the need for something more lightweight. Also I have used this in the past and the experience wasn’t the greatest. Tried with a dev server with gateway hosted within intranet. Used an m1 Mac as thin client. Issues with syncing state of client. Significant input lag in a large project. I remember trying to refactor a method in a 500K+ LoC and the UI would hang. Syncing plugins was also an issue at the time. I suspect these issues would likely be exacerbated over internet with tailscale reply asabla 17 hours agoparentprevI usually recommend new users to check out Kickstart. It contains a set of plugins and nice to haves so you don't have to discover them your self. All plugins are in one file + has a lot of comments to help you get started. ref: https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim reply WuxiFingerHold 6 hours agorootparentYep, I followed this recommendation, but when I was about to use Neovim in \"production\" I checked out LazyVim and AstroNVim and chose LazyVim by purely personal taste. Thanks to having learned how the config works with kickstart I don't feel lost, but still benefit from the big efforts and deep knowledge of the distro maintainers by assembling a sound full featured package. reply sciolist 16 hours agorootparentprevI second Kickstart! The single-file and comments make it easy to learn and configure yourself. reply lawn 18 hours agoparentprevThere are many great plugins. Telescope, nvim-cmp, treesitter are standard recommendations. I'll give a shout-out to conform.nvim that gives you very solid format on save functionality that's also easy to setup: https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim reply joeconway 18 hours agoparentprevThis isn’t neovim specific but this was one of the more delightful and impactful discoveries https://shapeshed.com/vim-netrw/ Configuring netrw right and having my vimrc load a side pane with it on load, combined with configuring my tab key to cycle between windows... Perfect. reply james2doyle 17 hours agoparentprevI'm doing the same on an old macbook. Off topic, but any idea on how you remap command + left/right? On a mac it is the equivalent of Home and End.

And I already use Neovide as a GUI pretty often. reply dpcx 17 hours agorootparentI've been using neovide for a few months now, and my biggest gripe is that there's not an easy way to automagically open a new file in an existing neovide window as a tab. With macvim I could do `--remote-tab-silent` and it was handled, but neovide seems to want me to use some kind of background server and a bunch of other hoops to jump through. reply trip-zip 19 hours agoparentprevWhat's the use case for a separate GUI for neovim? I remember using macvim for a few days maybe 8 years ago, but I never \"got it\". It felt like the benefits of having my editor in my terminal were thrown out for little return. reply doix 19 hours agorootparentIf neovim had a proper gui, you could move away from some of the limitations of the terminal. The biggest being using fixed width characters for drawing UI elements. Emacs does it pretty well, one of the few things that makes me jealous of emacs as a vim user. reply kevincox 19 hours agorootparentIIUC fixed widths is more than just a UI problem. Lots of internal code is assuming that. But maybe it works well-enough that it isn't a real issue. I remember trying a terminal that didn't have fixed char widths and it mostly worked. The only real issue was line wrapping (as vim and the terminal would both wrap based on how long they considered the line to be). So maybe it would be possible! I would love to see solid support for variable-width fonts. I know variable-width fonts are controversial, but I actually think they work well for coding but haven't had the chance to use them much due to Vim limitations. But especially for Markdown and similar mostly-text content they seem like a clear win. reply kzrdude 18 hours agorootparentprevAnd input limitations can be resolved by non-terminal UIs (for example like Ctrl+i and Tab being mapped to the same control character in old terminals - that one is solved by newer protocols, but the problems don't end there.) reply rockorager 11 hours agorootparentNeovim already supports these keys as long as you are using a terminal that supports the Kitty keyboard protocol (Kitty, wezterm, alacritty, foot, ghostty) reply eviks 18 hours agorootparentprevalso even the newer protocols fail to support modifier sides (left vs right shift) reply rockorager 11 hours agorootparentKitty keyboard protocol does indeed support modifier sides. reply eviks 5 hours agorootparentNo it doesn't, and the author rejected the proposal to add them https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/ Modifiers are encoded as a bit field with: shift 0b1 (1) alt 0b10 (2) ctrl 0b100 (4) super 0b1000 (8) hyper 0b10000 (16) meta 0b100000 (32) caps_lock 0b1000000 (64) num_lock 0b10000000 (128) reply bbkane 19 hours agorootparentprevI'd really like image support in a Neovim GUI. It'd make markdown editing easier for me reply Macha 19 hours agorootparentSeems more likely to be something you implement with e.g. kitty/iterm/sixel escape codes than moving to a GUI app. Actually probably is something that could be implemented in neovim today. Maybe even by a plugin, not sure what control they have over stuff like that. reply kzrdude 18 hours agorootparentprevsee 3rd/image.nvim on github. There might be others reply snarfy 18 hours agorootparentprevJust basics like fonts and window sizing make the gui version of Vim a better experience for me. reply anta40 18 hours agorootparentprevI mostly work on macOS nowadays, and I like macvim.

Not sure why but in my use cases it is slower than vim, the terminal is imo still worse than vim and it s harder to copy and paste to the terminal: in vim I yank and than C_W\"0 (or whatever register I need) in nvim I didn't find a solution yet. Nvim always feels more clunky. reply jarbus 18 hours agoprevLove neovim, great to see more parts already in my config coming to core. Maybe one day most of us won't even bother with plug-ins :) reply LeSaucy 19 hours agoprevI am curious if any of the termsync options can make neovim play nicely with mosh. My dream setup is to be able to spin up preconfigured dev environments in docker containers, and use blink shell on my iPad for on the go coding. Unfortunately mosh and neovim always end up with display corruption. reply cyberpunk 19 hours agoparentI used to use blink quite a lot on my iPad and I’ve noticed it really going “weird” lately. They have some script that executed on login, which tried to “upgrade” my connections to mosh by downloading a static mosh bin from some server they own (so, could contain anything) and it was opt out — and lately randomly some keys just stop working on the keyboard (like, the c key just doesn’t work at all in the app). I jumped ship to Termius, shame. How’s your experience lately? reply LeSaucy 19 hours agorootparentI refuse to pay a subscription for a terminal app. reply cyberpunk 18 hours agorootparentThe subscription just seems to be for teams features like a shared address book and whatever a “vault” is — I’ve not paid them anything.

    "originLink": "https://www.fstar-lang.org/",
    "originBody": "Introduction Download Learn Community Uses Research People Introduction F* (pronounced F star) is a general-purpose proof-oriented programming language, supporting both purely functional and effectful programming. It combines the expressive power of dependent types with proof automation based on SMT solving and tactic-based interactive theorem proving. F* programs compile, by default, to OCaml. Various fragments of F* can also be extracted to F#, to C or Wasm by a tool called KaRaMeL, or to assembly using the Vale toolchain. F* is implemented in F* and bootstrapped using OCaml. F* is open source on GitHub and is under active development by Microsoft Research, Inria, and by the community. Download F* is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. Binaries for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X are posted regularly on the releases page on GitHub. You can also install F* from OPAM, Docker, Nix, or build it from sources, by following the instructions in INSTALL.md. Learn F* An online book Proof-oriented Programming In F* is being written and regular updates are posted online. You probably want to read it while trying out examples and exercises in your browser by clicking the image below. Low* We also have a tutorial that covers Low*, a low-level subset of F*, which can be compiled to C by KaRaMeL. Course Material F* courses are often taught at various seasonal schools. Lectures and course materials for some of them are also a useful resource. Embedding Proof-oriented Programming Languages in F*) Online lectures at the Oregon Programming Language Summer School (2021): Lecture notes, slides, code Formal Verification with F* and Meta-F* Lectures and tutorial at ECI 2019: Lecture notes, slides, code Verifying Low-Level Code for Correctness and Security Lectures at the Oregon Programming Language Summer School (2019): Lecture notes, slides, code Program Verification with F* Course at 2018 EUTypes Summer School, 8-12 August, 2018, Ohrid, Macedonia Course material Community Please use GitHub Discussions to ask questions about F*, learn about announcements, etc. We also have a mailing list, which has very low traffic. You can subscribe at fstar-mailing-list. The F* developers and many users interact on this Slack forum---you should be able to join the forum automatically by clicking here, but if that doesn't work,please ask for access on this thread. There is also a public forum on Zulip. The F* PoP Up Seminar, a users and developers meeting is open to all. We aim to schedule it once a month, though the schedule is irregular---we hope to see you there! You can also contact the maintainers of F* at fstar-maintainers@googlegroups.com. Uses F* is used in several projects in both industrial and academic settings. We list a few of them here. If you are using F* in your project, please let us know by writing to the fstar-mailing-list. Project Everest Project Everest is an umbrella project that develops high-assurance secure communication software in F*. A big part of the development of F* has been motivated by the scenarios that Project Everest targets. Several offshoots from Project Everest continue as their own projects, including some of those listed below. HACL*, ValeCrypt, and EverCrypt HACL* is a library of high-assurance cryptographic primitives, written in F* and extracted to C. ValeCrypt provides formally proven implementations of cryptographic primitives in Vale, a framework for verified assembly language programming embedded in F*. EverCrypt combines them into a single cryptographic provider. Code from these projects is now used in production in several projects, including Mozilla Firefox, the Linux kernel, Python, mbedTLS, the Tezos blockchain, the ElectionGuard electronic voting SDK, and the Wireguard VPN. EverParse EverParse is a parser generator for binary formats that produces C code extracted from formally proven F*. Parsers from EverParse are used in production in several projects, including in Windows Hyper-V, where every network packet passing through the Azure cloud platform is parsed and validated first by code generated by EverParse. EverParse is also used in other production settings, including ebpf-for-windows. Research F* is an active topic of research, both in the programming languages and formal methods community, as well as from an application perspective in the security and systems communities. We list a few of them below, with full citations to these papers available in this bibliography. If you would like your paper included in this list, please contact fstar-maintainers@googlegroups.com.

I was a big fan of Idris at the time, and F* seemed like it could more or less satisfy that itch while still being compatible with F#. One thing is that there didn't really appear to be any kind of IDE support, and while I'm alright just hacking up everything in Vim, I think the rest of my team was not. I never really got to use it, and all I've ever done with it is a few of the toy examples on their website, but I haven't completely given up on it either. I think it's a much more approachable system than Coq or Agda, but still gives you sexy dependent types. My PhD stuff is in Isabelle, and I do really like Isabelle, but I find that dependent types translate a bit more directly to \"real code\" than Isabelle's higher-order logic, so I would really like to utilize it for something, particularly with its .NET integration. reply daxfohl 18 hours agoparentI remember reading (~10 years ago) that F* was created as part of a \"Project Everest\" a long time back, with the goal of creating a provable TLS implementation. I never saw that anything came out of that though. If it's that hard to create something as well-defined as a TLS implementation, it seems futile to think this could ever be used for hand-wavy things we encounter in day-to-day work, no? Or are there real-world use cases where this could really be applied? reply lambdanik 18 hours agorootparentF* existed before Project Everest, but Everest did power a lot of its development. We have built verified systems and components in the TLS ecosystem, including parts of TLS, QUIC and related protocols, and continue to do so: https://project-everest.github.io/ Some of it is deployed in production systems: * Verified parsers in the Windows kernel and elsewhere: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/everparse-hard... * Verified crypto in Linux, Firefox, Python, ... https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star reply daxfohl 6 hours agorootparentSo _would_ it possibly be useful for business apps?

A language isn't enough, a language recognized from its support in ide/production and community reply tombert 19 hours agorootparentI didn't find F# so hard to run in production, particularly after JetBrains released Rider, but even before that I didn't think it was so bad. At Jet we managed to get to pretty decent scale with F#, and for the most part got pretty ok performance. Often I would use the C# versions of libraries simply because they were updated more frequently. Everyone says that the C# interop is clunky and I think that's just not true, I found it relatively easy to work with C# libraries and utilize the .NET Framework. I used ConcurrentDictionary and SemaphoreSlim pretty heavily, for example. For the stuff was a little cludgy, I found it pretty straightforward to simply make wrapper functions that did what I needed. I even found the object-oriented support in F# to be pleasant, though I didn't use it a lot. The syntax was really terse but easy to read, so in the rare cases where I had to extend a class or something, it wasn't hard. If I needed to implement an interface, it was also pretty easy to write an anonymous interface and plop that into a wrapper function. One thing that I didn't like about F# was the kind of unpredictable performance with the async monad. It was hard to measure, and it didn't seem to work completely deterministically due to some kind of laziness that I never completely understood. The task monad released a bit later seemed to fix that, but that was integrated a bit later than my time at Jet. Still, I found it a pretty decent language, to a point where if I started a company I would genuinely consider utilizing F#. reply williamcotton 17 hours agorootparentprevIonide, The F# language server, is excellent. I use F# in .NET Interactive Jupyter notebooks daily at work and it works quite well. The community around the language is very helpful and the Discord is great for all sorts of issues ranging from beginner to advanced. I love the Fable compiler which targets JS, TS, Python and Rust and makes for a wonderful way to share a domain design across multiple code bases. reply lambdanik 18 hours agoparentprevHave you seen https://github.com/FStarLang/fstar-vscode-assistant? Copilot & F* works pretty nicely. We've also had a pretty nice emacs mode for a while: https://github.com/FStarLang/fstar-mode.el reply tombert 18 hours agorootparentI have not tried the VSCode stuff, but I did try the Emacs thing. Looking at the repo you linked, it looks like the first commit was last year and I left Jet in 2018. The Emacs mode was fine, I didn't think it was bad, but it was still a tough sell to my team; none of them wanted to install Emacs, they wanted a Visual Studio or JetBrains experience. I'm aware that's an uphill battle, and maybe it would be a different story if the VSCode extension existed in 2018. reply toasted-subs 18 hours agoparentprevWhere do you even find orgs that let you program in those fun langs? University jobs? reply tombert 18 hours agorootparentI was working for Jet.com, it was one of the very few places that did F#. The reason I was hired was because I had Haskell experience from working at NYU as an engineer before. reply Nuzzerino 14 hours agorootparentI used F# at realtyshares in 2017. Didn't think it was particularly great for anything except Payment processing. The F# tools were only good with VS IDE on Windows at the time. I would probably use it again though, the REPL is much better than anything C# has to offer. The Rider release was a shitshow, lots of bugs that went unfixed. Productivity went way down when I had to switch to a mac laptop (keep in mind this is 2017 on a Microsoft language). Had similar experiences with Rubymine in 2022 (poor YARD support, lots of bugs in type inference even with simple things, bug tickets left open for years, thank god for Sorbet-lsp). The tooling is probably better these days but I don't trust Jetbrains for anything, they are a rent-seeking company. reply neonsunset 14 hours agorootparent2017 was right as the very first releases of .NET Core 1, 1.1 and 2.0 were happening. It’s most likely your experience today would be a polar opposite to this. reply happypumpkin 7 hours agorootparentprevMaybe try looking for Clojure jobs? They aren't super common but are a lot more so than any other lisps or functional languages that I'm aware of (except maybe Scala). reply barrenko 16 hours agorootparentprevThere are some trading companies as well, I guess because it's ocaml adjacent. reply jfoutz 20 hours agoparentprevLately I've been dabbling with lean. pretty tight vs code integration. I don't know why I keep getting pulled toward dependent types, like a damn moth to a flame. I get a little scorched, then, oh I should try ... But yeah, compiler checked properties are something kinda magical. Even more when you can specify the property to check. reply ykonstant 18 hours agorootparentLean is lovely, but those of us using it for general purpose programming are a lonely bunch; virtually all discussion on Zulip is about mathlib and tactics (which is understandable). reply eggy 12 hours agorootparentI have heard of Lean, but I just took a look for the first time. Certainly, much more Idris/Haskelly than the OCamlish F*. Are there libraries available for general programming in Lean? Can you compile to another lower-level language like C? I would be interested in writing some embedded code that could formally be verified. Right now, I have put some time in to SPARK2014, the subset of Ada. reply ykonstant 12 hours agorootparentLean in fact compiles to C so the C FFI is trivial to use. However, the only general programming facilities Lean has seem to be those required to bootstrap the language. I find it equal amounts funny and sad that you still cannot get the Unix epoch in Lean; you need to call the C functions through the FFI. For verifying code Lean is not great right now (see a sibling comment in this post). For embedded code in particular, I remember there was a low-level formalizer, but I cannot remember what it was. This post here has many discussions and links: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31775216 Maybe I am remembering this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATS_(programming_language) But I was under the impression there was an almost assembly-level functional programming language with formal verification capabilities; I cannot recall it. reply 6gvONxR4sf7o 16 hours agoprevI wish one of these languages (where you can prove and confirm that your code follows the formal spec) would aim for production use. I was really interested in Lean 4 when I found out that it aims to be a general purpose language, but then I saw that the language manual still has a section titled \"Should I use Lean?\" that emphasizes it's just a research project not a product and still expects a bunch more breaking changes, and so on. Some day, I'd love to write proofs instead of tests in some places. reply bluGill 16 hours agoparentWhile I agree with that in principal, in talking to people who have actually written proved programs I get the impression they don't think it is practical to prove programs that are more than medium sized. I'd love to prove my code correct, but I deal with 10s of million lines of code and nobody has a clue how you would approach a problem that large (we use C++, but you can select a different language if you want - the problem is the size and you can't get around that with a different language reply agentultra 15 hours agorootparentI talk to folks who are involved in proof engineering and they disagree here. It is possible to prove large systems when you have good automation. But perhaps it's writing the automation that is hard right now due to a small overlap in skills. Writing the proofs is one thing but writing the automation that scales those proofs to a larger system and which makes it easy to extend the system without breaking the proofs constantly is key and requires more \"engineering\" focused people rather than proof-focused ones. reply Someone 15 hours agorootparentprevDivide and conquer does work a bit, though. Languages that support strong encapsulation of various structures will be easier to work with than those that pass pointers around. As an example, having proofs of various properties of strcat, strcpy, etc. will help less in large programs than having proofs for all Java’s methods on String. In the former, you’ll also have to proof that covers all accesses to your data. In the latter, the JVM guarantees that. reply PhunkyPhil 15 hours agorootparentprevSurely it wouldn't be aimed at proving a 10 million line black box of code, right? In my mind it would have to be built from the ground up, sub unit tests for function proofs and maintain 100% coverage as you go along. As long as the constituent parts are proven you don't have to zoom out to a macro level. reply ReleaseCandidat 15 hours agoparentprev> Some day, I'd love to write proofs instead of tests in some places. Believe my, you only want to do that if the proof assistent accepts \"I leave the details as an exercise to the reader\" ;) reply tombert 15 hours agorootparentI do a lot of work with Isabelle, and when doing proofs, you can use the word \"sorry\" to basically say \"this is true because I said it's true okay\". It's become a running joke in my grad school of \"when in doubt, there's always 'proof by sorry'\". I'm not as familiar with a lot of the other proof assistants but I suspect there are similar constructs? reply nextaccountic 14 hours agorootparent> I do a lot of work with Isabelle, and when doing proofs, you can use the word \"sorry\" to basically say \"this is true because I said it's true okay\". I always thought that unsafe { .. } blocks in Rust should be called trustme { .. } But sorry { .. } is even better! reply ReleaseCandidat 12 hours agorootparentMy favorite is accursedUnutterablePerformIO https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-0.12.1.0/docs... This \"function\" has a superficial similarity to unsafePerformIO but it is in fact a malevolent agent of chaos. It unpicks the seams of reality (and the IO monad) so that the normal rules no longer apply. It lulls you into thinking it is reasonable, but when you are not looking it stabs you in the back and aliases all of your mutable buffers. The carcass of many a seasoned Haskell programmer lie strewn at its feet. reply tombert 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah, it's pretty funny to see the first draft of anything I'm trying to prove; it'll be polluted with sorry's everywhere; it comes off as the most apologetic, completely un-confident bit of math you can think of. The worst part is when you forget to remove a sorry (or three) because of a linked file you didn't check, and you submit stuff to other people on the team thinking you discovered something pretty cool, only to find out that you didn't actually prove anything. reply dunham 11 hours agorootparentprevLean has `sorry` and Idris has `believe_me`. Recalling my math education, I would think the appropriate keyword would be `clearly`. reply naasking 9 hours agorootparent> Recalling my math education, I would think the appropriate keyword would be `clearly` I prefer the slightly more ominous \"surely\". reply Nevermark 4 hours agorootparent\"Obviously\" casts a nice aspersion upon anyone so uncouth as to question its validity. Of course, any junior member of a team that is willing to stand up and state that, no, the assertion is anything but obvious to them, should get an immediate promotion, and be quickly moved to another group! reply ReleaseCandidat 12 hours agorootparentprevCoq has \"admitted\" (or \"admit\"), but sorry is of course way better :). Lean also has \"admit\". reply rtpg 11 hours agoparentprevWell Coq is used to build a C compiler used in aerospace. At the very least you could write \"trricky\" stuff in that, and then use the compiled artefacts in your toolkit. I get the general complaint, though. I wish I could have the syntax-based interactive proof system everywhere. reply yodsanklai 14 hours agoparentprevI wonder how that is compatible with the industry requirements, and even with software engineering in general. A lot of the code we write is short lived, either because we're iterating, or because features aren't used anymore. Also, bugs aren't the end of the world most of the time. You don't aim for 100% correctness, but for something that provides value to users and it's better than your competitors. Formal proofs may be useful in some case, but I don't see them outside very niche fields. Even regular static types can be argued against. reply amw-zero 8 hours agoparentprevCode written in F* is running in Firefox, Linux, Windows, and Azure: https://project-everest.github.io/. reply ykonstant 15 hours agoparentprevFor small projects without tight performance or reliability requirements, Lean 4 is fine. It is lacking a lot in basic I/O functions, but you just yank them directly from the C standard library via the FFI and use them in your code. Don't expect to be able to prove anything about your code, though; just treat Lean as a pure functional language like Haskell but with dependent types and eager default evaluation. reply nequo 12 hours agorootparentIn your experience, what is the main impediment to proving properties of one’s code in Lean? Is it something specific to Lean or more generally an issue with theorem provers? reply ykonstant 12 hours agorootparentBy far the main impediment is that the current community does not care about this use-case. Lean's proof system works mainly by using its metaprogramming aspects to write macro-type objects called tactics; they perform transformations on the goals of your proof to simplify or dispatch them. [Note that this meta-programming is very powerful, but also extremely hard to use from what I have managed to see; do not expect LISP style ergonomics here. It doesn't help that the meta-programming book shows some trivial examples of macro rules and then delves deep into proof tactics for the next 2 chapters, leaving the reader who wants general code transformations stranded]. In order to use Lean for proving properties for serious amounts of code, you need to write an entire tactics library similar to mathlib (but for code). Nobody has done this. Maybe it is reasonably hard, or maybe unreasonably hard; the point is, there is no serious collaborative effort that I know of. reply nequo 12 hours agorootparentDo you get the sense that this would be easier with Coq due to the availability of suitable tactics? What makes you pick Lean instead of Coq for your projects? reply ykonstant 12 hours agorootparentProbably, from what people are telling me. But Coq is not a general purpose language, it is a dedicated theorem prover. I don't use Lean as a theorem prover for code (only for mathematics) and I myself don't do any code formalization unless someone offers to pay me. The reason I code in Lean is because I find it fun, and I think it is a very nice general purpose language; for instance, I like Lean much better than Haskell. If Lean ever gets the libraries Haskell has, I will be really excited. reply eggy 19 hours agoprevI prefer F#/F* syntax, but I had to go with Ada/SPARK2014 for the safety-related control systems I am trying to verify formally and use for high-integrity applications. Rust is making some inroads with AdaCore and Ferrous Systems partnering on providing formal verification tools for Rust like they do for Ada/SPARK2014, but Rust still doesn't have a published standard like C, Common Lisp, Prolog, Fortran, COBOL, etc. Plus the legacy is immense for Ada and SPARK2014. reply letmeinhere 19 hours agoparentMy understanding is that the key feature of SPARK is design-by-contract aka run-time enforced pre- and post-conditions plus invariants for loops. Whereas F* lets you define dependendent types, a subset of which are compile-time constraints similar to those SPARK contracts. Is that a fair contrast? reply Jtsummers 18 hours agorootparentFairly short course on SPARK/Ada - https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-spark/index.html SPARK's pre-/postconditions and assertions can be statically checked, they aren't just for runtime enforcement. This is its key value proposition, if it were just runtime enforcement it'd be nice, but not that great. reply debugnik 18 hours agoparentprev> with AdaCore and Ferrous Systems partnering I thought the partnership was already over? AdaCore left Ferrocene, and released its own support for a Rust toolchain lacking formal verification tools. reply eggy 13 hours agorootparentVery well might be the case. I am speaking on old news. I would guess the lack of an official published standard makes it hard to create tools and support them over time - a moving target. reply dang 5 hours agoprevRelated. Others?

For example, I'm aware that both NuPRL and Coq have some ability to extract programs from proofs. What kinds of problems does F* do better at? Are there some areas where the SMT solver is a particular advantage? Are the extracted programs superior in some way? reply octachron 18 hours agoparentF* has an extraction backend which targets \"human-readable C\" code, contrarily to Coq which extracts proof to \"machine-written OCaml\" (typically the extracted code use a type-system-escape-hatch left in OCaml for the sake of Coq extraction). Consequently, part of the Everest project (the proven cryptographic primitives in particular) has been integrated into C code base like the linux kernel, firefox . reply jfoutz 19 hours agoparentprevI think humanity in general are only dimly aware of this space. The Research section is probably your best bet about what's different. I think your questions are what academics call \"open\". reply abeppu 19 hours agorootparentActually it does look like their book has at least some additional info in their intro section \"To F*, or not to F*?\" The highlights seem to be: - extensional equality (similar to nuprl) - undecidable type-checking - combination of both SMT and tactics, metaprogramming - focus on compilation to mainstream languages, programming more than formalizing math reply pelagicAustral 19 hours agoprevThe first thing that came to mind when I entered the site was the resemblance of the classic Soviet iconography to their logo, sans the hammer and sickle, then I checked the repo, and coincidentally, they have a recent commit (`c6fac4d`) titled \"kremlin -> karamel\" [0] ([...] a tool for extracting low-level F programs to readable C code*)...

Just because I don't like communism, doesn't mean people can't have things named after one of recent history's most well-known superpowers, with admittedly cool style. reply debugnik 18 hours agorootparentI'm guessing they came up with the wordplay before the invasion, and then regretted it because the reference suddenly stopped being purely historical.

Nothing specifically Russian about it. reply debugnik 17 hours agorootparentI, personally, am aware, but I'm not so sure everyone who will read my username knows that, and there's enough war-related shilling around (and suspicion thereof) that the pun simply isn't worth it. reply andrewflnr 17 hours agorootparentprevAnd even if it was, poking gentle fun at a Russian suffix would not be an endorsement of the invasion. reply chuckadams 14 hours agorootparentprevYeesh, avoiding obvious Russian-isms is one thing, but a common suffix?

History is written by the victors. There's a reason the cliche move in politics is to call your opponent \"literally Hitler\" and not \"literally Stalin\". That said, I doubt any tool named \"Stalin\" would gain any major traction.

I was born too early! reply wk_end 16 hours agoparentCorrect me if I'm wrong (I've only dabbled in F* and only briefly read about 1ML) but wouldn't F*'s full dependent types make 1ML redundant? That is, once you've brought types into the value level, modules themselves become redundant - they're just records, and functors are just functions. The point of 1ML, IIUC, is to accomplish a similar unification without demanding full dependent types and the attendant complexities they bring. reply unstruktured 14 hours agorootparentInteresting point. I never inferred a strong connection between dependent types and the unification of records and modules. Maybe a real PL theorist around here can provide insights on that subject. reply joshmarlow 18 hours agoprevI'm curious how similar F* is to Lean Prover (which I've dabbled in). reply slushy-chivalry 14 hours agoparentand both are backed by msft? reply wyes 11 hours agoprevWe use F* for some of our crypto for embedded systems software :D reply bmitc 18 hours agoprevI've never understood the relationship between F# and F*. I had previously come to the conclusion that F* was merely inspired by F#'s syntax and base-level semantics but that was where the relationship ends. As far as I can tell, F* is not a .NET language and doesn't run on the CLR. Is that correct? In the description it says it compiles to OCaml, which confuses me even more about the F* naming. What is the relationship to or level of interoperability with F#, if there is any? reply samueldurante 18 hours agoparentI believe that F* is named purely for marketing purposes, or perhaps to specify another programming language with syntax derived from OCaml.

    "originBody": "Blog I Don’t Want To Spend My One Wild And Precious Life Dealing With Google’s AI Search Google's AI search has come for me By Riley MacLeod 9:45 AM EDT on May 16, 2024 Share on X (formerly Twitter) Share on Reddit Share on Email 20Comments Google’s AI search has arrived, uninvited, to my browser, and I cannot make it leave. It isn’t just that it serves me crap whenever I enter a question into my search bar, but that I have to wait for all the crap I don't want in the first place. Let me tell you a story from my day: I was paying invoices, and I wanted to doublecheck that the number of episodes of our podcast, Aftermath Hours, squared with what our producers had billed for. I typed “Aftermath hours spotify” into my browser window, which–depending when I’ve last cleared my history–either autofills the URL for the podcast on Spotify or takes me to Google search results, where our Spotify page is the top result. But now, when I get Google, I have to wait through a nearly three-second pause before AI information about the podcast appears at the top of the page, followed by a link to Spotify and other results. While I appreciate that, in this instance, the AI-generated information about the podcast is correct, this information is not what I’m looking for, and I have to wait three seconds for it to show up just so I can ignore it. These three seconds are wrecking me. I’m not one of those lifehacking types who wants to optimize every bit of their day, but that three second wait is just enough friction that I notice it every time. It’s a small annoyance in the moment, but over the course of a day’s queries–any writer or editor can tell you that the number of weird searches you do adds up–that friction starts to build into a drag. I feel like I’m losing chunks of my one and only life waiting for bullshit I didn’t ask for and don’t want to load onto my screen so I can scroll past it. That's something I already deal with when visiting the ad-laden websites Google search brings up; I don’t need a preview! It makes the already unpleasant experience of Google search even worse than it already is. Before some stray AI evangelist leaps into the comments to promise the tech will get better, I want to be clear that even if it were instantaneous, I still wouldn’t want it. I didn’t ask for results from the plagiarism machine! My Aftermath colleagues aren’t getting it, so I assume it’s just rolling out to more people this week on the back of Google’s I/O conference. I should, apparently, be able to get around all this by selecting “web” results from the “more” dropdown, but I’m not seeing that option yet–and I assume I’d still have to wait for the AI results to load first. All the instructions for how to disable AI search presume I opted into it, which I very much did not. Plus, Googling “how do I turn AI search off” still gives me AI results; while its answers square with what actual websites tell me, it’s a real 2001: A Space Odyssey vibe. In lieu of being able to turn it off, I’ve been trying to race the AI results, clicking “search” and then scrolling as fast as I can down the page before the AI text appears. While this adds some excitement to my day, it also adds more stress and time crunch to a life that’s already full of it. I don’t want this! I don’t need this. Life is too short.

They invented a whole TCP replacement to reduce page latency, and now this? reply h2odragon 16 hours agoparent\"happy users\" has not been on google's priority list for a long, long time. 20 years or more. reply derefr 16 hours agorootparentThis isn't even about \"happy users\", though; it's about money. Where does Google's ad revenue come from if users give up on waiting for their searches to complete before they're ever shown any revenue-generating sponsored links? Actually, thinking about this more, I fundamentally don't understand Google's search experience strategy over the last 10 years. Even before AI answers, they were heuristic-ing answers into a little box that pushed sponsored ad placements below the fold. Why push sponsored results below the fold? How does Google make money from a search engine that just answers people's questions directly, rather than doing lead-gen for the rest of the Internet (with much of the Internet willing to pay for that)? reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparent> Where does Google's ad revenue come from if users give up on waiting for their searches You serve the ads while the answers spin up. reply mrweasel 14 hours agorootparentThat would be kinda sad, given that Google would previously forgo showing ads, if they didn't arrive on time. This is actually a problem I currently have with Ecosia on mobile. I search, get the result, and then the ads pop in, pushing the search results down, causing me to click the ad and not the result that previously occupied that part of the screen. reply voiceblue 15 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think that comment was in regards to AI, I think it was about the blurb that appears instantaneously from Google’s knowledge engine (e.g. when searching a celebrity’s age). reply zitterbewegung 16 hours agorootparentprevI think they just want to have your captured on their platform . If you get all of your answers then why pick a competitor? reply theolivenbaum 14 hours agorootparentThey probably also know that some types of queries are not ad-worth (like age of an actor, etc), while others would never show a box reply derefr 13 hours agorootparentThat's a really good point. Google has likely decided that some query categories are unprofitable-enough already that they can just drop the rest of the expected revenue from them, and instead use them as loss-leaders — aiming to give the customer a better (but zero-revenue) experience today, to increase retention, so they'll come back with positive-revenue-generating queries later. They've just done a rather braindead job of it, with the experience of these loss-leader queries feeling perceptually† worse than a regular SERP page would. It's like a grocery store running a sale on e.g. milk, selling it for below-cost — but then making you have to wait in a line for five minutes in front of the milk cooler to get it. It feels like so much friction that not only wouldn't lure people in; it would push people to avoid that grocer when its milk sales are happening, and shop at other stores instead! --- † I emphasize perceptually here. Even if the total time spent waiting for an AI answer is shorter than the time it would take to load a SERP page, read and select a link that looks like it'll have your answer, click it, load the resulting page, and read it — the AI experience could still feel longer, in large part because \"the ball is in your court\" for a lot of the self-navigated query, with you being given things to look at and click on; while \"the ball is in their court\" for the entirety of the AI response, with just a spinner and no indication of what's happening. As such, I wonder if this could be solved by just running a cute little animation under the AI prompt window: make it look like it's automating the loading of a [blurred to non-identifiability] SERP page, scrolling down, clicking a result, loading an [again blurred] page, highlighting a few random fragments of it, and then transposing them together to form the paragraphs of the answer — before the answer actually snaps into place on top of that animation. If you can predict how long before the AI answers, you can even use that to determine how long the animation should spend dicking around on the pretend SERP page and answer page. reply bilekas 15 hours agorootparentprev> How does Google make money from a search engine that just answers people's questions directly It did what it needed to do to realise the same thing and get their fingers in all the other pies. reply otabdeveloper4 15 hours agorootparentprevGoogle works because it is a monopoly.

As others in this thread already point out, it's extremely easy to use DDG or Bing if you want. reply otabdeveloper4 3 hours agorootparentNo. Google owns your phone and your browser, your email, your video feed and often your office productivity tools too. All human eyeballs go through Google's advertising network first. (Unless you're an Apple-only person.) So for advertisers it makes no sense to budget anything but Google first and foremost. Maybe they'll add some Bing-Yahoo if they have spare money laying around and want to catch the remaining couple percent of the audience. P.S. Search is only a small part of Google's advertising network, and not the most important one nowadays. reply doublerabbit 15 hours agorootparentprev> Competition is just one click away.

Sorry. It is driving people mad via the YouTube algorithms. And it is destroying democracy. reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentDo you have a specific example for Google? The fact that it has been reported by groups like Amnesty International that Facebook helped to enable the ethnic violence in Myanmar makes arguing this sort of point much easier. People want to treat complaints about attention economy companies like they are coming from whiners who just don’t like ad profiles. It is useful to have specific information to remind people of the actual stakes of uncontrolled, personalized propaganda and social manipulation that these companies can enable. So if you have one for Google I’d definitely be interested in adding it to my collection. (I’ll admit some bias, I think they are a little better than Facebook, but that bar is so low, let’s be careful not to trip over it). reply holonsphere 15 hours agorootparentSome of the best examples are too sensitive to share on this forum. Other things get flagged and reported. Some new topics/sources that squeeze by invite the bots. The best arguments for Google's algorithms making people crazy for lay people would be Aaron Swartz like individuals who just go unknown. I can think of atleast 4 individuals new to me the last 6mo ive discovered who used to cover court cases, ran NGOs, or worked as journalists that have been seemingly swept up in what looks like delusions.

The algorithm rewards what you watch, and someone addicted to politics and the culture of outrage around it, will get what they ask for. reply Alupis 15 hours agorootparentIt usually starts off with just content you're overtly interested in. Then, they'll sprinkle in random clips every so many scrolls to guard against overfitting the model and getting stale for the user. Some of those random clips are Outrage Porn designed to get a reaction out of you... You scroll past, then scroll back because \"wtf did I just see?\" - and now you're in. The frequency starts to increase and pretty soon you're shouting at clouds feeling like you're the only one that realizes how crazy everything is... It's hard to keep your feed \"clean\" and dialed into just things that bring you intellectual stimulation or enjoyment. It's not impossible, but it's quit difficult. You constantly have to realign your algorithm lest it goes off into the weeds. reply marcosdumay 15 hours agorootparent> It's hard to keep your feed \"clean\" and dialed into just things that bring you intellectual stimulation or enjoyment. The confusion happens because this can be very easy. All it takes is rarely watching youtube. If you only watch a random video here and there, Google won't push all the bullshit at all. So the people watching many videos, getting the shitty recommendations, and complaining that the internet is crazy end-up sounding insane to everybody else. reply FredPret 14 hours agorootparentprevThe algo will only push outrage on you if you secretly like it enough to spend hours watching that shit. I have consumed more than my fair share of content on Youtube, Instagram, Facebook videos, and TikTok. My timeline is all engineering, spaceships, jumping puppies, and comedians (and not the negative kind). It's an algorithm, it wants you to watch more and click on all the ads. It doesn't care if the world burns, but it also isn't going to push you that way. My statement will only be \"objectively false\" if the algorithm is somehow programmed for political extremism. In reality, each of us is in the driver's seat. People have been spouting crap since time immemorial - doesn't mean you have to watch it. I would suggest a heavy and sustained dose of puppy videos. reply Alupis 14 hours agorootparentHow do you use these short video services? Are you searching for content then watching, or just \"doom scrolling\" while on the toilet? Searching then watching is effectively realigning the feed to your latest and most engaged preferences. Doom scrolling will get worse and worse as time goes on - it appears entirely unavoidable. They pick up on \"positive\" interaction signals such as slowing down while scrolling past a video, scrolling back to a video, letting it play more than once, even downvoting can be a sign of engagement and a catalyst for more of the same... You are right - the algorithm doesn't care if the world burns... it just wants to maximize engagement. That, for most of the human population, means stuff that gets immediate reactions. Unfortunately that often means outrageous material. reply mrweasel 14 hours agorootparentprev> Your algorithm is a reflection of you. Yes and no, you're correct in that it feeds you more of the stuff you engage with, but that's not what it should be going if YouTube cared about the mental well being of it's users. The YouTube algorithm is notorious for not responding to deliberate user input. Say I know that the content I engage with is harmful to my mental health, first step in dealing with the issue. You CANNOT tell YouTube to stop enabling you, even if you try. There are things the algorithm isn't smart enough to understand, or if YouTube is evil, understand that it SHOULD NOT respond to. Example: I wasted a lot of time on Shorts, and videos less than 2 minutes, junk content. So I start hitting \"Not interested\", the algorithm WILL NOT pick up on the thing these videos have in common, that they are short. You can block channels, that works, except that there are thousands of similar channels which YouTube will then just push instead. What I would like to see is YouTube have settings for: What kind of person do you want to be? And then just push the hell out of relevant content, ignoring any level of engagement. I think everyone knows why YouTube won't be doing that. YouTube is a company, they do what's good for the stock price / profit margin. If it hurts the users, they don't care. It's not that they are evil, they just don't give a crap. reply gspencley 14 hours agorootparentprevI'm starting to consider creating different accounts / profiles for my different interests. The problem that I have with YouTube is that it can't know what I'm in the mood for at any given moment and it thinks that if I click on one single video about a sensitive topic that suddenly I want my entire home page to be overrun with recommendations about that. To give a specific example, something that honestly kind of baffles and bothers me is the amount of firearms related videos in my recommendations despite the fact that I never watch them, I don't own any firearms and I keep clicking \"Don't Recommend Channel\" and they never seem to go away. It has to be because the topic is tangentially related somehow to something I've watched, or maybe people who are into firearms overlap with some of the content I watch. But it's the volume and the non-responsiveness to my feedback that annoys me. Another example: my wife and I enjoy watching the Eurovision Song Contest every year. So naturally we've watched a lot of that content in the days and weeks leading up to it. Obviously the algorithm is going to recommend content related to Eurovision, but my home page is completely flooded with these recommendations to the seeming exclusion of most other stuff that I want to watch. And I keep clicking \"Don't Recommend Channel\" on the various \"reaction\" videos that are just feeder content featuring people reacting to the songs and performances ... because I CAN'T STAND reaction videos in general and NEVER watch them. But they keep appearing in the recommendations nonetheless. Recommendation algorithms are a hard problem to solve, for sure. I'm not trying to be unfair to YouTube because I know these recommendations are somehow related to what I do watch. I just know that it feels like 90% of those recommendations miss the mark regardless. YouTube is starting to feel like cable TV these days (\"200 channels and nothing to watch\") where my wife and I often find ourselves just doom scrolling and refreshing the home page (we watch on our TV) hoping that something we're interested in watching at that moment will appear. Often times nothing does and we go do something else. reply gspencley 12 hours agorootparentReplying to myself because I just thought of a 3rd example that is extremely common for me: news channels. I don't watch news on YouTube, ever. If I see a video from a news outlet I automatically click \"Don't Recommend Channel.\" And I've done that with all of the big major news channels like CNN, Fox News, MSNBC etc. But that doesn't stop videos from local affiliates showing up in a never ending game of whack-a-mole. To be fair these do not tend to \"flood\" my recommendations. But I want them to go away all together and I can't seem to make that happen. reply legulere 15 hours agorootparentprevOne example of meta instead of google: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-faceb... reply SkyBelow 15 hours agorootparentprevIt ends up being a reflection in the flaws built into humans. We have many vices. Individuals overcome it, but as a group we are susceptible. We have a long history of deciding where to draw the line between exploiting a vice to control someone and where it becomes letting others live while minding ones own business. We might allow alcohol starting around 18-21, but we ban food companies putting certain addicting drugs in their recipes (but yet allowing others, not fully consistent). Where this algorithm's exploit falls is a new area we haven't really decided upon as a society. Is it like adding cocaine to soda or like adding caffeine to soda? reply mateus1 16 hours agorootparentprevBut the good people are being driven out while the good product are being killed. reply mrguyorama 16 hours agorootparentprevThat does not matter one iota. Google's goal since they bought doubleclick has been to serve more ads and make more cash, and everything is subservient to that goal. If serving more ads reduces the user experience, they will not choose to stop serving those ads, they will choose to reduce the user experience. Companies are not democracies. If every single dev thinks that the user experience matters, but the CEO wants more ads, you will get more ads. It's literally a tyranny. reply phreeza 15 hours agorootparentYou can get away with a lot of things even inside of a tyranny, if you are good at selling to your superiors. So in your example, a dev who wants to improve user experience might have to couch it in terms of how users are likely to come back more often an click on more ads, and if they do this well, they will often be allowed to do the improvements they want. reply hehdhdjehehegwv 15 hours agorootparentprevLeadership however is a monolith: they are all 100% locked into quarterly stock market price as the single criteria for making decisions.

Early adopters excuse this since they value the AI text, realize it's being generated at high expense, and there's no way to make it much faster on the backend. Non-adopters won't value AI text or the technical hurdles. Google is in a hard place - they need to roll the feature out to stay relevant to early adopters of AI. But they can't give good results without making it a huge loss leader - their revenue comes from sending users to spam. They can't seriously commit to a loss leader that counters their entire business model, so they're going to half ass it. That stands to upset established users and early adopters alike, with an unfocused and executive sabotaged Hail Mary. I call this the \"decline of AOL\" phase of Google's lifecycle.

It is similar to the VR race, which has just ended and anyone investing heavily in it would not necessarily be praised by the stock market. Companies like Alphabet, Meta, or Apple have to be seen to be innovating or else their stock will suffer. So, even if they know it is all not going to work they are forced to show they are keeping up. So they suck life of the new tech by deploying billions of USD to hoover up talent and tech and thus asphyxiate competition, especially smaller players. Once the dust settles in a couple of years there will be some leftover tech that might be useful and a whole bunch of patents kept at the ready for the next round of crazy. Google could be doing nothing, but there would be no end to the comments that they are finished and have no future. Funny that nobody expects Oracle or Autodesk to out-hallucinate their competition. I guess they don't because bank ledgers or high-rise designs are best kept away from the tricksters selling another iteration of Mechanical Turk under the guise of \"saving humanity\". Unfortunately for us, unlike previous advances in IT this one make things slower, uses way more energy, and spits out BS.

Is it TCP. No. It is pages laden with excessive amounts of advertising. Google is an advertising company. The problem is the advertising, which causes latency, not TCP. Moreover, they did not \"invent\" this TCP replacement, they borrowed the idea from djb (CurveCP) who may have borrowed it from someone else. CurveCP does better as it encrypts each packet individually, does not require TLS and allows multiple websites to be hosted on the same IP address. No plaintext domainnames on the wire (SNI) required. Nor some elaborate, complex and cumbersome Band-aid like ECH. Google's problem is how to deliver more advertising without affecting www speed, i.e., without web users noticing how much advertising slows the web down. But Google spins this problem as how to \"make the web faster\". It is Google's business, online advertising, that is slowing the web down. Google deliberately adds latency to pages when \"loading\" so that ad auctions can take place first. Advertising is the priority, not reducing latency. reply christkv 15 hours agoparentprevNot yet in Europe it seems. I can’t wait /s.

Apple not so, because they keep it to their iDevice. - Firefox is Mozilla's and Mozilla is a non-profitable organisation. The story as I know it is that in the early days Mozilla became the defacto internet suite as they produced a suite of applications. Email, FTP client and a browser and these were crafted and sustained by volunteers. (This is skipping the predecessor, Netscape). The internet was simple then. HTML and CSS with an lil' bit of Javascript made the internet fine. Everything was open and the rainbow coloured fence of your neighbour was pretty. You could even implement your own renderer and know it would work. In the dozens: https://eylenburg.github.io/browser_engines.htm Introducing Google: they started out just as search engine and that it was. Pretty great at it what it was and their was no other. It's boasted feature was one of that you could rank pages with PageRank although in the long run became unprofitable. The popped dotCom boom had made VC's scared to invest and Silicon Valley was still recovering from the aftermath. Unlike Yahoo, Lycos and other service providers, who all had offered services like email and entertainment subscriptions, survived. Google, as bankruptcy neared had offered to sell to Yahoo for $500k and what a different world we would be in. But this didn't happen. Google then started their up-taking. By introducing advertising to their search engines. The gimmick I recall is \"buying nukes\" as if you searched \"nukes\" you'd get a banner in the right hand side of the page of \"buy nukes on ebay\". Geeky college humour. Eventually, they branched out releasing gMail with beta invites and insanely large inbox sizes where the latter only gave you small amounts of 20mb. And folk flocked to this service. You didn't need 1gb of email storage but hey, you had it. They had it all, a feature rich simple email client. Simple being the key, Simple search engine and your simple website now possible to be seen. As well as vendor lock in. As to change email is as painful to change mobile phone numbers. Dark-UI. You had a exclusive gmail email, a chance to be on top of Googles search and it thrived. The internet existed but wasn't something for everyday everyone but heck was it a good time. Introducing Apple and the iPhone. This was the new strike to the internet. The internet wasn't an everyone thing but it was now. Apple created the iPhone from the previous based Java firmware driven non-smart phones with apps and Google introduces with Android a few years later with their apps. Apple users already being an exclusive clique of the time flocked in masses and this boosted Apple sky high. Eventually major vendors started to suck up to Google as Apple as we know doesn't play ball with the BlackBerry being the business phone, tried! in the end lost as it wasn't innovative enough nor was designed for the consumer market. We now had this fantasy tech but no future internet for it to work. And so Google crafted the next-gen specifications for HTML. HTML5 for the internet - This was to enable the \"future\" and Chrome came with it to carry out these new features. For their phone and for the desktop web browser prior to that you had Internet Explorer or Firefox. Even then Firefox was least popular because Internet Explorer was shipped in Windows and sabotaged. This was a further blow for Mozilla because now as an volunteer organisation with less money now had to implement all these new features while Google already had their thing. This kept Firefox lagging behind and made FireFox less popular as the new rebranded Internet wouldn't work with it. Google with that and advertising money as well as resources could afford to keep implementing, sabotaging and make it painful expiration for anyone to keep up the pace. While this is excluding Mozillas mishandling and not greatest decisions but here we are now, Google dictating the latest internet splash of paint. The younger crowds who adopted Google, adopted Chrome as the browser and the legacy keeps going. Googles vendor lock in for gmail as the same with Canonical's Ubuntu, (which helped Firefox a bit) with its free-cd campaign, and so boosted Linux but ultimately with less money and community support has brought Mozilla to it's knees. reply jfim 16 hours agoprevThe worst part is when it hallucinates an answer.

They want to use it as an oracle where they ask a straightforward question, and get a straightforward correct answer. In reality they're more of a simulator- you describe a scenario with your prompt, and they play it out for you the way it would likely occur in real life. To accurately predict text as they are trained to do, they have to simulate the scenario generating the text, not provide the most correct and simple completion to the text. This is why you can ask it a simple physics question for example, and the default might be to give a wrong answer based on a popular misconception. But tell it that it should answer as Richard Feynman, and it can give the correct answer.

It would also serve as a good platform for other companies to study. Kagi has an AI integration philosophy [1], which, while modest, has successfully navigated us through the current AI cycle and I think helped our users understand what they can expect from us. AI can enhance the search experience, but the core search functionality must be strong and robust first. An LLM grounded in search will only be as good as the search results it gets.

Overall im hoping OpenAI and Microsoft create a chatGPT phone to compete with iPhone and Android. Either they go the Android route (create a phone OS for manufacturers) or build a direct iPhone competitor. The UI/UX would be fairly minimal and ur chatGPT phone would be used as your 2nd brain / your AI friend.

The first real-world application of this innovative technology is set to commence on the S4 railway construction in Hamburg later this year. Source: DB AG / Public domain Berthold Huber, a DB Board Member for Infrastructure, emphasized the dual benefits of the MetaWindow. \"To achieve our climate protection targets, we need to get more traffic on the rails and expand and extend the network,\" emphasized Huber. \"But we can only gain the necessary acceptance from residents if rail transport becomes quieter.

Its design minimizes visual disruptions, aligning better with the environment and reducing public grievances often associated with the construction of conventional noise barriers.

In Europe we've actually made big leaps forward with regulation, building standards for isolation, and abatement laws.

There is basically no one who makes greater kitsch than him. Everything he makes is steeped in the middle class, liberal, mediocrity of someone who points out that things, which everyone agrees are bad, actually are bad. It seriously is something of the worst \"art\" I have ever seen and actually makes me quite sympathetic to the post modernists whose movement is a reaction to people like him. The middle schooler, scribbling on canvas, is at least not trying desperately to impress the most bourgeois group of people the world has ever seen. That alone puts everything he does a serious step above Banksy. reply kmmlng 2 hours agorootparentprevOf course you can find stuff that's high quality, but that is rare.

The actual art is often a bit strange but can be beautiful, and is more interesting than a bare concrete wall or train hull. But I agree with you that virtually all tags are ugly.

By that logic, graffiti artists as regular people who use public infrastructure in the area should as much right to paint on the wall as you do to paint the wall in your house. And you can paint over it if you hate it so much. But its all down to the community. It should not be a crime enforced by a ruling class who nominally owns the wall but doesn't use it, so is totally not actually inconvenienced by it being painted. You are part of the community. So is the artist. The person who owns the wall is mostly likely not. Stop pretending you're on the same side because you think you may also become a millionare by osmosis. reply atoav 2 hours agorootparentprevAs someone with an art degree (with no great admiration for street art per sé) I have to ask one question: Could you imagine that one person's \"defaced\" is another person's \"finally some colors\"? The destruction of property, trespassing etc. is obviously on the wrong side of the law, but on purely aesthetical terms this could be argued either way making it for that narrow category a subjective thing. Proponents of graffiti could argue you cannot deface a faceless thing, opponents would argue they like their lawn short, their fence white, the sky blue. One persons order is another persons prison. Note that I tried to look at the aesthetic question while ignoring the legal question — mainly because you made an aesthetic argument. For many people the two would be entangled however: Something being illegal makes them look at the result unfavourable, even if a similar legal wall mural would strike them as aesthetically superior to the 10 years weathered white wall that it was before. As an art person I really see truly good graffiti, yet I have to notice that heavily graffitied parts of my city are tourist magnets — so many people tend to like those \"defaced\" walls. reply soco 2 hours agorootparentLet's be honest, 99.999% of graffiti is smeared black lines barely recognizable as tags, over more smeared tags and curse words and just dirt. If that is aesthetic, we might have a very different definition of aesthetic than the art schools you mention. Do I see sometimes street art? Yes, but almost never on such places - the real street art is one done on commission (I assume) on some private house walls, while the rest is at best ignored. There's a reason you never see trains stations on Instagram. reply wiseowise 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's easy: Was the graffiti made with approval of the owner of the building? Does it fit general aesthetics of the city? Yes and yes - it's finally some colors. Otherwise it's a vandalism. If it's a public building - it's vandalism, unless it was decided by all people living there. > As an art person I really see truly good graffiti, yet I have to notice that heavily graffitied parts of my city are tourist magnets — so many people tend to like those \"defaced\" walls. Yeah, way to make life hell for residents of the neighborhood. reply kalaksi 20 minutes agorootparentMany cities here also have walls dedicated for graffiti and such to give street artists some space and bring some color. Some small infra-related buildings also have street art done on commission and they look great! But shitty tags and graffitis still exist and my impression has always been that the maker probably wasn't thinking about art or anything deeper for that matter... reply JW_00000 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is pretty ironic to read on a forum called \"Hacker\" News, which also originated as a counter-culture that considered itself creative but was regarded as criminal by the general public. reply helboi4 42 minutes agorootparentFr. God you have to be so boring and pro-authoritarian to really be offended by buildings you don't own and will never have the power to own, being drawn on by the public. Sometimes I think graffiti is nice looking. Sometimes I think its ugly as shit. I would never begrudge someone doing it though, since I appreciate the spirit of reclaiming public spaces by the people who actually live there, who will often never be able to own spaces of their own.

I think local urban expressions like stickers and graffiti is pretty cool. The mainstream prefers ads I guess. reply ldjb 10 hours agorootparentThe impact isn't merely aesthetic. For one thing, it can be costly to remove graffiti. And when it's on publicly owned property, who pays for that removal? The public, of course. If, for example, a train is the target of graffiti, it will often need to be taken out of service. This, then, results in a degraded service to the travelling public. Furthermore, graffiti artists often put themselves in dangerous situations. Numerous people have been seriously injured or killed when doing graffiti. That not only sucks for them, but also has various knock-on effects. Some graffiti art can look really nice, whereas others have little artistic value. Regardless, the negative impacts of graffiti should not be overlooked. reply thuuuomas 10 hours agorootparent> The impact isn't merely aesthetic. For one thing, it can be costly to remove graffiti.

When all released at once, the pressure causes a shockwave that goes boom!

Hooray for basic infrastructure. reply danpalmer 5 hours agoparentI would go further, and say that public transport improves quality of life far more than sound absorbers for public transport do. It's nice that these things exist, but we should be spending money on more public transport, not necessarily on making public transport more palatable to people. I realise that's an unfortunate necessity, but it's clear that people pushing back on public transport just haven't seen its benefits enough. reply Maxion 4 hours agorootparentI think you're missing the point. Many public transport projects are dependant on the community around allowing them to be built, mitigating the impact of said projects allows more public transport to be built. E.g. a tram doesn't go very fast and is also pretty quiet. A train usually runs a lot faster, and causes more noise pollution. If you can mitigate the noise, then you'll probably be able to build the railway instead of the tram. Allowing more capacity, higher speeds, and a better public transport solution. reply eru 1 hour agoprevThey specifically mention railway noise.

People tend to obsess over DB and it's management, but they only control maintenance. All decisions about renovations are made by the government. So what do you want? - Wait years for large renovation projects on all major routes, including lengthy closures for work(the current strategy) - Cancel 25-50%% of all trains permanently, if then people can't travel because it's impossible to get through the door, tough The latter one is the French solution - just run very few trains, regardless of demand. The last time I wanted to travel by train in France, I simply couldn't because all trains on the route for the entire day were 100% sold out. Then there's Spain. The last time I wanted to travel there, I didn't because the first(!) train of the day left at lunchtime and arrived mid-afternoon. reply jamil7 4 hours agoparentprevIt’s also gotten so expensive and unreliable that some people I’ve spoken to are just driving again instead whereas years ago they would have always gone by train.

Do you think it is reasonable for them not not make progress or advancement in anything as long as the ICE delays are not fixed? They can never change a train interior, improve the food menu, or 1000s of other things? This is a totally unreasonable suggestion. The reason for DB reliability problem is 50+ years of infrastructure neglect, fixing it will not be improved by shutting down every other group at DB. Personally having traveled threw Germany many times, its a mostly amazing. Yes sometimes trains are late sometimes, but the trains themselves are great and travel in them is a joy. I think what Germans don't understand is how good they have it compared to many places in the world. reply probably_wrong 2 hours agorootparentSomeone turned on the DB signal[1] so here I am. > sometimes trains are late sometimes, but the trains themselves are great and travel in them is a joy. \"Sometimes\"? Let me tell you about my friends in the German area of NRW. The one that commutes far away regularly gets stranded on the way because the trains arrive so late that there's no connection home till the next day and because, of the two lines that take her home, one is closed. The second one commutes within the city and has decided to buy a car because the SBahn was closed for over a year with a repair that took longer than planned. The other two don't even consider trains in their daily life. My GF at the time had a year-long line closure, we moved to a place with a year-long train closure and I'm living now in an area where my regular train won't run until November (assuming no delay). Yes, DB trains are pretty nice on the inside. Quiet, too. But what good is a nice train that doesn't take me to where I need to go, or at all? If anything, I think those that don't rely on the trains daily fail to realize how bad the situation is. Ten minutes delay on the one ICE trip on holidays? Sure, whatever, it's fine. Ten minutes delay on a five minutes connection to work? Enjoy wasting half an hour of your life every other day, like I did during my studies. Switzerland has cut DB off [2] and Scottish fans received warnings [3] about how unreliable German trains are. It is bad. [1] The DB signal is like the bat signal for comments downplaying DBs issues, but you often don't see it because there's a \"Signalstörung\" and it shows up an hour later.

DB is facing the problem that the network needs substantial overhaul - the problem is that when you do a large-scale renovation, you gotta adhere to current code, not late 19th century code (which is when quite a few of the railways had been built). And that means noise protection anywhere where the tracks are adjacent to residential areas, but NIMBYs will launch intensive protests if they get presented with a massive wall of steel in their backyard - understandably so, these things are an eyesore. So, it's a prerequisite for DB to tackle its problems... because most of them are caused by the aged infrastructure. Right next to Munich, on the route to Mühldorf, there are still mechanical switches in place, built around 1900 [1].

Read Later Nico Roper/Quanta Magazine By Steve Nadis Contributing Writer May 16, 2024 View PDF/Print Mode algorithmscomputer scienceexplainersAll topics Introduction Imagine that you’re sent to a pristine rainforest to carry out a wildlife census. Every time you see an animal, you snap a photo. Your digital camera will track the total number of shots, but you’re only interested in the number of unique animals — all the ones that you haven’t counted already. What’s the best way to get that number? “The obvious solution requires remembering every animal you’ve seen so far and comparing each new animal to the list,” said Lance Fortnow, a computer scientist at the Illinois Institute of Technology. But there are cleverer ways to proceed, he added, because if you have thousands of entries, the obvious approach is far from easy. It gets worse. What if you’re Facebook, and you want to count the number of distinct users who log in each day, even if some of them log in from multiple devices and at multiple times? Now we’re comparing each new login to a list that could run to the billions. In a recent paper, computer scientists have described a new way to approximate the number of distinct entries in a long list, a method that requires remembering only a small number of entries. The algorithm will work for any list where the items come in one at a time — think words in a speech, goods on a conveyor belt or cars on the interstate. The CVM algorithm, named for its creators — Sourav Chakraborty of the Indian Statistical Institute, Vinodchandran Variyam of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and Kuldeep Meel of the University of Toronto — is a significant step toward solving what’s called the distinct elements problem, which computer scientists have grappled with for more than 40 years. It asks for a way to efficiently monitor a stream of elements — the total number of which may exceed available memory — and then estimate the number of unique elements. “The new algorithm is astonishingly simple and easy to implement,” said Andrew McGregor of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. “I wouldn’t be surprised if this became the default way the [distinct elements] problem is approached in practice.” To illustrate both the problem and how the CVM algorithm solves it, imagine that you’re listening to the audiobook of Hamlet. There are 30,557 words in the play. How many are distinct? To find out, you could listen to the play (making frequent use of the pause button), write down each word alphabetically in a notebook, and skip over words already on your list. When you reach the end, you’ll just count the number of words on the list. This approach works, but it requires an amount of memory roughly equal to the number of unique words. In typical data-streaming situations, there could be millions of items to keep track of. “You might not want to store everything,” Variyam said. And that’s where the CVM algorithm can offer an easier way. The trick, he said, is to rely on randomization. Share this article Copied! Newsletter Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inbox Subscribe now Recent newsletters Vinodchandran Variyam helped invent a technique to estimate the number of distinct elements in a stream of data. Craig Chandler Introduction Let’s return to Hamlet, but this time your working memory — consisting of a whiteboard — has room for just 100 words. Once the play starts, you write down the first 100 words you hear, again skipping any repeats. When the space is full, press pause and flip a coin for each word. Heads, and the word stays on the list; tails, and you delete it. After this preliminary round, you’ll have about 50 distinct words left. Now you move forward with what the team calls Round 1. Keep going through Hamlet, adding new words as you go. If you come to a word that’s already on your list, flip a coin again. If it’s tails, delete the word; heads, and the word stays on the list. Proceed in this fashion until you have 100 words on the whiteboard. Then randomly delete about half again, based on the outcome of 100 coin tosses. That concludes Round 1. Next, move to Round 2. Continue as in Round 1, only now we’ll make it harder to keep a word. When you come to a repeated word, flip the coin again. Tails, and you delete it, as before. But if it comes up heads, you’ll flip the coin a second time. Only keep the word if you get a second heads. Once you fill up the board, the round ends with another purge of about half the words, based on 100 coin tosses. In the third round, you’ll need three heads in a row to keep a word. In the fourth round you’ll need four heads in a row. And so on. Related: Scientists Find Optimal Balance of Data Storage and Time Researchers Approach New Speed Limit for Seminal Problem Mathematicians Discover the Perfect Way to Multiply Eventually, in the kth round, you’ll reach the end of Hamlet. The point of the exercise has been to ensure that every word, by virtue of the random selections you’ve made, has the same probability of being there: 1/2k. If, for instance, you have 61 words on your list at the conclusion of Hamlet, and the process took six rounds, you can divide 61 by the probability, 1/26, to estimate the number of distinct words — which comes out to 3,904 in this case. (It’s easy to see how this procedure works: Suppose you start with 100 coins and flip each one individually, keeping only those that come up heads. You’ll end up with close to 50 coins, and if someone divides that number by the probability, ½, they can guess that there were about 100 coins originally.) Variyam and his colleagues mathematically proved that the accuracy of this technique scales with the size of the memory. Hamlet has exactly 3,967 unique words. (They counted.) In experiments using a memory of 100 words, the average estimate after five runs was 3,955 words. With a memory of 1,000 words, the average improved to 3,964. “Of course,” he said, “if the [memory] is so big that it fits all the words, then we can get 100% accuracy.” “This is a great example of how, even for very basic and well-studied problems, there are sometimes very simple but non-obvious solutions still waiting to be discovered,” said William Kuszmaul of Harvard University.

Intuitively I think the key to many computational limitations is making use of randomness. reply pixelmonkey 3 hours agoprevThis algorithm seems to resemble HyperLogLog (and all its variants), which is also cited in the research paper. Using the same insight of the estimation value of tracking whether we've hit a \"run\" of heads or tails, but flipping the idea on its head (heh), it leads to the simpler algorithm described, which is about discarding memorized values on the basis of runs of heads/tails. This also works especially well (that is, efficiently) in the streaming case, allowing you to keep something resembling a \"counter\" for the distinct elements, albeit with a error rate. The benefit of HyperLogLog is that it behaves similarly to a hash set in some respects -- you can add items, count distinct them, and, importantly, merge two HLLs together (union), all the while keeping memory fixed to mere kilobytes even for billion-item sets. In distributed data stores, this is the trick behind Elasticsearch/OpenSearch cardinality agg, as well as behind Redis/Redict with its PFADD/PFMERGE/PFCOUNT. I am not exactly sure how this CVM algorithm compares to HLL, but they got Knuth to review it, and they claim an undergrad can implement it easily, so it must be pretty good! reply hmottestad 1 hour agoparentIt’s also possible to use HLL to estimate the cardinality of joins since it’s possible to estimate both the union and the intersection of two HLLs. http://oertl.github.io/hyperloglog-sketch-estimation-paper/ reply usgroup 2 hours agoprevI found the paper took about as long to read as the blog post and is more informative: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10191 It is about estimating the cardinality of a set of elements derived from a stream.

They counted the distinct words in Hamlet with a memory size of 100 words, about 2.5% of the number to find, and got a result that was off by 2. If you do the same with the whole of Shakespeare, again using 2.5% of the memory needed to hold all the distinct words, is the accuracy better?

Thus, you can subtract one HLL sums from other. This is useful if stream supports deletion. Streams with deletions can be found in log-structured merge trees, for one example, so one can estimate count of distinct elements in all of the LSM tree hierarchy. The algorithm in the paper does not allow for deletions. Also, if one counts statistics of the stream of large elements (say, SHA-512 hashes, 64 bytes per hash), this algorithm requires some storage for elements from this stream, so memory requirement is O(table size * element size). reply drycabinet 39 minutes agoprevDoes finding the number of unique elements in a set actually require comparison of each element with everything else?

For every element, add it to the table (ignore if already exists), and finally, take a count of keys. reply Anduia 13 minutes agoparentUsing a hashtable is effective because you only compare elements within their hash buckets, not the entire set. However, they can become inefficient with very large datasets due to memory usage and processing time, which is where approximate counts shine. reply jangxx 27 minutes agoparentprevUsing a hashtable is the \"normal\" approach mentioned in the article. It works of course, but requires memory to store each unique element (or their hashes). If you have less memory available, the described algorithm can still give a very good approximation. reply theginger 23 minutes agoparentprevThat is fine when you have say 1 million values and only 1000 are unique. But when you have 1 million values and about 900 thousand are unique you are putting more or less the whole data set into memory. reply xwolfi 26 minutes agoparentprevImagine a million elements. How big must your hashtable be ? The article explains it very well, did you miss it ? It's a way to save memory. But to be honest I implemented it, ran it on Hamlet, and it's very wrong, it's barely useful but maybe if you just need a vague idea... reply gh0stcloud 32 minutes agoprevvery interesting solution. A perfect example of how even some very complicated problems can sometimes have simple solutions. Will definitely try to write an implementation of this. The only minor downside to this is that it's obviously not deterministic since it depends on chance. But for many applications where the dataset is so big it doesn't fit in memory, that's probably just a tiny rounding error anyway. reply saulrh 2 hours agoprevHuh, that's a clever twist on reservoir sampling. Neat. reply hum3hum3 1 hour agoprevThe counting/estimstion technique is rather like a floating point number. An integer exponent k and a mantissa of a population. reply kromem 1 hour agoprevAh, so Thanos was just conducting a census. reply biscuit1v9 2 hours agoprev> The trick, he said, is to rely on randomization. > When the space is full, press pause and flip a coin for each word. Heads, and the word stays on the list; tails, and you delete it. I wasn't expecting to go that far: randomization. How can you verify if the answer is good? Only approximation, maybe.. reply seanhunter 2 hours agoparentThe proof is pretty straightforward and is included in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10191 reply HDThoreaun 2 hours agoparentprevYes, the result is an estimation. reply biscuit1v9 44 minutes agorootparentThanks. Just wanted to be sure I didn't misunderstood. reply 8372049 2 hours agoparentprevDid you read the (entire) article? reply 112233 2 hours agoprevAfter skimming Knuth's paper — does the algorithm work if values are hashed, that is, the \"uniform deviate\" is selected deterministically for each unique value of the stream? reply devnonymous 1 hour agoparentNot sure which Knuth paper you're referring to but skimming through the article my understanding is this algorithm works /only/ if the values are hashable. IOW how else does one define unique/distinct values ? reply hcs 1 hour agorootparenthttps://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/cvm-note.pdf Looks like it was posted at the time https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36079213 but not much discussed.

I don't read it as being a hash. reply hcs 1 hour agorootparentI think the analysis relies on independent random \"u\"s, even for the same key. reply dist-epoch 52 minutes agoprevDo they assume any particular distribution of the items? Otherwise Nassim Taleb would like a word with them. reply coldtea 41 minutes agoparentNo, and Taleb is not relevant for this. reply dist-epoch 17 minutes agorootparentIt is if the distribution is extreme. reply coldtea 11 minutes agorootparentIf Hamlet was 100000000 times the word Hamlet and 1 time the word pancake, it would still give an good estimate measurement - even if pancake gets 0. reply aaron695 1 hour agoprevKnuth talks about this paper here - \"The CVM Algorithm for Estimating Distinct Elements in Streams\" - https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/cvm-note.pdf reply matt3210 2 hours agoprev [–] CS guys always wanting to throw away a good system and start from scratch. reply 112233 2 hours agoparentWhich good system are you referring to? reply Miraltar 2 hours agoparentprevWhich good system are we talking about ? reply coldtea 39 minutes agoparentprevYeah, if only we have stuck with those stone wheels from 20,000 B.C. reply baq 2 hours agoparentprev [–] Tell me you didn't read the article without telling me you didn't read the article. ...but actually, I think you didn't even read the headline...? reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
