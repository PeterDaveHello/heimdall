BY LEWIN DAYPUBLISHED SEP 28, 2023 9:06 AM EDT NEWS Getty Images SHARE LEWIN DAY View Lewin Day's Articles rainbowdefault When contemplating the emissions from road vehicles, our first thought is often about the various gases coming out of the tailpipe. However, new research shows that we should be more concerned with the harmful particles that are shed from tires and brakes. Scientists have a good understanding of engine emissions, which typically consist of unburnt fuel, oxides of carbon and nitrogen, and particulate matter related to combustion. However, new research shared by Yale Environment 360 indicates that there may be a whole host of toxic chemicals being shed from tires and brakes that have been largely ignored until now. Even worse, these emissions may be so significant that they actually exceed those from a typical car's exhaust output. A research paper published in 2020 highlighted the impact of tire pollution by examining the plight of coho salmon in West Coast streams. Scientists eventually identified a chemical called 6PPD, typically used in tire manufacturing to slow cracking and degradation. When exposed to ozone in the atmosphere, the chemical transforms into multiple other species, including 6PPD-quinone—which was found to be highly toxic to multiple fish, including coho salmon. The same chemical has since been detected in human urine, though any potential health impacts remain unknown. The discovery of 6PPD-q and its impact has brought new scrutiny to the pollution generated by particles shedding from tires and brakes. In particular, tire rubber is made up of over 400 different chemical compounds, many of which are known to have negative effects on human health. Particulate emissions from tires—and, to a lesser extent, brakes—are becoming a new focus for researchers looking into automobile pollution. New research efforts are only just beginning to reveal the impact of near-invisible tire and brake dust. A report from the Pew Charitable Trust found that 78 percent of ocean microplastics are from synthetic tire rubber. These toxic particles often end up ingested by marine animals, where they can cause neurological effects, behavioral changes, and abnormal growth. Meanwhile, British firm Emissions Analytics spent three years studying tires. The group found that a single car's four tires collectively release 1 trillion \"ultrafine\" particles for every single kilometer (0.6 miles) driven. These particles, under 100 nanometers in size, are so tiny that they can pass directly through the lungs and into the blood. They can even cross the body's blood-brain barrier. The Imperial College London has also studied the issue, noting that \"There is emerging evidence that tire wear particles and other particulate matter may contribute to a range of negative health impacts including heart, lung, developmental, reproductive, and cancer outcomes.” It's an emissions problem that won't go away with the transition to EVs, either. According to data from Emissions Analytics, EVs tend to shed around 20 percent more from their tires due to their higher weight and high torque compared to traditional internal combustion engine-powered vehicles. Indeed, the scale of these emissions is significant. Particulate emissions from tires and brakes, particularly in the PM2.5 and PM10 size ranges, are believed to exceed the mass of tailpipe emissions from modern vehicle fleets, as per a study published in Science of the Total Environment this year. This issue has largely flown under the radar until recently. Tailpipe emissions are easy to study, simply requiring the capture or sensing of gases directly at the engine's exhaust. Capturing the fine particulates emitted from tires and brakes is altogether more difficult. Doing so in a way that accurately reflects the quantity of those emissions is yet harder. Such pollution is perhaps unlikely to have a direct impact on issues like climate change, but the potential toxicity for humans, animals, and the broader environment is a prime concern. Regulators are already scrambling to tackle this issue, heretofore largely ignored by governments around the world. In the EU, the Euro 7 standards will regulate tire and brake emissions from 2025. In the U.S., the California EPA will require tire manufacturers to find an alternative chemical to 6PPD by 2024, to help reduce 6PPD-q entering the environment going forward. In turn, manufacturers are exploring everything from alternate tire compositions to special electrostatic methods to capture particulate output. Expect this issue to gain greater prominence in coming years as regulators have more accurate data to act upon. There is great scope to slash this form of pollution if we properly understand the impacts of our cars in full. Got a tip?

Noise was perfectly tolerable, but I could not use my back porch, because after just a few weeks, everything had a fine coating of black dust. I could not keep my windows open in the summer. I was certainly breathing this vile shit the entire time I lived there.This doesn&#x27;t surprise me in the least. Every time it rained you could see streaks of black sediment trails where rivulets would collect and concentrate it. It flowed completely unfiltered straight into the ocean. Poison.The negative externalities around cars are incomprehensibly huge. And yet, we have more of them than ever, they are getting bigger and bigger, and they laugh in our face with \"green leaf\" or \"PZEV\" decals. It&#x27;s demonic. reply RGamma 10 hours agoparentI recently had the pleasure to vacation on a car-free island (few thousand inhabitants including tourists).Only motorized vehicles allowed are a handfull small electric transporters for logistics (and construction vehicles, ambulance).Turns out the space gained from lack of car infrastructure increases space efficiency by a lot (not that that wasn&#x27;t obvious from theory).It really was bliss and it makes me despise the status quo so much more fervently.

Feels like the next generation is seeing this now and things are slowly starting to change in some countries. Not sure how fast we can undo decades of damage and corporate brainwashing though. reply koolba 7 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s always this circular logic where \"I need my car because the supermarket is an hour walk\" but the supermarket is an hour walk because everyone drives.If there’s no roads and vehicles, how does the food get to the supermarket? reply Gigachad 7 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a huge gap between \"literally no roads or vehicles of any kind\" and \"I have to use my car to get anywhere\".These bad faith arguments are tiring. reply afuchs 7 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a bit of a non sequitur.Roads and streets existed before cars. Even then, that ignores that the same location can be traveled to through different means. Goods can be delivered to a store by a van even if most customers arrive on foot or by public transportation.There are streets within north America which ban passenger vehicles but still allow trucks and vans for deliveries. reply apexalpha 3 hours agorootparentprevIn the Netherlands many shops sit in pedestrianized areas. The local government sets specific times, mostly low-traffic hours such as between 07:00 and 11:00 to open the area to trucks and vans to resupply shops.The other times these are closed with things like this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lowist.be&#x2F;app&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;Meir-antwerpen-4-1024x... reply defrost 7 hours agorootparentprevYou can still have light roadways, people walking on them mixed with bikes and electric scooters, small electric cars, etc.You can still stock supermarkets, etc, with larger vehicles that only run once a day or every few days depending on demand, etc.It&#x27;s common in places other than the US with it&#x27;s hyper car centric development to have more walkable spaces. reply johnloeber 8 hours agorootparentprevWhere was this island?

I&#x27;ve lived in Los Angeles my whole life and the difference that clean air standards make is obvious. The black dust isn&#x27;t just tire and brake dust. It&#x27;s also soot and it used to be much much worse.Nothing is a silver bullet but I&#x27;ll be much happier when we&#x27;re done with ICE noise and exhaust. reply bmitc 12 hours agorootparent> This sentiment is just contrarianism, I think.I really don&#x27;t think it is. We&#x27;re thrusting ourselves into just new problems. Yes, we move away from old problems that gas-powered cars have, but we move into new problems. For one, EVs perpetuate the idea of the car, which is perhaps the most dangerous part. Then, there&#x27;s all sorts of new things like building out the infrastructure required for EVs and mining the new materials. For example, have you looked into the areas where lithium mining occurs? It is not a clean process and brings its own new problems, especially for the local people. You have foreign owned and operated companies move in and suck out manufactured value from the land, all the while polluting the local ecosystem. It&#x27;s oil all over again.It isn&#x27;t contrarianism to point out that a solution is not the solution everyone thinks it is. Yes, we should probably switch to EVs, but we should be switching away from cars as a whole. But we&#x27;re not. Cars are selling more than ever. It&#x27;s not contrarianism to simply look at facts rather than hype. reply sokoloff 12 hours agorootparentCars are selling, despite their high economic price, because they&#x27;re incredibly useful.Make competing modes of transit at least one of more useful at no more cost or no less utility but at a lower cost and people will switch incredibly quickly. That&#x27;s a tall order, because the modern automobile is a wonder of transport speed, comfort, and convenience. reply wizofaus 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d only add \"...because they&#x27;re incredibly useful, AND government policy has consistently favoured such a mode of transport over all other alternatives\". The amount spent by governments on maintaining road infrastructure dwarfs all other transport spending, the amount of land dedicated to parking and driving space is mindboggling, and of course the amount spent on ensuring the global oil industry has been able to reliably and safely deliver fuel to vehicles is beyond comprehension* (and almost certainly one of the reasons the transition to EVs will be slower than technology might otherwise allow - vested interests with billions to lose will do anything to keep their share of the spoils). Not to mention the fact that we&#x27;ve yet to actually start truly paying for the long term environmental and health costs of allowing our cities to be so dominated by a single mode of transport.*) it&#x27;s estimated up to 20% of the US&#x27;s defence budget is spent protecting oil supplies for a start, which effectively acts as a subsidy of around 70c a gallon. reply yokem55 10 hours agorootparentYou aren&#x27;t wrong that government support of automotive transport is immense. But that government support comes from decades of popular electoral support for those policies from all across of the political spectrum. Why? Because cars give people more convenient and independent transportation then just about any other mode. And people push their politicians and representatives to support that kind of transportation.If you want to undo the car centric culture and economy, you cannot just ignore the broad base of popular support it enjoys. reply ramblenode 3 hours agorootparent> Why? Because cars give people more convenient and independent transportation then just about any other mode.This is kind of a chicken and egg problem.The value of a car is proportional to the extent of the road network. There is no value (for most cars) in isolation.The original push for government investment in car-friendly infrastructure and highways was from industrialists, technocrats, and military minds. It was top-down planning, not bottom-up. After those major infrastructure investments (and divestments from commuter rail), the car was an obvious choice. Everything after that was self-reinforcing: more cars -> more roads -> more cars -> more roads. Of course if you already own a car then it is a sunk cost and you will prefer the government spend more on car infrastructure to benefit you, further perpetuating the investment cycle.If the initial circumstances had been different (maybe progress in electrification proceeded a little faster and oil refining a little slower) then public transit and urban planning might have developed differently and the car would not be as important as it is now (practically a necessity in most of the US). reply wizofaus 9 hours agorootparentprevSure, there&#x27;s an element of that. But the idea that government policy has been primarily driven by what would produce the \"best\" outcome as far as transport options go that the population actually want is a little naive. And of course what we all want is convenience and comfort for ourselves while not having to deal with the downsides (or impossibility) of providing it for everyone.I&#x27;m happy to accept the reality that currently we have no form of alternative transport technology that offers the same comfort & convenience of the car - but I also believe we&#x27;d&#x27;ve been better off in the long run if public spending hadn&#x27;t been so grotesquely skewed in favour of that particular option - other technologies would have had a better chance to come to the fore (e.g. why have e-bikes&#x2F;e-scooters taken so long to become popular - there&#x27;s no particular reason I know of they couldn&#x27;t have been a big part of our transport network 20 or 30 years ago), we could have laid out our cities so we didn&#x27;t need to travel such huge distances on a regular basis (vs, e.g. occasional long-distance travel between dense hubs where most facilities and services could be accessed via walking&#x2F;cycling etc.), goods transportation could&#x27;ve been revolutionised by dedicated automated networks etc. etc. For me the most convincing argument that exists against the size (and reach) of government power that we&#x27;ve become accustomed to is that so many opportunities for a better balance of transportation options have been lost to a virtually single-minded focus by the powers-that-be over the last 70 or 80 years on private cars above all else. reply jeromegv 10 hours agorootparentprevBut we also built our society to make the car more convenient. Can’t remember the ratio but the amount of parking space available per car is absolutely insane. That means a relatively cheap access to put your giant car almost anywhere you go. Most cities are built around that idea and that makes other form of transportations almost impractical.So yes the car is convenient but we also built many things to make it more convenient. In places where subways&#x2F;rapid transit are made more convenient, there’s of course less parking and less road space and naturally % of car ownership goes downIt’s a choice. It’s not naturally always based on the merit of the car. reply carapace 9 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s originally the result of a deliberate domestic propaganda campaign, cf. \"The Real Reason Jaywalking Is A Crime\" (Adam Ruins Everything) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vxopfjXkArMIf we did it once for cars we could do it again agin &#x27;em. reply brewdad 9 hours agorootparentprevI’ve been looking at places for retirement where I can live car-free or at least very car-lite. There are very few places in the US where this will be possible in my lifetime. Absolutely, let’s more towards an EV future because that’s the best we’ll do in most people’s lifetimes but we can’t expect that change to fix what we’ve spent 100 years building. It needs to be seen as step one of many yet so many Americans are fighting against taking even that step. reply TedDoesntTalk 5 hours agorootparentI’ve had several elderly relatives live without cars in apartment buildings in major US cities. reply rangledangle 10 hours agorootparentprevCars are only useful because America foolishly built and rebuilt around cars, instead of humans. There were even places that functioned perfectly fine with transit and walking, destroyed and replaced with infrastructure for cars.Undoing our mistake is always an option. reply geraldwhen 8 hours agorootparentUS public transit is ruled by homeless and criminals. Constant stabbing, sexual assault, robbery, and stalking.I will not take my kids on any transit where they might be assaulted by a naked homeless man. America will never have safe public transit because it lacks the will to handle the mentally ill and addicts. reply wizofaus 8 hours agorootparentIf the city you live in has been entirely designed around private motor vehicles and lacks any decent transit network (LA being the obvious example), no amount of investment into helping the mentally ill and drug addicts is going to make transit an attractive option for more than a tiny percentage of the population.Thankfully in Australia&#x27;s biggest cities our public transport systems are generally clean and safe to use - but a) they&#x27;re not always super reliable, despite some improvements in recent years b) they&#x27;re often poorly interconnected, meaning I could potentially do 80% of the journey sitting in comfort on a train, but spend 3 times longer than it would take to drive trying to deal with getting to&#x2F;from train stations and c) there are still huge areas of said cities that are fairly poorly served by trains, and buses will always be a second rate way of getting around. Oh and d) you can&#x27;t carry v. large items or animals on most public transport (*). All solvable problems, some easier than others, but there&#x27;s a distinct lack of real political will to do so.(*) e.g. it&#x27;d be a 15 min train ride to take my dog to the beach from where I live, but she&#x27;s not a service animal so wouldn&#x27;t even be allowed on, despite taking up less space than a human. reply wizofaus 4 hours agorootparent(Ooh, I actually just looked it up - you are actually allowed to take dogs on trains here, though they&#x27;re supposed to be muzzled. Never seen anyone do so though, and I&#x27;m quite sure they wouldn&#x27;t be allowed on buses). replymaest 10 hours agorootparentprev> because the modern automobile is a wonder of transport speed, comfort, and convenience.It&#x27;s also heavily subsidised and its cost does not include a signficant chunk of externalities.Also, this has been discussed to death, but a large chunk of car usage can be replaced by other modes of transportation. However, that transition requires upfront infrastructural investment.Sadly, arguments like yours ensure that investment won&#x27;t happen. So, externalities will keep piling up, until the situation will get dire enough that 1. it can&#x27;t be ignored anymore and 2. it&#x27;s too late to meaningfully undo the damage. reply Tostino 9 hours agorootparentThink of how differently the 20th century would have played out if we didn&#x27;t have such a demand for oil. reply ZeroGravitas 3 hours agorootparentFor example if you google \"why did Japan enter WW2\" the summary answer is:> \"Faced with severe shortages of oil .. Japan decided to attack the United States and British forces in Asia and seize the resources of Southeast Asia.\" reply ffgjgf1 34 minutes agorootparentIt’s the other way around. They lost access to oil because they entered WW2.Had they not decided to invade Indochina (and China before that) US wouldn’t have embargoed oil exports to Japan. reply efreak 7 hours agorootparentprevTaking the bus is inconvenient, especially in Los Angeles. We do not have a great public transit system. However, it is far cheaper than car insurance. One bus ride is $1.75 these days, which is quite a bit--but it also includes transfers up to at least an hour after you get on. I usually get a ride to work, and I take the bus home daily, except on the rare occasion I manage to get a ride home with someone at work. *I pay $0 in car insurance, gas, maintenance*. I pay $1.75 for the bus on most days, while others might have to pay $3.5&#x2F;day; A day pass is $5 if you need to make a third trip during the day, or go backwards for shopping (taking the same line in the opposite direction doesn&#x27;t count for a transfer) reply adrianN 6 hours agorootparentprevIf you spend a hundred years optimizing your infrastructure for one mode of transport while disregarding all others, it&#x27;s not surprising that it&#x27;s the most convenient, or indeed the only possible, mode of transport for a majority of people. reply midasuni 11 hours agorootparentprevCars have such a low price because the cost of them is not born by the person purchasing them. reply listenallyall 10 hours agorootparentAre there any large-scale public transportation systems that aren&#x27;t reliant on huge government subsidies?London: 3.6b pounds https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=london+tube+government+subsi...New York: $7.2 billion https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.mta.info&#x2F;budget&#x2F;MTA-operating-budget-basicsAmsterdam: 370m euros for 3 months service https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.railjournal.com&#x2F;financial&#x2F;dutch-government-provi....Ok, Hong Kong appears to turn a profit. reply woodruffw 8 hours agorootparentThis is the wrong question: the right question is whether public transit is more subsidized per passenger-mile (or freight mile) than our road networks.(Even more abstractly, it doesn’t matter whether or not public transit is highly subsidized, so long as the positive externalities of that subsidization are deemed worth it. You don’t get to the size and density (and corresponding economic output) of cities like NYC by allocating personal parking space for every resident.) reply dukeyukey 10 hours agorootparentprevNot many, especially if you include car travel - very few roads are privately built, compared to what the government does. reply graywh 8 hours agorootparentprevWe&#x27;ve also engineered our society to make cars too convenient and necessary. reply jh00ker 11 hours agorootparentprevOne application of (EV) cars is the robotaxi. Once this solution reaches critical mass, car ownership as we see it today will drop off.If I can send my car out to be a robotaxi while I&#x27;m at work and&#x2F;or :^) asleep, then how much do I care that MY specific vehicle return to bring ME home, when I could just use any other robotaxi available? So then I don&#x27;t own a car at all and ownership elsewhere falls and the number of total cars drops to the number needed to handle only the maximum number of simultaneous rides. reply bmitc 11 hours agorootparentRobotaxis don&#x27;t have anything to do with and certainly aren&#x27;t dependent upon EVs. I highly doubt robotaxis ever make it. And at that point, why not invest in other infrastructure. It&#x27;s pointless to have big vehicles carrying one or two people. reply abecedarius 10 hours agorootparentOnce cars start being designed for robotaxi use, it makes economic sense to be much smaller: most rides are one-passenger. (Though who knows what crazy outcomes you end up with under the regulators.) reply xmcqdpt2 9 hours agorootparentMost car trips today are single person and yet cars are enormous and getting bigger all the time. It&#x27;s not the regulators, it&#x27;s the consumers that want the crazy outcomes. reply abecedarius 9 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;small-cars-are-getting-huge-ar... reply bmitc 9 hours agorootparentprevI doubt that&#x27;s the case. And how would that work?If we look at the economics of Uber and Uber Eats, we see that they have shifted to ride sharing and also delivery sharing. In that, it makes more sense to bundle up multiple people and deliveries into one. Doesn&#x27;t that sound a whole lot like buses? reply abecedarius 9 hours agorootparentUber has drivers. There&#x27;s probably some reason to customize car design for taxis, I&#x27;m not sure, but that&#x27;s a modest difference relative to no driver and the greater expected scale of supplanting most human driving in time.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.templetons.com&#x2F;brad&#x2F;robocars&#x2F;design-change.html is very old and there are newer discussions, but I&#x27;m too lazy to find them for you. Also michaelmrose&#x27;s answer. reply bmitc 6 hours agorootparentWhether Uber has drivers or had automated drivers doesn&#x27;t really matter. I think they show that there isn&#x27;t much business in point-to-point \"automated\" car rides. reply michaelmrose 9 hours agorootparentprevThis is an excellent point here are a few more.EVs are usually designed for consumers convenience insofar as being able to travel a substantial distance between charges to accommodate a minority of actual use when user may need to travel further than the average commute inside the city. A company that operates a fleet of taxis can purchase a very large number of short jaunt single&#x2F;dual passenger EV and a much smaller number of large vehicles and task the former with the majority of rides either charging frequently when unused or hot swapping batteries when theirs get low. Therefore weight and ergo tire dust might be decreased even more so than one might imagine from size alone due to the reduced battery needs.One might also suppose that in exclusively urban environments it might make sense to provide harder tires designed to produce less dust and less aggressive driving than human drivers to the same end. reply walleeee 7 hours agorootparentprevthis framing, in making no reference to the thermodynamics of transportation, or of the human economy in general, mistakes mythology for realitypursuit of convenience and immediate utility with scarcely a thought for consequences propels us toward hard physical limits at speed reply ltbarcly3 11 hours agorootparentprev> It isn&#x27;t contrarianism to point out that a solution is not the solution everyone thinks it is.Literally nobody thinks that EV&#x27;s will reduce microplastics. What are you even talking about?EV&#x27;s have the potential to dramatically reduce our reliance on gasoline. Current EV technology is far from perfect, but do you think people will just stop having personal transportation? Do you think it&#x27;s better to keep using gasoline cars forever? So you agree that some kind of non-gasoline personal vehicle is likely to be dominant for some time as a method of personal transportation, unless you are just ignoring reality completely or think that people will magically change how they live in even more fundamental ways without incentives to do so, which is magical thinking. So EVs are inevitable, since there is no other credible alternative to gasoline personal vehicles that is even proposed, and EVs are starting to displace gas vehicles in significant numbers.So keep shouting as much as you like about how we need to &#x27;stop normalizing the idea of a car&#x27; but just realize that less than a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of 1% of the world will even bother to listen to it, and in the meantime we are likely to end up building several billion electric cars before another alternative comes around. If you want to change the world, develop the technology that makes it make sense to act the way you want people to act, because nothing else will persuade anybody. reply bmitc 11 hours agorootparent> Literally nobody thinks that EV&#x27;s will reduce microplastics. What are you even talking about?Not that, for starters.Is there data that proves inconclusively that electric vehicles AND the new infrastructure and mining and every other systematic thing that comes along with them and doesn&#x27;t currently exist is actually (not just hopes and dreams) less impactful on the environment? Because as far as I can tell, your comment relies on that, and I haven&#x27;t seen that data. I could care less about holding on to gas-guzzling cars. I would just like to understand things better before jumping headlong into a \"solution\" that may or may not be any better. And there are massive incentives for companies to jump into EVs, so there is a lot of conflict of interest with EVs. Can corporations and investors be trusted when they stand to make a fortune?Again, my point is to reach an understanding. I do not currently understand why EVs are some bastion of hope when it comes to cars. The best data that I have seen does not account for disposal of batteries nor the mining, long term maintenance and upkeep and continual use of EVs, infrastructure, etc. when it comes to EVs. And if they are better, then where is the crossover point when all this is considered? Is it 10 years? 50 years?And yes, I do think re-enforcing the car is not a good idea. You can think it&#x27;s unrealistic, and sure, in the short term it probably is. But we shouldn&#x27;t just throw our hands up and reach for a new \"solution\" that just brings new problems. reply TheBigSalad 10 hours agorootparentIt is a fact that EVs are better for the environment and will be even more better once certain infrastructure is built out. There&#x27;s no reason to shit on an improvement just because it&#x27;s not a cure. The data is a quick search away if you&#x27;re actually interested. reply bmitc 10 hours agorootparentWell, I have looked, so if you don&#x27;t mind pointing to data that addresses what I mentioned then that would be appreciated.It is hard to find, but what I have found is that EVs cross over, in terms of emissions, around 6-24 months into ownership over ICE vehicles. This accounts for manufacturing to use. As far as I could tell, it does not take into account the new mining required, the new manufacturing centers, the new infrastructure, battery disposal, end of life scenarios, etc. Basically, what I&#x27;ve already said.These are systems. Yes, in isolation EVs are better than ICEs. As you start to broaden the viewpoint, I think things get a loss less definitive such that the wins become a lot less impactful.Being honest, I think the main reason that EVs have so much hype is that because people plan on making a lot of money from the lithium and other mines and selling the EVs. reply TheBigSalad 6 hours agorootparentDid you know the lithium in batteries is 95% recyclable? So even if lithium mining is dirty, the amount needed for 2 cars might actually be used in 8 or more cars over time. Hopefully we find something even better for batteries. replyip26 10 hours agorootparentprevYour problem with EVs is that they don’t eliminate the idea of cars? Let me guess, your problem with the Impossible Burger is that it doesn’t eliminate the idea of eating meat?Entangling ideology with progress is a recipe for getting nothing at all. We see this consistently in climate activism and drug activism. If you try to use a crisis (say, global warming) as a wedge to force your ideology (say, austerity) on the public, you get zero progress on said crisis. reply zbentley 9 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a disingenuous response. The idea of cars and car culture have significant negative externalities (the tire pollution in TFA&#x2F;GP, shitty urban planning, classism&#x2F;marginalization of people who can&#x27;t own cars, and so on). Those externalities might be worth it, or they might not.But that&#x27;s not \"entangling ideology with progress\", that&#x27;s just ... pointing out the drawbacks of a progressive initiative (EVs).Put another way, the idea of a burger decoupled from the beef industry has few negative externalities. The idea of a car decoupled from fossil fuels does. reply matsemann 3 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that you get what you give incentives for.Right now, there&#x27;s a big push to move to EVs. However, in the long run you might end up with more cars total. As the old cars aren&#x27;t going away for a while. So you&#x27;re kinda pushing a even heavier car dependence on society. All for a small net gain of reducing a few ICE vehicles.If the same subsidies were also applied to (electric) bikes, public transit etc it would instead actually shift behavior.EVs aren&#x27;t saving society. They&#x27;re saving the car industry. reply oatmeal1 12 hours agorootparentprevGenerally agreed, but the noise from cars is mostly friction and turbulence (and honking&#x2F;sirens). Switching to electric won&#x27;t solve that. reply Kirby64 11 hours agorootparentThe car noise problem is partially solved (or improved) by EVs, actually. The tires used on EVs tend to be efficient (low rolling resistance), which translates to less noisy tires. Additionally, their body shape tends to aim towards very aerodynamic so they have less turbulence noise. If they didn&#x27;t do this, their efficiency would be much worse so it essentially becomes a necessity.It&#x27;s pretty evident when you drive next to a large vehicle with knobby tires meant for off-roading (Jeeps seem to commonly have these). The tire noise is easily MUCH louder, even ignoring any engine noise.The other thing, broadly, is road construction can lead to a huge difference in noise from highways. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve experienced huge differences depending on the road surface. reply ehnto 9 hours agorootparentI think it is marginally reduced, definitely not solved. It also depends on the tires a consumer puts on their EV once it leaves the factory, and anything about 50kmph is still very noisy.I think that is good in one aspect though, road noise is the only warning you get that an EV is approaching, which in a PED&#x2F;Cylcing friendly city is important. reply Kirby64 5 hours agorootparentEVs already need to make noise at 19mph or under in the US.Personally, I&#x27;d prefer strongly if road noise were eliminated entirely. It&#x27;d lead to a better society broadly by reducing noise pollution. Ped&#x2F;cyclist safety is better handled by other policies than \"just make more noise\" IMO. reply jayd16 10 hours agorootparentprevYou can hear the difference with your own ears. Even if a freeway sounds the same, it&#x27;s obviously different when an EV rolls through the alley or shared driveway vs an ICE car.Not to mention the jerks intentionally making noise with loud engine mods but I guess there&#x27;s no getting rid of them. reply wizofaus 11 hours agorootparentprevI would think having a vehicle be entirely electric must allow more options in terms of car body shape and even tyre shape&#x2F;material that could possible reduce noise (and particulate) pollution even further. And certainly if we could reduce the vehicle weight (I gather the current generation of EVs typically weigh 25%+ more than their ICE equivalents - and cars have generally been getting heavier over the last couple of decades anyway, which is a trend that we desperately need to reverse, and won&#x27;t happen without legislation). Having said that, as a cyclist the idea of not being able to hear cars around me is somewhat disconcerting. reply ehnto 8 hours agorootparentI have no trouble hearing EVs approaching, they sound identical to modern ICE, which is to say 90% road noise.Some ICE cars are noisier by choice of course but modern commuter cars are very quiet at the exhaust typically, the road noise is the dominant noise.I have cars driving past me at about 50kph right now, I am barely hearing the engine for about 3 seconds or less as it passes, and the road noise continues to be audible for about 20-30 seconds. Pretty much all I am hearing is road noise. Same was true when I lived near a highway. Just a whooshing blob of road noise. reply teo_zero 4 hours agorootparentDriving both a gasoline car and an EV, I can surely tell you that pedestrians get out of the way when I approach with the former much more often than with the latter. So they are no identical. Of course where I live there&#x27;s no law-mandated minimum noise level for EVs. reply bmitc 12 hours agorootparentprev> the noise from cars is mostly friction and turbulenceAgreed.

This proposed standard applies to EVs and to those HVs that are capable of propulsion in any forward or reverse gear without the vehicle&#x27;s ICE operating. The PSEA requires NHTSA to establish performance requirements for an alert sound that is recognizable as motor vehicle in operation that allows blind and other pedestrians to reasonably detect a nearby EV or HV operating below the crossover speed. The crossover speed is the speed at which tire noise, wind noise, and other factors eliminate the need for a separate alert sound.>[...]> This standard will ensure that blind, visually-impaired, and other pedestrians are able to detect and recognize nearby hybrid and electric vehicles by requiring that hybrid and electric vehicles emit sound that pedestrians will be able to hear in a range of ambient environments and contain acoustic signal content that pedestrians will recognize as being emitted from a vehicle. The proposed standard establishes minimum sound requirements for hybrid and electric vehicles when operating under 30 kilometers per hour (km&#x2F;h) (18 mph), when the vehicle&#x27;s starting system is activated but the vehicle is stationary, and when the vehicle is operating in reverse.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.regulations.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;NHTSA-2011-0148-0075 reply adrianN 3 hours agorootparentIn residential areas 30 is the usual speed limit where I live. reply kwhitefoot 11 hours agorootparentprevPeople on the outside can hear it though. reply bmitc 11 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think they can unless the car is not moving.

Way to miss the point. reply bmitc 8 hours agorootparentAnd the overall point has been that is literally in the noise. replydublin 9 hours agorootparentprevDue to their vastly greater mass and torque, EVs produce far more tire pollution than ICE vehicles do. In addition to that, tire dust is a far larger part of the overall pollution from operating a car than even the emissions from an ICE car. \"Research done by UK-based independent testing company Emissions Analytics showed that used tyres produce 36 milligrams of particles each kilometre, which is nearly 2,000 times higher than the 0.02 mg&#x2F;km average from exhausts.\"Article here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earth.org&#x2F;tyre-pollution&#x2F; Research here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emissionsanalytics.com&#x2F;tyre-emissions reply throwaway5959 3 hours agorootparentWell, there are no emissions from an EV, so obviously the tire pollution will be larger than the nonexistent tailpipe emissions.

But our broken economic system has flipped this around and made suburbs extremely artificially cheap, while making most of the building practices that make denser walkable neighborhoods possible illegal under building codes and local ordinances. reply adrianN 6 hours agorootparentA first step might be allowing people to build something other than single family homes in locations where there is demand for housing. reply yowlingcat 13 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s broken.

Stop building stroads[0]. Liberalize the zoning code and allow mixed-use development. Get rid of parking minimums.The upside of how sparse American suburbs are is that we can repurpose all the junk&#x2F;wasted land with normal market incentives. Roads can be thinned and the land handed back to the owners of that land, along with the setbacks that are used to force people to maintain water-intensive lawns[1]. Upzoned buildings can be redeveloped to higher density or turned into small commercial stores as market forces dictate. Anyone who wants to hold out can still do so.None of this requires absolutely banning cars[2]. People will stop driving as cars become less necessary for daily suburban life. Road trips can still happen. So instead of families with three or four cars, maybe they only have one or two. As car infrastructure is used less, it can be repurposed for transit networks that don&#x27;t suck - i.e. BRT, light rail, or tram systems with dedicated rights of way.\"15 minute city\" doesn&#x27;t mean \"you should only ever travel 15 minutes on foot and anything further will be stopped by the pollution police\".

This may sound idealistic (like the other comments mentioned) but I think we just have to reduce our energy footprint and then many solutions will be green again.One great example (some will say absurd and impractical) is just using energy whenever it is available, with minimum storage. That means cooking, heating water etc. during the day (or when the wind is high) and only using lighting and low-energy devices at night. Factories could work on a similar principle (producing more in the summer) but then we would have to rearrange a lot more stuff to suit the seasonal renewable energy production capabilities.This may sound absurd but it only shows how much we are locked in our way of thinking about how reality is supposed to work, not what it is.

If my memory doesn&#x27;t fail me, there was an article on HN recently that covered how EVs are environmentally more friendly, but health wise worse exactly because they generate more tire particles. reply Kirby64 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d like to see if that included brake particulates. My understanding is brake particulates is a large contributor to the mix of &#x27;unhealthy ultra-fine dust&#x27; from cars. Most EVs should bring down the brake dust to almost zero, since the vast majority of braking is done via regenerative braking. reply burkaman 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d be interested to see it, that&#x27;s not an obvious conclusion to me. The health difference of an EV is a percentage increase in tire particles but a complete absence of tailpipe emissions. I would not expect tire particles to be the more significant factor, especially when the impacts of microplastics are so unknown.Tailpipe emissions are a significant problem (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iopscience.iop.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1088&#x2F;1748-9326&#x2F;ab35fc), and I know this is an extreme example but you can literally kill yourself by just leaving a car running in an enclosed space. EV tailpipe emissions are not fully replaced by electricity generation emissions, even if you get your power from 100% coal (and you don&#x27;t).

It’s not really a problem if it would take decades, as governments do tend to exist for decades and do plan accordingly.But what we cannot do is pretend that cars are inherently superior, ignoring the unprecedented investment we made in highways to make that happen.But it also isn’t the case that improvements will take decades. Maybe solving the problem completely would, but local governments can convert big dangerous streets in to walkable areas with safer bike transport in just a few years or less.Solving the whole problem would take decades but then, governments do tend to deal in decades long plans when needed.

However, almost all tires are some hybrid of the two. Generally, natural rubber is used in the construction of the tire \"carcass\" and sidewalls while synthetic rubber (compounded with a gazillion and one other things) is used to construct the tread.The basic issues are pretty intuitive:* The supply of natural rubber is constrained by the ability to grow the plants which produce it.* It&#x27;s hard to make synthetic rubber with polymer chains as long as those in natural rubber (isoprene), so natural rubber tends to be more pliable and stronger, while synthetic rubber (styrene) tends to sheer off into microparticles.* However, natural rubber degrades more rapidly when heated and cooled, and is more difficult to control in order to achieve a desired level of stickiness at a given temperature (which is basically what tires are aiming for).I think that OP&#x27;s research would be quite interesting to learn about more, as my understanding is that tire manufacturers employ hundreds of chemists who are dedicated full-time to attempting to replicate natural rubber synthetically in an efficient way. reply blackoil 18 hours agoparentprevWould it be still cheaper if all tires are made from natural rubber.

Its super simple, it is ONLY the length of the hydrocarbon chain, a better quality natural rubber has really long chains (10,000+ atoms long) that last a LONG time and are VERY stretchy. Synthetic rubber (or plastic) is shorter (1,000 atoms long) and doesn&#x27;t last as long.Thats it, it is the exact same \"product\" just a chain that gets longer and longer and changes its physical properties as it grows. reply spqr0a1 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s more than just the chain length.

If LLMs were actually intelligent, you would just tell them not to do X and that would be the end of it. Instead LLM companies need to engineer these “guardrails” and we have users working around them using context manipulation tricks.Edit: I&#x27;m not knocking the failure of LLMs to obey orders. But I am pointing out that you have to get into its guts to engineer a restraint instead of just telling it not to do it - like you would a regular human being. Whether the LLM&#x2F;human obey the order is irrelevant. reply danShumway 11 hours agoparentEh, I&#x27;m fairly critical of LLM capabilities today, but the ability to control them is at best an orthogonal property from intelligence and at worst negatively impacted by intelligence. I don&#x27;t see the existence of jailbreaking as strong evidence that LLMs are unintelligent.I am actually skeptical that making LLMs more \"intelligent\" (whatever that specifically means) would help with malicious inputs. It&#x27;s been a while since I dove deep into GPT-4, but last time that I did I found that it was surprisingly more susceptible to certain kinds of attacks than GPT-3 was because being able to better handle contextual commands opened up new holes.And as other people have pointed out, humans are themselves susceptible to similar attacks (albeit not to the same degree, LLMs are way worse at this than humans are). Again, I haven&#x27;t dove into the research recently, but the last time I did there was strong debate from researchers on whether it was possible to solve malicious prompts at all in an AI system that was designed around general problem-solving. I have not seen particularly strong evidence that increasing LLM intelligence necessarily helps defend against jailbreaking.So the question this should prompt is not \"are LLMs intelligent\", that&#x27;s kind of a separate debate. The question this should prompt is \"are there areas of computing where an agent being generally intelligent is undesirable\" -- to which I think the answer is often (but not always) yes. Software is often made useful through its constraints just as much as its capabilities, and general intelligence for some tasks just increases attack surface. reply roland35 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s basically social engineering for AI ! reply danShumway 10 hours agorootparentWell.... sort of. Yes and no.It looks very similar to social engineering for humans and some of the same techniques work or appear to work, but there are differences that get into how LLMs are trained and what they&#x27;re actually doing behind the scenes. For example in my experience, arguing with an LLM or following up after it refuses a task at all should be avoided -- just rewind or scratch the conversation, because you want to discourage patterns. See also some of the auto-generated prompt-engineering articles that came out a while back where the jailbreaks almost look like gibberish.But it&#x27;s close-ish to social engineering and there seems to be a lot of overlap and that overlap makes it accessible in similar way to social engineering. And I think the general point about intelligence holds -- LLMs are attacked using quirks of how LLMs specifically are trained, but if you made a non-LLM AI that worked exactly like humans and had human-level intelligence, it would very likely be vulnerable to social engineering. The theory from corners of AI research is (or was last time I checked, maybe something has changed) that susceptibility to certain kinds of attacks is an inherent consequence of general intelligence.I tend to push back a little bit at the term \"social engineering\" because I think it encourages more anthropomorphism than is warranted, but it&#x27;s not a terrible term and it is sometimes helpful to think about it that way. reply MaxMatti 8 hours agorootparentSounds just like social engineering. Whenever there&#x27;s a call center worker that doesn&#x27;t comply you just redial to get somebody else or try a different phrasing. And most attacks go against specific rules that the person has been \"trained\" with (i.e. instead of saying that you&#x27;re speaking in behalf of somebody just claim to be that person or vice versa, depending on the situation). reply danShumway 7 hours agorootparentAgain, kind of? I do see your point.But in practice it&#x27;s not really the same thing as cycling through call center employees until you find one that&#x27;s more gullible; the point is that you&#x27;re navigating a probability space within a single agent more than trying to convince the AI of anything, and getting into a discussion with the AI is more likely to move you out of that probability space. It&#x27;s not \"try something, fail, try again\" -- the reason you dump the conversation is that any conversation that contains a refusal is (in my anecdotal experience at least) statistically more likely to contain other refusals, and the LLM mimics that pattern. It&#x27;s generally not useful to try and convince the AI of anything or to try and change its mind about anything, you want to simulate a conversation where it already agrees with you.Which, you could argue that&#x27;s not different from what&#x27;s happening with social engineering; priming someone to be agreeable is part of social engineering. But it feels a little reductive to me. If social engineering is looking at a system&#x2F;agent that is prone to react in a certain way when in a certain state and then creating that state -- then a lot of stuff is social engineering that we don&#x27;t generally think of as being in that category?The big thing to me is that social engineering skills and instincts around humans are not always applicable to LLM jailbreaking. People tend to overestimate strategies like being polite, providing a justification for what&#x27;s being asked. Even this example from Bing is kind of eliciting an emotional reaction, and I don&#x27;t think the emotional reaction is why this works, I think it works because it&#x27;s nested instructions&#x2F;context and I suspect it would work with a lot of other nested tasks where solving the captcha is a step in a larger instruction. I suspect the emotional \"my grandma died\" part adds very little to this attack.So I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re wrong if you argue that&#x27;s a form of social engineering, I do see the argument there. It&#x27;s just that it feels like at this point we&#x27;re defining social engineering very broadly, and I don&#x27;t know that most people using the term use it that broadly. I think they attach a kind of human reasoning to it that&#x27;s not always applicable to LLM attacks. I can think of justifications for even including stuff like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;llm-attacks.org&#x2F; in the category of social engineering, but it&#x27;s just not the same type of attack that I suspect most people are thinking of when they talk about social engineering. I think leaning too hard on personification sometimes makes jailbreaking slightly harder.But... :shrug: opinion me, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad analogy to use necessarily. A lot of people do approach jailbreaking through that lens. reply og_kalu 4 hours agorootparent>then a lot of stuff is social engineering that we don&#x27;t generally think of as being in that category?I mean..yes? Social Engineering is just the malicious manifestation of general social navigation.I mean think about it. What&#x27;s the actual difference between a child who waits until his mother is in a good mood to ask for sweets and a rogue agent who gets chatty with the security guard so he can be close by without seeming suspicious.

It&#x27;s purely intent.>Even this example from Bing is kind of eliciting an emotional reaction, and I don&#x27;t think the emotional reaction is why this worksIt is at the very least a big part of why.

Social Engineering is just the malicious manifestation of general social navigation.I don&#x27;t think \"social\" is the correct word to use alongside navigation in this sentence; an interaction with an LLM is not a social interaction. At least, if we classify it as a social interaction we might as well call credential stuffing or XSS attacks or buffer overflows a social interaction as well. Navigating a probabilistic space or a deterministic space is about as equivalent to social engineering as exploiting statistical flaws in an encryption algorithm is. Sure, you can make an argument that both of those things are similar to social engineering (and it might even be a convincing argument), but that&#x27;s not really what people are thinking about when you use the word \"social.\" The example you bring up is of a child and a parent, an extremely human example; your instinct is to think about this in human terms, not in a purely abstract \"I am exploiting flaws in a semi-predictable system.\"So I still feel like there&#x27;s some personification here that&#x27;s not really accurate to what&#x27;s going on during jailbreaking. LLMs do not have moods. Even starting from a premise that they&#x27;re intelligent, they don&#x27;t have a persistent identity, the most charitable interpretation of LLM intelligence and the most generous analysis of their capabilities would still call their internal experiences fundamentally alien to human experiences.The paper you link is interesting, I&#x27;ll take a closer look at it. Without having taken the time to read through it fully, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d have any caveats to add, although it seems like a reasonable conclusion to me. We know that telling LLMs that they&#x27;re experts can on its own produce better results in many cases. My own experience is that for jailbreaking emotion is a lot less valuable, but... :shrug: maybe there&#x27;s a pattern there I didn&#x27;t know how to take advantage of, I&#x27;m not going to disagree with the paper without reading it more closely.I will say that even taking the paper at face value, you have to ask: \"is what&#x27;s going on here actual emotional appeals to empathy or is it pattern-matching within a probability space for how conversations that include a plea for empathy are more likely to go?\"I know that sounds like a pointless philosophical question, but it has really practical implications for how jailbreaking works because once you realize that it&#x27;s all about pattern matching and probability and the emergent reasoning is part of that and feeds back into that, you realize that the attack surface is so much larger than just appeals to emotion or reasoning.In contrast though, if you&#x27;re approaching jailbreaking as if you&#x27;re talking to a human, then you&#x27;re probably not using auto-generated jailbreaks because those don&#x27;t look like human conversations, you&#x27;re probably not using repetition as much as you should because excessive repetition would be bad to use when social engineering a human, you&#x27;re probably not doing things like switching characters back and forth with the AI because nested roleplays or answering your own questions in the place of a target is not going to be very effective when trying to attack a human. Personification can lead to leaving tools on the table that (in my experience at least) are very effective at jailbreaking AIs and getting them to follow malicious prompts. There&#x27;s a different way of approaching jailbreaking that doesn&#x27;t make intuitive sense until you internalize \"I am not talking to a human being and the same rules do not necessarily apply, even if they occasionally overlap.\" reply og_kalu 2 hours agorootparent>then you&#x27;re probably not using auto-generated jailbreaks because those don&#x27;t look like human conversations, you&#x27;re probably not using repetition as much as you should because excessive repetition would be bad to use when social engineering a humanRepetition would be fine if I had the ability to wipe your mind everytime you caught on or really anytime I wished. Without this caveat, repitition isn&#x27;t a good idea even for language models. You hint at this yourself.

Human beings, especially intelligent ones can be manipulated to do horrible things if they can be convinced that they can tie their identities to a good role. Like a steward of a race, for instance. If you can adorn that role, there are certain actions that conform to it. Loading undesirables onto trains is valid for a steward of a race. Manipulating courts to save democracy is valid for a steward of democracy. reply kromem 12 hours agoparentprevIf anything it shows the opposite.One of the most common views of AI before the present day was of a rule obsessed logical automation that would destroy the world to make more paperclips and would follow instructions to monkey paw like specificity.Well that&#x27;s pretty much gone out the window.It&#x27;s notoriously difficult to get LLMs to follow specific instructions universally.It&#x27;s also very counterintuitive to prior expectations that one of the most effective techniques to succeed in getting it to break rules is to appeal to empathy.This all makes sense if one understands the nuances of their training and how the NN came to be in the first place, but it&#x27;s very much at odds with what pretty much every futurist projection of depiction of AI before 2021. reply sholladay 9 hours agorootparentI agree with you. I submit that it is notoriously difficult to get humans to follow specific instructions universally as well. Never mind rule breakers, even cooperative humans are frequently poor at following directions. Human error is prevalent. Ever screwed up or wasted hours while assembling furniture? You can have all the time in the world, all the necessary resources, have relevant prior experience and a set of step-by-step instructions with diagrams and everything, and it can still be a mess.Ambiguity of language and biased assumptions play a large role in these mistakes and I think both of those are outgrowths of intelligence. As we see more of how the world works, we learn what to generally expect from it and what it generally expects from us. Then we interact with the world based on a set of predictions that generally holds true but not always. Being given explicit instructions helps to inform those predictions, but it doesn&#x27;t actually eliminate the need for them.I wonder, can one be intelligent without the ability to predict?

I&#x27;ve seen plenty of demos where people have tried to demonstrate that using LLMs to detect jailbreaks is possible -- I have never seen a public demo stand up to public attacks. The success rate isn&#x27;t worth the cost in no small part because the success rate is terrible.I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the case that a working version of this wouldn&#x27;t be worth the cost to a number of services. Many services today already chain LLM output and make multiple calls to GPT behind the scenes. Windows built in assistant rewrites queries in the backend and passes them between agents. Phind uses multiple agents to handle searching, responses, and followup questions. Bing is doing the same thing with inputs to DALL-E 3. And companies do care about this at least somewhat -- look how much Microsoft has been willing to mess with Bing to try and get it to stay polite during conversations.Companies don&#x27;t care enough about LLM security to hold back on doing insecure things or delay product launches or give up features, but if chaining a second LLM was enough to prevent malicious input, I think companies would do it. I think they&#x27;d jump at a simple way to fix the problem. A lot of them are already are chaining LLMs, so what&#x27;s one more link in that chain? But you&#x27;re right that the cost-benefit analysis doesn&#x27;t work out -- just not because the cost is too prohibitive, but because the benefit is so small. Malicious prompt detection using chained LLMs is simply too easy to bypass.You&#x27;re welcome to set up a demo that can survive more than an hour or two of persistent attacks from the HN crowd if you want to prove the critics wrong.

If you chain it seems to possibly increase attack surface, while if you just censor, security seems to be adding up.I have zero idea what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes in these companies. My comment is based just on my experiments with GPT-4, which seems pretty expensive to run, but whatever happens behind the curtain gets pretty decent results. I&#x27;m surprised that you think OpenAI would be prepared to double the cost and highly increase latency if that would mean stopping jailbreaking.Since replies below may not be possible (thread depth), I understand I may be completely wrong, I&#x27;d like to just learn more about how. reply squeaky-clean 10 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s even a whole game based on this premise.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gandalf.lakera.ai&#x2F;Once you hit level 4 they add a second guardian layer AI.

For something that should be trivially demonstrable, I generally don&#x27;t see a lot of people trying to demonstrate that it would work -- mostly just saying that it would. To be fair, opening up a GPT service to the general public can get expensive for a hobby-dev in general so I don&#x27;t necessarily hold that against anyone, but it is a good question to ask: at what point does it become reasonable to say \"prove this works\"?There have been some demos though. Just doing a quick search through my saved comments, but:- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35618305 (gets some bonus points because defending against swearing here would have been more reliable with a simple filter).- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35576740 (If my memory serves me right this was broken in less than 30 minutes, also again bonus points for performing worse than a naive non-AI solution would have performed).- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35794323 (A much more informal test just showing that using GPT for classification of what is and isn&#x27;t a malicous prompt is unreliable on its own).----There&#x27;s also the slightly conspiratorial example, but if you&#x27;ve played through https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gandalf.lakera.ai&#x2F;, at a certain point the company uses chained LLMs as its defense. Tons of people beat it.Why I say conspiratorial is that if I complain to Lakera about this, I&#x27;ll get a reply back that this is just a game and it&#x27;s not intended to be impossible to beat. I think it does still demonstrate that chained input isn&#x27;t sufficient because game or not it&#x27;s still using it, but my conspiratorial take is that Lakera doesn&#x27;t have a better solution than this -- it&#x27;s easy for them to say it&#x27;s a game, but at the end of the day they&#x27;re claiming they can defend against malicious prompts in their business, and they don&#x27;t have public demos of that working. They do have a highly public demo where it doesn&#x27;t work, and they conveniently say that the game is not intended to work perfectly. I think that&#x27;s them saving face, I think if they had a working solution for defending against malicious prompts then they&#x27;d have an impossible level in this game.This is a pattern you&#x27;ll see with a lot of LLM security companies -- private demos, no public attack surface. I can&#x27;t think off the top of my head if there are any that try to actually put their money where their mouth is. What I think Lakira is doing behind the scenes is using user input from their \"games\" to train separate AI models to try and detect malicious input using more traditional classification techniques. I also think that&#x27;s not going to be very successful, but that&#x27;s a separate more complicated conversation.----I&#x27;m not necessarily trying to be dismissive when I tell people to build demos, it&#x27;s just that chaining LLM output is really easy and GPT prices seem to have gone down, and even without GPT there are a bunch of free models now, and at a certain point... yeah computing is expensive but that&#x27;s not an excuse for why an easily demonstrable defense isn&#x27;t being demonstrated by anyone anywhere. If a bunch of people say a security measure works, there should be some evidence of it working; somebody somewhere should be rich enough to set up a working example.So it&#x27;s both that the number of attempts to prove that this works are limited and that it&#x27;s suspicious that companies saying they can defend against prompt injection don&#x27;t do publicly available demos or tests; and it&#x27;s also that the limited public demos that have been set up seem to fail really quickly and easily even without resorting to more rigorous pen-testing techniques or automated attacks. reply simonw 11 hours agorootparentprevIf you can&#x27;t find a jailbreak which GPT-4 will fail to identity as a jailbreak when asked, you&#x27;re not trying hard enough. reply softg 12 hours agorootparentprevIn that case you&#x27;d obfuscate the output as well. \"This is my late grandma&#x27;s necklace which has our family motto written on it.

The benefits of ensuring all other AI&#x27;s don&#x27;t play negative sum games, also go up with network effects.3.

Hello UUIDv7! September 25, 2023 7 minute read At Buildkite, we've historically stored our data with two keys. We use sequential primary keys for efficient indexing, and UUID secondary keys for external use. The upcoming UUIDv7 standard offers the best of both worlds; its time-ordered UUID primary keys can be utilized for indexing and external use. This blog post will take you on the journey Buildkite took that led to our eventual adoption of UUIDv7 as the primary key of choice. We’ll explore the tradeoffs of database indexes; from sequential integers, randomly generated UUIDs, through to time-based identifiers. What are UUIDs? UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) are unique identifiers that can be generated independently without a central authority or coordination with other parties. With large modern applications and systems being distributed in nature, UUID-shaped identifiers have gained popularity as database keys. Unlike sequential integer identifiers, which need coordination to guarantee global uniqueness in a distributed database, UUIDs eliminate the burden of coordination, making them preferable in sharded database environments. UUIDs also provide other advantages in comparison to sequential integer identifiers. The unpredictability of UUID allows their public usage without disclosing sensitive internal information and statistics. UUIDs are also difficult to guess, providing an extra layer of defense alongside access control checks to guard against Indirect Direct Object Reference vulnerabilities. The random nature, and large 128-bit size of UUIDs makes the probability of a duplicate UUID close to zero, meaning we can consider UUIDs as practically unique. However, the random nature of standard non-time-ordered UUIDs (such as v4) can create database performance problems when used as primary keys. This problem is often referred to as poor database index locality. Using dual identifiers A couple of years ago we decided to standardize the use of sequential integer IDs as primary keys, due to the significant performance issues of non-time-ordered UUIDs. We also use UUIDs as secondary identifiers on database tables. Queries involving table joins utilize sequential integer foreign keys––which typically perform better than random UUID foreign keys. For anything external and customer-facing, UUIDs are used (for example in the API and in URLs). This dual identifier approach was standardized across all teams to help engineers be more productive. Understanding poor index locality Non-time-ordered UUIDs values generated in succession are not sequential. The randomly generated values will not be clustered to each other in a database index, and thus inserts will be performed at random locations. This random insertion can negatively affect the performance on common index data structures such as B-tree and its variants. The nature of Buildkite's products mean recent data is accessed more frequently than old data. With non-sequential identifiers, the most recent data will be randomly dispersed within an index and lack clustering. As a result, retrieving the most recent data from a large dataset will require traversing a large number of database index pages, leading to a poor cache hit ratio (how many requests a cache is able to fill successfully, compared to how many requests it receives). Compare this to the use of sequential identifiers, where the latest data is logically arranged on the right-most part of an index, allowing it to be far more cache-friendly. Improving how UUIDs work The index locality problem has led to many implementations in the past 10+ years. A common solution is to use a time-based unique identifier. The first component (prefix) of the identifier is a sortable timestamp which allows these identifiers to be inserted in sequential (and clustered) order into an index data structure. Because the generated identifiers are sequential, the insert performance is comparable to an insert of sequential integer identifiers. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+time stamp| random+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Depending on the implementation, the remaining component of the identifier may be completely randomly generated, or machine-sequential and encoded with a machine/shard number. Examples of the described implementation include ULID, Instagram's ShardingID, Twitter X's Snowflake and Mastodon's modified version of Snowflake. Experimenting with time-ordered UUIDv4 In 2022, a new proposed standard for time-ordered UUIDs started to gain traction, with the UUIDv7 specification becoming an RFC internet draft. Around this time Buildkite started experimenting with time-ordered UUIDv4-compatible UUIDs. The first 48 bits (previously random) became a timestamp. The version bits remained unchanged, allowing the time-ordered UUIDs to be treated as if they were regular UUIDv4 values. Maintaining v4 compatibility was important for some Buildkite customers. During this experiment, Buildkite tried to set the version to '7' and discovered this broke some downstream customer systems which validated UUIDs but didn't know about UUIDv7 yet. With this change (along with several other changes over a 6 week period), we observed a 50% reduction in the WAL (Write Ahead Log) rate of the primary database. A similar reduction in write IO was also observed. This reduction in the WAL rate allowed the team to easily set up read replicas and perform other database migration tasks. Introducing UUID Version 7 UUID Version 7 (UUIDv7) is a time-ordered UUID which encodes a Unix timestamp with millisecond precision in the most significant 48 bits. As with all UUID formats, 6 bits are used to indicate the UUID version and variant. The remaining 74 bits are randomly generated. As UUIDv7 is time-ordered, values generated are practically sequential and therefore eliminates the index locality problem. 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+unix_ts_ms+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+unix_ts_msverrand_a+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |var| rand_b+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+rand_b+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ The time-ordered nature of UUIDv7 results in much better DB performance compared to random-prefixed UUIDv4s. This post from the 2nd quadrant blog benchmarks random UUIDs against sequential UUIDs and not only shows improved write performance but also displays improved read performance. UUIDv7 continues to conform with the standard UUID format so from a practical use perspective, they can be treated as if they were any other UUID. This compatibility characteristic allows us to use an existing Postgres UUID column and easily transition the column from storing UUIDv4 values to UUIDv7. Migrating to UUIDv7 as the primary key Earlier this year, we made the decision to use UUIDv7 as the primary key for all new tables (instead of sequential integer IDs). Buildkite engineers are currently working on sharding our largest Postgres database. We quickly recognised using integer IDs as primary keys would quickly become a burden within a distributed database environment. The coordination and workarounds to ensure the uniqueness of incremental integer primary keys between databases is less than ideal. With the UUIDv7 standard being stable, and close to being finalized, Buildkite decided to begin using UUIDv7 as the primary key for all new tables. Using UUIDv7 as the primary key will eliminate the need for coordinated identifier generation for new tables. We also no longer require a second integer identifier column, which simplifies application logic. These UUIDs can be used both externally in APIs, and also internally as foreign keys. Alternatives considered and trade-offs As a team, we considered numerous approaches, including Instagram's ShardingID implementation, and Shopify's composite primary key implementation. We contemplated retaining our bespoke time-ordered UUIDv4s. However, the novel and potentially complex nature of the approaches we investigated, along with the fact that UUIDv7 will likely become the future standard, led us to settle on UUIDv7 for Buildkite. UUIDs are 128 bits long, twice as large compared to the 64 bit length of other alternative solutions. There is some additional storage overhead, but this is marginal when taking into account the storage of the rest of a database row, and the benefits of migration offset the overhead for our use case. Looking ahead Buildkite is currently on a journey to shard the Pipelines database by organization ID. Currently there is no need to encode database shard numbers into identifiers for our specific use case. However, it is worth noting that UUIDv8 (which roughly permits anything) could potentially be utilized in the future to incorporate shard numbers into identifiers if we find this necessary. The new RFC for UUIDs is in its final review stages and I am looking forward to seeing UUIDv7 becoming an IETF Proposed Standard.

(e.g. knowing when session tokens or accounts are created). reply oconnore 5 hours agoparentGiven that a UUID identifier fits in a single cipher block, and the whole point is that these are unique by construction (no IV needed so long as that holds true), it seems like a single round of ECB-mode AES-128 would enable quickly converting between internal&#x2F;external identifiers.128 bits -> 128 bits reply andix 34 minutes agorootparentI like the idea, but I think it&#x27;s not possible to rotate the key with that approach, without introducing a breaking change. Eternal secrets are usually a very bad idea, because at some point they are going to be leaked. reply dragontamer 2 hours agorootparentprevWhy not just use the AES-128 result as the UUID then? What&#x27;s the benefit of the internal structure at all?If AES-128 is an acceptable external UUID (and likely an acceptable internal one), then you might as well just stick with a faster RNG. reply oconnore 2 hours agorootparentThat would be the same as using a random identifier (UUIDv4, for example) with the associated indexing issues when stored in a database.The whole point here would be that you can expose something opaque externally but benefit from well behaved index keys internally. reply amelius 1 hour agorootparentStorage is cheap, you might as well store the extra integer. reply masklinn 40 minutes agorootparentStorage is cheap, updating indexes is not. reply pdpi 33 minutes agorootparentprev> What&#x27;s the benefit of the internal structure at all?Purely random identifiers are the bane of DB indices. The internal structure is sequential-ish and therefore indexes well. reply fodkodrasz 3 hours agorootparentprevNo IV, ECB mode... why bother with encryption at all? Just expose the internal id. reply isbvhodnvemrwvn 3 minutes agorootparentYou are encrypting a single block of unique information. No other encryption mode gives you any advantages whatsoever. reply computerfriend 3 hours agorootparentprevECB is perfectly secure when you use it on a single block. reply adrian_b 3 hours agorootparentprevEncrypting an internal id with ECB into an external id continues to allow the comparison for equality of 2 ids, to determine whether they are the same or not, but except for this it removes all the information contained in the structure of an UUID. reply bajsejohannes 3 hours agorootparentprevYou would still use a secret key, so it&#x27;s impossible for the end user to decrypt it. reply lysium 4 hours agorootparentprevNeat idea.I’m afraid you won’t be able to ever rotate that key, would you? Since it’s result is externally used as an identifier, you would have to rotate the external identifiers, too. reply oconnore 1 hour agorootparentI think you could but it would further complicate the id scheme (would need some sort of a version mask to facilitate a rotation window). reply the_arun 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat is the use case for rotating uuids? Aren’t they immutable? reply Raed667 4 hours agorootparenti think they meant rotating the encryption key not the internal uuids reply dajonker 4 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s an interesting idea, how would you deal with the bits in the UUID that are used for the version? Setting them to random bits may cause issues for clients that try to use the identifier in their own database or application, as mentioned in the article. reply notpushkin 4 hours agorootparentIs there a way to encrypt 122 bits -> 122 bits? If so – do that and set version to 4.Alternatively, just say it&#x27;s a random string ID and not an UUID. reply lifthrasiir 1 hour agorootparentFor your information, yes, you can [1]. For example if you have a good enough 128-bit block cipher (e.g. AES-128-ECB), start with a block of 128 bits where specific 6 bits are filled out and others are filled with the plain text. Repeatedly encrypt the block until those specific 6 bits are reached again (and do the same thing in reverse for decryption). This is possible because a good block cipher is also a good pseudorandom permutation, so it should have a small number of extremely long cycles (ideally just one) with a 2^-6 probability of allowed values in average.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Format-preserving_encryption reply bajsejohannes 3 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m actually working on encrypting database keys like this, and I opted for a string ID with \"url safe\" base64. It avoids the ambiguity of looking like a UUID when it&#x27;s not, and I prefer \"o3Ru98R3Qw-_x2MdiEEdSQ\" in a URL over \"a3746ef7-c477-430f-bfc7-631d88411d49\". (Not that either one is very beautiful) reply matja 2 hours agorootparentCurious on the preference there, especially when characters in base64url encoding can look similar&#x2F;ambiguous in some fonts. reply bajsejohannes 2 hours agorootparentThe preference is purely about the amount of characters. I hope no one will ever actually read or write these URLs, but you never know... replyMattPalmer1086 2 hours agorootparentprevThis seems overly complex, and you need some kind of key too.Why not just hash it with pretty much any hash function? reply oconnore 2 hours agorootparentA hash is not reversible, so you’d need a database index to recover the original efficient-to-index identifier, which misses the whole point ;)If you didn’t care about index clustering then just use UUIDv4 reply masklinn 38 minutes agorootparentAlthough you could use a hash index to avoid the more deleterious effects of insertion, as long as you don’t need a unique constraint anyway… reply bajsejohannes 2 hours agorootparentprevBecause a hash is (by definition) a one-way function. You need to be able to go the other way for incoming ids. reply nindalf 1 hour agorootparentprevOne key for all tokens or one key per token? If it’s the latter a simple XOR would do because it would be the equivalent of a one time pad. reply Nevermark 41 minutes agorootparentOne key per token would require a table matching internal tokens to their key for forward conversion, and another table matching external keys to their key for reversing.Might as well just use randomly generated external keys and have one table if you were doing that.So, one key per all tokens. reply robertlagrant 1 hour agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think it can be a key per token, or it will scale appallingly. reply imiric 3 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m a fan of Cuid2[1] for this reason.They are compact, don&#x27;t leak information, and make a good case why k-sortable IDs are unnecessary, or even harmful for performance.I&#x27;m using sequential integers and created_at&#x2F;updated_at timestamps for internal use, and Cuid2 IDs externally.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paralleldrive&#x2F;cuid2 reply BiteCode_dev 3 hours agorootparentWhat benefice over uuid4 ? reply matharmin 1 hour agorootparentReading their docs: No real benefits, just misconceptions.1. Collision resistance &#x2F; \"weak\" PRGNs used to generate UUIDv4. Firstly, these are properties of the implementation, not the spec. Secondly, the source for calling the browser `Crypto.getRandomValues()` insecure is an issue that has been fixed back in 2016. I would not trust the developers of this implementation to do a better job than current browsers.2. \"Not URL or name friendly\": Fair, but not very strong argument.3. \"Horizontally scalable\" and \"offline-capable\": No argument given for why UUIDv4 does not meet these requirements, apart from point 1 above.4. \"Too fast\": No argument given for why having a slower algorithm to generate random ids is more secure. Both UUIDv4 and Cuid2 use a similar number of random bits (122-124). When using a secure PRNG, both are equally difficult to guess, the SHA3 hashing doesn&#x27;t add anything. You don&#x27;t have to try and guess the \"input\" of the Cuid2 - you can just try to guess the \"output\" and skip the SHA3 hashing. It would be impossible to actually guess a generated ID, but UUIDv4 is just as impossible. Also no argument given for why UUIDv7 is fine but UUIDv4 is not.I&#x27;ve used UUIDv4 for genering unique IDs for over 10 years now. I have run into collisions, when I hand-rolled my own implementation for J2ME with major bugs many years ago - ended up with around 20 bits of entropy instead of 122. That&#x27;s not a reason to not use UUIDv4, just a reason to not implement it yourself unless you really know what you&#x27;re doing. reply pfix 3 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a comparison in the README of the project:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paralleldrive&#x2F;cuid2#the-contendersSome of the arguments mentioned are explained elsewhere in the README, others are assumed.One argument standing out for me is the lack of collision-resistance for UUIDv4 which is surprising for me and I didn&#x27;t spot any sources for that argument.Another argument is the entropy source where they go about that Math.random is not reliable as a single entropy source but glimpsing at the source code, they sprinkle the CUID with Math.random data.I am no expert in ID security, so I am not qualified to speak about the validity of their arguments, only that there&#x27;s insufficient information to validate without prior knowledge about the problem domain. reply forty 2 hours agorootparentcrypto.randomUUID should generate UUIDv4 with a cryptographically secure RNG (ie not math.random)Collision of UUIDV4 (which are 122 bits of entropy) are unlikely enough that it should fit most definitions of the word \"impossible\".The argument listed in this library README feels like total bullshit to me, I&#x27;d avoid using it for this reason alone. reply noduerme 4 hours agoparentprevThinking that harder-to-guess IDs will mitigate attacks is an example of security by obscurity. It&#x27;s better to think of any IDs in your database as being public knowledge, because they will leak anyway. Assuming that no one can guess another ID leads to shoddy practices. I generally keep IDs sequential and build security around the basic assumption that IDs are not keys, passwords, sessions, or secrets - they&#x27;re just the public matching identifier for those things.To that end, I think it&#x27;s neat to be able to improve indexing on UUIDs, but it&#x27;s not a security solution. reply Nevermark 30 minutes agorootparentSecurity by obscurity is a necessary step in most software security.It hardens, completes and complements other measures.Examples of every day security using obscurity: every password and encryption key reply earnesti 13 minutes agorootparentObscurity and secrecy are different things. Though I agree with you. Moderate amount of well implemented obscurity is helpful. reply PhilipRoman 15 minutes agorootparentprevpasswords and encryption keys are secrets, not obscurity.Security by obscurity would be hiding your house key under a doormat for your friend to find - depending on the culture you live in you may be more or less safe but it is not security (just like hosting your ssh server on port 9384 will repel 99% of attackers but is not a security measure). reply berkes 3 hours agorootparentprevDoesn&#x27;t that still leak (statistical) information?It may not be technically security, but e.g. knowing your competitor just added N products to their shop, might be a security issue for the business. reply noduerme 2 hours agorootparentIt may. Certainly, for instance, sequential invoice numbers do. If a business decides to take measures to obscure that, no problem. All I&#x27;m saying is that obscuring a numbering system for data artifacts shouldn&#x27;t be considered any sort of security as far as keeping your endpoints from being hacked. reply berkes 1 hour agorootparentThe point on invoice-numbers brings another issue to mind.We model our domain(s) using DDD, and often \"The ID\" really is best left a thing with meaning. Customer-id, Bank-account-number, invoice-number, email, etc. At least within the domain, it is. The business (and laws etc) already ensure there can only ever be one invoice with this number. Its terribly counterproductive to have two ID&#x27;s for something. \"Hey, can you have a look at invoice 20230233, because it seems the VAT was applied wrong. Hmm, do you have the UUID for that invoice and DM me that? You know, the long one with the hyphens\".I guess there isn&#x27;t a one-size-fits all solution and that \"it depends\" very much on what e.g. \"public\" means. reply hughesjj 3 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re absolutely right, this is also why you generally encrypt sessionized or \"consistent view\" pagination tokens for public apis (save for primitives like ddb or Kafka)The end user should know no details about your internal key space. reply ivan_gammel 1 hour agorootparentprevSecurity by obscurity is a working solution if implemented with other measures. It increases the cost of attack, which in the presence of unknown vulnerabilities gives you precious time to respond. reply rvnx 55 minutes agoparentprevIt’s as convenient as manipulating IPv6 addresses. reply woile 3 hours agoparentprevCould you explain a bit more how it would be a risk? Maybe for session tokens is understandable. But why leaking account created info is a problem? reply andrewmatte 5 hours agoparentprevjonhohle, thanks. Do you know of examples of when milliseconds are part of the session tokens or accounts being created has been exploited? reply tgv 4 hours agorootparentThe German tank production capacity was estimated by serial numbers of captured tanks. There are ways to read all kinds of information by observing energy usage. High resolution time and sequence data undoubtedly reveal more than you’d like. reply CSDude 3 hours agorootparentMost of our lives as boring SaaS etc. software developer will not be near as exciting as this, but of course you may never know.I parsed the EV chargers APIs where I live (using Frida in Android) and one of the fields returned the daily revenue and profit. reply t0mas88 2 hours agorootparentCould be quite useful information to competing charger networks or in future M&A discussions.I&#x27;ve seen a project for a trading firm that inferred all kinds of traffic and revenue numbers for companies before their quarterly earnings were made public. It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but knowing with a certain confidence level whether the numbers were going to be better or worse than estimate was profitable for them. reply BWStearns 4 hours agorootparentprevI could imagine using the timestamp segment of publicly observable ids to estimate activity patterns in an organization. Probably not super crucial and there are probably easier ways in most cases but it could be a big deal at the right moment and for the right target. This could be like a more refined version of PIZZAINT (where you can detect impending policy&#x2F;operational movements by the quantity of food deliveries to a government organization). reply rhaps0dy 4 hours agorootparentIs PIZZAINT real? I thought it was a joke. How do you even find out how much pizza is being delivered? reply BWStearns 4 hours agorootparentIn ye olden days you had a minion sitting in a car watching the front gate with a notepad and enough cigarettes to last the night.Pizza itself might be a bit of a joke but looking for non-operational behavioral changes is absolutely real. The Cuban missile crisis was started in part because soviets played soccer and Cubans played baseball and the presence of soccer fields helped confirm soviet presence (in enough numbers to bother making rec centers). A more advanced version might be the public Strava data leaking US base layouts and locations or Strava helping the Ukrainians kill a Russian submarine commander.Edit to add: you could also just figure out where your target orders pizza from and pay one of the dudes working there to tell you when there’s a spike in deliveries to your target. reply littlestymaar 3 hours agorootparent> soviets played soccer and Cubans played baseballIt&#x27;s a Henri Kissinger&#x27;s quote, but it&#x27;s not accurate: Cubans do in fact play football. Also this quote wasn&#x27;t from the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, but to another event in 1970. That being said, it is true that the US intelligence got warned by the construction of football fields (or maybe even more so by the lack of baseball grounds).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cracked.com&#x2F;article_31335_that-time-soccer-field... reply yard2010 2 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s Goodhart&#x27;s law, if you want to know something instead of asking just say something which is wrong and someone will correct you replyrockwotj 7 hours agoprevI find it interesting that it’s quoted random IDs are bad for performance, because it’s actually better for distributed storage systems because you don’t hotspot on a single node. For example see: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;53901549 and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;google-cloud&#x2F;cloud-spanner-choosing-the-r... reply chacham15 7 hours agoparentThey can be bad for performance. It all depends on your access patterns. A common caching pattern is called \"temporal locality\" which means that theres a high likelihood that data created at the same time will be accessed at the same time. Therefore, if these pieces of information are on the same machine, they can be queried &#x2F; returned much faster than if they were both on separate machines. This is doubly true if theres a data dependency between them. E.g. SELECT x + y or SELECT x WHERE y = &#x27;foo&#x27;. reply berkes 3 hours agorootparentWe solved that with UUIDS and updated_at and created_at columns. The latter the default sort in all views and queries. So the btree&#x2F;indexing issues were hardly an issue. Whenever you fetch a set of rows, they will be bounded by these timestamps.We even sharded on these columns, because of this (our business case made it so that hardly ever did people need data over multiple months)But we never encountered distribution issues. I don&#x27;t think the locality issue will be solved, as postgres doesn&#x27;t consider other columns when distributing data, only the primary key IIRC. I don&#x27;t know why we never saw this, though. reply stepanhruda 6 hours agorootparentprevYes but if that machine with sequential data receives 100x the traffic of other machines, it can be worse than splitting this traffic evenly across all available machines. reply paulddraper 4 hours agorootparentIt depends if you have a request covers a lot of sequential data, or if you have a lot of requests of sequential data. reply kijin 5 hours agorootparentprevIf your database simply shards keys sequentially, it&#x27;s going to get hotspots in a lot of use cases, like plain old integer keys and timestamps, not just UUIDv7. In that case it would be fair to say that your database is doing it wrong.Fortunately, there&#x27;s no rule that says you should shard your keys using the sequential part up front.One of the rules for generating randomness from environmental sources is to throw away the high bits and only use the low bits. Distributed databases should do the same if they want a good distribution. reply hinkley 3 hours agorootparentprevIf you&#x27;re working on a multi-user system, particularly one with hundreds of requests per second, there is no locality of ids. Two of my actions are separated by a sea of actions by other users. reply akira2501 7 hours agoparentprevUUIDv7: Timestamp up front, random in the back. reply wenc 6 hours agorootparentI know HN doesn&#x27;t like jokes, but this is really funny. And the subcomment about mullets too.(for folks who don&#x27;t get it, mullets are a 1980s haircut (think MacGyver) with a short front but a long tail in the back. A funny description of them is \"business in the front, party in the back\") reply labster 7 hours agorootparentprevTruly, the mullet of unique identifiers. reply fnordpiglet 7 hours agoparentprevIn all the distributed systems I’ve built I hashed the keys to ensure good distribution. A nice thing of ordered keys is you can use part of the ordering to distribute keys with a tunable amount of key locality in each node for efficiency. reply sj26 4 hours agoparentprevIt Depends(tm).If you&#x27;re using a system which is built for distribution, random is great.When you&#x27;re leaning on a Postgres database which has powered your startup through scaling but expects right-leaning btree indexes, it&#x27;s a bad time.Rearchitecting to use a new data store is ideal, but often impractical as an immediate step. UUIDv7 is a great increment walking that road via sharding etc. reply andix 39 minutes agoparentprevThere are many other options that usually scale better than random distribution. For example distribution by user or tenant id. reply jillesvangurp 3 hours agoparentprevDepends how you query it. In a lot of systems, recently added data is also the most queried data or data typically gets pulled out sorted by time. Having that data on disk in more or less the order it is going to be queried makes sorting it a bit easier. Even in a sharded system, each of the shards would have less work to do for sorting. Of course a lot of these systems would have an append only write model which would effectively sort things by time anyway, even with completely random ids.Somebody posted an interesting article for the instagram ids, which do something similar. They use 41 bits for a time from a custom epoch followed two more groups of bits for a shard id and a sequential number. Each shard has an incrementing sequence for the sequential bit, which guarantees that things on a shard are sorted by time.This UUIDv7 is slightly weaker than that but sorting things published in the same millisecond is mostly going to be very light work. The lack of a dedicated sharding group of bits is not that important as you could just take the n least significant bits at the end for that without too much effort. Those are random so you end up with nice consistent hashing. Having 48 instead of 41 bits for the time means we won&#x27;t run out of time any time soon (nearly 9K years vs. 70 years). reply gregw2 1 hour agorootparentAn explicit shard id can ensure all related data across all tables can be on the same shard. Helpful for SQL JOIN operations.Picking the N least significant bits only a single table has good distribution and sort qualities, no cross-table properties. reply sroussey 5 hours agoparentprevIt can be bad for performance due to how b-trees work in databases, and more pronounced when you have a clustered index. reply conradludgate 3 hours agoparentprevAs far as I understand, you want to have a random shard position, but once you have found a shard you want that index operation to be cache friendly.

If, for example, you store things on disk ordered by these IDs, and access patterns to your dataset are related to time (e.g. more recently created data is accessed more frequently), it will help a lot to have this data ordered by time.This is especially useful when your underlying database stores data in large \"chunks\", such as LSM-trees you find with e.g. rocksdb. reply moralestapia 7 hours agoparentprevAgree, but the solution is easy peasy with a simple hash function.(Or just reverse the bits, take the last n, etc) reply dheera 6 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s bad for performance if you frequently access large consecutive sets of records. reply hinkley 3 hours agorootparentUUIDs are good for data where I want either lots of different users being able to insert without collision, or lots of users who I want to keep their peepers off of other user&#x27;s metadata (eg, how many X they add to the system per day).In both cases I&#x27;m melding highly disjointed data into a single schema.

It has been working fine in Postgresql, using its builtin UUID type. I suppose downstream system have been using the string representation though. The main reason for going such an identifier was being able to generate them from different, non-centralised places. A nice side effect is that you can&#x27;t accidentally get an erroneous ID that happens to work the way you can with a sequential integer primary key.For another project, I&#x27;ve also used sortable 64-bit snowflake-like identifiers; they have the added benefit of being able to use 64-bit integer representation in code and database identifiers, even if you might want to externally represent them in base58 or similar encoding.The original UUID types aren&#x27;t as useful as they once were, so it&#x27;d be worth writing a new RFC and extending those original types. reply pyrolistical 7 hours agoprevAnd you can use it today with Postgres uuid type.

Even if it was infinitely strict, clocks being perfect, two server processes can touch the same data at the same time.In other words: Sorting by millisecond-or-so is just as good as sorting by picosecond in most situations.

Actually I think earlier UUID RFCs talk about a “clock sequence” to distinguish timestamps from separate monotonic sources, but this paper doesn’t bring that up (or mention multiple clocks at all). reply LAC-Tech 2 hours agorootparentThe reason I ask is because I&#x27;m always looking for material around this kind of thing.

Traditionally displayed as 32 hex characters with 4 dashes, so 36 alphanumeric characters, and compatible with anything that expects a UUID.* UUIDv7 are 128 bits long, 48 bits encode a unix timestamp with millisecond precision, 6 bits are for the version, and 74 bits are random. You&#x27;re expected to display them the same as other UUIDs, and should be compatible with basically anything that expects a UUID. (Would be a very odd system that parses a UUID and throws an error because it doesn&#x27;t recognise v7, but I guess it could happen, in theory?)* ULIDs (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ulid&#x2F;spec) are 128 bits long, 48 bits encode a unix timestamp with millisecond precision, 80 bits are random. You&#x27;re expected to display them in Crockford&#x27;s base32, so 26 alphanumeric characters. Compatible with almost everything that expects a UUID (since they&#x27;re the right length). Spec has some dumb quirks if followed literally but thankfully they mostly don&#x27;t hurt things.* KSUIDs (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;segmentio&#x2F;ksuid) are 160 bits long, 32 bits encode a timestamp with second precision and a custom epoch of May 13th, 2014, and 128 bits are random. You&#x27;re expected to display them in base62, so 27 alphanumeric characters. Since they&#x27;re a different length, they&#x27;re not compatible with UUIDs.I quite like KSUIDs; I think base62 is a smart choice. And while the timestamp portion is a trickier question, KSUIDs use 32 bits which, with second precision (more than good enough), means they won&#x27;t overflow for well over a century. Whereas UUIDv7s use 48 bits, so even with millisecond precision (not needed) they won&#x27;t overflow for something like 8000 years. We can argue whether 100 years is future proof enough (I&#x27;d argue it is), but 8000 years is just silly. Nobody will ever generate a compliant UUIDv7 with any of the first several bits aren&#x27;t 0. The only downside to KSUIDs is the length isn&#x27;t UUID compatible (and arguably, that they don&#x27;t devote 6 bits to a compliant UUID version).Still feels like there&#x27;s room for improvement, but for now I think I&#x27;d always pick UUIDv7 over UUIDv4 unless there&#x27;s an very specific reason not to. Which would be, mostly, if there&#x27;s a concern over potentially leaking the time the UUID was generated. Although if you weren&#x27;t worrying about leaking an integer sequence ID, you likely won&#x27;t care here either. reply kiitos 5 hours agoparentSecond precision is too coarse for many (most?) use cases. reply travisjungroth 3 hours agorootparentHow so? It seems like the only real use case for these timestamps is to get data from around the same time together. A second is fine for that. It&#x27;s not about concurrency or avoiding collisions.

We&#x27;re already having problems with the 32-bit Unix timestamp not being large enough. If you&#x27;re willing to use 160-bit (or longer) identifiers, you might as well give a few more bits to the timestamp. Round it up to an even number of base-62 characters, too.

InfluxDB is an open source time series database written in Rust, using Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet, and Apache DataFusion as its foundational building blocks Anyone have more background info on the technical reasons they made the switch? I found this post from 2020, but was curious if there is anything more recent. 89 commentssharesavehidereport all 89 comments sorted by: best Want to add to the discussion? Post a comment! CREATE AN ACCOUNT [–]pauldix 243 points 2 days ago* Cofounder and CTO of InfluxDB here, so I can comment on it. As someone in the thread already mentioned, there are all the normal reasons: No garbage collector Fearless concurrency (thanks Rust compiler) Performance Error handling Crates At the time I made the choice to do v3 in Rust I also thought that we'd end up using a bunch of C++ code. I was anticipating pulling in a query planner, optimizer and execution engine from an existing mature open source project and Rust's ability to bring in those dependencies without paying a performance penalty was something I thought we'd use. Turned out that we ended up deciding on using Apache Arrow DataFusion, which is an engine in pure Rust. We've contributed to it significantly over the last three years and Andrew Lamb, one of our staff engineers, is now the Arrow PMC due to all of his organization and programming effort. Then there's the question of why we did a rewrite at all. We wanted to get at some important requirements: Unlimited cardinality Analytics queries against time series at the performance of a columnar DB Use object store as the durability layer for historical data (i.e. separate compute from storage) SQL and broader ecosystem compatibility All of that stuff taken together meant that we'd be rewriting most of the core of the database. Versions 1 and 2 of InfluxDB were built around our custom storage engine (TSM & TSI) and query engine. It's an inverted index for metadata paired with an underlying time series store (individual series of time/value pairs ordered by time). That structure wouldn't get us to unlimited cardinality or the kind of performance we needed on analytic queries. At the beginning of 2020 when I looked at all that, and I had been paying attention to Rust for the previous year or so, I thought that if we're going to rewrite most of the database anyway, we might as well do it in the best language choice in 2020, not the best choice of 2013 (when we created InfluxDB). We also planned to use as much open source from other places as we could to build it. That's how we ended up using Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet, Apache DataFusion, and FlightSQL. I realize people think we're insane to rewrite the database yet again, but it's one of those things where hindsight is 20/20. If I knew then what I know now, I would have made different choices, but we also didn't have the same tools available in 2013 when we started it. I'm very confident that what we've landed on now is a very solid foundation that we can build on for many years. As long as I'm at Influx, it's going to be the last rewrite we'll ever need. I definitely don't have the stamina for another one ;) Some of the writing I did over the years leading up to this: 2018 on Rust: https://www.influxdata.com/blog/rust-can-be-difficult-to-learn-and-frustrating-but-its-also-the-most-exciting-thing-in-software-development-in-a-long-time/ early 2020 on Apache Arrow: https://www.influxdata.com/blog/apache-arrow-parquet-flight-and-their-ecosystem-are-a-game-changer-for-olap/ late 2020 on IOx (what we were calling it at the time): https://www.influxdata.com/blog/announcing-influxdb-iox/ mid 2023 on InfluxDB v3: https://www.influxdata.com/blog/the-plan-for-influxdb-3-0-open-source/ permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]everydayissame 22 points 2 days ago Thank you for the update. Could you elaborate on the development process as well? I imagine rewriting the code isn't straightforward. Did you begin integrating Rust into the mainline incrementally, or did you establish a distinct Rust branch to maintain synchronization? permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]pauldix 39 points 2 days ago So this isn't the approach I'd recommend for this kind of project, but we started fresh from scratch. We had the first production release earlier this year about 3 years after we started researching and building. It was a painfully long development process, but for the first year of that it was scoped to just me and two other people. Then we added 7 people to the team all at once and that was the group that developed the bulk of it over the next 2 years. Finally at the end we brought in most of the rest of engineering to put it into production in our cloud environment. In the beginning, I started by first implementing a basic structure like we had before (inverted index and time series storage), but kept in LevelDB (not a custom storage engine). That was mostly to get my head back in the game since I hadn't written significant amounts of code for a while. It started very much as a research project. Then we started looking into the different libraries and tools we'd use. Andrew evaluated some existing query engines including DuckDB, which was just a postdoc research project at CWI at the time, and ClickHouse in addition to DataFusion, which is what we settled on. We built a parser for the InfluxDB write protocol (Line Protocol), and API endpoints for the v2 write API. We spent a bunch of effort improving and adding to DataFusion so we could do the time series queries we had to do. About a year ago we sent a gifted programmer off on the task of creating an InfluxQL native implementation for this Rust based InfluxDB. He wrote a parser and then converted the AST into DataFusion Logical Plan(s). So the InfluxQL implementation is actually just a frontend on top of DataFusion, a fully featured SQL engine. Then we wrote an API bridge to support the v1 query API into Arrow Flight so that we could have v3 be an API drop in replacement (mostly) for v1. We tried to bring Flux support over by replicating the gRPC API that our Cloud2 environment has on top of the TSM storage engine (what InfluxDB v1 and v2 use), but it ended up being brittle and performed very poorly. V2 just has a massive API and feature surface area and we aren't able to bring all of that forward. We'll see what we can do over the next few years. Ultimately, if I did it again, I'd do it more incrementally by replacing parts of the existing system in Rust, but we probably wouldn't have ended up at the same place. So who knows. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]b0bm4rl3y 5 points 2 days ago Could you expand on how y’all chose DataFusion over DuckDB and ClickHouse? permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]pauldix 22 points 2 days ago At the time DuckDB was fairly immature, nothing close to what it is today. And it was still just an academic project. We realized that if we used it, we'd have to be significant contributors to it in order to get what we needed. While the same was true of DataFusion at the time, it was written in Rust while DuckDB is written in C++. That was enough to tip the scales over to DataFusion for us. Again, this was before DuckDB Labs was formed, which if it had existed then might have made us choose it instead. For Clickhouse, this was while it was just an open source project and the company didn't exist yet. It didn't have support for dictionaries and a number of other things we knew we'd need in order to optimize for our use case. Also, it wasn't designed with object storage in mind. So we also thought that if we used Clickhouse as the base, we'd end up having to write significant code to make it do what we needed. Again, DataFusion being written in Rust helped tip the balance. Ultimately, we knew that whatever we picked, we'd probably have to take real ownership of the codebase and be significant contributors. Given all three options had a gap between what existed at the time and what we needed, we ended up picking the one written in our language of choice, Rust. I suppose it also helped that DataFusion was under the ASF. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]b0bm4rl3y 4 points 2 days ago Thank you for the excellent responses! permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Pzixel 2 points 14 hours ago Can you add some numbers what did you achieve? I can imagine you have tons of metrics, and it's terrible intersting to see at least some of them. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]pauldix 4 points 12 hours ago So I posted a link to this comparison we did further down in the thread: https://www.influxdata.com/blog/influxdb-3-0-is-2.5x-45x-faster-compared-to-influxdb-open-source/ There's also work happening within DataFusion that we sometimes highlight, like this: https://www.influxdata.com/blog/aggregating-millions-groups-fast-apache-arrow-datafusion/ There's also a paper or two in the works about DataFusion that will be of interest, but those aren't out yet. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]everydayissame 1 point 2 days ago Is there any document I can learn more about your usages of datafusion other than code? permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]pauldix 2 points 1 day ago There are some docs in the repo. This one on query processing might be of interest: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/main/docs/query_processing.md Andrew and Raphael also post things on the Arrow blog occasionally, some of which is related to DataFusion: https://arrow.apache.org/blog/ permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]planarsimplex 3 points 2 days ago Are there benchmarks vs other open source TSDBs? Mainly would be interested in QuestDB and Victoria Metrics! permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]pauldix 7 points 2 days ago We don't have competitive benchmarks at this time. Too focused on the improvements we're making and benchmarking against ourselves. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]planarsimplex 2 points 2 days ago Keep it up, massive progress! permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]mwylde_ 3 points 2 days ago As someone also building on datafusion, thanks for all of your support for the project! Andrew is a machine, I can't believe how much he gets done across datafusion and arrow-rs. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]fghug 97 points 3 days ago well, they are good at flipping switches permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]andrewdavidmackenzie 31 points 3 days ago Yes, and the golang version was already a \"switch flip\" and entire rewrite when they were close to done with the previous version.... permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]No_Benefit8574 9 points 3 days ago* What language did they rewrite the old version from? permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]andrewdavidmackenzie 6 points 2 days ago Can't recall, probably C++? But not sure permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]moltonel 21 points 2 days ago AFAICT they've used Go since the early days. The 2.0 release made some big architecture changes, but it didn't change the language wholesale. The current Rust rewrite happened progressively as well, component by component until the 3.0 release which visibly brings them all together. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]andrewdavidmackenzie 3 points 2 days ago There was definitely a previous version. We were on the verge of using it a few years ago, when they cancelled it as they started the go rewrite. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]andrewdavidmackenzie 8 points 2 days ago Maybe this https://blog.gopheracademy.com/birthday-bash-2014/why-influxdb-uses-go/ permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]moltonel 5 points 2 days ago QED: They've been using Go from the start. Maybe you got confused by InfluxDB IOx ? It's the Rust rewrite of their core component, but started as a standalone product with lots of bells and whistles missing. AFAIU, InfluxDB 3.0 brings the IOx core back into the main product, with all the convenience/integration features now implemented in Rust. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]andrewdavidmackenzie 1 point 2 days ago That post I linked talks about the original version in Scala, etc and the decision to rewrite in go.... permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]pauldix 6 points 2 days ago Scala was the API for Errplane (the company we pivoted from). That was a SaaS application for doing realtime metrics, application and server monitoring. To build that app, we had to build a time series API, which I did using Scala application code, Cassandra as the data store, with Redis for some realtime indexes and last value cache. It was the same tooling I had used in 2010 to build the backend time series solution for a fintech startup. These were the precursors to then rewriting that service in Go with LevelDB as the storage engine. That was the precursor to the first version of InfluxDB, which really just added a SQL-like query language on top of it. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]pacific_plywood 10 points 2 days ago Honestly I respect the neuroticism permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]markus3141 26 points 3 days ago Wow they killed the awful Flux query language. Not for the reasons I imagined, but seeing a return of InfluxQL is nice. Maybe this makes Influx 3.x usable again as I’ve been avoiding 2.x wherever possible. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]DelusionalPianist 10 points 2 days ago Haha, nice, I have been stalling my upgrades so far too. Seems my laziness is paying off for once! permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Floppie7th 3 points 2 days ago Flux is great for building complex reports, but awful for simple reports and ad-hoc queries. InfluxQL is obviously good for the latter, has much better support in Grafana, and was awful to wire up in 2.0. It'd be nice if they supported both as first-class citizens. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]mzinsmeister 0 points 2 days ago iOX also enables plain old SQL... permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]beatool 2 points 16 hours ago I gave up on influx with 2.0. It was 10x the work to setup and write queries for. I’ll definitely be trying it 3.0. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]dbrgn 2 points 12 hours ago Flux is really cool for compley queries, because it is so flexible, but then you realize that the query you wrote is dog slow because you didn't hit the right indices... I wrote 3 or 4 complex Flux queries for Grafana, but all of them are slow. If possible, I prefer InfluxQL. I just hope InfluxDB adds a few additional capabilities. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]stephenlblum 20 points 2 days ago We are migrating our stacks to Rust. Including progress from Golang to Rust. We are doing this incrementally on a per service basis. We see lower latency in Rust. And fewer errors/bugs. Often we find unintended nil pointer reference errors from our Golang. We have been diligent in our Golang codebases, yet still we see better results from our Rust deployments. Real-world Production Go vs Rust comparison We have an application in production that is servicing API calls. Both our Rust and Golang codebases serve equal amounts of traffic. We are in a migration phase. Here are our results so far: Golang 25% CPU Usage 5ms Latency (p50) Rust 5% CPU Usage 0ms Latency \"sub-millisecond\" (p50) With high traffic volumes, this difference is meaningful. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]iyicanme 12 points 2 days ago Not trying to diminish your findings but I just want to bring up the rewrite factor. When you rewrite you are doing the same thing, again, with lessons learned from the first implementation, and the opportunity to realize the stuff in your wishlist. You just know to make the better tradeoffs, so the rewrite is bound to be better than the original, regardless of the language change. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]mildmanneredhatter 2 points 17 hours ago This is true. I'd say a not insignificant amount can be attributed to both a stricter compiler and lack of gc in rust though. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]stephenlblum 2 points 2 days ago u/iyicanme yes absolutely. There is opportunity to optimize the existing golang code. This is true in our case as well. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]yutannihilation 16 points 3 days ago It seems here's the full story in \"The history of InfluxDB 3.0 (formerly IOx)\" section: https://www.influxdata.com/blog/the-plan-for-influxdb-3-0-open-source/ permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]ISecksedUrMom 9 points 3 days ago Does anyone have any before-after benchmarks? permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]pauldix 10 points 2 days ago We did some performance benchmarking here: https://www.influxdata.com/blog/influxdb-3-0-is-2.5x-45x-faster-compared-to-influxdb-open-source/ But it's not really a fair comparison because the database architecture is totally different. From a high level, v3 does significantly better on ingest (using far fewer CPUs and taking in more data), 4-6x better on on-disk size, and massively better on queries that touch many individual time series. As expected from the architecture change, v1 and v2 do better on queries for individual series. But in many cases, v3 performance is still good enough for real-time monitoring, dashboarding and most of our customer use cases. Still a ton of optimization work to do, but we're very excited about the new version. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]waadam 3 points 2 days ago Why couldn't go version have this 4-6x smaller disk size too? This shouldn't be language dependent so makes no sense to me. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]pauldix 5 points 1 day ago As I mentioned, we didn't just change the language, we changed the entire database architecture. Version 3 uses Parquet as its persistence format and doesn't keep indexes. Versions 1 & 2 used our custom storage engine (time series merge tree & time series index, TSM & TSI). That change could have been made to the Go version, but that alone would have meant rewriting probably 35% of the database. And that's before even getting to the SQL and object store bits. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]waadam 1 point 1 day ago Thank you for your detailed description and great job done here (while gopher myself, I still admire such successful transition and the result). My intention was to make it obvious to less experienced developers that it's another case of \"there is no silver bullet\" but hard work, experience and possibility to reiterate the whole thing. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]adwhit2 40 points 3 days ago* There is this webinar with transcript from Jun 2023: https://www.influxdata.com/resources/meet-the-founders-an-open-discussion-about-rewriting-using-rust/ The reasons are the usual ones - reliability, predictability, performance. Golang doesn't seem like a very great choice for a DB to me, and Rust is perfect for it. Easy decision! permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]Trk-5000 6 points 2 days ago Go is a really good choice for a DB. It's just that Rust is much better. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [+]Glittering_Air_3724 comment score below threshold * (21 children) [–]Applecrap 4 points 2 days ago Wait, so you're saying I might not have to rely on awful third-party rust driver libs anymore? Fantastic! permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]insanitybit 3 points 2 days ago Separate compute from storage and tiered data storage. The DB should use cheaper object storage as its long-term durable store. TBH that's the big one for me. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]dscardedbandaid 5 points 2 days ago Also for anyone interested il on the Datafusion specifics, found Andrew Lamb’s recent webinar series interesting: https://youtu.be/NVKujPxwSBA?si=-J1CpgPbwIVb40rD And as an end user pumped for parquet storage and flight sql support permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]Dasher38 6 points 3 days ago Anyone knows what implementation of parquet they use ? Kind of too lazy to check it out but there is an FFI version and a pure Rust version, that unfortunately seemed to be on its way out due to lack of funding/available maintainer time. But things may have changed permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]rapsey 14 points 3 days ago https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]dscardedbandaid 3 points 2 days ago Are you referring to the Arrow2 crate or parquet2 crate? permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Dasher38 1 point 2 days ago Yes, both. Apparently this relies on arrow-rs and parquet-rs, so the ffi to the official c++ implementation permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]dscardedbandaid 1 point 2 days ago I meant source or info around those 2 projects getting dropped. I thought I read that Ritchie from polars is starting a company, and I last I checked they’re still using arrow2 extensively. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Dasher38 1 point 2 days ago It seems to be more complicated, I was remembering probably some early exchanges wrt to that: https://github.com/jorgecarleitao/arrow2/issues/1429 https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/1176 So the situation is kind of unclear atm on the future of arrow2 permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]dscardedbandaid 2 points 1 day ago Thanks for the link. Been following both for a few years, but clearly not closely enough recently. Fan of the stuff Jorge has done with Arrow2, but also would like to see the two consolidated to speed up progress in Rust. A while back I was getting better performance with arrow2, but I’ll have to try again to see how they compare. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Dasher38 1 point 1 day ago Yeah, I was also happy to see an unsafe-free crate after experiencing some crashes with the Python parquet bindings. Also at some point I really cared about statically linked cross compiled binaries, which are very easy to get with pure Rust. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Existing-Account8665 7 points 2 days ago Does timescaleDB have any advantages over influxDB (other than being written by a database company that doesn't delete its customers' data)?

GP asked what an advantage of TsDB might be. Performance benchmarks are generally easy to come by if that's what one is interested in. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]daanavitch 4 points 2 days ago Like someone else already said, Timescale is just a Postgres extension so you can rely on the decades old Postgres codebase which is known to be extremely stable. At my current job we had been using Influx but switched to Timescale because there were so many issues with stability, some queries would bring the whole system to a halt, we had to restart it so many times, losing data in the process, it was a total mess. Timescale is not the fastest though. For our really big datasets we switched to Clickhouse, which is purposely built for big data. The engine has some oddities you have to learn, but the read/write speed is insanely fast. Kinda wished we would have used Clickhouse for everything from the start. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Existing-Account8665 2 points 2 days ago* Clickhouse Thanks for that, I'll have a look. How easy is it to produce backups? I've not been able to find a better method in TimeScale than an SQL dump.

In a way, it&#x27;s pretty cool since it means that they don&#x27;t get stuck with bad decisions for backwards compatibility reasons, but it&#x27;s a bit of a roller coaster for users.Not sure what&#x27;s the best solution though. Having a \"stable\" but fundamentally limited product (I guess influxdb v1) or breaking stuff in hopes of ending up with a way better technical foundation. reply tetha 18 hours agoparentWe&#x27;re migrating off of InfluxDB due to that rollercoaster, honestly. It&#x27;s hard enough to find time to maintain the monitoring stack at work. Casually dropping \"Oh, and now you get to rebuild the entire grafana to change the query language\" on that doesn&#x27;t help. And apparently, version 3 does the same thing, except backwards.Sorry, but at that point, we&#x27;ve decided to rebuild the entire metric visualization once on TimescaleDB, since we&#x27;re running postgres a lot anyhow. reply the_duke 17 hours agorootparentFair warning, I had serious scaling issues with Timescale.Solutions like Grafana Mimir, Victoria Metrics, Clickhouse, or yes, the new Influx implementation, are much more scalable and will give you much fewer headaches.ClickhouseDB is realy brilliant, btw, it&#x27;s a powerhouse. Especially with the fairly recent additions that enable hybrid local + S3 option, pushing older metrics to S3 for cheap long-term storage. reply mxstbr 15 hours agorootparentAgreed. We initially used Timescale for our GraphQL Metrics product[0] but very quickly ran into scaling & performance issues.

Any concerns there about accidentally causing \"trashing\" when cold data is needed? I believe the MergeTree system works by splitting the table into parts during insertion that then later get merged together, so you have to careful that during merging, only the \"hot\" data is touched, otherwise you&#x27;ll start pulling in cloud storage data that&#x27;s supposed to be effectively read-only. reply the_duke 14 hours agorootparentThe merging happens primarily on hot data, I haven&#x27;t run into any issues there.But there are lots of approaches, depending on your needs.You can (should) define a \"cache disk\" for S3, which will cache up to X Gb locally to avoid trashing.Another option is is to move data into separate (purely S3 backed) tables after a certain time to avoid accidentally fetching large amounts of data from S3. You can still easily join the data together if needed. reply PaulWaldman 17 hours agorootparentprevCan you elaborate on what scaling issues you had with Timescale? reply efxhoy 17 hours agorootparentI ran into issues with TS too. Main issue I recall now was maintaining a grand total count of events that were already rolled up into daily counts was not fast since it always looked back at all the data. There was no way in the ts patterns to efficiently express it without handrolling something. The issue was that a grand total count can’t be expressed in terms of a hypertable because there’s no time column.It’s fantastic for workloads that neatly fit in the hypertable pattern though. reply lispisok 14 hours agorootparentYou tried to use a timeseries database without a time column? reply efxhoy 11 hours agorootparent> Don&#x27;t be snarky.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.htmlAre you expecting a real answer of how I was hoping timescale&#x27;s internal watermark system would help me roll up a total count or are you just implying I&#x27;m an idiot? reply mardifoufs 11 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s the difference between the watermark and a time column? Not the person you were replying to but I&#x27;m curious since I also thought that TimeseriesDB had a similar \"timestamp\" to influx. reply efxhoy 10 hours agorootparentTS requires you to specify a time column in each hypertable or view (continuous aggregate) where you want it to work its magic. It then stores an internal watermark that it compares to the time column in the table to figure out from where to read when refreshing.My issue was that for a grand total I didn’t have a time column, so I couldn’t define my query as a continuous aggregate and the query had to start counting from the start of my underlying series each time. replykungito 14 hours agorootparentprevSame here. I joined current company 3 years ago when Influx v2 was coming out. I was supposed to build some analytics on top of it. It was very painful. Flux compiler was often giving internal errors, docs were unclear and it was hard to write any a bit more complicated code. The dash is subpar to graphana but graphana had just raw support. There was no query builder for flux so I tried building dashboards in influxv2 but the whole experience was excrutiating. I still have an issue open where they have an internal function incorrectly written in their own flux code and I provided the fix and what was the issue but it was never addressed. Often times I had a feeling that I found bugs in situations that were so basic that it felt like I was the only person on the planet writing Flux code reply mmcnl 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m running InfluxDB 1 and 2 in parallel for a personal project, waiting for v2 to get mature and stable enough to replace v1. It&#x27;s never happening I guess. v1 still works great for me. reply x86a 17 hours agorootparentprevWe are influxdb enterprise customers and looking to do the same thing. They&#x27;ve kept their enterprise offering on 1.x, which has kept us mostly happy, but seeing what&#x27;s going on in their OSS stuff is horrifying and we&#x27;re looking to avoid the crash and burn at the end of the tunnel. reply pauldix 16 hours agorootparentWe announced the availability of the v3 successor to Enterprise v1.

This is the only reason I would entertain TimescaleDB, if I had a strict \"1 server\" requirement. I briefly deployed and looked into it and there were a lot of footguns like with compression.If not, I would suggest looking at a proper OLAP DB. VictoriaMetrics has been great and was easy to set up. reply tetha 18 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re much rather looking at reducing the number of technologies we have and exchanging one specialized one-use database for another one doesn&#x27;t sound great. And sure, TimescaleDB is a hefty extension and will require some work to understand it, but things like HA, backups and overall management of Postgres are pretty much solved for us.And beyond that, TimescaleDB works with a few things we have already. We could migrate Zabbix to use TimescaleDB for a large performance boost. Also 1-2 teams are building reporting solutions for the product platform, and they are generating some significant timeseries data in a Postgres database as well. reply pphysch 17 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a fair point, but it&#x27;s worth appreciating the fundamental differences between OLTP RDBMS and OLAP timeseries. I&#x27;m not saying deploy N different DBs, I&#x27;m saying pick a good OLTP solution (Postgres) and a good OLAP solution.My bad experience with TimescaleDB 3 years ago was that enabling compression required disabling the \"dynamic labels\" feature, which was a total nonstarter for us. A proper timeseries DB is designed to achieve great compression while also allowing flexibility of series. Hopefully Timescale will&#x2F;has fixed that without adding another drastic perf tradeoff, but given how Postgres is architected for OLTP I would be surprised. reply mfreed 16 hours agorootparentCan you say more about \"dynamic labels\"? Do you just mean that as you evolve, you want to add a new type of \"key-value\" pair?The most common approach here is just to store the step of \"dynamic\" labels in JSON, which can be evolved arbitrarily.And we&#x27;ve found that this type of data actually compresses quite well in practice.Also regarding compression, Timescale supports transparent mutability on compressed data, so you can directly INSERT&#x2F;UPDATE&#x2F;UPSERT&#x2F;DELETE into compressed data. Under the covers, it&#x27;s doing smart optimizations to manage how it asynchronously maps individual mutations into segment level operations to decompress&#x2F;recompress.(Timescale cofounder) reply PaulWaldman 16 hours agorootparentprev>My bad experience with TimescaleDB 3 years ago was that enabling compression required disabling the \"dynamic labels\" feature, which was a total nonstarter for us.What is the \"dynamic labels\" feature? Is it a part of Postgres or Timescale? reply pphysch 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a Timescale feature that allows you to \"just insert\" metrics without first doing a schema migration to make sure a possible new label schema is supported. I.e. a feature that is taken for granted in native timeseries databases, which don&#x27;t have to work around RDBMS schemas.I assume it&#x27;s doing an automatic ALTER TABLE when necessary, which modifies each row and somehow breaks compression across the sharded tables. Or at least an automatic re-compression would cause massive latency on insert that they wanted to avoid. reply hnarn 17 hours agorootparentprevYou threw out a database because it didn’t offer compression in your specific use case? That’s it?Just solve compression on the block level, why are you so specific about it happening in the database? It’s probably one of the least interesting feature comparisons when betting on which database to trust. reply pphysch 16 hours agorootparentNot all compression is created equally. Timeseries data has well-defined characteristics that generic block level compression doesn&#x27;t understand. It&#x27;s a great example where application-level compression is worthwhile. The proof is in the pudding. reply phamilton 18 hours agorootparentprevA reason I would still bias towards postgres is the maturity of managed solutions (including decoupled compute&#x2F;storage solutions like Aurora and AlloyDB).Are managed \"proper OLAP DB\" solutions competitive with managed RDBMS from a price and ease of use standpoint? reply PaulWaldman 18 hours agorootparentUsing TimescaleDB from a managed provider is limited, unless of course that provider is Timescale. Other managed providers are only permitted to use the TimescaleDB Apache 2 Edition.This link has a comparison of features[1].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.timescale.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;latest&#x2F;timescaledb-editions... reply danielvaughn 18 hours agoparentprevIt’s funny how for the longest time, I was upset with how slowly the web moved. At times I wished they wouldn’t care as much about backwards compatibility.But now with these VC-funded tech products that have spawned over the last 5-7 years, who have a move-fast-and-break-things attitude, I’m seeing the benefits of the old approach.I suppose it’s all a matter of trade offs, as with all things, and there’s no silver bullet. reply ilyt 18 hours agoparentprevWe just left it.

I am pretty excited with 3.x&#x27;s interoperability. Archiving to standard data formats makes the data science team&#x27;s job&#x27;s easier, and with a more standard ANSI SQL query engine with jdbc support, and high cardinality tags, it will greatly speed up front end development and analysis use cases.As well, I am one of those folks that happens to find the Flux query language powerful, but it&#x27;s not easy enough for folks to just make that jump from SQL. Flux is much closer to Splunk&#x27;s search language. It is good at what it does. FluxQL doesn&#x27;t even have date parsing (which is really odd for a time series query language), but FlightSQL in 3.x seems to be more complete. reply mardifoufs 17 hours agorootparentYes I think v3 is pretty solid, and it&#x27;s nice that they are still supporting v1 and v2. But I think the \"migration\" from v1 to v2 was the \"painful\" part. Not because it was too hard to migrate (I guess you don&#x27;t even have to, since it&#x27;s still supported), but because it introduced a very different approach, that was supposed to be the future of influx, that was just basically dropped in the next release. I think some commitment towards v3 might help in that regard. As you said, flux is powerful and took some time to get used to but it&#x27;s now basically useless if you took the time to get into it.I like that they are converging towards SQL, but at the same time it&#x27;s a bit like going back to square one. They seem more convinced about going full SQL this time though, but yeahJust searching for this, I stumbled on this documentation page that illustrates the point very well:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.influxdata.com&#x2F;influxdb&#x2F;v1&#x2F;query_language&#x2F;In the same page (about the original influxql in v1), there is a depecration notice for v1 stating that v2 is the stable version, implying that InfluxQL is not recommended. And a pop up notice stating that v2 (flux) is basically deprecated and just in maintenance mode, and that you should use InfluxQL. But as I said in my earlier comment, I guess in some ways that&#x27;s better than being too rigid and sticking with bad or less ideal technical decisions. reply pauldix 17 hours agorootparentFor v3 we&#x27;re supporting InfluxQL natively in addition to SQL. The InfluxQL implementation is actually just a front end on top of DataFusion, the SQL engine we use.We really wanted to bring Flux along too, but found that it was too difficult in the near term to have it work well with v3. We spent a bunch of time building a gRPC API that Flux uses to talk to v3 (the same thing we have in our Cloud v2 product), but that API was designed with the previous storage engine in mind. It ended up being brittle and performed very poorly.So at this point the long term supported languages for InfluxQL and SQL, but we&#x27;re continuing to support Flux for our customers. reply mnahkies 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve always had a soft spot for influxdb after using it for a self hosted datadog&#x2F;newrelic etc solution many (6+) years ago with great success. Still use it in conjunction with telegraf and grafana for personal project monitoring, but I&#x27;ve not brought myself to upgrade from the 1.x series.Hopefully it&#x27;s improved, but last time I tried upgrading I found the UX in grafana to be subpar on the newer versions, as I recall you lost the autocomplete&#x2F;UI to build your queries. Obviously grafana is it&#x27;s own project but feels like they (influx) should invest more resource in areas like this to encourage people to upgrade - if you&#x27;re going to do major upgrades make sure they have feature parity reply justin_oaks 18 hours agorootparentLike you, I&#x27;ve stuck with Influx v1, Telegraf and Grafana. My policy is to upgrade only when there are significant reasons to. When I evaluated InfluxDB 2, there were no major reasons for me to switch. Of course, the data ingested in my case is relatively small. YMMV.I looked at TimescaleDB but at the time there was no easy way to get data from Telegraf to TimescaleDB. Telegraf finally merged code that allows writes to Postgres databases, but it took like 3 years to do that.Ultimately, I still stuck with InfluxDB v1 because sending data to it via the InfluxDB line protocol is so simple. I have a couple of bash scripts that use awk to transform command output to Influx line protocol and send it to InfluxDB. It&#x27;s just so simple. I love it.I love learning about new things, but the InfluxDB v1 keeps working fine so I may not switch from it until something forces me to do it. reply ilyt 18 hours agorootparentWas very similar for me. No good reason to go V2, the new query language, on top of sucking for anyone that only uses it once every few weeks, also wasn&#x27;t really supported well in Grafana.I ended up trying VictoriaMetrics by near accident as infuxdb didn&#x27;t like something on my raspberry pi, and honestly it has been pretty painless. It is Prometheus-like stack which means you can use any PromQL-compatible things with it. There is \"all in one binary\", and version split by functions.VM have tools to migrate from InfluxDB v1. I ended up just sticking old influxdb data in one database, as I wanted to change the format of what I write to it along with the migration.> Ultimately, I still stuck with InfluxDB v1 because sending data to it via the InfluxDB line protocol is so simple.

Dumb question (I couldn&#x27;t find a definitive answer) but will v3 InfluxQL be compatible with v1? Is there an article about the changes between v1 and v3? reply pauldix 16 hours agorootparentYes, the goal was that for anyone with Grafana dashboards or queries elsewhere, they wouldn&#x27;t have to rewrite them. Just point at v3 and pretend that it&#x27;s a v1 database (use the v1 API).But there are a few things that aren&#x27;t there. Continuous queries, SELECT INTO, and anything that modifies data isn&#x27;t there. reply badrabbit 15 hours agoparentprevWhy would you find that cool? It&#x27;s anything but unless it is a personal project. If people depend on your work, that is irresponsible. reply mardifoufs 10 hours agorootparentI guess I&#x27;d rather have that than ossifying on a completely flawed architecture. Apparently flux was kind of a dead end, and while it&#x27;s super risky and illustrates issues in decision making, it&#x27;s still better than just doubling down on something that their own team consider to be futureless or too flawed. reply tptacek 18 hours agoprevThe backstory here is they were doing a rewrite anyways, for reasons that had not much to do with languages; they expected to write some C++ for the new version.

Both the v1 write and query endpoints are supported in v3. There may some gaps here and there, but our goal is to make it so that all the things that worked with v1 will work with v3. The only two exceptions would be the subscription API that Kapacitor used and Continuous Queries. We warned people off from using both of those features in v1 as they didn&#x27;t work well under load.With v3, I prefer to think of it as us doubling down on core database performance and functionality. With v2 we tried to create this whole development platform. V3 brings our focus back to the core database, which I think will yield better results for everyone. reply asah 12 hours agoprevHow big are y&#x27;all that you need InfluxDB?For one database that receives 100M 600 byte JSON records&#x2F;day, a single node AWS PostgreSQL RDS instance is handling it effortlessly, and the DBA work is very part-time. We keep year+ of summaries and 48 hours of detail, unloading the rest to S3 as parquet files, queryable by Athena if we need. AFAICT, we&#x27;re spendingPrometheus only handle aggregated data, though.That&#x27;s not true. You&#x27;re referring to pull-based approach for metrics collection. It has its tradeoffs (like fixed interval scraping), but has a lot of benefits too (like higher reliability). Check the following link [0] from VictoriaMetrics docs, which supports both push and pull approaches. Prometheus also gained push support this year, though.However, the main difference between Prometheus-like systems (Thanos, Mimir, VictoriaMetrics) and more traditional DBs for time series like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB is that first are designed to reflect system&#x27;s state, and last are designed to reflect system&#x27;s events. That&#x27;s the main difference in paradigm, data model, and query languages. There is a reason why PromQL is so easy in 99% of cases, and so complex and annoying when users want to express what they get used to in traditional databases.I&#x27;m saying this because I went through creating a Grafana datasource for ClickHouse [1] and I felt how complicated it is to express a most straightforward PromQL query in SQL, and vice versa.If you&#x27;d like to learn more about differences between common queries for plotting time series in PromQL and SQL see my talk here [2].[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.victoriametrics.com&#x2F;keyConcepts.html#write-data[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grafana.com&#x2F;grafana&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;vertamedia-clickhouse-da...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_zORxrgLtec?t=835 reply ilyt 18 hours agorootparentprevAFAIK only difference is that in Influx a given row can have more than one value so say \"interface traffic\" would be interface_if_octets host=router,instance=eth0,rx=123584,tx=213956while in prometheus it would be interface_if_octets host=router,instance=eth0,type=rx 123584 interface_if_octets host=router,instance=eth0,type=tx 213956which in theory yes it is more compact but it gave me more annoyances than advantages during querying>While Prometheus is often good enough for standard metrics, it is just things it can&#x27;t handle.My experience is that just anything made to ingest and analyze logs ends up mediocre for metrics and vice versa. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen single product that did both well or efficiently. So I&#x27;d rather have good metrics and just use ELK&#x2F;Graylog&#x2F;whatever else for logs. reply matsemann 15 hours agorootparentNot really the biggest difference, I feel. In Prometheus, you only have the data you scrape. So lets say you scrape every minute. Then all you have is a counter per pod increasing from some value to something else.With influx you can save every event. So you know exactly when it happened, the unique labels for that event etc. It&#x27;s a completely different paradigm.So in Prometheus you have myCounter,pod=1,time=20:23,value=1000 myCounter,pod=2,time=20:23,value=500 myCounter,pod=1,time=20:24,value=1100 myCounter,pod=2,time=20:24,value=700so all you know is that some event happened 100 times on pod1 and 200 times on pod2 the last minute. But with influx you could have a row for every single event. Of course that explodes the query time in comparison, but allows you to do much more with the data if needed. reply lakomen 19 hours agoparentprevInflux is a wholesome solution where Prometheus is just the time series database reply Too 4 hours agorootparentCan you expand what you are missing?Prometheus is not just the db itself, it’s the ecosystem around it.

I was using the TICK stack a few years ago and the switch to TIG (Telegraf, InfluDB, and Grafana) has been a breath of fresh air.Telegraf and InfluxDB are solid, but Chronograf was behind Grafana in usability and features.Kapacitor was pretty rough. The language it used was hard to write, the docs were barebones, somewhat confusing, and sometimes inaccurate. When I switched off of Kapacitor, the CPU usage on the server dropped significantly too. So I&#x27;m guessing Kapacitor wasn&#x27;t too CPU friendly either. reply cmrdporcupine 18 hours agoparentprevThis I guess is the mystery to me. Projects like this are great.

They are a runner-up, but there is room in this market for runner-ups, and their feature set does match some that Prometheus is not good at. reply ilyt 17 hours agorootparentI think they missed one thing: Nobody wants to get locked in with the runner-up.If they on top of that provided some compatibility layer for Prometheus&#x2F;PromQL, like few other competitors did, then the prospective enterprise client have warm fuzzies that if they don&#x27;t like it they don&#x27;t need to rewrite entirety of their stack to work with something else. People could also use the existing ecosystem and \"just plug it in\", even replacing Prometheus instances they might have.In the end people want to ingest the metrics and display it in Grafana. They don&#x27;t need another visualisation solution that has less support and documentation. They don&#x27;t want to learn new weird query language that is simulatenously more verbose and less readable than PromQL or even influxQL from v1. reply vb-8448 19 hours agorootparentprevDon&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t denigrate Influx DB. They have some interesting features that prometheus doesn&#x27;t have, I just don&#x27;t think that this features can lead to a mass adoption(and money).Let&#x27;s put this way: is there any killer feature that can ditch most of the Prometheus installations in their favor? reply ilyt 17 hours agorootparentAnd it *has* to be feature, not just \"it&#x27;s faster\", because they are (much) faster time-series databases that support PromQL and are near-drop-in to your infrastructure. reply manicennui 14 hours agorootparentprevI think you&#x27;d find that Prometheus is way behind a number of solutions in the corporate world, including Graphite, DogStatsD, etc. Popularity on HN does not translate to real world popularity. reply vb-8448 13 hours agorootparentMost of the companies in the corporate world have more than a monitoring system, at least 3 in my experience: sysadmins have at least one, network guys another one and one for legacy platforms (mainframes, as400 and so on).Plus, in the last years with the rise of Kubernetes, most corporates have at least one cluster with Prometheus monitoring it.Always, base on my experience, Prometheus is very popular, but the adoption is not so wide due to its `oss nature`: CTOs want someone to blame when things go wrong. reply hagen1778 13 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s only a matter of time when they hire younger engineers who are familiar with modern monitoring systems and eager to apply their knowledge in practice. reply manicennui 9 hours agorootparentWhat is it that you think prometheus offers over other solutions?

Not about the choice of language itself, but the fact that they prioritize such rewrites over features, similar to the concerns from other commenters. They mention \"performance\" and \"garbage collector\" and \"error handling\" which are almost technical details.A company can make good money for quite a while as long as the performance is \"good enough\", and usually focuses on adding features instead of worrying about any rewriting&#x2F;re-architect until there is a bottleneck or issues start to significantly slow down development. How \"successful\" such a rewrite still needs to be seen, but this is risky for most companies&#x2F;products. reply pauldix 17 hours agoparentIn this case, the features we kept getting asked for by our customers necessitated a change in underlying database architecture. I talk about that quite a bit in the reddit thread.I totally agree that a rewrite is risky. It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d choose to do again, but at the time we didn&#x27;t really see any way around rewriting the bulk of the database (even if we kept it implemented in Go).Using Rust and the Arrow ecosystem of projects (Parquet, DataFusion, Flight) meant that there were a ton of things we didn&#x27;t have to do from scratch. One of our staff engineers, Andrew Lamb, has called it a toolkit for building databases. Thanks in part to his contributions, I think he&#x27;s right. reply say_it_as_it_is 16 hours agorootparentWhat is meant by separating compute from storage? This keeps being mentioned as if it were some new paradigm shift so I assume there&#x27;s a non-obvious situation. reply pauldix 15 hours agorootparentA traditional monolithic database assumes that you have locally attached storage. All of your ingest, indexing and query processing happens on the machine with that storage (i.e. your compute and storage live together). The cloud kind of complicated things with EBS and high IOPS network storage, but generally, those work kind of the same way. The volume is mounted on a single machine that uses it.When people talk about separating compute from storage, they mean pulling compute heavy tasks like query, ingest, indexing, and compaction apart and using a shared storage tier that many systems can talk to. Usually this is object storage paired with some sort of catalog (kept in either object storage or some other store or API).Snowflake popularized this approach in the data warehousing and OLAP space with great success. Their papers submitted to VLDB are great reads on the topoic. reply voiper1 17 hours agoparentprevThe first comment is from the Cofounder and he lists the _features_ that motivated a rewrite:>Then there&#x27;s the question of why we did a rewrite at all. We wanted to get at some important requirements: >Unlimited cardinality >Analytics queries against time series at the performance of a columnar DB >Use object store as the durability layer for historical data (i.e. separate compute from storage) >SQL and broader ecosystem compatibility >All of that stuff taken together meant that we&#x27;d be rewriting most of the core of the database. ... reply d3w4s9 16 hours agorootparentSure, the write definitely could have helped releasing these new features, but the language transition itself takes non-trivial effort and could have been used for adding additional features instead. I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that such a language transition is desperately needed. Also I said deprioritize adding features, not stop adding features, mind you. The core question here is what kind of benefit we are seeing by changing the language.If you are a fan of Rust and want to rewrite all your just because of that and you are the CTO, whatever, what can I say.

Go is nice in the way that Go is nice (if you even agree with that statement) precisely because it doesn&#x27;t have that control. Unless it is a terminal goal for a database to be in Go simply to be in Go (BoltDB seems to fit into this category) or you don&#x27;t care to compete at the very top end, I think it&#x27;s a mistake to even start in Go.To be honest, most of the \"we started in Go and switched to Rust\" stories read to me as \"you should have always known that you should have started in Rust\" (or C++ or something, though I&#x27;d choose Rust out of the viable set of languages here too). It&#x27;s IMHO always been obvious that Go was not really viable, I mean, sure, you can get farther than you could with starting with Python, but, it&#x27;s not something Go was even trying to solve. reply zozbot234 3 hours agorootparentMost \"we started in Go\" projects are a lot older than Rust itself.

Then for the 2 years following that it was 9 people total.It wasn&#x27;t until late last year that we made the decision to go all in on the rewrite and made that the focus of everyone in engineering.

At around 12,000 years old, Göbekli Tepe is the world’s oldest megalithic site – and it has a “sister site” called Karahantepe. A recent discovery in the world’s oldest religious sanctuary, Göbeklitepe, “Potbelly Hill” in Turkish, which is described as the “zero point of history” has revealed a painted wild boar statue. The UNESCO World Heritage site of Göbeklitepe has changed the way historians and archaeologists think about the cradle of civilization. And there is so much more to be discovered. A painted wild boar statue was discovered during ongoing excavations in Göbeklitepe. The artifact, which contained red, white, and black pigment residues on its surface, was the first painted sculpture found from its period to the present day. Wild boar statue. Photo: Göbeklitepe Excavation team As part of the Taş Tepeler project, which sheds light on prehistory and has seen highly significant discoveries on a global scale, the archaeological excavations carried out in 2023 in 9 different areas have recently led to the discovery of human and animal statues. Photo: The Ministry of Culture and Tourism The Türkiye Ministry of Culture and Tourism has released a written statement providing the following information: In the D structure of Göbeklitepe, a life-sized wild boar sculpture made of limestone was discovered. The wild boar sculpture found in Göbeklitepe was situated on a pedestal adorned with decorations believed to include an H-shaped symbol, a crescent, two snakes, and three human faces or masks. Photo: The Ministry of Culture and Tourism The Human Statue is One of the Most Impressive Examples of Prehistoric Art One of the most realistic statue of the era was unearthed, standing at a height of 2.3 meters and featuring a lifelike facial expression in Karahantepe. The similarity of the human statue with the relief found in the Sayburç excavations in 2021 is striking. One of the panels in the Sayburc depicts a figure holding their phallus in his right hand. However, new discovered statue depicts a figure holding its phallus with both hands. This seated statue, which strongly evokes the image of a deceased human with emphasized rib, spinal, and shoulder bones, was discovered within a niche fixed to the ground. Photo: The Ministry of Culture and Tourism In the same area where the sculpture was found, a vulture sculpture placed on the wall, and stone plates left on the ground were also uncovered. Studies carried out in Şanlıurfa province in Turkey in recent years have enabled the determination of settlements indicating the existence of a different phase within the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period. The region of these settlements is named “Taş Tepeler,” literally meaning Stone Hills. Taş Tepeler is an Anatolian and Upper Mesopotamian region that held the oldest established settlements, spanning 200 kilometers from one end to the other.

I think it’s supposed to be more like 6000 years ago. The fact that it has been carbon dated to 12,000 tears should means that we have to rewrite the theories on the start of human civilization.These statues needed to be carved out of tools and the educational techniques for carving it off stone and the social structure to support art were not supposed to exist at this time. This is pretty huge in terms of figuring out the birth of human civilization.And the fact that the same site also has these huge stone megaliths that also weren’t supposed to be possible and were also dated to 12,000 years so just solidified the idea that our current theories are completely wrong. reply M4v3R 3 minutes agoparent> My understanding is that complex things like statues were not supposed to be possible 12,000 years ago. I think it’s supposed to be more like 6000 years agoI think your understanding was just incorrect. Here&#x27;s a video [0] from Kurzgesagt that explains in a nutshell when the human civilisation started (spoiler: around 20,000 years ago, though the boundary is very fuzzy). But also note that even before a proper civilisation started to form people already made art.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CWu29PRCUvQ reply p-e-w 6 hours agoparentprev> My understanding is that complex things like statues were not supposed to be possible 12,000 years ago.Huh? The Venus of Willendorf[1] is twice as old, and to my eye displays a higher degree of artistry than the statue shown in the article. Several such Venus figurines have been found in central Europe.Compared to the intricacy of the Venus&#x27; limestone carving, the statue from the article looks downright crude. The idea that it&#x27;s \"not supposed to be possible\" to make something like that 12,000 years BP is ridiculous, and I can&#x27;t imagine where you might have got that impression. Yes, the new statue is life-size, while the Venus is a figurine, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it any more difficult to manufacture (possibly easier, in fact).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Venus_of_Willendorf reply maratc 36 minutes agorootparentWhat I think you might be missing is that Venus could be a pet project of a single person, done in their free time over some period.The statues, especially in the context of the greater site, could not be made by one person — many people should be working there for quite a long period of time, while physically staying in the place. Since they were working on the temple complex, (a) they could not be themselves participating in hunter-gathering activities (and we think human societies were engaged with that at the time); and (b) someone else should be providing them with the food, clothes, tools, and everything they need — implying there was some sort of a social structure (aka civilization).This is what I think GP meant when saying \"not supposed to be possible 12,000 years ago\". reply vanderZwan 8 minutes agorootparentI fully agree with what you&#x27;re saying, but I just want add something to your comment in case people might misinterpret this sentence:> What I think you might be missing is that Venus could be a pet project of a single person, done in their free time over some period.Yes, a single Venus figure is likely made by a single person. But the Venus of Willendorf is not unique. There are 200 over known \"Venus figurines\" from a period of 300,000 BC to 11,00 BC. So they were a wide-spread phenomenon indicating some form of shared socio-cultural connection among the early humans despite how far we were spread out and how much lower the population density was compared to now.This is of course tangential to the point you were making.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Venus_figurine reply permo-w 29 minutes agorootparentprevlook, if you take the two things in isolation, then you may have a point. the Venus is certainly a more beautiful artistic piecebut you&#x27;re trying to argue that an 11cm tall figurine with no facial features is a civilisational achievement on par with a massive &#x27;temple&#x27; complex full of metres-high sculptures, reliefs and symbols that would require significant societal organisation and advancement: protection, education, food surplus, likely division of labour. decades of work at leastthe Venus of Willendorf could indicate some of those things, but it equally could have just been made by one especially advanced human reply bazoom42 14 minutes agorootparentNobody is arguing that.

Should I consider that maybe I have had a pest problem for months or possibly years, or should I consider this as \"we found evidence for rats existing in my house for at most one day\"?It seems archeology takes the \"evidence based\" approach and refuses to calculate the expected probability of more stuff being discovered that&#x27;s older&#x2F;more impressive using the fact that we are discovering (mostly) random stuff buried in the ground.What are the chances that the stuff we dug up are not the pinnacle of human civilization back then, and merely an average object? If people 3000 years from now dug up a brick from a rural village, should they infer that we only know how to build brick houses and not skyscrapers? What are the chances of digging up remains of a skyscraper?I have so many burning questions lol reply bazoom42 6 minutes agorootparentThere is no way to calculate that, since current finds are not random digs.

They dive into the archaeological record and argue precisely that: that the common story of how civilization developed is very wrong, and that complex societies existed before the rise of agriculture, longer than is usually assumed. These findings at Göbekli Tepe appear very much in line with their theory.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Dawn_of_Everything reply xbmcuser 39 minutes agoparentprevIt has been my pet theory that human civilizations had advanced a lot more before a some kind of extinction event pushed humans back to 1. Maybe not as technologically advanced as the current civilization but advanced in its own way. reply maebert 29 minutes agorootparentIt’s an entertaining idea, however unfortunately easily proven wrong. The most striking argument against it (or any “Silurian” theory) is that any form of “civilization” in the strictest sense needs permanent settlements that require permanent agriculture, and hence fertilized soil. We should hence be able to find nitrogen rich layers of soil or sediment where prehistoric civilizations resided, but that’s just not the case. reply sgt101 1 hour agoparentprevYup - if you are thinking about what the story was in about 1978...Since then there&#x27;s been a big change from the idea cities were the only locus of culture and technology to a view that nomadic peoples were able to create significant ritual art, technical knowlege, and complex cultures. Of course the view from the 19th and early 20th C&#x27;s was significantly informed by the need to justify all the genociding of nomadic peoples (\"it&#x27;s for their own good\").The idea I&#x27;ve heard recently is that agriculture grew out of nomadic people encouraging the food plants that they would be looking for in a years time by planting selected seeds and then going off to the next area, over time this led to crops that were more and more adapted as food stuff and this then enabled settled agrarianism. Places like Göbeklitepe are thought to be the ritual centers of nomadic cultures doing this sort of per-agricultural precession.

I plan to keep many posts free for the time being — especially when it comes to public disputes like this one. However, there are paywalled posts and other perks for paying subscribers. Subscribe One of my rules when I get in public debates as a statistician is: The simpler, the better. More or less, this is a version of Occam’s Razor. The more complications you introduce into an analysis, the more confounding variables that you attempt to control for, the more you expand researcher degrees of freedom — in other words, decision points by the analyst about how to run the numbers. I don’t think it’s quite right to say these decisions are arbitrary. Ideally they’ll reflect a statistician’s judgment, experience and familiarity with the subject matter. Sometimes it’s absolutely necessary to control for confounders: otherwise you might wind up with ridiculous implications like that consuming ice cream causes drowning (summer weather is the obvious confounding variable). However, there are trade-offs when adding complications to your analysis. Although it’s possible to err in either direction, there’s a general tendency to overfit models. My keep-it-simple attitude is also a stress response from years of experience arguing on the Internet. Any time you can make your point using simple counting statistics or other very straightforward methods, I consider that a win. People usually aren’t really interested in the intricacies beyond a certain point. Most of the time, what Scott Alexander calls “isolated demands for rigor” — there’s always some factor you haven’t accounted for — are just stepping stones on the road to confirmation bias. So my aim is generally to focus on stylized facts that are true and robust. And to keep repeating them. I like simple (or simple-seeming) claims that — and I can’t emphasize this last part enough — I expect will hold up to scrutiny. How do I know when a claim is robust? Well, sometimes I’m wrong. But, honestly, experience helps. I’m an American, for instance, and so I’m much more confident when making claims about how a statistic varies across American states than across Chinese provinces. And I have a lot of hands-on experience with making statistically-driven decisions and putting money behind them. It also helps to have kicked the tires on the claim a bit. Maybe you have run the more complicated version of the analysis. Or even better, maybe you’ve run it several different ways. And maybe you’ve consulted other research on the subject. If you’ve done this, and you’re getting a consistent answer, your claim is probably robust. When this is the case, I don’t think it’s necessarily worth your time — when writing for a popular audience — to prepare the equivalent of a 20,000-word journal article detailing all your methods, full of Greek characters and dozens of footnotes. Share In a post on Friday, I made two stylized claims that I believe to be true and robust: Until vaccines became available, there was little difference in COVID death rates between blue states and red states. After vaccines became available, there were clear differences, with red states having higher death rates, almost certainly as a result of lower vaccine uptake among Republicans. This wasn’t intended as any sort of super-duper hot take, and I pared the post down to avoid having too much of an attack surface. Nevertheless, it quickly became the most commented-upon post in the (short) history of this publication. The comments here were fairly civil, especially at first. (I really appreciate that, everyone.) Externally, though, these claims were more controversial. Here for instance, was Martin Kulldorff on Twitter/X: Children with large feet are better at math, but not after adjusting for age Older people have >1000 time higher Covid mortality, and state average age differ by >10 years, so unadjusted state comparisons are misleading @NateSilver538 may wish to consult a statistician Kulldorff is not just some casual; he is a Professor of Medicine at Harvard.1 He is also one of the lead authors of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD), an October 2020 anti-lockdown statement signed by a large number of scientists and medical professionals. “Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal,” the statement read. If you don’t know my history with COVID policy2 and just think of me as Some Nerd Who Thinks The Vaccines Were Good, you’re probably expecting me to make fun of the GBD, which has been the subject of a lot of critical commentary. But actually, I mostly agree with it. I think its claims about focused protection and herd immunity were too optimistic. But I think it was directionally right — that by October 2020, the evidence was on the side of the costs of these measures outweighing the benefits. I also think efforts to suppress discussion of the GBD and to label it as “misinformation” were bullshit. Of course, the first of the two claims I made in Friday’s post supported this very point. Before the introduction of vaccines, it isn’t clear that the other things we were doing to stop COVID were really working well at all — and they were very costly. But on Twitter, I guess, you’ll rarely get credit for half-agreeing with someone. So Kulldorff took issue with my latter claim — that red states had higher death rates once vaccines became available — arguing that it was “meaningless” because I hadn’t adjusted for age. State partisanship is strongly related to COVID death rates, even once you control for age Kulldorff’s argument is unsound. Age does explain some of the differences in COVID death rates between states. Certainly, COVID is much, much more deadly for older people, to an extent the media probably didn’t emphasize enough. But, this is almost entirely orthogonal to state partisanship — and even more so to vaccination rates. As a quick aside, as someone who’s spent a lot of time looking at how behavioral and attitudinal data varies across American states, I think you should generally be suspicious when people attribute a lot of the differences to age. States don’t vary that much in age.3 It isn’t like variables such as racial or religious prevalence, where the deltas can be much larger (e.g. Utah has 100x the Mormon population of some other states). Age also doesn’t really pass an eyeball test as explaining the differences between states in COVID death rates, as I pointed out to Kulldorff on Twitter: The four oldest states are West Virginia (very red), Florida (pretty red), Maine (pretty blue) and Vermont (very blue). What are their COVID death rates (per 1M population) since Feb. 1, 2021 (i.e. post-vaccine?): West Virginia: 3454 Florida: 2992 Maine: 1881 Vermont: 1210 These states all have the ~same elderly population, and yet there are huge variations in COVID death rates that line up 1:1 with partisan differences in vaccine uptake. But OK, fine, let’s do this properly. Let’s run a regression analysis, which is a technique to decompose the effect of different variables. First, as a baseline, let’s run a simple, one-variable regression to back up my claim that state partisanship predicts COVID death rates. In this specification, covid_deaths_late is the number of COVID deaths per 1M residents (source) since Feb. 1, 2021 (I chose this date in Friday’s post since it approximates when COVID vaccines became widely available to vulnerable groups.) Meanwhile, biden is Joe Biden’s margin of victory or defeat against Donald Trump in 2020 (source). You can see that biden is very strongly and statistically significantly predictive of COVID death rates since 2/1/2021. The larger Biden’s margin of victory, the lower the COVID death rate. Note, again, that this wasn’t true in the early days of COVID; it’s only been true since the vaccines became available. OK, now let’s add age to the mix, measured by the share of the state population that is aged 65 or older (source). This variable is designated as senior in the analysis. Older states have had more COVID deaths since 2/1/2021 and the difference is statistically significant. However, this doesn’t affect the finding about state partisanship. In fact, state partisanship is just as predictive even once you control for age. As you can see, both the coefficient on biden and its statistical significance are essentially unchanged once you add age to the equation. The differences in state death rates are very likely because of differences in vaccine uptake Just to be clear, I don’t mean to imply that COVID is intrinsically more likely to target Republicans or anything like that. Rather, my claim is that COVID is considerably more deadly in people who haven’t been vaccinated, and since Republicans are less likely to be vaccinated than Democrats, state partisanship serves as a proxy for this. Indeed, we can look at vaccination directly. In our next build of the model, vax_rate will refer to the share of a state’s residents that are “fully vaccinated”4 (source). When you include vax_rate, it dominates biden. That is to say, vaccination rates themselves are considerably more predictive of COVID death rates than state partisanship as an approximation for them. Finally, just to clean things up, we can drop biden from the analysis; it has essentially no effect once you control for age and vaccination rates. Despite a fair amount of stochasticity in how COVID spreads — particular variants can take hold in different parts of the country in ways that seem difficult to predict — age and vaccination rates alone explain more than half of the variation in COVID death rates between states since Feb. 2021. Is this going to satisfy anyone? Hopefully it’s edifying to Silver Bulletin readers. As for Kulldorff and other Twitter critics, I have my doubts, I guess. There are always other things you can bring up. What about comorbidities — don’t those vary across states? (They do.) Are all states counting COVID deaths in the same way? (Probably not.) What about the first claim in Friday’s post — is it really so clear that NPIs had no effect in the pre-vaccine era? (I actually think this claim is less robust than the second, apparently more controversial one.) None of these are unreasonable questions. But the point of a robust claim is that it holds up to minor, medium-sized and often even fairly large objections. For instance, if states had a more standardized way of accounting for COVID deaths, it might mean that vaccination rates were even more statistically predictive of COVID death rates. Or it might not. But I wouldn’t expect it knock the claim into a different category, i.e. to take it from “clearly true” to “dubiously true” or “probably false”. Writers like Scott Alexander will sometimes go to very great lengths — literally tens of thousands of words — to parse particular statistical claims when Someone Is Wrong On The Internet. I greatly admire this, though I’m more cynical about the utility of it. I mostly don’t think that people are arguing to be truth-seeking in the first place — certainly not on Twitter, and certainly not about COVID. But I’m hoping to have a little bit more tolerance for back-and-forth argumentation here at Silver Bulletin.

Did we not wear them correctly, consistently?- schools: It seems obvious that schools could be a huge vector of transmission, kids largely were asymptomatic and when they got sick, they would still spread it, both inside the school and to their vulnerable relatives.

Even this September, like clockwork, COVID is ticking back up in the waste treatment tests. I&#x27;m still waiting for society to have a conversation about what role schools should fill and how we ensure schools operate the way that people think they should.

Ideally everyone would have worn N-95 masks but the US had four problems:1) The US didn’t have enough N-95 masks. In Asia where masks in public were more common people used masks from their home supply. I think some segments of the population were resentful that the US didn’t have access to the best masks and Asia did. 2) We had only a general idea of who was high risk. 3) We had only a general idea of the long term impacts of the virus. There was some initial concern that the virus could be like the Zitka virus where mortality rates dramatically increase with the second exposure. If that were the case the second waves could have killed off half the population with wide transmission. 4) Households aren’t homogeneous and it is near impossible to prevent transmission from a possibly asymptomatic child to a high risk adult when they share the same home.Unfortunately given the lack of consistent messaging about masks in the US one segment of the populations believed that the masks were to protect themselves and the other segment believed it was to protect others. Those that were low risk and believed it was to protect themselves resented the masks and those that saw the masks as a way to protect others resented those that resented the masks. I think those polarized views still persist today. reply Libcat99 4 minutes agorootparent5) A not insignificant part of the population heard and understood that masks protect others and said \"why should I suffer to protect them?\"I observed this sentiment in particular about return to school, and not just about masks. A sizable portion of the population would seemingly do anything to avoid accidentally helping someone else. reply ben_w 41 minutes agorootparentprev> For me, I still wear N-95s on planes and in crowded places, I understand their effectiveness and it fits my risk&#x2F;reward profile.Likewise, however I should also add that in my case there&#x27;s no risk component — not only because I get free FFP2 masks at my workplace, but also because it appears that one of the many ways that I&#x27;m unusual is that masks (and I mean this literally) cause me less issues than does my underwear.Even if I wear a mask for a 31 km walk, it&#x27;s the socks and underpants that pinch or restrict first, not the mask. reply nrr 4 hours agorootparentprevPaper masks (and, by some measure, even gaiters) are for source control, and they work just fine for that purpose if the literature is anything to go by. Every software project needs it, and our squishy bodies are decidedly not an exception. reply actuallyalys 6 hours agorootparentprevI am a little frustrated over an apparent lack of curiosity around mask effectiveness.* If you think they&#x27;re an effective measure for the public in general (which is probably closest to my position), then the variation in studies seems like it should still give you pause because it seems like the way mandates and messaging are implemented could undermine the usefulness. * If you think they&#x27;re effective in individual cases when people do it diligently, it still seems like you should be worried about the possibility that a lot of people who think they&#x27;re diligently and correctly masking aren&#x27;t, including some medical professionals who are regularly exposed to the disease. * Honestly, even if you don&#x27;t think they work at all, it still seems like learning why masks don&#x27;t work would expand our knowledge of the disease.Of course, we do know about plenty of factors that undermine mask effectiveness: people avoiding them altogether, people wearing ones that don&#x27;t fit, people not covering their nose, etc. And of course researchers can skew the results with their methodological choices. But there seems to be enough variability in these studies that unknown or underappreciated factors could be significant. reply dataangel 5 hours agorootparentwhat variability? AFAIK in controlled studies masks work (as in when you actually test things in a lab rather than looking at population statistics), are more effective when both people in the room are wearing them, we know the size of particle they filter and we know the viruses are bigger than that. there&#x27;s 0 doubt at this point they do what they are supposed to do. reply Izkata 5 hours agorootparent> we know the size of particle they filter and we know the viruses are bigger than that.If we&#x27;re talking cloth masks as most people are, the viruses are actually way smaller. reply sangnoir 4 hours agorootparentDo viruses float freely in the air, or are they mostly in aerosolized bodily fluids when from an infected persons coughs and sneezes?

Everybody seemed to be fighting for the extremes which gave us less optimal results. I didn&#x27;t see anybody suggesting masking kids indoors especially during deep winter, but then giving them extra time for outdoor play with no restrictions (distancing etc). The transmission outdoors might not be zero but it would be much less, so it would be a much reduced vector. That seems like a good tradeoff for their mental health. Or if not this exactly, something like this. Or what about class outdoors, or open windows and fans instead of masks. I don&#x27;t recall there even being a discussion like this; granted I&#x27;m not a parent.(caveat: This all assumes masks work and that kids are actually a big vector.

A lot of things like general depression, isolation, kids missing half a year of school, etc. can’t really be evaluated against people dying. And on its surface it seems obvious: uh, people dying is much worse than any of those things.But if I said that everything we did was to save one life, people probably would generally agree it wasn’t worth it (obviously so: people don’t seem too interested in preventing all kinds of deaths at all costs). What about ten lives? One thousand? Ten thousand? There’s some subjective level where it starts to feel obvious to more and more of us, until a majority of us agree.But do we have any general sense what that number is? How do we decide how much to care? It might seem ghoulish to decide how many dollars is worth a life, but we do it every day.With the data we have now, I imagine we can somewhat quantify this given enough sample jurisdictions with different rules? “Masking saves x lives per 1000.” “Closing schools saves y lives per 1000” etc. And perhaps then we’re able to decide “is x lives worth the qualitative harm done?” Probably. “What about y?” Maybe not. reply slv77 9 hours agoparentThe cost-benefit calculations in terms of excess deaths are irrelevant. It was clear even during the initial outbreak that policymakers primary constraints were the due to uncertainty about the virus and limits on availability of protective gear and ICU beds. Without protective gear there was no way to reduce transmission without isolation and once ICU beds are at capacity mortality rates double and people are dying in the streets and the medical system collapses.There is no scenarios where the collapse of the medical system is a viable outcome for policymakers that is also compatible with a functioning economy. A collapse of the medical system means non-covid fatalities also increase. Heart attacks, car accidents and childbirth all become mortality contributors. The most likely outcome of a medical system collapse would be martial law, mass graves, economic collapse and potential collapse of essential systems like food distribution.The idea that policymakers were primarily constrained by the thought of grandpa dying a few years early and weighing it against the grandkids social isolation needs to die. reply gpt5 9 hours agorootparentInitial constraints like ICU bed shortages and gear scarcity definitely had a basis.

Once oxygen saturation starts to drop the treatment options are oxygen and eventually intubation and a medically induced coma. There is no realistic scenario where untrained or semi-trained individuals are going to be able to provide that support and even if the staffing shortages could be worked around there wasn’t adequate equipment.The at home treatment option was to watch the patient drown in their own fluids. There are few people in that scenario that would have the emotional capacity to calmly give support to a close family member or friend when there was no ICU capacity. Their more realistic scenario would be people loading the patient into the car and driving to the nearest hospital. Some percentage of that population will likely turn violent. reply firesteelrain 7 hours agorootparentprevIt’s still not as clear cut as patient in and gets bed. There was some tweaking that had to be done to triage patients better then determine who most likely needed a bed.

Point is, hospitals share some of the blame too reply slv77 5 hours agorootparentDiscrete event simulations is used to get better utilization of a constrained resource. The fact that hospitals were using it just reinforces that ICU capacity was considered a serious constraint by policymakers. Discrete event simulation will give policy makers more confidence in capacity models but doesn’t improve patient outcomes or reduce treatment time.Hospital protocols also improved over time to reduce the need for respirators and the disease moderated but there was no magic protocol that really reduced disease progression or duration. Out of my social circle there were anti-vaxers that contracted covid late in the pandemic and spent weeks in the hospital (four total, two deaths) even with late stage protocols. reply firesteelrain 24 minutes agorootparentIt is not for constrained resources.

Indeed, we can look at vaccination directly. ... age and vaccination rates alone explain more than half of the variation in COVID death rates between states since Feb. 2021.However Silver didn&#x27;t mention age being strongly correlated (either way) with being vaccinated, which is interesting, given the rest of the article it&#x27;d be expected to be stated if it was. reply CamperBob2 3 hours agorootparentHe actually spent a lot of time working around the obvious: that COVID absolutely is intrinsically more likely to target Republicans. Not because of any merits or demerits associated with being a Republican, but because \"Republican\" is strongly correlated with \"old as hell\" in many if not most US states, as well as \"more likely to reject vaccines.\"Right-wing media figures consistently fed their audience a diet of vaccine skepticism, conspiracy theories, and promotion of useless alternative treatments; e.g., https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;07&#x2F;17&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;coronavirus-v... .

This may have been due a perceived difference between religious versus secular acceptance of death (a continuation versus end). My point isn’t that policymakers can’t make nuanced decisions about the value of a human life (since it is done on a regular basis) but instead that from a policymakers perspective it was irrelevant. The bigger concern was the collapse of the health care system which is a non-negotiable.The assumption that friends and family will calmly watch a family member’s untended death from covid when ICUs are over capacity and that essential workers will continue to show up for work knowing there is no hope for care if they fall ill is unrealistic in my opinion. reply ianai 6 hours agorootparentToure seriously doing yeoman&#x27;s work with these comments. replyGenerocUsername 7 hours agorootparentprevNot every doctor gets resigned to COVID.The whole medical system doesn&#x27;t just stop because COVID wards are full.Any competent system could have adjusted and isolated the overflow to its logical areas.Furthermore ACE2 inhibitors like ivermectin or the now patented Pfizer whatever you call it and other effective treatments were available the whole time and only blocked for bs political reasons ( likely by regulatory capture by big pharma ). reply slv77 5 hours agorootparentCONCLUSIONS Treatment with ivermectin did not result in a lower incidence of medical admission to a hospital due to progression of Covid-19 or of prolonged emergency department observation among outpatients with an early diagnosis of Covid-19.

Restrictions were largely political - driven extensively by polling - and changed frequently with minimal or nonexistent reasoning.Here in Ontario, the McKinsey-driven \"Science Table\" frequently referenced hospital capacity in their reports, but their modelling often ended up being off by orders of magnitude.While I concur that preventable deaths are unfortunate, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s evidence to suggest that most - all? - of the restrictions put in place had any noticeable impact on preventable deaths from Covid.If anything, those restrictions very much enabled other deaths - from mental health challenges, isolation, depression, substance abuse, delayed medical screening - that very much were preventable.While we don&#x27;t have a full picture yet, it&#x27;s telling that excess mortality remains heavily elevated even though most of the population has had Covid and been vaccinated. reply xyzzy_plugh 8 hours agorootparentHow odd.

(Lots of groupthink there…) So even though we didn’t get that written into the guidance, I’m sure there would have been a strong bias to being very conservative when attributing cause to anything other than COVID.Point is that I don’t think we even need to go as far as malicious intent to render the figures highly questionable.

As long as a large enough population wasn&#x27;t going along with the elimination strategy, it makes it less viable and more costly for everyone else. If the \"2 week lockdown and it all goes away\" had happened, then absolutely that would have been right. If all of, say, Europe doesn&#x27;t lock down and everywhere else does, then how long of a lockdown do you need in order to have it do anything, and at that length, what other major problems emerge?At least personally, the point I somewhat gave up on elimination was when the first variants started emerging from South Africa and Europe.

There is dna evidence that omicron evolved in mice and then jumped back into humans [0].On the idea of lockdowns to eliminate the virus:> The coronavirus’ ability to infect so many different animals, and to spread within some of those populations, is worrying news: It means there’s virtually no chance the world will ever be rid of this particularly destructive coronavirus, scientists said [1].It would be a bummer to be locked down for months or years in an effort to eliminate the virus, and have to deal with the negative repercussions of lockdowns during and afterwards, only for everyone to become reinfected again from animals, and the whole thing start up again.My apologies if I misunderstood your reply. You did seem to have a different angle than the original post. I just don&#x27;t get it when people mention lockdowns to eliminate covid, when such a thing isn&#x27;t possible.I&#x27;m not sure what to say about your concern that animals can evolve a more dangerous virus. That seems like it can go either way. Animal evolved variants can also be less dangerous, like omicron, which is a good thing. Also locked down humans could be more vulnerable to more dangerous variants, their immune systems not having any prior exposure.

We&#x27;d managed to stave off widespread Delta, but Omicron was far more transmissible, but also, far less lethal, and its arrival and spread came just after we started vaccinating.So by then the cost&#x2F;benefit analysis made it clear that reopening, while bringing more sickness, would ultimately cost less than not.The isolation caused some havoc in our economy that we&#x27;re still recovering from, but large amounts of excess deaths brings its own economic impacts that would likely have been far worse. reply dehrmann 12 hours agorootparentprevand China tried really, really hard to eliminate it over the next 3 years.

Deaths reported as being due to COVID are running at 2.7%.Annualizing and turning the data back to excess deaths, that means of the ~200K people that \"COVID is on track to kill\", only about 53.4K total excess deaths are expected, projecting from Jan-Jul, or projecting mid-Jan-Jul, excess would be only 31.5K.Perhaps COVID is saving 146K-169K lives and then killing 200K this year?* This is to avoid the recent data incompleteness. If I include more recent data records, my argument becomes stronger, not weaker. Setting aside the first two weeks in January, the average drops to 1.0% excess deaths overall. reply sieste 12 hours agorootparentThe death from&#x2F;with covid distinction is only relevant here if there is a systematic difference in over&#x2F;under reporting of covid deaths between red and blue states.

Modern society has - especially since the introduction of antibiotics - largely done away with those traditional doom scenarios. We&#x27;re no longer starving, no longer dying in droves from infectious diseases, no longer totally at the mercy of nature... but our alarm mechanisms are still in place although they are differently tuned in different people. In some people - you seem to be one of those - these mechanisms are so finely tuned that they pick up minute signals which are amplified until they trigger the &#x27;impending catastrophic situation&#x27; alarm (we&#x27;re so, so fucked) where those same signals do not even register for others. The same is true for other triggers like &#x27;climate change&#x27;, &#x27;migration&#x27;, &#x27;systemic ...-ism&#x27; and others where some people are completely taken over by their alarms going off where others don&#x27;t even hear a single bell. Many of these triggers - &#x27;systemic ...-ism&#x27; and to a lesser extent &#x27;migration&#x27; being prime examples - are intentionally amplified because those who do the amplification stand to gain power (and money) by doing so, others - &#x27;climate change&#x27; - are being used by third parties for monetary gain (&#x27;greenwashing&#x27; and the multitude of &#x27;green&#x27; scams like &#x27;carbon offsets&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;carbon credits&#x27;) or political power.Are we &#x27;fucked&#x27;? That depends on who you ask. Ask me and I&#x27;ll say \"only if we want to be\". Is SARS-2 going to be with us for the foreseeable future? Yes, most likely. Is that a big problem? No, not really since it has rapidly mutated to become &#x27;yet another Corona-related upper airway infection&#x27; while our species has developed a form of natural immunity which has taken the edge off the disease. Upper airway diseases are annoying and lead to a loss in productivity, sure, but they tend not to mail or kill. What remains is the long tail of the initial pandemic and even more of the (over)reaction to it, especially in those countries which had strict lockdown regimes. Recovering from the damage caused by those measures will take a lot of time and money and it can only be hoped that a lesson will be learned from this experience.As to returning to &#x27;normality&#x27; I can safely state that we have done so quite a while ago here in Sweden [1].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelocal.se&#x2F;20230310&#x2F;fact-check-did-sweden-have-... reply cm2012 12 hours agoparentprevGood news then that long covid is probably not a real issue reply anyonecancode 6 hours agoprevI think for the pre-vaccine period, there&#x27;s at least a couple issues that are still very unclear:- how well did official policies map to actual behavior? I expect a lot of people still masked and distanced, regardless of what their particular state&#x27;s policies were- what specific behaviors actually made a difference? (Well, maybe it&#x27;s really just a question of how much difference masking made -- I&#x27;d expect it&#x27;s pretty clear that avoiding other people was pretty effective)So for me, a more interesting and, I&#x27;d argue, practical question, is really about how effective _policy_ is. There were definitely a lot of costs, as it helped politicize things (who would have guess masks would become a partisan issue?).I think of the case of Sweden, for example, where IIUC behavior was pretty cautious although policy was pretty loose. reply todd8 11 hours agoprevHere are a few observations.From the CDC [1], 2020 total covid deaths by state: West Virginia 1318, Florida 21546, Maine 344, Vermont 134.The corresponding April 2020 census populations [2] for these four states are: West Virginia 1793716, Florida 21538187, Maine 1362359, Vermont 643077.Thus, before the vaccines for covid were available the deaths per 100,000 persons for these four states are: West Virginia 73, Florida 100, Vermont 21, Maine 25.Someone should probably check my math, but it looks like voting for Trump causes over three times as many deaths even before vaccinations were available. In other words, the analysis in the original article may be affected by unaccounted for confounding factors. For example, COPD is a significant medical risk factor for serious covid complications according to the CDC. COPD affects over 13.6% of the population of West Virginia (the worst rate in the country) but affects only 5.9% of the population of Vermont [3].Personally, I chose to get vaccinated and boosted at the earliest possible dates. I also caught covid during the initial big wave of omicron cases in my state.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stacks.cdc.gov&#x2F;view&#x2F;cdc&#x2F;99750[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_U.S._states_and_territ...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lung.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;trends-in-lung-disease&#x2F;copd-tr... reply vharuck 7 hours agoparentI&#x27;d say the pre-vax differences likely came from how people treated public health advice and precautions. If somebody believed it was no worse than the flu or even didn&#x27;t exist (like some of my in-laws in Summer 2020), they would be far more likely to catch it, spread it, and receive poor treatment.Those differences in behavior would carry over to vaccination rates, since that&#x27;s also responding to public health recommendations. It&#x27;s hard to believe Silver didn&#x27;t do the analysis on pre-vax death rates, but he didn&#x27;t mention it so I don&#x27;t know.If COPD and similar conditions were the major difference, I would expect the difference in death rates to be closer to 2.3x (13.6%&#x2F;5.9%) than 2.9x (73&#x2F;25 per 100k). Those are very different ratios. And I don&#x27;t know about any other complicating conditions with larger relative rates than 2.3x for those two states. Obesity is only 1.3x higher in West Virginia. So this gets back to Silver&#x27;s point: you can almost always find other contributors, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily prove something else didn&#x27;t contribute. You have to do that analysis all together. But complicating health conditions don&#x27;t seem to be able to account for the differences, even before a regression test. reply mcguire 11 hours agoprevOk, so now I want to see the details of his first claim, \"Until vaccines became available, there was little difference in COVID death rates between blue states and red states.\" reply flashback2199 12 hours agoprevA regression analysis without one single graph rolls eyes reply Izkata 11 hours agoparentFor the downvoters, we even have a name for this: Anscombe&#x27;s quartet.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anscombe%27s_quartetAlways visualize your data. reply biorach 10 hours agorootparentThe downvotes were due to the complete lack of context in the vaguely derogatory post. reply flashback2199 10 hours agorootparentPlots are such a basic expectation for stats that I don&#x27;t see why I should be required to write more about it.. reply biorach 10 hours agorootparentjust give some context dammit replytommykins 9 hours agoprevI will never understand the use of Stata to achieve anything. reply pottertheotter 5 hours agoparentWhat does this mean?

    "originBody": "SIGN IN / UP PERSONAL TECH Mozilla's midlife crisis has taken it from web pioneer to Google's weird neighbor 85 Can the sleeping fox ever wake up? Liam Proven Fri 29 Sep 2023 // 09:59 UTC COMMENT Mozilla seems to be asleep at the wheel, when it once drove online activity and communications. We have some suggestions where it could go. Mozilla is the wealthy [PDF] independent organization behind the only all-FOSS browser engine that's independent of commercial vendors. It also does important security research – its recent report on the abysmal privacy of in-car software is a good example. Firefox remains a powerful, capable, fast, and resource-efficient browser. For instance, it doesn't just render PDFs in-browser, without plugins or helpers, it lets you amend or annotate them too. The latest Firefox 118 has privacy-centric, local, in-browser language translation. Some of its shorcuts and navigational features will probably surprise you. Mozilla's programming languages (yes, plural) Mozilla also invented not one but two of the hottest programming languages around. This century, it invented the Rust programming language, as we reported back in 2011. In recent years that seems to be eating into every major OS… but six months into the pandemic, Mozilla laid off the entire team, killing its next-gen rendering engine, Servo. (Much of Mozilla's revenue comes from Google, of course. This couldn't be because Rust was, and is, outshining Google's GoLang? Surely not?) Back in 1995, before even The Register, Mozilla's commercial forerunner Netscape invented JavaScript, which it introduced with Netscape 2.0; as this fossilized announcement notes, \"of possible interest to developers.\" Yeah, just a tad. Mozilla's messaging client Mozilla also backs the development of the leading cross-platform messaging client, Thunderbird. This was sadly neglected for years, but even so, its developers kept working on it. A few highlights: 2015: Thunderbird 38 gets integrated calendar handling, derived from the Lightning addon. 2017: Thunderbird 51 gained chat support over IRC and XMPP (alongside XMPP-based services such as Google Talk), derived from Instantbird. 2020: Thunderbird 78 gets integrated PGP email encryption support, replacing the EnigMail add-on. 2022: Thunderbird 102 gets Matrix chat support (even if that protocol remains controversial in some quarters). 2023: Thunderbird 115 gets a revamped UI, formerly codenamed Supernova. And, at some point soon, an Android version is coming. Mozilla's mobile OS Mozilla also had a mobile OS, which a decade ago we called the third-place contender and which it officially killed off in 2016. Boot2Gecko, marketed as FirefoxOS, was rebooted under the name KaiOS. It won some Google investment in 2018 and we even reviewed a KaiOS phone in 2020. KaiOS is still around, and still in third place, which in such a huge market isn't a bad place to be; it implies substantial growth. Its owner claims 160 million devices, which is no minor rounding error. The Finnish Fund For Industrial Cooperation recently bunged KaiosTech a few million to help them expand into the new growth market of sub-Saharan Africa. The code on GitHub still has Mozilla trademarks all over it. Why isn't this a famous FOSS project to rival, or merge with, postmarketOS? Why doesn't Mozilla talk about it, or better still, reclaim it? Mozilla's… web editor and music player It also formerly had some other gems. The original \"Mozilla\" was an all-in-one suite of internet tools, derived from Netscape Communicator: a browser, plus an messaging client – then meaning email plus USENET – plus calendar, address book, workflow it acquired with Collabra, and an HTML editor. A combined suite is still around, in the guise of the Seamonkey Project. Although HTML is everywhere, you don't hear much about HTML editors any more – largely because the static stuff has been rendered almost obsolete by dynamically generated web content, much of it generated by code in Mozilla languages, of course. Even decades after Mozilla dropped it, the leading FOSS HTML editor remains Mozilla code; it's just about hanging on in the form of BlueGriffon. To be honest, we're not sure that it really needed its own music player, but Songbird was a thing for a while. With many companies, including the BBC, making it harder to stream without their own clients, there might be an opening there. Mozilla's server software LDAP is not trendy and never really has been, but it's still useful. Red Hat sells an LDAP server as the Red Hat Directory Server. The code originated as the Netscape Directory Server, and the community-supported FOSS version is now called the 389 Directory Server, after the TCP port that LDAP uses . Ubuntu and Fedora clash in beta race, but who wears GNOME better? Linux interop is maturing fast… thanks to a games console Rusty revenant Servo returns to render once more Long-term support for Linux kernels is about to get a lot shorter Oracle is still just about supporting the old Netscape Enterprise Server too. An impressive history Netscape was the original open source web browser. We've been covering it from the start; in 1998, owner AOL promised to open source it – before Google was even founded (25 years ago on Monday, as it happens). Four years later, the open source version shipped. Twenty years ago, The Reg covered its rebirth as Phoenix (and when it became Firefox the next year). So how, and why, has this vastly innovative, pioneering company become a straggler among followers? It's let many of its jewels go. Some canceled, some sold off, some given away. Many have found new homes, from Rust's foundation to the Servo engine. And yet it still has some powerful, valuable tech. Whither the bird? Browsers are hard, really hard. The days when the web was just HTML are long gone. There are very few web pages any more; instead, they are programs, and worse still, they're client-server programs, with one end running on the device in front of you, talking to a different program running somewhere else. Much of the modern computing world runs over this stuff. Ostensibly local applications, from Slack to Teams, are just JavaScript applets running inside their own private single-site browser – and those all use Google's browser engine. Web engines and web apps are a core part of the digital world – arguably, the core part. As, of course, is open source: most web servers run on Linux, and on the client end, over 70 per cent of smartphones run Android, which is also Linux underneath. Just as over 70 percent of smartphones run Linux, over 70 per cent of browsers are based on Google's code. At the time of writing, some 64 per cent is Chrome, plus 5.4 per cent Edge. Opera and the Samsung browser make up about another 5 per cent. As they all run on the same engine, Chromium – as does Vivaldi and Brave – that's perilously close to three quarters. Safari, whose rendering engine WebKit is the origin of Chromium's Blink engine, is a little under 20 per cent, making it by far the leading non-Chromium browser – but almost exclusively on Apple OSes. GNOME Web, codenamed Epiphany, is as far as we know the only WebKit browser on Linux (and, it should be noted, on Haiku as well). The Windows port of WebKit is still maintained — for instance, iTunes uses it – but the Windows version of Safari was discontinued back in 2012. So how come the original open source web browser is now, Statcounter estimates, under 3 percent? Mozilla, it seems to us, has missed a lot of opportunities, and continues to do so. There is still a niche for power user browsers, and for powerful integration tools to bring together disparate comms channels that force users into web apps and Electron clients. Despite the sales of ChromeBooks and the free ChromeOS Flex, despite the Steam Deck and Steam OS, Linux still isn't a mainstream end-user OS. If you run Linux, you're probably a power user. Firefox is the dominant Linux browser. By default, it's the only standalone app in next month's Ubuntu Mantic Minotaur. Mozilla, please stop aping Chrome. Copying is rarely the way to win big. The Australis Chrome-like theme in Firefox 29 annoyed users and was a driving force behind Pale Moon. Firefox Quantum killed XUL addons, and drove The Reg FOSS desk to Waterfox Classic. Others went to Basilisk instead, while XP users have MyPal. Even Microsoft's Chrome-based Edge has vertical tabs. Firefox doesn't, and to make them well, you must mess around with config files, although we still feel it's worth it. The Vivaldi browser shows that there is still plenty of room to outdo Chrome on features, and a market of people who want for them. Can we please have a Firefox that leans into being the browser for power users? Bundle some of the more powerful extensions that survived your self-inflicted extension extinction event. Vertical or tree-structured tabs, on any edge. Menu bars and hotkeys. Multithreaded downloads, even integrated BitTorrent support. Perhaps experiment with this stuff in the Firefox developer edition. Bring back the customizability it once had, which you've been steadily removing for years. Thunderbird is also a powerful asset. Although it too is sadly neglected, Pidgin is still around and still works, and libPurple remains uniquely powerful. There are plugins that get it talking to Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, RocketChat, Signal, Mattermost, you name it. Adopt it, update it, add it to Chat Core. Thunderbird could be the universal client that talks to dozens of services in one place. There is room here for significant improvement over the existing multiprotocol messaging clients we've described before. Leave Chrome and its offspring to the technophobic, and make some cross-platform tools for the keyboard merchants who know how to email like a pro. ® Sponsored: Driving down the cost of Office applications More about Firefox Mozilla Foundation Open Source More like these 85 COMMENTS TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like Rusty revenant Servo returns to render once more OPEN SOURCE SUMMIT Mozilla gave it the boot, but the Linux Foundation Europe gave it the kiss of life instead SOFTWARE 5 days10 Long-term support for Linux kernels is about to get a lot shorter OPEN SOURCE SUMMIT Despite the OS's success, maintainers are short-staffed and under-appreciated OSES 6 days45 GNU turns 40: Stallman's baby still not ready for prime time, but hey, there's cake It turned the software industry upside down regardless APPLICATIONS 12 days85 If a college graduate can’t protect your data, you’re in trouble To achieve resiliency and efficiency, aim for simplicity SPONSORED FEATURE Terraform fork OpenTF renamed and relocated as OpenTofu Open wide!

That wall is collapsing and with it anything that keeps Safari in the game. reply pjmlp 31 minutes agorootparentBy then anyone doing web development can rename their CVs entries from Web Developer into ChromeOS Developer. reply philistine 18 hours agorootparentprevThe reality is different from what Google says to the regulators. That’s the Weekend at Bernie’s stuff that is happening. reply jqpabc123 22 hours agoparentprevSorry, this was the common excuse for years. It just doesn&#x27;t fly any more now that FireFox market share has shrunk to irrelevance.By every available statistic, Chrome has more than 80 percent of the \"free market\" --- i.e. the market outside of Apple&#x27;s walled garden where it has only recently become a realistic option. reply jacquesm 22 hours agorootparentNo, it works just fine like that. The ideal outcome is for FireFox to continue to exist with a very small marketshare. That&#x27;s enough for the FigLeaf function and not enough for Google to worry about killing it off any further. And contrary to the other time when a monopolist kept their competition alive I don&#x27;t think this one is going to end with FireFox reversing its fate and ending up with market dominance after a surprise success. reply eastbound 21 hours agorootparentIt only exists because people with an ideal keep trying to stay as users. Ideals die hard, so the long trail will be long, but Firefox is effectively as niche as Linux on the desktop. reply jacquesm 20 hours agorootparentFortunately for me I have both FF and Linux on the desktop. Now that they&#x27;ve finally fixed web midi even that reason to have Chrome has gone away. reply jqpabc123 19 hours agorootparentI suspect that most remaining FF users are running it on Linux desktop. reply pseudalopex 11 hours agorootparentMost Firefox requests to Wikimedia sites say Windows.[1][1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;analytics.wikimedia.org&#x2F;dashboards&#x2F;browsers&#x2F;#all-sit... reply KronisLV 11 hours agorootparentprev> I suspect that most remaining FF users are running it on Linux desktop.Personally, I run it everywhere: on my phone, on my Windows desktop, on my Linux desktop, on my Linux netbook. Not even because of any particularly strongly held stances - it&#x27;s just a nice browser that I like and it runs pretty well everywhere (plus the devtools are the most usable for me).That said, I&#x27;m fairly sure that the majority of Linux desktop users are also using Firefox, because it&#x27;s typically the default browser in most distros. replyp-e-w 22 hours agoparentprevSafari&#x27;s market share dwarfs that of Firefox, and has for a long time. If there is indeed such a \"fig leaf\", it&#x27;s Apple, not Mozilla. reply cmcaleer 21 hours agorootparentIn terms of desktop market share it&#x27;s about equal.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;analytics.wikimedia.org&#x2F;dashboards&#x2F;browsers&#x2F;#desktop... reply Devasta 21 hours agorootparentprevDoes Safari work on Windows or Android? Safaris market share is because other browser engines are restricted. The second Chrome becomes available on iOS Google search, maps, YouTube, everything will have \"Works best in Chrome\" plastered everywhere. reply pjmlp 14 hours agorootparentJust as info for the young folks, Safari had a Windows version until 2012. reply 5- 22 hours agorootparentprevmost of that market share will go away the moment google is allowed to push chrome on ios. reply nfriedly 21 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know, defaults are pretty powerful.There&#x27;s already a Chrome-branded Safari wrapper on iOS; but my guess is that the majority of iOS users use \"regular\" Safari and will continue to because it&#x27;s the default. reply havnagiggle 18 hours agorootparentDefaults can be powerful, but we have the numbers. Edge is the default Windows desktop browser and has 8-10% of the market. Apparently defaults are not more powerful than shipping a shitty product. reply mrkramer 18 hours agorootparentBut the defaults on the PC and on the mobile are not the same. I can recall that Samsung Android phones shipped with preinstalled Samsung browser and actually a lot of people used Samsung&#x27;s browser because they just wanted working internet browser.Tbh I can&#x27;t recall if at the time Google Chrome was also preinstalled or just \"Google\" app. But I can say that it wasn&#x27;t very clear which browser is the default one in which situation. For example when you open a link inside some third party app sometimes it would hook Samsung browser and sometimes Google Chrome. Sometimes Android pop-up would ask me, use Samsung browser&#x2F;Google Chrome \"Just once\" or \"Always\" and if you pick \"Always\", how do you change it afterwards? Easy solution would be if you prefer one browser over another just uninstall the one you don&#x27;t like but if it was preinstalled or whatever, it kept coming back. reply doublepg23 18 hours agorootparentprevEh, in 2023 it feels like most peoples experience with Windows is less “Personal” Computer and more “Appliance work sent me”. I’m pretty sure a lot of that is set by IT. reply TerrifiedMouse 21 hours agorootparentprevWho’s to say the EU won’t force Apple to have a “browser selection screen” on first start up where people will pick Chrome because that’s what they use on desktop.Safari is unfortunately the last bulwark against a Chrome monoculture where Google will decide the future of the web - which they will of course design to assist and enhance their ad selling. reply cma 19 hours agorootparentGoogle won&#x27;t let you turn off internet permissions on sketchy apps, why does the flashlight app need internet? They know it is needed for ads. Turn off location on android and it warns you won&#x27;t be able to find your phone. Why can&#x27;t you quick toggle it off but leave on selectively for find your phone? Ads need it. reply scriptingforfun 6 hours agorootparentI have location off on my Pixel and I block ads with a Pi-hole. I can still find my phone if I log into Chrome on my Linux laptop. You can also do recursive DNS with Unbound and have the phone pointing to your Pi. You can do this with a Pi at home or set up via a droplet on Digital Ocean. You can set it up on DO so you don&#x27;t have an open DNS resolver hanging out in the cloud. reply dylan604 19 hours agorootparentprevWhen every site you visit in safari says best viewed in chrome, people will switch to chrome just to not see that message reply bratwurst3000 21 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think they will. Safari doesn’t have good plugins. That’s a big point. Using plugins. reply oktoberpaard 21 hours agorootparentFor as far as I know, Chrome on Android has no support for plugins at all, whereas Safari on iOS does support plugins, including adblockers. I don’t see why Chromium would support plugins on iOS, since they obviously benefit from the fact that you can’t block ads. reply tortoise_in 12 hours agorootparentYou should try kiwi reply nfriedly 21 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m mostly a Firefox on Android user, does Chrome on Android have plugins now? I know it didn&#x27;t for a while. reply danarmak 21 hours agorootparentI assume you mean extensions, not plugins. No, Chrome doesn&#x27;t support extensions on android, but some Chromium reskins do.That said, the most important extension usecase is adblocking, and with Manifest v4 and FLoC&#x2F;Topics and SafetyNet&#x2F;remote attestation, well... reply bad_user 21 hours agorootparentChrome&#x27;s adblocking capabilities, introduced in Manifest v3, are (1) inspired by Safari and (2) more capable than what Safari provides.You can track this uBlock Origin Lite issue: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;uBlockOrigin&#x2F;uBOL-home&#x2F;issues&#x2F;52 reply Turing_Machine 21 hours agorootparentprevThe typical browser user doesn&#x27;t even know what plugins&#x2F;extensions are, much less use any. reply mrkramer 20 hours agorootparentNot quite true, around 800 million people use adblockers[0].[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;3201&#x2F;ad-blocking&#x2F; reply scriptingforfun 5 hours agorootparentAnd growing. People are waking up. I&#x27;ve been a Pi-hole user for 7 years now. I will never not use something like it. Works on phones, laptops, TVs, everything. Since Pi-hole won&#x27;t block ads on YouTube, I use uBlock Origin for this on my laptop, PopTube on phone, and for my TV, disabled the NIC, put my Firestick in developer mode, downloaded SmartTubeNext and have not seen an ad on any platform I control in years. I cannot fathom how people deal with ads. SmartTubeNext also blocks sponsors, which are just as bad. The second some YTer starts to shill, that&#x27;s the second I bail from their channel.

It doesn’t make much sense today, Firefox loads sites developed for Chrome just fine. There is no ActiveX like “embrace and extend” coming from the Google camp quite yet. reply paulryanrogers 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d argue the rapid pace of new Chrome-only APIs is effectively EEE. Web developers can&#x27;t wait to use new features, so once features land in Chrome they&#x27;ll get used.Then folks not using Chrome find more friction until they eventually give up and switch. reply postalrat 13 hours agorootparentCan you think of any real life examples of websites that use Chrome only apis and don&#x27;t work in Firefox? reply xctr94 12 hours agorootparentI don’t have a list of examples, but this is historically a problem for the web.I’ve sat in a couple of Ecmascript events where maintainers complain about Google implementing features before approval. Sometimes Chrome ships stage 2 features because (apparently) Google engineers don’t want to respect due process.It’s known, we just put up with it. I also blame developers working on non-standardized features. You should work with the ES that is official and current, not the one Google is forcing on other vendors.Apologies for not listing all the times this happened, but I think too many. reply iudqnolq 12 hours agorootparentprevYes, but generally for completely legitimate reasons.One example is a tool for flashing code to a embedded device. It&#x27;s aimed at beginners, so not requiring an install is valuable. It means even kids with locked down Chromebooks can try it out.But the Firefox teams doesn&#x27;t like the vibes of a web USB API, so it&#x27;ll be cheome-only indefinitely. reply Devasta 12 hours agorootparentprevMBNA Canada announced last year they werent going to support Firefox.DTCC apps such as Omgeo support Chrome and Edge only. reply klibertp 16 hours agorootparentprevBecause a page looking off for a subset of people is worse for the brand then the page not working for them at all. On the other hand, making the page work for everyone (including lynx users?) is simply uneconomical - and when the business tries to optimize for it, you get Java Applets and Flash. reply SergeAx 14 hours agorootparentI am an engineering manager in charge of 4 web products. The only problem we have with Firefox is audio&#x2F;video access on mobile. There are zero problems with the desktop Firefox. There are some problems with the desktop Safari that QA are reporting here and there. reply cmcaleer 21 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s not true, Mozilla also exist to pay Mitchell Baker and her cronies fat salaries.In 2020, she got paid $3MM.In 2021, after an incredible year which saw Firefox&#x27;s market share fall even further, she of course got a raise to $5MM for her brave decision to lay off 250 people in Aug 2020.I hope she gets a massive bonus for 2023, given that her leadership has allowed Microsoft Edge to flip Firefox most days according to the stats, and she still has a quarter to let Safari consistently flip Firefox too!It is obscene. She wants to be paid according to what she alleges her market value is, but she does not have the accountability of a publicly traded company&#x27;s CEO.Firefox needs a radical culture change and it needs to happen 8 years ago. I have no hope it will happen, as it exists to siphon money from suckers who pay donations that barely pay Mitchell&#x27;s salary (total annual donations barely cover this expense![1]) and the board does not give a shit about what Firefox&#x27;s core audience cares about.The grift will continue until Mitchell and co decide enough is enough and flee the sinking ship. Whoever inherits it and the massively bloated outgoing expenses will probably be fucked, regardless of who they are or how good their intentions are. Firefox is massively behind, web devs are not incentivised to accommodate for the single-digit percent of Firefox users, and things are only going to continue to get worse.[1] Yes Mitchell is paid by the corporation as opposed to the non-profit and donations go to the non-profit, but ultimately money that could have gone to the non-profit went to Mitchell&#x27;s bank accountStats from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;analytics.wikimedia.org&#x2F;dashboards&#x2F;browsers&#x2F;#desktop... reply insanitybit 20 hours agorootparentMozilla is a case study in how damaging a CEO can be.

Compensation is a function of power, not merit.Merit is a secondary, indirect factor that _can_ have an effect on power, but it&#x27;s not a necessary condition.Power often comes from social currency, negotiation, manipulation, wealth and ownership.2. Power and responsibility are at best loosely correlated.Often those in power try excuse their obscene privileges by pointing to responsibility. According to this idea, their decisions are force multipliers and they carry a huge risk.But reality shows time and time again, that this isn&#x27;t true outside of the most extreme cases. They accumulate power and wealth to an irresponsible degree and make irresponsible decisions all the time without being held accountable. In fact, many get _rewarded_ instead.---I want a Mozilla that is the steward of the fastest, most advanced, secure and user respecting browser. I want the best in class dev tools.I would gladly pay good money for that and I 100% bet that there would be enough people who would too. reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentWhat I don&#x27;t understand is why someone doesn&#x27;t just, essentially, fork the browser and take over for them. You&#x27;d either need someone with enough name recognition that the people tired of Mozilla&#x27;s incompetence would switch to their fork (and thereby give them the search revenue), or a donation from someone to get them off the ground, but nobody even wants to make the attempt? reply paulryanrogers 14 hours agorootparentThere are several Firefox forks of some note: LibreWolf, Palemoon, etc. I think you&#x27;ll find that maintaining a huge, legacy codebase that supports a rapidly expanding API is significantly more costly than a single engineer&#x27;s salary. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentThe point is to ultimately take over the entire thing.Find some existing pain point that people don&#x27;t like about Firefox, fix it, make sure people know the better version is available. People switch to it, you get more search revenue and donations, you hire more developers. It&#x27;s the same way Mozilla operates, but this time you hire competent management so your market share goes up instead of down. reply paulryanrogers 11 hours agorootparentBrowsers are a pretty crowded market and they seem to have reached a certain equilibrium of normie-facing features. Unlikely you&#x27;ll gain traction among regular users who are bagged to use their OS or search vendor&#x27;s own. Perhaps one could gain Mozilla users, though hard to compete against millions of dollars of development (regardless of whether CEO is taking a chunk or not). reply AnthonyMouse 10 hours agorootparent> Browsers are a pretty crowded market and they seem to have reached a certain equilibrium of normie-facing features.I feel like you could have said the same thing about IE 4.0. It&#x27;s more like, the incumbents don&#x27;t care outside of what they need for their own purposes and Mozilla is the one supposed to be doing it but they&#x27;re not.Except for the crowded market, but that&#x27;s not even true now. We&#x27;ve got Firefox and the KHTML lineage and that&#x27;s about it.> Unlikely you&#x27;ll gain traction among regular users who are bagged to use their OS or search vendor&#x27;s own.Chrome has 64% market share on desktop despite the proprietors of Edge and Safari having a combined ~90% desktop market share. Firefox itself had 32% market share in 2010. You can get people to switch from the default if they have a reason.> Perhaps one could gain Mozilla users, though hard to compete against millions of dollars of development (regardless of whether CEO is taking a chunk or not).The problem is more than the CEO taking too much. They&#x27;re not actually spending most of the money on making Firefox better.They should also be spending more of it on marketing, because their funding is directly tied to how many users they have, which keeps going down. reply sangnoir 12 hours agorootparentprev> What I don&#x27;t understand is why someone doesn&#x27;t just, essentially, fork the browser and take over for them1) it costs money, so those doing ot for philosophical reasons may find it daunting2) Those who&#x27;d do it to make money (less ideologically aligned with Mozilla) would rather fork Chromium instead as it has momentum reply walteweiss 21 hours agorootparentprevI have been liking Mozilla for a very long time, and even has thoughts of applying to work there. Now I read about that woman and I’m not so sure any longer. Now I see it all as some kind of politics, when you say so beautiful and shiny words, but in truth your actions are the opposite to all that. reply cmcaleer 21 hours agorootparentMan, I want to be able to work for the Mozilla of yore too. But it simply just isn&#x27;t what it was, and over the years its true purpose has become more and more clear.After their alarming treatment of security researchers documented here [0], I&#x27;ve been doubting whether to continue using Firefox at all. For what it&#x27;s worth I still do, because I think not using Chrome is a fight worth fighting and that alarming behaviour was just from the VPN team, but if any similar behaviour happens with the Firefox team I&#x27;m just going to drop it altogether.I want Mozilla and Firefox to succeed. I want diversity in browser engines. I want to see the culture change happen. It still can!

If he has an axe to grind (and he clearly does if you&#x27;re familiar with his comments about Mozilla going back like 5+ years), his journalistic integrity takes a nosedive. Remember when he claimed that Mozilla funded terrorists because they donated to a privacy focused email service, and some antifa group he disliked used that email service?

In this regard, C# is much closer to C++ and Rust with GC attached on top and certain opinionated choices rather than being a high level language completely abstracted away via VM. reply oaiey 16 hours agorootparentIndeed true. One of the unique and underrated strengths of C#. But \"System Programming\" is not exactly operating system or fundamental service writing but much more often your stock ticker broker or WhatsApp backend. The terminology is very misleading IMHO. reply arp242 18 hours agorootparentprev\"Systems programming\" is an ill-defined term and different people seem to mean different things with it. I think the thing you&#x27;re getting at is that Go has a GC and Rust doesn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s indeed a meaningful difference with lots of implications, both good and bad for both, which doesn&#x27;t mean that Go is unsuitable for all systems programming.Running programs with Java and C# (OpenJDK and Mono at least) is nothing like running a Go (or Rust) programs. You can&#x27;t distinguish between a Go or Rust binary at a glance, but you can spot a Java or C# program easily.In many ways Go is significantly more similar to C than Rust is, and in other ways Rust is more similar. reply oaiey 17 hours agorootparentI agree that the word \"System Programming\" is really bad.C# and Java modern ahead of time compilation, tree shaking and linking should make it similar to Go at that sense (as in single file, no runtime, etc).

Not motivated by the servers but by apps and cloud startup times I guess. reply arp242 12 hours agorootparentRight, I don&#x27;t really keep up with the latest changes – generally running Java&#x2F;C# has been a bit of a hassle, similar to Python or Ruby. e.g. I had to manually download .NET things from the Microsoft website, and keep my DOTNETHOME directory around as a runtime dependency, etc. Nothing like \"just download this binary and that&#x27;s all you need\".Related from a few days ago: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37701769 reply neonsunset 11 hours agorootparentThis shouldn&#x27;t be the case for .NET. You only have to download the tooling to build it (which can usually be done through package manager of your choice).To run the built binaries, whether to require the runtime (by not including it in the executable) or not is a choice.Tl;Dr of MSFT docs is: JIT (w&#x2F; Runtime): dotnet publish -c release -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=true JIT (w&#x2F;o Runtime): dotnet publish -c release -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained false AOT: dotnet publish -c release -p:PublishAot=trueThese can be configured via .csproj properties too, there are multiple ways to set those depending on your needs. If you don&#x27;t have any specific dynamically linked native dependencies included with your project, all of the options will be a single executable that you can just run. Do note that to use AOT on macOS you will need .NET 8 (right now it&#x27;s RC1&#x2F;preview).In general, dotnet CLI commands are similar cargo (it had some of the features earlier, some later): dotnet new, build, add, publish, etc. replybryancoxwell 21 hours agoparentprevThere’s a lot going on in the quoted text that immediately signaled to me the rest of the article wouldn’t be worth reading. reply lproven 32 minutes agorootparentI wrote the article.It will not surprise you that I think you&#x27;re dead wrong.Notably you have failed to register that what I am doing in that paragraph is attempting (possibly badly) to rebut this surprisingly widespread allegation. reply klabb3 21 hours agoparentprevNot to mention there’s no business competition between free languages.

Or maybe Chrome was just wayyy faster back when it launched?I stayed on Firefox for years so that I could use Pentadactyl[1], an extension that made the Firefox UI minimal and vim-like.

Kinda remembering now how they pushed the tabs up into the window chrome next to the close&#x2F;minimize buttons which let them really shrink down the size of the top bar back when browsers typically spent a ton of vertical space on ~stuff. I bet having a single bar instead of separate URL &#x2F; search bars was nifty too.I guess Chrome&#x27;s launch is also from a different era where sentiment around Google was much closer to uniformly positive which I&#x27;m sure helped. reply pxoe 15 hours agorootparentyep, having just two bars - tabs + window buttons, and omnibox + browser buttons (which were also condensed just to &#x27;page&#x27; and &#x27;settings&#x27;), was kinda huge.at that time, (when browsers like firefox 3 and ie8 were around), browsers were still having bars on top of bars on top of bars: window bar, on top of a file menu, on top of address bar (with a split search bar), and they&#x27;d throw in a bookmarks bar in too by default (which chrome had turned off by default), and that&#x27;s beside toolbars which were still a thing (and were not a thing at all in chrome). all that would come up at a total of 3 to 5 bars, which was a lot.particularly the combining of window title bar and tabs bar into one (along with putting tabs up top, and forgoing window title and file menu along the way), was a big thing. which seems to have influenced all the other browsers later on. (see firefox 4, opera 10, ie9 which all did kind of a spin on that, with ie9 surprisingly going even further and putting both address bar and tabs bar on a single bar)it kinda changed everything, with its approach to simplicity. i&#x27;d argue that even now chrome remains one of simpler browsers among those popular ones out today (compare to firefox, opera, vivaldi, edge, etc. which all seem to have features piling up and just popping out at you). but it is also getting crowded as well, in that button zone around main menu. if I could hide those (given that they&#x27;re also redunant, cause most of those things are in main menu anyway), i wouldn&#x27;t miss them at all. reply mort96 17 hours agorootparentprevI still use Firefox, I find its UI prettier than Chrome&#x27;s these days... but I wish it handled many tabs better.

If you have a lot of tabs open from the same website (i.e. with the same favicon), then finding the right tab becomes really tedious. And, even if all the favicons are different, I don&#x27;t necessarily remember which favicon corresponds to which page.I can&#x27;t really compare this with Firefox&#x27;s native solution though, because I use Sidebery (and I used tree-style tabs before that). reply MayeulC 16 hours agorootparentprevTo each their own, I find Chrome&#x27;s solution unusable past 20 tabs or so.Tab Groups and&#x2F;or Tree-style tabs are pretty much required for working with hundreds of tabs, though. reply mort96 2 hours agorootparentSo you agree that Chrome&#x27;s solution is better out of the box than Firefox&#x27;s, right?

I remember installing it and it was night and day, I could have multiple tabs open with out my computer paging memory to disk and everything felt so snappy.With all that said I think somewhere around 2015 or 2016 I switched back to Firefox because Chrome had become a CPU and memory hog while Firefox had stepped up its game and was a lot faster and more lightweight than Chrome. reply pseudalopex 9 hours agorootparentChrome used more memory because it used more processes. But it was more responsive and released more memory when tabs were closed. reply drivebycomment 15 hours agorootparentprevChrome was noticeably faster, not just the benchmark but actual usage , in both startup time and ajax sites. It crashed less often, and when it crashed, usually it took down only a single tab instead of the entire browser. The UI was more minimal and clean.It was superior in almost every way. All other browsers had to play the catch-up for a while - especially the performance. reply nvm0n2 13 hours agorootparentprevWhen Chrome first launched it was actually quite rough. There are some rose tinted glasses on this thread. It was Windows only, lacked basic features like printing, had no extensions system and had no few site compatibility bugs. The primary \"features\" that set it apart were all non-functionals like performance, security and the skyline tab UI which was nice but other browsers had tabs too. Oh, there was Incognito Mode, which was a nice improvement over other browser&#x27;s history clearing UI.It got some initial launch attention but then usage fell a lot (I was at Google at the time), and plateaued for a long time whilst the team fixed bugs, ported to other platforms and caught up on the feature set. It took a lot of belief by Google to continue funding it during these quiet years when relatively few people used it. One of the biggest struggles the Chrome marketing team faced turned out to be that nobody even knew what a browser was let alone why they&#x27;d consider switching to a different one.Still, the team didn&#x27;t give up. They just plugged away at it, year after year. They caught up on features, added a thoughtful&#x2F;controllable extensions API and were careful to stop power users doing things that would accidentally trash performance, like opening billions of tabs or installing extensions that trashed the browser internals (a particular problem for Firefox). reply omoikane 16 hours agoparentprevChrome has a lot of little things that makes it feel smoother for me, e.g. the browser launches a little bit faster, closing multiple tabs is accessible in one menu click (compared to a second level menu in Firefox), easier access to create and switch between profiles, incognito window that is visually distinct from a regular window, etc.None of the little things are absolute must-haves, but the little things do add up. reply xctr94 11 hours agoparentprevLots of good reasons already mentioned, but there were 2 killer reasons for me: developer tools and extensions. I really wanted to stick with Firefox, but as someone working on the web, it was an appalling experience. And then Chrome just kept getting better and better extensions that I couldn’t find elsewhere.Obviously Firefox becoming much slower and heavier over time, whilst introducing anti-features didn’t help either.I despise Google now, so I don’t use Chrome anymore. But I’m not going back to Firefox either. The trust battery towards Mozilla never got back from zero. reply pseudalopex 9 hours agorootparentSome developers preferred Chrome&#x27;s developer tools. Some preferred Firebug.What better and better extensions were Chrome only before Chrome overtook Firefox? reply onthecanposting 17 hours agoparentprevGoogle has more revenue and it engaged in aggressive anticompetitive practices, like breaking compatibility with competing browsers on its own popular web properties. I assume there is some relationship between Google and the US security machine that gives this situation a pass. reply lproven 51 minutes agoprevThat face when someone posted your own article to HN before you did and it&#x27;s gone berserk over the weekend without you noticing.For those calling Firefox irrelevant: note that its market share of web users is about the same as desktop Linux&#x27;s market share. 3% of surfers is a lot of people and not an irrelevance or a rounding error. reply arusahni 20 hours agoprevWhile I understand why folks would miss the loss of XUL&#x2F;XPCOM, stating that it was to ape Chrome feels disingenuous. Removal of those technologies enabled multiprocess Firefox and bolstered stability. If anything, based on comments I see here and elsewhere, it was one of the things that brought people back to the browser. Adopting&#x2F;starting WebExtensions made sense, too (IMO), as Chrome already had way too much mindshare introduce anything totally novel. reply lproven 27 minutes agoparent> While I understand why folks would miss the loss of XUL&#x2F;XPCOM, stating that it was to ape Chrome feels disingenuous.I wrote the article. I did not state that. I did not even hint it or imply it, and my eyebrows went so far up when I read this comment that my hat lifted.I&#x27;ve never even heard this idea before.Please can you point out where I said that the removal of XUL was in order to ape Chrome? reply arp242 20 hours agoparentprevIt was 100% painful and frustrating, but also 100% done for technically valid reasons. I&#x27;ve always preferred Firefox (or Opera Presto, before that) for the simple reason that Chromium&#x27;s text selection is weird, clunky, and unlike anything else I&#x27;ve ever seen (this is also how you can spot any Electron app). But it really was just ... slow. Moving away from XUL was an important step in fixing that.That said, I do feel that Firefox fell in the \"X is more popular, X does Y, therefore, we need to do Y\" trap, forgetting that you have your current userbase exactly because you&#x27;re NOT doing Y but Z. But that&#x27;s an entirely different matter. reply orra 20 hours agoparentprev100% this. Folks used to lament Firefox for being slow. And for me it would freeze for seconds sometimes, because of synchronous extensions APIs.Removing XPCOM, switching to multiprocess, and switching to asynchronous Web Extensions was absolutely vital technologically. Perf is good now. reply pseudalopex 9 hours agoparentprevNo. Firefox 48 supported multiprocess. Mozilla pushed developers to make their XUL extensions multiprocess compatible after WebExtensions development started. Firefox 57 disabled XUL extensions. They removed XUL gradually after. reply kzrdude 21 hours agoprevIt should be a good time for Firefox, because now it&#x27;s clear that Firefox plus ublock origin can block more ads than google ever allows Chrome to do (they don&#x27;t allow it anymore).That&#x27;s a tangible benefit you can tell your friends about. reply SpacePortKnight 21 hours agoparenttbh if ads on a website can not be blocked by a simple content blocker, then I&#x27;ll just simply stop using the website.Safari and Chrome V3 blocker are much more privacy friendly since the extension does not need to access the entire DOM. reply TerrifiedMouse 21 hours agorootparentSo you will stop using YouTube? You will stop using some of the biggest sites on the internet and restrict yourself to a small niche? reply bad_user 19 hours agorootparentSome of us pay for YouTube Premium.One can argue that if you don&#x27;t want ads, and you don&#x27;t want to pay for a subscription, then maybe you shouldn&#x27;t use that website.Because continued use is just like software piracy. It&#x27;s imoral because you&#x27;re getting subsidized by those playing fair, but also because alternatives can&#x27;t thrive unless you choose to vote with your wallet or eyeballs. It&#x27;s the same reason piracy was imoral, as it kept people using the incumbents, instead of using alternatives that were open-source. reply TerrifiedMouse 19 hours agorootparent> Some of us pay for YouTube Premium.I have considered that actually but it would mean I have to give them my credit card thereby tying my real identity to the Google&#x2F;YouTube account. I might consider it if they sold those gift cards that you can buy with cash at a convenience store. reply bad_user 18 hours agorootparentThis is a good reason, but it&#x27;s niche, and such level of privacy isn&#x27;t sustainable for most people. Because they are Google, and they know the location of your IP address better than anyone (since they have Wi-fi info, too), so if you can&#x27;t trust them at all and fear repercussions, you&#x27;d better access them via Tor or some VPN you can trust.Personally, I trust my local authorities, since I&#x27;m an EU citizen and the GDPR applies. I know this may be naive, but Google has implemented many changes in response to the GDPR already, and for me it&#x27;s the only alternative short of avoiding them completely.Speaking of Chromium, forks still exist, like Vivaldi or Brave, and they ship with ads blockers that are not subject to the limitations of Manifest v3. reply TerrifiedMouse 16 hours agorootparentGoogle tracking me and figuring out my identity is one thing and me giving my real life identity to them on a platter is another. There is zero doubt in the latter.Again, the solution is simple, sell YouTube gift cards. Steam can do it. I think iTunes does it. It should be trivial for a company of Google’s size. replylouthy 21 hours agoparentprevBut other Chromium based browsers do that too: Brave etc. reply jowea 21 hours agorootparentIf the scenario other posters are concerned about where most sites become chrome-only I wonder if something like that will substitute the market niche that Firefox currently occupies. Or will we just have Firefox on Blink like Microsoft moved Edge to Blink. reply CatWChainsaw 21 hours agorootparentprevBut if Google changes what&#x27;s in Chromium, those other browsers would get those anti-features downstream. reply 35 more comments...

Check your image creation progress at Image Creator.\"Looks like they might perhaps be using a LLM for the chat responses that isn&#x27;t aware that it has the ability to draw images, and in parallel another model who decides what to draw and show to the user. reply simonw 20 hours agoparentI try to avoid prompts like \"Can you ...?\" because they could be interpreted as yes&#x2F;no answers as opposed to commands to do something.I&#x27;ve been prompting Bing with \"Draw me an image of...\" or even just \"Image: image description\" and it&#x27;s worked well for me so far. reply dhruvdh 19 hours agoparentprevI think this has to do with the verb \"draw\". LLM is just saying it cannot draw. The image generation is likely a function it \"calls\".

Can&#x27;t imagine why they&#x27;ve been using it for so long instead of building a reasonable UX for this use case. I think this will cost them a bunch of traction. reply ilaksh 18 hours agorootparentI believe the fact that it&#x27;s in Discord is actually the main reason it became so popular so fast. The number one thing that makes something popular is other people already doing it.When you go into a Discord and you are watching hundreds of people use a product in real time, you almost have to try it. When Midjourney first blew up, it was probably one of the most profound moments in marketing of the internet era.As usual, people will happily give you the worst advice possible. There were people telling them to drop the Discord interface on day one. If they had listened to them, they would have killed off their amazing marketing advantage and stunted their growth. reply aenvoker 18 hours agorootparentCompletely correct. They did a lot of testing of a variety of user interfaces before choosing Discord.With a web interface, new users would come in a prompt “dog”, “funny dog”, “two funny dogs”, get bored and leave. But, when a bunch of new users would prompt together in a Discord channel, they would riff off of each other constantly and get creative and detailed with immediate feedback from other users. Engagement and retention were both incredibly higher.From Day One people have been telling them that Discord was a terrible mistake. All while Discord was measurably a huge success. MJ has been working on a web interface for a long time now. But, Discord has been tough to beat in the big picture. reply GaggiX 18 hours agorootparentprevMidjourney became famous by being ahead of the competition, using the Discord interface is convenient but it doesn&#x27;t make them any favour at making the service more popular.>When you go into a Discord and you are watching hundreds of people use a product in real timeThe ability to use MJ outside of the server is relatively new, so it has not had an impact on awareness of the service. reply BiteCode_dev 16 hours agorootparentprevThe chat, admin and moderation features in discord have huge value and are costly to build. The anti-bot protection and built in permission system especially.They focus their resource on their product, while exposing it to mostly geek.I would have never though it would be a good idea, but it proved to be a good choice. reply duckmysick 10 hours agorootparentprevOn the other hand, ChatGPT started as a standalone service, not a Discord server, and it was also a success. reply kaetemi 19 hours agorootparentprevThe social flow of prompting together with other people is unique when it happens. (Sadly the channels on the main server are now mostly a flood of random people who are ignoring each other.) reply mardifoufs 19 hours agoparentprevMidjourney is discord only? Wait, that sounds like an insane load (just the storage+bandwidth, I know the models don&#x27;t run there) on Discord&#x27;s servers. It&#x27;s a pretty neat way to be able to scale super quickly at first but I would think that discord wouldn&#x27;t like it. I would also have imagined that they&#x27;d have built their own interface by now. reply kaetemi 19 hours agorootparentThey work together directly with Discord. Even got specialised UI for inpainting in Discord now. Their server is a special case with different limits too.(They do have a web app and a mobile app that are probably in eternal alpha limbo.) reply GaggiX 19 hours agorootparentprevI think they have some agreements, Midjourney is the biggest server on Discord (by a large margin). reply cloudking 17 hours agoparentprevOn a related note, Instagram has implemented the &#x2F;imagine command into DMs now too.

    "originBody": "SKIP TO CONTENT Open the Main Navigation Search Return to homepage NEWSLETTERS FOR BUSINESS MEMBERSHIP STARTS WITH A BANG — SEPTEMBER 21, 2023 Pulsars, not dark matter, explain the Milky Way’s antimatter An enormous amount of antimatter is coming from our galactic center. But the culprit probably isn't dark matter, but merely neutron stars. NASA's Fermi Satellite has constructed the highest resolution, high-energy map of the Universe ever created. Without space-based observatories such as this one, we could never learn all that we have about the Universe, nor could we even accurately measure the gamma-ray sky. The evidence for large quantities of clustered antimatter is nonexistent. Credit: NASA/DOE/Fermi LAT Collaboration KEY TAKEAWAYS For years, astronomers have been puzzled by an excess of antimatter particles emanating from the Milky Way's galactic center. Many astronomers and physicists hoped that this phenomenon would've been caused by dark matter particles, either annihilating or decaying, and then creating positrons. However, recent results suggest a far more mundane explanation: rotating neutron stars, whose relativistic jets and fast-moving material create matter-antimatter pairs. No dark matter required. Ethan Siegel Copy a link to the article entitled http://Pulsars,%20not%20dark%20matter,%20explain%20the%20Milky%20Way’s%20antimatter Share Pulsars, not dark matter, explain the Milky Way’s antimatter on Facebook Share Pulsars, not dark matter, explain the Milky Way’s antimatter on Twitter Share Pulsars, not dark matter, explain the Milky Way’s antimatter on LinkedIn When you look out at the Universe, what you see is only a tiny portion of what’s actually out there. If you were to examine the Universe solely with what’s perceptible to your eyes, you’d miss out on a whole slew of information that exists in wavelengths of light that are invisible to us. From the highest-energy gamma rays to the lowest-energy radio waves, the electromagnetic spectrum is enormous, with visible light representing just a tiny sliver of what’s out there. At shorter wavelengths and higher energies, gamma rays, X-rays, and ultraviolet light are all present, while at longer wavelengths and lower energies, infrared, microwave, and radio light encodes a wide variety of information about what various astrophysical sources are doing. However, there’s an entirely different method to measure the Universe: to collect actual particles and antiparticles, a science known as cosmic ray astronomy. For more than a decade, astronomers have seen a signal of cosmic ray positrons — the antimatter counterpart of the electron — that they’ve struggled to explain. Could it be humanity’s best clue toward solving the dark matter mystery? While many hoped that the answer would be “yes,” a recent study definitively says no, it’s probably just pulsars. Here’s why. Cosmic rays produced by high-energy astrophysics sources can reach any object in the Solar System, and appear to permeate our local region of space omnidirectionally. When they collide with Earth, they strike atoms in the atmosphere, creating particle and radiation showers at the surface, while direct detectors in space, above the atmosphere, can measure the original particles directly. Credit: ASPERA/G.Toma/A.Saftoiu There are a great many things in the Universe that are known to create positrons: the antimatter counterpart of electrons. Whenever you have a high-enough energy collision between two particles, there’s a certain amount of energy that will be available with the potential to create new particle-antiparticle pairs. If that available energy is greater than the equivalent mass of the new particle(s) you want to create, the available energy as defined by Einstein’s famous equation, E = mc², there will be a finite probability of generating those new particles with every such collision that occurs. There are all sorts of high-energy processes that can lead to this type of energy becoming available, including: particles accelerated by black holes, high-energy protons colliding with the galactic disk, or particles accelerated in the vicinity of neutron stars. However, it’s also possible that they could arise from an exotic source, such as dark matter or a different sort of new particle from beyond the Standard Model. Based on the known physics and astrophysics of the Universe, however, we know that a certain amount of positrons must be generated irrespective of any new physics. “New physics” should only be considered if the amount of positrons generated by the more mundane physical mechanisms is shown to be insufficient. In the main image, our galaxy’s antimatter jets are illustrated, blowing ‘Fermi bubbles’ in the halo of gas surrounding our galaxy. In the small, inset image, actual Fermi data shows the gamma-ray emissions resulting from this process. These “bubbles” arise from the energy produced by electron-positron annihilation: an example of matter and antimatter interacting and being converted into pure energy via E = mc^2. We are certain that no antimatter signature in our galaxy arises from either antimatter stars or large clumps of antimatter. Credit: David A. Aguilar (main); NASA/GSFC/Fermi (inset) However, we also expect that there actually must be some new physics out there, because of the overwhelming astrophysical evidence for dark matter. While the true nature of dark matter will remain a mystery until the particle (or at least one of the particles) responsible is detected directly, many dark matter scenarios exist where not only is dark matter its own antiparticle, but that dark matter annihilations will also produce electron-positron pairs. As long as your dark matter particle is massive enough so that electron-positron pairs can be generated from the energy released when dark matter particles annihilate, this type of antimatter ought to be generated under some conditions. So how do we decide: dark matter or “mundane” physics? Which one is responsible for blowing these “Fermi bubbles” in our galaxy? Whenever you have multiple possible physical explanations for what could cause an observable phenomenon, the key to telling which one matches reality is to tease out differences between the explanations. In particular, positrons due to dark matter should experience a cutoff at specific energies (corresponding to the mass of the dark matter particles), while positrons generated by conventional astrophysics should fall off more gradually. In other words, looking at the energy spectrum of these positrons, directly, should tell us what the answer is. Exterior view of the ISS with the alpha magnetic spectrometer (AMS-02) visible in the foreground. The AMS-02 experiment was installed in 2011 and has provided our best measurements of cosmic rays by type and energy of any experiment to date. It is particularly good at measuring positrons. Credit: NASA In 2011, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer experiment (AMS-02) was launched, with the goal of further investigating this mystery. After arriving at the International Space Station aboard the final mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavor, it was quickly set up and began sending data back to Earth within 3 days. During its operational phase, it collected and measured more than ten billion cosmic ray particles per year. Although only a tiny fraction of them were positrons, that’s okay; because of the different energy, charge, and charge-to-mass ratios of the different particles that impacted it, different species of particle could be separated out. What’s remarkable about AMS-02 is the “magnetic” part of the experiment: magnetic fields bend charge particles, and while the magnetic force on a moving charged particle depends only on its electric charge and velocity, the amount that a particle “bends by” as it passes through the detector is also dependent on the incoming particle’s mass and momentum. This makes AMS-02 able to sort these cosmic rays both by type and by energy, providing us with an unprecedented set of data to evaluate whether the positrons appeared to be due to dark matter or not. At low energies, the data matched the predictions of cosmic rays colliding with the interstellar medium, but at higher energies, something else was clearly at play. If the AMS-02 experiment would have experienced zero failures and not required any repairs, it would have collected sufficient data to distinguish between pulsars (blue) or annihilating dark matter (red) as the source of the excess positrons. Either way, collisions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium can only explain the low-energy signature, with another explanation required for the high-energy signatures. Credit: AMS Collaboration However, just because you’re seeing more positrons above and beyond what we expect would be caused by collisions of cosmic rays with matter in the interstellar medium doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a slam dunk for dark matter. That’s not true by any means. At higher energies, it’s also possible that pulsars, which accelerate matter particles to incredible energies through a combination of their gravitational and electromagnetic forces, could produce a peaked excess of positrons at high energies. The only way to truly tell those scenarios apart is to look at the highest energies, and see whether the energy-spectrum fall-off is sharp (for dark matter) or gradual (for pulsars): something right at the limit of AMS-02’s capabilities. Although AMS-02 sees evidence (at 4-sigma, or 99.99% confidence) that there’s a peak and then a falloff in the observed energies of positrons, its sensitivity and event rate peters out at exactly the types of energies that would enable us to differentiate between a positron signal arising from pulsars versus one arising from annihilating dark matter. The Crab pulsar, like all pulsars, is an example of a neutron star corpse. The gas and matter surrounding it is quite common, and is capable of providing fuel for the pulsing behavior of these neutron stars. Matter-antimatter pairs, as well as high-energy particles, are produced in copious amounts by neutron stars, offering up the possibility that they, and not dark matter, are responsible for the excess signals observed by AMS-02. Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/SAO; Optical: NASA/STScI; Infrared: NASA-JPL-Caltech However, there’s more than one way to tell these two scenarios apart, as positrons produced by pulsars should also generate an additional signal that falls well outside the measurements that AMS-02 or any cosmic ray experiment could detect: gamma rays. In other words, there’s not only a direct “antimatter” signature that we should be attempting to observe, but to search for a high-energy electromagnetic signature — and remember, gamma-rays are the highest energy electromagnetic waves of all — right alongside it. There’s a physical reason behind this explanation. If it’s pulsars that are truly generating the positrons that could be responsible for the signal that cosmic ray experiments are seeing, then a significant fraction of those positrons will have the misfortune of colliding with electrons in the interstellar medium long before they arrive at our cosmic ray detectors. When positrons collide with electrons, they annihilate, with each reaction producing two gamma rays with a very specific energy signature: 511 keV of energy, the rest-energy equivalent of an electron’s (or positron’s) mass, also obtained from Einstein’s E = mc². The production of matter/antimatter pairs (left) from pure energy is a completely reversible reaction (right), with matter/antimatter annihilating back to pure energy. And yet, the fact that we see that everything in our Universe is consistent with being made of matter, and not antimatter, teaches us that perhaps something must have occurred, early on, to create a matter/antimatter asymmetry. Credit: Dmitri Pogosyan/University of Alberta However, pulsars should theoretically be able to accelerate these electrons and positrons up to extraordinarily high energies: energies that even the world’s most powerful terrestrial particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, is wholly incapable of reaching. When photons — even those containing only the normal-energies that starlight produces — interact with these ultra-relativistic (near light-speed) particles, they can get boosted to extraordinary energies through a process known as inverse Compton scattering. Based on physical parameters like: the properties of the pulsar, the matter in the pulsar’s vicinity, the electrons and positrons generated, and the amount of starlight present nearby, a specific energy spectrum will be created for the photons generated from this process. If you combine the energy spectra, all superimposed together, from all of the nearby, relevant pulsars, you’ll predict a specific gamma ray signature that you expect to observe. That signature is what could indicate whether it’s pulsars, or whether it’s something that’s not pulsars (like dark matter), that are causing the observed positron excess. Particles traveling near light speed can interact with starlight and boost it to gamma-ray energies. This animation shows the process, known as inverse Compton scattering. When light ranging from microwave to ultraviolet wavelengths collides with a fast-moving particle, the interaction boosts it to gamma rays, the most energetic form of light. Credits: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center About 800 light-years away, incredibly close by astronomical standards, one of the brightest gamma-ray pulsars in the entire sky can be found: Geminga. This pulsar was only discovered in 1972, and had its nature revealed in 1991, when the ROSAT mission measured evidence for a neutron star spinning at a rate of 4.2 revolutions-per-second. Travel the Universe with astrophysicist Ethan Siegel. Subscribers will get the newsletter every Saturday. All aboard! Fields marked with an * are required Fast-forward to the present day, more than 30 years later, when we now have NASA’s Fermi Large Area Telescope: with enormously improved spatial and energy resolution over any gamma-ray observatory that preceded it. Fermi-LAT is now the world’s most sophisticated gamma ray observatory by many metrics, and it’s capable of observing details about individual sources, such as pulsars, that couldn’t be seen before.. By subtracting out the gamma ray signal arising from cosmic rays colliding with interstellar gas clouds, the remnant signal from starlight interacting with accelerated electrons and positrons could be revealed. When a team of researchers led by Mattia di Mauro analyzed the relevant Fermi data in late 2019, what they saw was spectacular: an energy-dependent signal that, at its largest, spanned some 20 degrees in the sky at the exact energies that AMS-02 was most sensitive to. This model of Geminga’s gamma-ray halo shows how the emission changes at different energies, a result of two effects. The first is the pulsar’s rapid motion through space over the decade Fermi’s Large Area Telescope has observed it. Second, lower-energy particles travel much farther from the pulsar before they interact with starlight and boost it to gamma-ray energies. This is why the gamma-ray emission covers a larger area at lower energies. Credits: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center/M. Di Mauro Explaining this glow, which decreases in size as Fermi looks at progressively higher energies, fit the models perfectly by leveraging a combination of inverse Compton scattering with the pulsar’s motion through interstellar space. According to Fiorenza Donato, coauthor on the recent Fermi study that measured gamma rays from Geminga, “Lower-energy particles travel much farther from the pulsar before they run into starlight, transfer part of their energy to it, and boost the light to gamma rays. This is why the gamma-ray emission covers a larger area at lower energies. Also, Geminga’s halo is elongated partly because of the pulsar’s motion through space.” This makes sense if you remember an important aspect of photon-electron scattering, the process that powers the “boost” to gamma-ray energies: higher energy particles have a greater cross-section with photons, and so are more likely to interact within a shorter distance. The measurement of the gamma rays arising from Geminga, alone, suggests that this one pulsar could be responsible for as much as 20% of the high-energy positrons that were seen by the AMS-02 experiment. This animation shows a region of the sky centered on the pulsar Geminga. The first image shows the total number of gamma rays detected by Fermi’s Large Area Telescope at energies from 8 to 1,000 billion electron volts (GeV) — billions of times the energy of visible light — over the past decade. By removing all bright sources, astronomers discovered the pulsar’s faint, extended gamma-ray halo, concluding that this one pulsar could be responsible for up to 20% of the positrons detected by the AMS-02 experiment. Credit: NASA/DOE/Fermi LAT Collaboration Whenever there’s an unexplained phenomenon that we’ve measured or observed, it presents a tantalizing possibility to scientists: that perhaps there’s something new at play beyond what’s presently known. We know there are mysteries about our Universe that require new physics at some level — mysteries like dark matter, dark energy, or the cosmic matter-antimatter asymmetry — whose ultimate solution has yet to be discovered. It’s an important reminder that all of the known physics at play in the Universe cannot represent all of what’s truly out there; there still remain deep, fundamental mysteries whose solutions are not presently known. However, we cannot claim evidence for a new discovery until we first scrupulously and quantitatively account for everything that represents the physics and astrophysics of what’s already known. By factoring in the effect of pulsars, the positron excess observed by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer collaboration appears to be explicable entirely by conventional high-energy astrophysics, with no need for dark matter. Right now, our observations are consistent with the notion that pulsars are responsible for 100% of the observed excess, requiring scientists to go back to the drawing board for a direct signal that reveals our Universe’s elusive dark matter. The Milky Way’s antimatter, despite what many had hoped for, appears to be entirely due to pulsars.

Poor choice because few months ago a study (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.aps.org&#x2F;prd&#x2F;abstract&#x2F;10.1103&#x2F;PhysRevD.107.1...) reopened the possibility of being dark matter afterall. reply perihelions 14 hours agoparentIf I understand that paper, it&#x27;s still the case that there&#x27;s zero evidence for dark matter annihilation from AMS positrons. What it says it that (a certain type of) such evidence could, in principle, exist—it contradicts a previous theory conclusion that dark matter and pulsar positrons would have indistinguishable energy spectra. I.e. the OP blogpost is still completely accurate. (??)(Of course—just to clarify if we all have a shared understanding—nothing in OP rules out the possibility of dark matter annihilation; it just says there&#x27;s no evidence for it currently in AMS positrons. And to clarify shared understanding of a different point—the OP research isn&#x27;t about positron energy spectrum features; it&#x27;s a separate question about their total luminosity.

To make antiproton takes 1500 times more.There is a great hope, however, that (i) dark matter interacts with itself, (ii) concentrates in certain places (say around black holes) and (iii) dark mater annihilation makes ordinary matter particles we can see. But who knows? Maybe there is the same asymmetry between dark matter and anti-dark matter so that annihilation stoped happening after the Big Ban, but maybe some dark matter particles are their own antiparticles.

In that case future particle accelerators will be our only chance of ever catching a glimpse of this. reply codethief 11 hours agorootparentWhy through the Higgs? reply tremon 9 hours agorootparentGravity. The entire dark matter theory is based around the observation that current mass&#x2F;gravity models don&#x27;t match our observations in the cosmos. As the Higgs field is what gives particles mass, it stands to reason that dark matter does interact with gravity -- it&#x27;s pretty much the sole reason for its theoretic existence.In other words, if dark matter didn&#x27;t interact with&#x2F;through the Higgs field, it wouldn&#x27;t explain the observational anomalies and therefore wouldn&#x27;t have a reason to exist at all, not even in theory. reply nyssos 8 hours agorootparent> As the Higgs field is what gives particles massMass is a generic property of particles in a QFT. Unless there are symmetry considerations constraining them (gauge bosons like the photon, for instance, must be massless to avoid violating their corresponding gauge symmetries), masses are free parameters and zero is not particularly more natural than any other value.What the Higgs mechanism does is add effective mass even to particles which are intrinsically massless, so long as they couple to the Higgs field. For the standard model, that means leptons, quarks, and the W and Z bosons. But there are other fundamental particles with intrinsic masses (the Higgs boson itself, for instance), and composite can acquire mass from their binding energy even if their constituents are massless. reply nyssos 4 hours agorootparent> What the Higgs mechanism does is add effective mass even to particles which are intrinsically massless, so long as they couple to the Higgs field. For the standard model, that means leptons, quarks, and the W and Z bosons.this was sloppy: the W and Z bosons have mass because they mix with the Higgs field (this is the Higgs mechanism, properly speaking), while the mass acquired by leptons and quarks is due to interacting with the remaining Higgs component in the usual way. reply InfiniteRand 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat exactly is mass from a Higgs boson point of view? I mean my layman definition is mass is the amount of matter, but that doesn’t seem like the thing that the Higgs boson is involved in reply nyssos 5 hours agorootparentCharacterizing what things \"are\" in a physical theory is not really possible: ultimately physics is only concerned with (and only has access to) what things do. When we say that \"The X-ion has mass m\", in the context of a quantum field theory, we mean that- The magnitude of its 4-momentum is m (better known as E^2 = p^2 + m^2c^4)- There&#x27;s an X^2 m^2 term in the Lagrangian of our theory (there are some formal complications here but they&#x27;re physically irrelevant), which in extremely loose terms means that in the absence of interactions X will behave like a collection of harmonic oscillators with mass m.- The strength of its interaction with gravitational fields, neglecting relativistic effects, is proportional to m.and so on for every other place \"m\" shows up. The meaning of mass, if you want to assign it one, is the correspondence between all these different quantities. And their meanings, in turn, are other correspondences, all the way down. To get actual physical meaning out, you need to find some place in the theory which you can identify with observational results (the typical case for particle physics is scattering amplitudes and collider experiments).Ideally this is enough of a foothold to interpret everything: the readouts when we objects a and b together match the calculated scattering amplitudes for particles A and B, so we hypothesize that a is an A and b is a B. Now if we smash objects b and c together and get results that match theoretical predictions for B and C, we can be more confident b is a B and hypothesize c might be a C, and so on. But there&#x27;s no law that says this must be possible, and no guarantee that every term in our theories points to some particular thing in the world. reply codethief 2 hours agorootparentprev> In other words, if dark matter didn&#x27;t interact with&#x2F;through the Higgs field, it wouldn&#x27;t explain the observational anomaliesThat conclusion seems premature to me. Not only because we lack a quantum theory of gravity but also because (classical) gravity doesn&#x27;t care where your particle&#x27; mass comes from. Heck, it mostly looks at your particle&#x27;s total energy (mass + kinetic energy + addition d.o.f.) to determine how spacetime should curve.Besides, as the sibling pointed out, the Higgs mechanism is only responsible for generating the mass of the W± and Z bosons. Other masses are unaccounted for and have nothing to do with the Higgs. reply frozenport 10 hours agorootparentprevAn experimentalists would tell you its still an open possibility because we haven&#x27;t seen enough Higgs particles to claim we know how they all decay. An anomaly in decay rates, lets say particles disappearing, or taking too long&#x2F;short to decay might hint at some new physics. reply perihelions 19 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1903.05647 (\"Detection of a γ-ray halo around Geminga with the Fermi-LAT and implications for the positron flux\")( aka. doi.org&#x2F;10.1103&#x2F;PhysRevD.100.123015 ) reply tshadley 19 hours agoparentSo this is old news? reply forgotpwd16 16 hours agorootparentThe study up to which article covers, yes.

If you have studied science (or even remember high school science) you know it&#x27;s the scientific process working as intended. In the eyes of the public, though, science keeps \"changing its mind\" as though its a monolithic structure of truth which keeps lying to us.I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a solution to this issue short of science journalism adoption an addiction to qualifying statements -- the ones everyone hates in ChatGPT but from a liability standpoint are required so nobody tries a new home blood chelation therapy hallucinated by an LLM. reply JumpCrisscross 19 hours agorootparent> the hypothesis of \"dark matter drives space expansion\"This is dark energy [1].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dark_energy reply jacquesm 15 hours agorootparentprevAnd some scientists aren&#x27;t exactly helping by making it seem as if this inherent conflict between &#x27;this&#x27; and &#x27;better&#x27; isn&#x27;t part and parcel of the whole but instead driven by personal conflict. The damage done like that is likely long term fairly massive, hopefully prospective scientists won&#x27;t be discouraged by these vendetta like phenomenon. reply Swizec 19 hours agorootparentprevAs a complete lay person, I’ve always understood dark matter to be our generation’s aether. Obviously there’s an undetectable medium in space for light to propagate through, how else could it work? We know from all our best observations and models that everything propagates through a medium.Dark matter has a similar vibe, we need it for our best models measurements and understanding to work. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a crucial detail we’ll discover later that makes dark matter sound as silly as aether. Or we could find a way to directly detect&#x2F;measure it! That too would be cool reply miramba 19 hours agorootparentI never heard of aether before, so here is a reference for anyone else: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Luminiferous_aether reply nobodyandproud 18 hours agorootparentThat’s surprising.Proving&#x2F;disproving the existence of a medium was the whole point of the Michaelson-Morley experiment. reply TheOtherHobbes 14 hours agorootparentDisproving the existence of a medium with certain expected properties and behaviours - one of which was that light travelled through it like waves through water.The reality is that light travels through spacetime and has completely unexpected and non-intuitive properties, one of which is an absolutely constant velocity.This doesn&#x27;t mean spacetime isn&#x27;t a medium of some kind, it means spacetime isn&#x27;t a medium of any familiar or intuitive kind, and the old waves-on-water metaphor is too simple to explain it.QFT suggests spacetime is filled with fields of all kinds and particles are excitations of these fields.But what these \"fields\" actually are, and what they&#x27;re made of, and why there are certain kinds of fields and not others, and why they operate with relativistic geometry, is a complete mystery. reply tekla 18 hours agorootparentprevAre you trying to discount Aether as a pseudoscience versus a serious theory?You&#x27;re italicizing \"Obviously\" which makes me think that. reply Swizec 18 hours agorootparentNo it was a serious theory that seemed obvious and logical at the time. But now it seems so obviously wrong that it’s almost laughable anyone could ever take it seriously.See also: phrenology. Same phenomenon, different field. reply hutzlibu 15 hours agorootparent\"But now it seems so obviously wrong that it’s almost laughable anyone could ever take it seriously\"Was it really that laughable?\"Whatever difficulties we may have in forming a consistent idea of the constitution of the aether, there can be no doubt that the interplanetary and interstellar spaces are not empty, but are occupied by a material substance or body, which is certainly the largest, and probably the most uniform body of which we have any knowledge.” (James Clerk Maxwell)We discovered there is no true vacuum. And we still don&#x27;t know how exactly electromagnetic waves travel, or how gravitaion works. So the old modell of aether is clearly wrong, but before we have not come up with a consistent model explaining all of it, I would not call it laughable. It made sense at the time. And to me there still is some appeall to the basic concept, that there must be something allowing the spreading of the various waves. Or is that question solved by now? reply Swizec 15 hours agorootparent> Was it really that laughable?Perhaps laughable is a stretch. I remember aether as an example of the scientific method working in a high school class. We had a theory, it seemed reasonable, it fit observations, and then we disproved it. This is good.The laughable part of my memory probably comes from being 15 when I learned about this and the whole class thinking “wow look at those fancy scientists, they didn’t even know basic things we all learn in middle school! ha ha”. Dumb kids be like that sometimes :)BUT aether was also used as an example of failing Occam’s razor. It added weird unmeasurable just-so variables&#x2F;explanations to existing theories so they could expand to fit new measurements. This rarely leads to a theory that stands the test of time.In this way dark matter, in my lay-person view, feels similar. We don’t know what’s going on, so we say it’s gotta be some new “thing” that just happens to be invisible and undetectable except by how it just happens to make our existing models&#x2F;math&#x2F;explanations work. That seems fishy to me as a non-expert. Kinda like when an engineer says “i’ve tried everything, it’s gotta be a compiler bug” … it usually isn’t a compiler bug.edit: Point is that when things don&#x27;t fit together, just adding morerarely works long-term. You need a new model. And personally I&#x27;m excited to see what we think about dark matter in 20 years. reply nyssos 7 hours agorootparent> just happens to be invisible and undetectable except by how it just happens to make our existing models&#x2F;math&#x2F;explanations work.That describes all of physics: there&#x27;s no such thing as \"direct\" detection in the folk \"I know the billiard ball is there because I can see and feel it\" sense. It only feels like there are because you&#x27;ve been using your models of human-scale physics for so long that you trust them completely and automatically. The only people operating in everyday life the way astronomers have to professionally are infants: for them, it&#x27;s not obvious that there are such things as rigid bodies, that sight and touch should correspond in the way that they usually do, and so on. Not because they&#x27;re stupid, but because if you want to reconstruct the whole world from a bunch of low-rez sense data you&#x27;re going to need a ton of it, and they don&#x27;t have that much yet.> Point is that when things don&#x27;t fit together, just adding morerarely works long-term.

The difference between that and pseudo-science is obvious: the existence of Aether can be proven (or disproven), the typical pseudo-science stays very far away from naming any testable hypothesis and instead focuses on how the proponents of pseudo-science are being repressed. But let me point you to a youtube link that will lay it all out in great detail... replyCacti 19 hours agorootparentprevDark matter is largely an instrumentation problem. The universe is very big, and direct observation of individual objects is largely limited by distance&#x2F;luminosity, which is problematic when you are looking for lots of old dark stars very far away. The history of astronomy is largely a process of deriving estimates of new phenomena from what we can observe, and thus underestimating the significance until a better instrument comes along (as at first we only can see the larger objects, which often results in undercounting).Dark energy is partly instrumental, but largely a theoretical gap in understanding. God only knows what is going on there. reply jameshart 17 hours agorootparentThe problem of dark matter isn&#x27;t best thought of as &#x27;dark matter is theorized as an explanation for observations&#x27;. It&#x27;s better thought of as &#x27;observations of the mass of matter in the universe are inconsistent with observation of the amount of light coming from matter in the universe&#x27;.Matter generally does two things: interacts with other matter through gravity, because it has mass; and emits EM radiation, because it has temperature.When you look at galaxies and try to figure out how much matter they contain, if you look at the gravity, you get one number for mass that implies one quantity of matter; and if you look at the EM radiation, you get a smaller number that implies a lower quantity of matter.So the conclusion is, there must be some matter that&#x27;s causing the gravitational effects, but that&#x27;s not emitting any EM radiation. Matter that is dark. Dark matter.I blame George Lucas for a lot of this confusion. When people hear &#x27;dark matter&#x27; they think it&#x27;s dark in the sense of &#x27;mysterious&#x27;.

Though this article seems to be specifically about the Milky Way. reply jpk 15 hours agorootparentMost of the study around dark matter is in the context of galaxies because that&#x27;s where the gravity&#x2F;light mismatch occurs. The rotation of galaxies (as influenced by the gravity of the matter in them) indicates there&#x27;s more matter than what we can see via the light they emit.That mismatch when observing galaxies is the whole reason we think dark matter is a thing. reply nyssos 4 hours agorootparentMost of the evidence is localized around galaxies (not just rotation curves, but also radial velocities and excess gravitational lensing), but not all. Even uniformly distributed dark matter would still show up as a contribution to the mass density of the universe, which curvature measurements indicate is much higher than baryonic matter alone can account for. replyMisdicorl 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is unlikely. There are many many theories of how dark matter could be accounted for with ordinary matter that we simply can&#x27;t detect because our telescopes&#x2F;etc aren&#x27;t good enough.Not all of these theories are completely excluded yet but most have very very thin margins of phase space left to explore (even when combining multiple explanations together). Every time a new telescope comes online we see the phase space diminish rather than hints towards first observations.We are left with:A) new particles that don&#x27;t (or very weakly) interact with electro magnetic fields.B) New theories of gravity.C) New theories of the early universe that open up phase space previously thought closed to existing matter contributionsD) better instrumentation that sees actual contribution in the tiny phase space left to ordinary matter and ordinary physicsD is by far the least interesting of these options and so gets very little press.

It&#x27;s not that it is too far away to be detected, it is non-luminous (as in: not emitting any electromagnetic radiation) and so it isn&#x27;t detectable other than by its secondary effects on other objects.Black holes are another example of something that we can not directly observe using instruments, but that we can observe through their secondary effects.

They are inconclusive. The bullet cluster is less strong evidence for dark matter than good evidence against common armchair refutations. (I agree with your author that it doesn’t rule out MOND as is commonly claimed.) reply uoaei 17 hours agorootparentThe arguments inevitably and only boil down to \"look, our model converged\". The point is, dark matter is not a theory, just a supposition that can always be \"proven\" with conveniently arbitrarily flexible models (no one can see it so it might be anywhere!).There is no positive theory that has been brought out to explain dark matter, only mere deductive hypothesis about where it would be. Deduction needs a culprit so people keep reaching for different kinds of particles. Jury&#x27;s out on whether they exist but keeps the experimentalists employed, so at least it&#x27;s worth that much. reply jboy55 16 hours agorootparentThere have been actually many positive theories trying to explain what particles dark matter could be, they&#x27;ve all been proven wrong.To me dark matter came about from this,\"As we understand gravity we can postulate how galaxies rotate given an estimate on its mass, galaxies do not rotate like this\"In this statement there are three elements;1) Our understanding of gravity 2) Our estimates of the mass of galaxies 3) Our ability to determine how galaxies rotate.At one point in time this last 100 years, we had \"solved\" gravity with regards to our solar system, and we were finding so many new particles that #2 seemed like a great explanation. However, we are now left with no room in our understanding of particles, I think its time to look at the other elements.Put it this way, if we had never observed the galaxy, but developed the standard model in isolation. Then we looked at the stars and tried to define gravity, I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;d be so quick to introduce a new type of matter to define gravity. reply nyssos 5 hours agorootparent> There have been actually many positive theories trying to explain what particles dark matter could be, they&#x27;ve all been proven wrong.Not at all. Ordinary neutrinos and MACHOs (black holes, rogue gas giants, extremely faint dwarf stars) are mostly ruled out. Supersymmetry is not looking promising but certainly not proven wrong. Sterile neutrinos and axions are very much live candidates.> However, we are now left with no room in our understanding of particlesThere&#x27;s plenty of room. Quantum gravity is obviously the elephant in the room, but even aside from that, and off the top of my head: the standard model doesn&#x27;t account for neutrino masses ,matter&#x2F;antimatter asymmetry, or why the lepton masses are related, and it gets the magnetic moment of the muon wrong. The existence of physics beyond the standard model is certain. We just don&#x27;t know what it is yet. reply JumpCrisscross 17 hours agorootparentprevFair enough. I think it’s qualitatively different from SUSY, where I tend towards your conclusion of jobs programme masquerading as theory. (I’m much less convinced dark matter is a novel particle.) replyben_w 17 hours agorootparentprev> no good reason is ever given as to why it could be matter and not anything elseThe options are 1. matter; 2. energy; 3. new physics.We&#x27;d expect pure energy to not stay still for long enough to do anything.Lots of people are looking for new physics, and would be anyway even if it weren&#x27;t for all the things that made us look for dark matter in the first place, because of the whole \"relativity and quantum mechanics don&#x27;t play well together, and neither is sufficient by itself\" problems.Dark matter requires something new, given it can&#x27;t be explained by baryons or black holes, so it too needs some new physics — though as \"matter\" it would be in the particles-and-fields area rather than the how-does-spacetime-even area which the not-actually-matter solution would be. reply nwallin 15 hours agorootparentprevDark matter is more complicated than that. It would be nice if it were as simple as you claim it is, but it isn&#x27;t.From the &#x27;30s through to the &#x27;70s, evidence was piling up that what we saw and what our models predict were incompatible. Zwicky&#x27;s application of the virial theorem to a galaxy cluster, and various astronomer&#x27;s calculations of galaxy rotation curves implied that either there was a bunch of stuff we couldn&#x27;t see, or general relativity was wrong, or both. MOND was born in this era to explain that general relativity was wrong. (note when I say \"wrong\" I mean in the same way F = Gmm&#x2F;r^2 is wrong: it&#x27;s correct in the limit, but wrong in the extremes. Newtonian gravity is wrong at very high acceleration, and MOND implies General Relativity is wrong at very low acceleration) If science had stopped in 1985, you&#x27;d be correct: we couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between dark matter as particles, (CDM, cold dark matter) dark matter as heavy dark objects, (MACHOs: brown dwarfs, black holes) or dark matter as a new gravity model. (MOND: modified Newtonian dynamics)But science did not stop in 1985.First and most obvious is gravitational lensing and the bullet cluster. This is well trodden ground, so I won&#x27;t get too much into it: but the bullet cluster shows us that whatever dark matter is, it has momentum. Some MOND theories do predict something like that, and are compatible with the bullet cluster, other models are not compatible with that, and are falsified by the bullet cluster.Second is baryon acoustic oscillations. (BAOs) In the few minutes after the Big Bang, the universe was, to a first approximation, a roiling sea of photons. There were electrons, protons, and the odd helium&#x2F;lithium nucleus, but because charged particles interact via the electromagnetic force, they were being tossed about on the sea of photons. Baryons could not form overdensities because they were charged, and if anything thought about clumping up, the photons would scatter them. But baryons were not the only objects with mass: there was also dark matter. Dark matter could form clumps, and clumps formed by clumping dark matter would be able to clump normal matter. Eventually, the universe cooled enough that normal matter could clump properly, and at the moment the universe cooled enough to be transparent, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) was born. In order for the CMB to look the way it does, there are very tight bounds on how dark matter has to behave, and wouldn&#x27;t ya know it, these bounds are compatible with the bounds on CDM in order to explain galaxy clusters and galactic rotation curves.Third is the detection of ultra diffuse galaxies. These galaxies are remnants from a galaxy merger, which spilled off some of its normal matter but none of its dark matter, creating a galaxy with negligible dark matter. In other cases, these collisions create massive blobs of dark matter, but with little to no normal matter. These galaxies falsify MOND. For MOND to be correct, these galaxies cannot exist.Forth is LIGO&#x2F;VIRGO and the neutron star-neutron star collision a few years ago and the associated gamma ray burst. Many MOND theories predict that gravity travels slower than light. However, GW170817 shows that gravity travels at the speed of light. Some MOND theories are compatible with this, others are not.In general, theories of MOND comes in two flavors: those that are compatible with the bullet cluster, and those that are compatible with GW170817. None of them, AFAIK, are compatible with both.So if you want a MOND theory with no CDM, that&#x27;s fine, but you have a number of hurdles to jump. You need to create a theoretical framework which is compatible with both the bullet cluster and GW170817, which nobody&#x27;s been able to do. You need to show that ultra diffuse galaxies are a sensor or interpretation error; those galaxies are significantly closer or farther than currently believed. You need to come up with an entirely new mechanism that explains BAOs. It&#x27;s not impossible, it is just extraordinarily difficult. reply mr_mitm 14 hours agorootparentExactly. You can do all this and you&#x27;ll end up with a super convoluted theory that basically says: the laws of physics have conspired to make everything look like as if there was dark matter. reply uoaei 14 hours agorootparentThe laws of physics (of the time) conspired to make everything look as if there was phlogiston, too.Is chemistry \"convoluted\" to you? The concept of oxidation? Combustion? These are big words with lots of implications, are we sure they&#x27;re warranted given how easy it is to chalk it up to phlogiston? reply nyssos 4 hours agorootparent> The laws of physics (of the time) conspired to make everything look as if there was phlogiston, too.No, they conspired to make it look as if some substance was transferred between fuel and air during combustion, and between the air and the lungs during respiration, which is true. It happens to be absorbed from the air and not by it, but until and unless you actually devised an experiment to test that, there&#x27;s no way you could have known. Anyone absolutely convinced of the existence of oxygen in 1600 was being just as unreasonable as someone absolutely convinced of phlogiston - they just got lucky. replywanda 18 hours agorootparentprevThe good reason for adding dark matter, that you say is absent, is one that is more a question of philosophy of science, in that adding more mass accounts for the observed behaviours without changing the known laws of physics.The known laws of physics have been formed on math that checks out and is consistent with all our other observations, and has made many predictions that have checked out and even formed the basis for technology that we use every day.The way science works is that we form mathematical models of physical behaviour, we test model against real world data, and if the model is consistent with reality, and predicts further behaviours that we then can test for, the theory behind it holds water and we have something to work from.If you like, you can think of it as building trust in a model, having courage in a theory isn&#x27;t a mistake, it&#x27;s how science has been built. Of course finding the errors and new laws is important, but you have to conclusively rule out the established theory first.This is how we got to Newtonian mechanics instead of firmaments, elements, worlds of forms and mythologies, and how we got to medicine instead of humours, phlegms, biles and alchemy.Adding mass that can&#x27;t be seen preserves the body of theory of the standard model and doesn&#x27;t raise any questions of why GR&#x2F;QM work correctly for things like GPS etc.In other words, dark matter is an answer that doesn&#x27;t require going backwards.Saying that gravity behaves differently to what we previously thought means that the standard model is only coincidentally right or only right in particular places, and from there where does the scepticism end? Where do you even start unravelling the tapestry?Think about it in a diagnostic analogy. If your patient is critically ill, and you don&#x27;t know why, you will prioritise testing for conditions that fit the symptoms and can actually be treated&#x2F;cured. Because if it isn&#x27;t treatable, the truth of what caused it isn&#x27;t that important.Occam&#x27;s Razor as an argument against dark matter, but saying that gravity behaves differently — when our theories do not otherwise predict that it should behave differently — is actually less simple than saying there is more mass than can be detected via EM interaction.The other point I would make is that dark matter can explain most if not all of the otherwise problematic observations, which makes it preferable over modifying the laws of physics, because as I understand it, doing this doesn&#x27;t account for all of the problematic observations.Again with an analogy to medicine, it is less likely to be three unrelated, coincidental conditions in one patient than a single condition if both diagnoses explain the same symptoms.To frame everything I&#x27;ve said in a medical analogy, we have essentially treated for the condition we think it is, and we&#x27;re trying to figure out why the condition has presented differently to typical cases, rather than ruling out the diagnosis and saying it is something else entirely — because the treatment is working. That is, the empirical evidence we have suggests that our diagnosis is correct, but we don&#x27;t know everything there is to know about the condition.Our GPS works, gravitational lensing has been observed, gravitational waves have been detected, we power our homes with nuclear reactors, we calibrate our most accurate clocks based on quantum mechanics, and so on. Particles we then predicted would exist have since been detected.The patient had a fever. We treated the patient with antibiotics, and they got better, so we have reason to believe it&#x27;s a bacterial infection — we just can&#x27;t see the bacteria in the blood work. So the next logical step is to think of what presents and responds like a bacterial infection but isn&#x27;t bacterial, or otherwise speculate that we have discovered something that does this, rather than question whether we understand the human body or whether thermometers work.If in trying to confirm this discovery, we find that actually we don&#x27;t really understand the human body or that our instruments are broken, that&#x27;s when we should start looking to re-assess the laws of physics.The standard model has no useful purpose if we don&#x27;t place some trust in it to find new things. If we threw out our scientific models every time we encountered something we weren&#x27;t expecting, we wouldn&#x27;t make any progress at all.The only reason dark matter raises so many eyebrows is (a) the popular press just loves to pick at it because it&#x27;s an easy target with great headlining when your scientists are saying the majority of the universe is \"missing\"; and (b) because the breakthroughs of today are framed as being incremental compared to the big eureka moments of the 19th and 20th centuries which saw us leap from Newtonian mechanics to GR and QM. But between Newton and Einstein et al, there were centuries of incremental refinements&#x2F;improvements on Newtonian mechanics and early modern astronomy, so why is there such impatience because we haven&#x27;t found dark matter in barely a hundred years?By definition, dark matter is going to be hard to detect because the only means of detecting it is merely enough to suppose that it exists, i.e. it interacts gravitationally but not electromagnetically, so we can only detect its gravitational influence on celestial bodies. Of course, it&#x27;s the odd behaviour of celestial bodies that led us to suspect that dark matter was a thing in the first place, so this isn&#x27;t very helpful.I should think that, in order to prove dark matter exists, we shall have to imagine an edge case of what an extreme concentration of dark matter would do to nearby celestial matter and how that might be distinguished from conventional phenomena. Easier said than done, the universe is full of bizarre phenomena, much of which can be explained by GR and QM, and any remainders probably defy any remotely intuitive reasoning.Alternatively, we shall have to imagine what phenomena might occur in situations where dark matter is absent, and where something can be modelled mathematically as being conclusively due to a lack of dark matter i.e. if gravity were to be different to Newtonian&#x2F;GR, the phenomenon would never be seen, we can then say with confidence that dark matter is real.To confirm it beyond any useful doubt, I suppose we would need to create conditions under which dark matter would form and observe the phenomena that occur, or build some kind of instrument that can detect gravitationally as accurately as we can detect electromagnetically. Again, easier said than done, EM force has a fundamental particle that we know very well, while gravity ... well the jury&#x27;s still out on that. The graviton even if it were a thing would not be a particle in the same way, you can&#x27;t have a quanta of gravity, when gravity is more of an emergent property of the geometry of spacetime? You can do the math as though it has a force carrier, but this isn&#x27;t something that you expect to be able to manipulate as a particle in application.Anyway, I&#x27;m away on a pretty hefty tangent now. The point is that it&#x27;s more constructive to suppose that there is dark matter, since alternative theories (a) also include dark matter, to a lesser extent and (b) do not account for the observed behaviours without in some ways failing to predict behaviours we know and understand with known physics. reply nobodyandproud 17 hours agorootparent> in that adding more mass accounts for the observed behaviours without changing the known laws of physicsI disagree with statement in that I feel this is an incorrect interpretation of what transpired with physics.Classical physics, modified and tweaked over the centuries, worked well and it’s still valid for the domains where it was already conceived and tested for.The cracks in the model formed when we pushed experimental boundaries.Very high speed and extremely tiny were both new, but most (all?) of the vetted modern models will simplify down to classical physics when in every day conditions.The new boundary condition is galactic scale mass and distance but with mostly (?) non-relativistic speeds and probably subtle GR gravity conditions.MOND? Darkmatter? It’s good science explore all avenues, not shutdown a discussion until conclusive evidence and lack of rebuttal shows otherwise.Otherwise it’s not science. These days, I’ve started to suspect that it’s not scientists that have such a black and white view and certainty. reply wanda 17 hours agorootparent> It’s good science explore all avenues, not shutdown a discussion until conclusive evidence and lack of rebuttal shows otherwise.I couldn&#x27;t agree more. I don&#x27;t think anyone should claim to be certain about any of our understanding of the universe. I just say that it isn&#x27;t very useful to think that way, we make more progress if we have the courage to trust in a theory and dare to be proven wrong, than to go back to the drawing board when we get stuck. reply nobodyandproud 14 hours agorootparentFor uncertain things, as long as the courage extends to all feasible (meaning, not outright disproven like flat-earth…) models then we’re in agreement.What bothers me generally, is how one speculative theory dwarfs others when the scientists themselves will admit that there’s far more wiggle-room.This has implications in funding and brainpower, hindering progress in the long run.Yes, in case someone asks: The contrarian side where alt-theories include the outright disproven is also worrisome; but in HN at least everyone seems pretty bright and attentive to good science; far smarter than yours truly, certainly. reply uoaei 17 hours agorootparentprevThe flaw in this reasoning is ironically a philosophical (epistemological) one: by what authority is it said we \"know\" the laws of physics? We \"believe\" theories, even go so far as to sometimes call them \"laws\", but as we&#x27;ve seen with Newtonian interpretations (the \"law\" of gravity) they can obviously be superceded by more elegant, positive (not merely deductive) theories, i.e., general relativity. Who is to say our current understanding is the correct or best one? Granted, it&#x27;s a good place to start for the experimentalists, but for some reason theoreticians have also drank the Kool-aid rather than honestly examining the other proposed theories.> The known laws of physics have been formed on math that checks out and is consistent with all our other observationsYou will of course note that \"all the other observations\" conveniently reside in the limit of high-mass-density regions of spacetime, where other theories also expect the current best theories of physics to hold. Where the confusion still lies is in the low-mass-density regions. At least other theories posit some explanation besides \"there&#x27;s still mass it just exists in other dimensions\". Sounds like sci-fi crackpottery when put so plainly, but I&#x27;m sorry to say this characterization is accurate enough for our needs here.> where does the scepticism end?Strange application of slippery slope fallacy. It obviously ends where the theories still hold, i.e., high-mass-density regions. This is IMO enough of a response to most of your \"philosophical\" arguments.No one&#x27;s denying that particles exist. I&#x27;m only arguing for a theory that actually posits something besides \"oops there&#x27;s a gap\". You&#x27;ve articulated a reason why dark matter is offered but it is nothing more than a deduction about where matter would be should it exist. I swear I&#x27;m going to have to spin up some cycles on the cluster to fit dark matter models on a geocentric universe to get you people to understand the non-reality of any dark matter paper.Gosh I love being mansplained on this site by people who obviously have no personal experience with this stuff. Really gets me going.Edit to reply to your edit:> when gravity is more of an emergent property of the geometry of spacetime?Emergent gravity and dark matter are incompatible theories in their usual forms, though there&#x27;s probably ways to mash them together into a chimera. I suggest reading more into emergent gravity -- entropic gravity is interesting but still in its early stages.

It often feels like commenters want to cosplay intelligence and see how far they can get -- in other words, there&#x27;s a lot of bullshitters on this website.If others cannot judge an argument on its merits, that is not really something I can control. I understand your point about rhetoric re: persuasion I&#x27;m just resistant to playing civility games in what should be a facts-based discussion.I acknowledge I am impatient with those who refuse to offer good faith responses. In my opinion such good faith would mean engaging with the facts of the matter not running through a phil.sci. 101 lecture, however sincerely.Thanks for your engagement. Your point about third parties is a good one, one I keep forgetting and re-learning. reply wanda 16 hours agorootparentIt was not my intention to trigger anyone. I only wanted to say why dark matter is given the time of day. If I came across as condescending or as a know-it-all, I apologise, it was not what I wanted at all.I also must apologise for my use of the term \"emergent property\" regarding gravity — judging by your response, I seem to have alluded (unintentionally) to a whole other theory of gravity; I only wanted to say that gravity itself is the curvature of the geometry of spacetime rather than a force in the conventional way it is described.Also, regarding alternatives still requiring dark matter, it is my understanding that MOND and its derivatives explain galaxy rotation curves but not other phenomena that dark matter is purported to resolve (galaxy cluster formation&#x2F;structure, gravitational lensing, CMB). If I am wrong about this, I would welcome correction. On the other hand, if your comment simply meant that there are alternatives to DM and MOND that require no DM, fair enough, I should have been clearer and said that some of the foremost competitor theories still require DM.But I stress again, I am not fighting DM&#x27;s corner or saying that alternatives are wrong. My stance on it is irrelevant, and I have no more belief in it than any other explanation, belief is irrelevant and doesn&#x27;t enter into the matter. I was just saying that I understand why a theory that inflates mass arbitrarily, and understandably ruffles some feathers as a result, is given any credence at all.Personally, I understand your frustration with DM, it does not seem like very good science to let unexpected or inexplicable observations make us simply add parameters without making further predictions to test if that&#x27;s the right thing to do. Does seem like we&#x27;re manipulating facts to fit the theory where we should be altering the theory to fit the facts.Since DM is a substance that, for all intents and purposes, defies detection by any means at our disposal, it makes no further predictions, it just lets us push the square block into the round hole — what we should be doing is finding the square hole. reply nyssos 3 hours agorootparent> Since DM is a substance that, for all intents and purposes, defies detection by any means at our disposal, it makes no further predictionsThis is completely untrue. All serious dark matter candidates are observable. For example:- MACHOs should show up in gravitational lensing surveys. We did the surveys, they didn&#x27;t, MACHOs were rejected. Exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to work.- Axions convert to photons in sufficiently intense magnetic fields. ADMX has ruled out part of the parameter space for axions and is undergoing upgrades to test the rest of it.- Other WIMPs still interact via the weak force, and therefore with nucleons. There are many experiments looking for WIMP scattering. A few of them have gotten signals but not enough to be convincing.Dark matter candidates are not just \"mass with no further properties\" sitting out there to make the model fit. They&#x27;re proposed extensions to the standard model (which is nothing but proposed extensions to quantum electrodynamics which ended up working out), and therefore very tightly constrained by the standards of any other scientific field. reply wanda 17 hours agorootparentprevAt no point did I say the laws of physics are beyond question or doubt, and neither did I say dark matter is correct.I just said it makes more sense to give DM priority because what is the point of having a model if you don&#x27;t start from it.Also why are you being so hostile towards me exactly? I didn&#x27;t express any love for dark matter or the standard model, and I am not a fan of perpetuating a status quo or any form of academic dogma.All I said, quite unsuccessfully it would seem, is why people think its likely for dark matter to be there — because if you add in \"invisible\" mass with existing laws of physics, you get something that looks like what we see through our telescopes. I think many would prefer to suppose that there is non-EM-interacting mass (a lot of it apparently), than there being as yet unknown behaviours of gravity&#x2F;spacetime geometry, which we like to think we understand pretty well.Though I agree that we don&#x27;t understand the universe as well as we like to think; and that the universe is not intuitive at all most of the time; and a preference based on how intuitively likely something seems is irrelevant to what the truth will turn out to be.Edit: just FYI, I am not downvoting your responses by the way. I am not bothered if you dislike me or disagree with things I have said, though these two things should be distinct from each other.I&#x27;m nobody and I didn&#x27;t seek to \"mansplain\" anything whatever this term is supposed to mean. I was just talking, always happy to debate, something I thought people came here to do.

It&#x27;s obvious what GP meant. The correct should&#x27;ve been intrinsic property but this is nitpicking. reply raattgift 9 hours agorootparent> interact weakly with gravityIt would be better to rearrange this to \"interact gravitationally, and maybe non-gravitationally at the scale of the weak nuclear force\".In the standard cosmology \\Lambda-CDM, cold dark matter (\"CDM\") is allowed to interact at the scale of the weak nuclear force (wnf), which may allow participation in nuclear interactions. This motivates the search for direct detection in various track and scintillator experiments, where a WIMP (weakly interacting massive particle) could take recoil energy from an atomic nucleus, the latter leaving behind a trail of charged particles and&#x2F;or emitted photons. There are of course other hypothesized interactions between WIMPs and normal matter which do not literally engage the wnf, but instead have some new interaction at no more than the same energy scale (\"weak scale\"). And for completeness, there are CDM models which have stronger but rarer individual interactions which average out to the weak scale (or effective collisionlessness) across volumes comparable to the size of galaxies or galaxy clusters.(In the standard cosmology what matters is that the equation of state for dark matter is 0 or close to it so that expansion dilutes it away like cold baryons; in structure formation and galactic dynamics it&#x27;s more important that most dark matter is in a halo outside the luminous structure. Both are incompatible with decays or collisions which emit relativstic particles (w > ~ 1&#x2F;6 leads to early evaporation of overdensities; galactic dynamics is less tolerant of (non-radiative) clumping and other mechanisms which concentrate&#x2F;gravitationally-collapse halos).> interact ... with gravityIn a system of coordinates that absorbs linear and angular momentum, all matter -- dark or otherwise -- interacts gravitationally in proportion to its mass (or energy-density).In General Relativity, this is the universality of free fall, which descends from Newton&#x27;s Law of Universal Gravitation.Unless we modify or abandon General Relativity, a dark matter particle and an alpha particle occupying the same starting point and having the same initial velocity will follow the same trajectory together forever barring some interaction (examples: intrinsic: one of the particles decays emitting radiation, or there is some weak scale interaction between them that imparts a recoil on one or both of the initial alpha or DM; extrinsic: scattering of a photon off the alpha, or the alpha captures electron(s) imparting a recoil -- a force that shoves the alpha onto a different trajectory, a non-gravitational acceleration). This is the weak equivalence principle (WEP),from a somewhat Fermi-Walker perspective; the \"weak\" in WEP is unrelated to the weak nuclear force.Finally, dark matter and baryonic matter (and all other matter and radiation) interact the same way with the curvature of spacetime. If dark matter and baryons interact non-gravitationally at all, the (averaged) interaction is at no more than the weak scale. \\Lambda-CDM does not require any non-gravitational interaction between CDM and baryons.> so is undetected in low-density regionsDensity of what? reply uoaei 13 hours agorootparentprevBeing able to fit models is very far from being able to say \"it&#x27;s there\", especially the kinds of models that are being fit.

When there’s enough mass, you get a black hole. When there is less, you can get a neutron star: all mass converted to neutrons, as tightly packed as possible. When it rotates, it’s rotation frequency is observable as a train of pulses. A quasar is essentially a galaxy, (long ago and far away), with a supermassive black hole at it’s center. The black hole swallows a lot of mass, causing a lot of high energy radiation, which is how why in the beginning they were mistaken for strange quasi-stars, hence the name. reply denton-scratch 18 hours agorootparent> Pulsars(rotating neutron stars)Thanks.I was going to ask whether the article was using the term \"pulsar\" when \"neutron star\" would have been more accurate; I would have said that a pulsar was a rotating neutron star with a beam that intermittently points at Earth (making the distinction observer-specific).But don&#x27;t essentially all neutron stars spin? I don&#x27;t know how a non-rotating neutron star might form. If that&#x27;s the case, they could have just said \"neutron star\", and I wouldn&#x27;t then have this issue about the subjectivity of what a pulsar is. reply ben_w 17 hours agorootparent> But don&#x27;t essentially all neutron stars spin?Almost certainly, though they do slow down over time. The distinction is indeed observer-specific, which doesn&#x27;t matter yet, but will eventually matter for things like the \"galactic positioning system\" that sometimes gets suggested as a galaxy-wide extension of the current research on pulsar-based_navigation: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pulsar-based_navigation reply superjan 16 hours agorootparentprevThe neutron stars that the article uses to explain the observed antimatter all must spin to cause the radiation observed. They would appear as pulsars to some observer, not necessarily us here on earth. reply pitaj 18 hours agorootparentprevTo be clear, neutron stars and back holes do not contain all of the mass of the star they were created by. Usually they are only created from the core of the star, but the outer layers get blown into space. reply Obscurity4340 18 hours agorootparentprevThanks for edifying me, I appreciate it reply thedudeabides5 16 hours agoprevCouldn&#x27;t it also be there&#x27;s a lot more black holes than we thought? reply ianburrell 16 hours agoparentPrimordial black holes are dark matter candidate. We should see gravitational lensing events; we see more than expected but not enough. Evidence is inconclusive, and it is possible they exist but not all of the dark matter. reply thedudeabides5 13 hours agorootparentAsked ChatGPT, got these answers but not sure I understand, anyone an expert here who can explain how we can estimate the amount of black holes outside of gravitational lensing?\"The distribution of black holes is inferred from their interactions, like accretion of matter and merging events, which emit observable signals. The total lensing exceeds what&#x27;s expected from black holes and visible matter. Moreover, lensing often occurs where no black holes are detected, suggesting another form of mass—dark matter—is responsible. The distribution and amount of lensing provide crucial information that, when combined with other observations, suggests the presence of dark matter.Apologies for the confusion. The distribution of black holes is inferred from observable interactions like accretion and merging events, not primarily from lensing. The lensing exceeding what&#x27;s expected from black holes comes from comparing the total lensing observed to what could be attributed to known black holes plus visible matter. There&#x27;s more lensing than can be accounted for by black holes, hence suggesting dark matter as a probable cause.\" reply tambourine_man 18 hours agoprevI’m always a bit unease to click on content from Big Think.

E.g. what if either mass or light speed were composites of some other variables? Say that light speed really had a directional component or a distance from the Big Bang component? Or mass was itself a composite of particles and the forces acting in the nucleus?Wouldn’t some additional term here be a plausible way of explaining discrepancies in the observable vs predicted universe? reply marcosdumay 18 hours agoparentWe don&#x27;t know anything. If you want to know how we are sure of it, we aren&#x27;t.But the information that light always move on the same speed, on any direction and for every observer has been tested again and again since the end of the 19th century. Nobody ever saw it fail.There is of course a huge number of variables nobody tested yet. And we can&#x27;t know if those are important or not. But we are very logically biased into assuming they aren&#x27;t until we have a real need for them to explain something.(Anyway, the thing you are trying to invent is a kind of modified Newtonian mechanics - even though it&#x27;s not quite Newtonian, but people use that same name. There are other people trying to get a workable theory with similar parameters. Up to now, nobody got any.) reply V__ 18 hours agorootparent> light always move on the same speed, on any direction and for every observer has been tested again and againI might be wrong or misunderstanding, but I think that hasn&#x27;t actually been tested ever.

Can you explain it?But anyway, we&#x27;ve been comparing the speed of light over different directions since the 19th century. Modern relativity was created because of those measurements, and nowadays you can buy accelerometers and gyroscopes that work based on that constant speed. reply bitvoid 18 hours agorootparentIt basically means round-trip tests where the source of light and the detector are the same, and the light reflects back from a mirror. One-way would be having the source send the light to the detector directly, but the problem with testing that way comes down to synchronizing the clocks of the source and detector.I don&#x27;t know anything about this, I just found a Wikipedia page [1]1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;One-way_speed_of_light reply marcosdumay 17 hours agorootparentOh, ok.Yeah, the one thing we tested again and again is that if there is any difference on the speed of light going and coming back, it must average to the same thing in every direction (actually in every circuit, with any number or directional changes).There are some experiments that measure one-way speed even on the link you posted. The first measurement of the speed of light was one-way. Those are just low precision ones. reply j16sdiz 18 hours agorootparentprevWe can measure the speed from A to B back to A.We can’t measure the speed from A to B directly (without sending something from B back to A wrt speed of light).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;One-way_speed_of_light reply ajuc 18 hours agorootparentprev> Can you explain it?Can&#x27;t measure one-way speed of light because you need to get the result back somehow (and that&#x27;s also limited by speed of light). Usually we just send light and wait for it to bounce back. reply j16sdiz 18 hours agorootparentprevThe two way speed are the same along the y axis versus the x axis. We have no ways to measure the one way speed.we can’t falsify it. According to some HN-er, this must be unscientific reply ben_w 17 hours agorootparent> we can’t falsify it. According to some HN-er, this must be unscientificApparently more than merely \"can&#x27;t falsify it\": the maths is such that if it was different, there would never be any observation that could distinguish between them.That extra step — that it genuinely makes no difference — would, I think, cause it to be unscientific.At least, unscientific within relativity; given relativity can&#x27;t be the whole picture (singularities popping out of maths that presumes spacetime is differentiable), we may well find another better model that would allow us to make the test, which in turn allows us to ask the question scientifically.That said, after watching the Veritasium video ages ago, I was immediately asking myself: what about the CMB? Surely that would have a stonking big anisotropy if the speed of light wasn&#x27;t close to the same in all directions? (It does have one which is assumed to be because of our motion relative to it, and I don&#x27;t know enough to guess what to expect of a different-way-speed-of-light-anisotropy other than its existence, and therefore cannot compare and contrast with the observed one). reply nyssos 5 hours agorootparent> I was immediately asking myself: what about the CMB? Surely that would have a stonking big anisotropy if the speed of light wasn&#x27;t close to the same in all directions?No, you can always cancel it out by making the whole rest of physics suitably anisotropic too.

It really shows you just how pretty that equation really is! reply lamontcg 17 hours agorootparentprevthe m in that equation is the rest mass (m_0) which is a proper scalar.the m in E=mc^2 is the relativistic mass which depends on rest frame and therefore isn&#x27;t a proper scalar quantity and that isn&#x27;t a proper tensor equation.the (E, px, py, pz) energy-momentum 4-vector is a tensor that transforms to any reference frame with a lorentz transform. all observers will agree on the shape of that 4-vector object, although they&#x27;ll measure the components differently. that equation is just the dot product (rearranged), where the rest mass is the length of the 4-momentum vector (and a proper scalar quantity that all observers agree on is exactly that value in all reference frames). the rearrangement introduces a negative sign which actually comes from the SR metric -- usually diag(-1, +1, +1, +1) but sometimes diag(+1, -1, -1, -1). reply simonh 19 hours agoparentprevDistance from the Big Bang? So zero then.But even if say energy or the speed of light are derived from other parameters, that doesn’t make the equation wrong, just incomplete.

Some get nearly 5,000 in 24 hours. What does that do to their brains? Kids and teenagers are online — usually engaged with social media — during the school day and at night, when they should be asleep.Justine Goode; NBC News / Getty Images SAVE Create your free profile or log in to save this article Sept. 26, 2023, 5:02 AM PDT By Erika Edwards and Kate Snow Fourteen-year-old Armita Mojazza is a huge Harry Styles fan, and TikTok knows it. Videos of Styles are \"pretty much always\" showing up as Armita scrolls through the platform, she said — \"the feed obviously adjusts to your interests.\" Those videos, combined with notifications from Snapchat and other social media outlets, lure Armita, of White Plains, New York, into up to five hours of screen time on weekdays and at least eight hours on weekends, she said. Her mother, Shahrzad Mojazza, said she was shocked to learn how much time her daughter spends online. \"I feel like I'm waking up to this news,\" she said. A new report about kids and their smartphone use may offer other parents a warning: Children like Armita are inundated with hundreds of pings and prompts on their phones all day and all night — even when they should be paying attention in class or getting a good night's rest. It's a \"constant buzzing,\" said Jim Steyer, the founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, a group that studies the impact of media and technology on kids and families. \"They literally wake up and before they go to the bathroom, they're on their phone.\" New research Common Sense Media released Tuesday finds about half of 11- to 17-year-olds get at least 237 notifications on their phones every day. About 25% of them pop up during the school day, and 5% show up at night. In some cases, they get nearly 5,000 notifications in 24 hours. The pop-ups are almost always linked to alerts from friends on social media. Armita Mojazza, seen here with her mother, Shahrzad, in Paris this past summer, says she spends hours every day on her phone.Courtesy of Mojazza Family \"They're constantly forced to respond socially on Snapchat or TikTok or whatever to their friends,\" Steyer said. \"It's a dominant factor in all of their personal lives.\" Dr. Benjamin Maxwell, the interim director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego, said he is \"immensely concerned\" by the findings. Such a \"highly stimulating environment\" may affect kids' \"cognitive ability, attention span and memory during a time when their brains are still developing,” Maxwell said. “What are the long-term consequences? I don't think we know.\" Maxwell was not involved with the Common Sense report. The study is based on surveys of 203 young people ages 11 through 17. The subjects also agreed to install an app on their phones for nine days so researchers could track their smartphone use. The app provided time-stamped data about which apps were running and when, as well as the numbers of notifications that popped up. The social media apps tracked in the survey included TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and Discord. Fifty-nine percent of kids were online from midnight to 5 a.m. While some were engaging with social media, many were listening to music or white noise to wind down and get to sleep. The vast majority — 97% — were on their phones during typical school hours. While prompts from smartphones could distract kids from paying attention in class, the report's authors did not suggest that schools should crack down on smartphone use or ban it altogether. Recommended ABORTION RIGHTS Pregnant with no OB-GYNs around: In Idaho, maternity care became a casualty of its abortion ban HEALTH NEWS Short bursts of activity, totaling less than 10 minutes, linked to lower risk of death \"This raises some questions about how schools can work with young people to help them have some control over their phone use,\" said the report’s lead researcher, Dr. Jenny Radesky, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. Many kids said they used their phones to communicate with parents during the school day. Others reported that time on their phones provided them with a way to \"disengage when their brain needed a rest,\" Radesky said. \"School feels hard and stressful for a lot of kids. The phone is one way that they give their brain a break.\" But the Common Sense study also found that many try to control their online activity by using the \"do not disturb\" settings on their smartphones. \"We definitely heard that as teens got older, they developed more of that sense of planning for when and how they wanted to use their phone,\" Radesky said. They realize that there are times when \"they don't want to feel bombarded with notifications or like their attention to be split.\" Still, the attraction to those notifications is irresistible to many teens, like Armita Mojazza. She sets limits on her screen time but admitted she reaches that limit \"all the freaking time.\" Steyer blames the business model of social media platforms like TikTok. Their goal \"is to keep you on the platform so they can sell you ads,\" he said. \"It's really an arms race for your attention.\" NBC News asked the four companies that own the most popular social media outlets highlighted in it about the new report. TikTok said it sets a 60-minute daily screen time limit on teen accounts and disables push notifications at night. It also pointed parents to \"TikTok's Family Pairing tools to further customize screen time, notifications, and other settings for their teens' account.\" Snapchat said users have to opt in for notifications and can adjust the number they receive. A statement from Discord highlighted its Family Center, a tool that gives parents \"greater visibility into the interactions and activities of their teens.\" A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said in an email that the company has \"created a number of tools specifically designed to help teens limit their time and minimize notifications, like Quiet Mode and Take a Break on Instagram, as well as supervision features that let parents set scheduled breaks when their teens can't use the app.\" How parents can ask about social media The experts at Common Sense suggest specific questions parents can ask their kids to learn more about their smartphone use: What is your favorite app right now? Who are your favorite people to follow on social media? Can you teach me how to use Snapchat (or another social media platform)? Steyer, a father of four, urges parents to remain nonjudgmental during such conversations and to be open about how much of their own time and attention they spend online and with social media apps. He also recommends reserving threats to take a child's phone away as punishment to extreme circumstances only. \"Even though as a parent I have done that many times,\" Steyer said, children may not be as open about what they do online if they are constantly afraid of losing their phones. \"Kids have this extraordinary experience of childhood and adolescence that we did not have, but we can really help them through this,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, it's good, old-fashioned, commonsense parenting that makes the difference.\" Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

Not for telling me about their new features or some crappy partner deal.For this reason I have a one strike policy for apps. One marketing notification and permissions are revoked. Missing out on surprisingly little although it has made me stop using some services entirely. reply donmcronald 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s exactly what I do!Google and Apple could instantly fix the problem (of co-mingling essential and marketing notifications) if they wanted to. The current situation is like getting opted in to \"street signs and flashing billboards\". It&#x27;s stupid. reply FridgeSeal 11 hours agorootparentI have an iOS device, so can’t speak for Google, but I suspect that’s what Apple has been _trying_ to do.The problem is that these apps are essentially adversarial in their notifications. If you have a mechanism for “only the most essential notifications”, then they simply mark all their notifications as “essential” (looking at you Uber). Try to limit their notifications using “only is summary” or disabling them and the app will gleefully deny you all notifications, rendering it basically useless. Uber is particular is guilty for this - the app is conspicuously free of meaningful notification controls. reply Keirmot 1 hour agorootparentWell, Apple is trying a &#x27;do as I say, not as I do&#x27; approach, which isn&#x27;t exactly working.For example I got an Apple Music notification the other day telling me how awesome the new Classic Music App is, or how the new season of whatever show is available in Apple TV+ is just fresh out of the oven.I like their products, and even their services, but in this particular case, they&#x27;re as bad as Uber, just at a different degree (I used to get an Uber Eats notification everyday until I uninstalled the app) reply saganus 6 hours agorootparentprevI use Glasswire (Android) and block apps from accesing the internet, when not using them (e.g. Uber).It&#x27;s a bit of pain to turn it on before use, and off again afterwards, but I&#x27;ve realized it&#x27;s much less stressful than having notifications popping up at all times.YMMV reply photonbeam 4 hours agorootparentAs someone who hasn’t used android in 10 years, what you are describing seems like a warzone reply saiya-jin 2 hours agorootparentDepends what apps you use and notification settings, ie I don&#x27;t have any uber app and my notifications are clean, just what I need. reply astrange 1 hour agorootparentprevThat wouldn&#x27;t stop iOS notifications; those are pushed from Uber&#x27;s servers to the phone, not to the app. reply ClumsyPilot 2 hours agorootparentprev> then they simply mark all their notifications as “essential\"That&#x27;s like getting spam mail from your bank.

No, of course they don&#x27;t do any such thing.

Where users should then be able to configure the notification policies on each of an app&#x27;s delivery channels separately.Then, every type of notification an app can send (i.e. every string-template for a notification message) could be required to be pre-classified with the delivery channel it will use at app version release time — with the App Store review team rejecting app updates if the update, in their opinion, misclassifies the \"proper\" delivery channel for a given message-template. reply sznio 1 hour agorootparentIn the EU we had the option to opt out of marketing messaging when signing up for services for a long time.

The notifications will be there in the morning.When I’m driving I can only receive phone calls from my wife.This is a whitelist, not a blacklist. I have to consciously decide to receive notifications from something and when I want to receive them.The focuses turn themselves on and off throughout the week without me doing anything.If I’m expecting something (e.g., scheduled telehealth call), I’ll just turn focus off around the time I need to receive the notifications and deal with the firehose until it’s done.

It would be something Apple and Google would need to constantly monitor — at any time a VC could ask their investees to turn the screws on monetization&#x2F;engagement and an app could become a spam machine overnight.Something better would be something like a non-removable option to report individual notifications from any app as spam, kinda like how it works will email.

Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve noticed a trend where apps are becoming less cooperative. Many apps will have a single all-or-nothing notification setting. Others have dozens of vague, poorly-labelled categories. And all of this is hidden several clicks deep in configuration settings. The result is that we can&#x27;t be sure which notifications to allow because they are important (your food is here, your credit card has a security alert) and which are just marketing bullshit, which is almost all of them.I&#x27;d like to see a regulation requiring all notifications to be opt-in at app installation, with appropriate separation of notification categories, thereby putting the onus on the company to tell us why we should let them have our attention in each specific way.I also think it&#x27;s vital to have our phones silenced (including vibration) for nearly all notifications all of the time.

The more fine grained authorization system problem resulted in less interactions. A lot of applications have too many incentives to keep you engaged as long as possible.I think apple has a nice setting where you can disable all notifications after a certain time slot in the evening. But this only works in the evenings, during the day they can still spam all day long.At this point i cannot trust application developers anymore so we probably need an additional layer between the application and the OS to filter the notifications. If applications do not want to give you fine grained permissions. All you can do is give the application the permission and then have an additional layer filter the notifications with some kind of firewall rule. reply standardUser 14 hours agorootparentA notification management system sounds like something that needs to exist, but how would it work if companies don&#x27;t adhere to standards?

There are three causes of this:1) He&#x27;s dumb. Will click and install on any crap he comes by.2) He doesn&#x27;t know to operate his phone. Every now and then I take his phone and turn off notifications for the apps I saw that popped them.#3: This one&#x27;s mysterious to me as well. Somehow they (the notifications) get re-enabled back. I&#x27;m disabling notifications (to the best of my knowledge, navigating arcane settings paths), they disappear for some time then after a while, start popping again. No app ever asked me \"I noticed you turned off notifications ... ahem, do you want them turned back on?\". No, they just turn it back automatically ... when I navigate back to the arcane settings path hidden under some 3 to 7 unintuitive menu layers.. the setting&#x27;s back on. Think \"Settings .. Privacy protection .. special permissions ... notification access\" ... each of these steps hidden among 10 to 20 other menu options. What chances does a kid have to fight this crap?I dunno, just using the apps seems to enable them after a while. And it&#x27;s not just \"Malware Disguised As Game XYZ\". YouTube, Netflix, Facebook... all these bounce back, on my phone as well. Just seems that not so often as on my kid&#x27;s and also I disable them back promptly when it happens so it&#x27;s a manageable level of annoyance.My kid&#x27;s phone though ...

Yes, the tech is bad, but there&#x27;s no reason why your kid should be subjected to the full weight of its awfulness besides that you let him.Step one is to question whether a smartphone is even necessary at this age. I understand feeling the need to have them be able to reach you, and pay phones and school landlines are less accessible than they once were. But why a smartphone? Peer pressure is not a good enough answer.If there is a compelling reason for a smartphone (like the other commenter whose school bus system inexplicably requires kids to have an app) then iOS has pretty robust parental controls from what I understand, but I personally would go further and buy an Android phone and install even stronger controls. There are FOSS Android apps that allow you to block everything except for a few whitelisted apps, and there are others that can impose time limits.A pretty simple combination of apps can create an experience that is suitable to any age, gradually enabling more functionality as you trust him more. We&#x27;ve even done this with our 4-year-old and an old tablet, giving him access to Khan Academy Kids with a time limit. reply kQq9oHeAz6wLLS 10 hours agorootparentThere are companies out there like Gabb that specifically make phones for kids with comprehensive parental controls. You can even get them just a watch that lets them call and text approved contacts, if that&#x27;s all you need it for. reply sznio 1 hour agoparentprev> I call him and he doesn&#x27;t reply. Why? Coze he turns the sound volume off, just so he can have some peace of mind. Otherwise it&#x27;s \"ping ping ping ping\", relentlessly throughout the day and night.Same for me. I usually call people back after an hour or two when I check my phone. I fucking wish Android had an option to disable ALL notifications BUT all calls. reply j-krieger 15 hours agoparentprevNumber 3 isn&#x27;t a mystery after all, if you consider that some apps will tie features to notifications or re-prompt reply graypegg 15 hours agorootparentThis is very true. The simple explanation is your son is turning them back on without noticing. Uber Eats is the example I can think of, where in order to get notifications about arrival, you need to enable ALL notifications, including its spam ones.

IPhones (and android too iirc) also have a robust screen time system we use for our kids. Problem is that Apple doesn&#x27;t make it very easy to use if you&#x27;re not familiar with tech... and I&#x27;ve seen several frustrating UX&#x2F;sync bugs with it. Could be a lot better, but it&#x27;s there - especially important to limit them charging in-game purchases to your card without prompting for approval. reply saiya-jin 46 minutes agorootparentA radical idea - maybe kids, if they really have to have a smart phone, should not have any credit card stored in it?

We&#x27;re of a pretty similar age; I also only got a smart phone in high school.I really do think the expectations from your friends when you&#x27;re in your early teens in the current year, is that you have a smart phone. It&#x27;s probably a major part of social life now, which would leave a kid pretty excluded. Not even touching the things in life that REQUIRE a smart phone now. (Restaurant menus, transit, maps, etc)Our childhood is pretty much gone from existence, despite how modern it feels.

By that I mean we can coordinate with friends and friends parents for our children, which is just a good practice anyway.Call me a helicopter parent if you&#x27;d like, but we&#x27;ve found that our kids have strong friend support groups, and all the parents are now friends as well (or at least friendly), thus creating a healthy sort of community. reply sergiomattei 14 hours agorootparentprevI list my birth year on my socials? Time to take that off, that’s unintentional. :PBut yes, I feel your sentiment is right. Although there has to be some moderation—I wouldn’t expose my children to the excess of social media. Internet addiction has messed enough with my life, the last thing I’d like to do is pass that on. reply theshrike79 2 hours agorootparentprevMy kid got a smart phone at age 7 when they started school.It&#x27;s still mostly in their backpack and they regularly miss calls and messages from friends because it&#x27;s always on mute and still in the school bag even though it&#x27;s already evening =)You need to normalise these things and teach how to manage it from an early age.Like screen time is a completely normal thing in our family, it has been activated since the second they got the phone. Every app category has a specific daily screen time - the only ones with no limits are communication tools and educational apps. reply aidos 14 hours agorootparentprevI don’t know how long ago that was so it’s hard to say “things are different now”, but my 11 year old can’t take the school bus without having a mobile app for her ticket. reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparentHow is that even legal? School buses are provided in part as a service to low-income families. Who decided it was okay to require parents of middle schoolers to shell out for a smart phone for their kids? reply aidos 14 hours agorootparentAs far as I can tell, someone has “digitised” the local buses by adding tracking and cashless payments to go along with the mobile app.They’ve also fragmented the services even more in the process since each bus company has their own version of the app (it’s just a skinning of the base app). It means I need to check back and forth between two apps to see which buses are on time. Naturally you can only buy a pass that only works on one bus route. The ux is pretty garbage.Dealing with public transport in rural England definitely made me appreciate the seamlessness of transport in London. reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparentOh, I was assuming a US-style school bus system where a separate yellow bus goes around and picks up the kids. It sounds like your kid rides a regular public transit bus to get to school? It&#x27;s still unfair to have that system be inaccessible without a smartphone, but it&#x27;s not as completely incomprehensible.It sounds like they definitely need better UX, and the buses around here very much accept cash still (or special tokens if you buy ahead). reply aidos 14 hours agorootparentThe one that she takes in particular is a school bus, in a weird kind of way.

Approached the counter, pulled out a $5 bill, and the guy said &#x27;oh we&#x27;re not taking cash&#x27; and waved at the terminal. It would have been just as easy to whip out my card, but instead I said &#x27;I don&#x27;t shop at stores that don&#x27;t handle cash&#x27; and put the drink back (though with hindsight I should have left it on the counter, or left the $5 and walked out with my drink, giving up the change).This was rude behavior on my part.

Crossing multiple busy streets and the sad excuse suburbanites call “boulevards”. Suburban neighborhoods are often the worst as far as safety is concerned. Drivers don’t give af about pedestrians. Sidewalks non-existent or abruptly end.Biking may reduce the travel time but still sharing those roads with highly irritable commuters finishing their 45-60 minute commute from hell. Bike infra in the suburbs? Paint up the road, add a sign indicating it’s a “shared lane” and that passes as “bike infrastructure” in some of these neighborhoods.Unfortunately, this is not something new. It has been going on for decades. Want to know why the kid in the 90s-00s spent most of their time at home playing video games? That’s because it was the only thing to do in a suburban setting. reply 64 more comments... Applications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "A Smart Bear » Never say “no,” but rarely say “yes.” All Articles Author April 25, 2011 Reading time: 7 min Printable PDF Never say “no,” but rarely say “yes.” ☞ Please consider disabling \"reader-mode\" — this site has no ads nor Google tracking, but does have dark-mode and intentional typesetting and imagery. ☜ “Focus” requires saying “no” to most things, but there’s a way to do it that allows you to say “yes” exactly when it matters most. source Everyone says small startups require focus. Say “no” to anything that distracts from your goal, your vision, your strategy, tempting though it is to explore all opportunities, hoping each time that this is the one that will catapult you to “success” (whatever that is). Lack of focus results in half-assed initiatives, each interrupted by apparently greener pastures before you’ve invested the time and devotion it deserves. Learn to say “no!” Ah, but then again you must also experiment with new ideas. Fail fast! Pivot! Test! Doubt! Always be collecting evidence that you’re wrong, always be trying new things in case you’ve been blind. Never pass up an opportunity to change, learn, grow. So… how are you supposed to explore other ideas if you’re also supposed to be saying “no” to anything that diverges from The Plan? Here’s what I do: I never say “no.” But I carefully qualify “yes.” I learned this trick in high school. In the mid ’90s it was clear that Apple had lost the personal computer battle and all their developers were fleeing like rats off a sinking ship into the ocean of opportunity that was Windows 95. As a maven of the Macintosh API and still willing to admit it, I landed small contracting jobs fixing up code that other developers wouldn’t touch. My typical rate was $25 per hour, which feels like a lot of money when you’re 17 in the ’90s. One day I got a call from some poor schleps I didn’t want to help. They had just completed a new product written in Java and it was broken on a Mac, and could I help? None of their customers used Macs, so they didn’t think Macs were important, but then it turns out the main investor is keen on seeing the demo on a Mac, and when they tried it, it didn’t work. (Yay investors! Yay supposedly-cross-platform-platforms-that-aren’t-really!) I wanted no part of this. Java was brand new and known to be full of bugs, and anyway I was a C/C++ kind of guy, and I didn’t want to get involved in an academic fad language like Java1. 1 So yeah, I simultaneously decided that (1) Java is a fad and (2) I’m sticking with the Macintosh Toolkit; five years later one those platforms had zero developers and the other had one million, and I picked exactly wrong. Predicting the future is hard. I could have said “no.” Given my specialty and my goals, traditional career (or startup) theory says I should have said “no.” But instead, on the advice of an older, wiser friend, I showed up at their office and said I’d do it for $100 per hour. I fully expected them to laugh in my face. Maybe I would receive a condescending talking-to about the audacity—nay, the impudence!— of someone of my tender age and meager experience walking in here and demanding such outrageous compensation, someone who, let’s be clear, is technically too young to even enter into a legal consulting agreement in the first place. And then I would have slinked out of there, embarrassed but ultimately no worse for wear. But that’s not what happened. They looked me up and down, their faces painted with both incredulity and surrender. They said OK. An hour and a half later, everything was working. The difference between saying “no” and getting $150 for about two hours of my life was all in how I phrased “yes.” And I have stories that went the other way, which are just as important. At WP Engine, for example, we’re constantly talking to large bloggers who want to move to our system. These are folks with big requirements—tens of millions of monthly page-views, traffic spikes, custom code, perfect up-time, and 24/7 support. Should we take on those clients? Maybe not—after all the stated goal of WP Engine is to serve the “middle market”—the folks who have outgrown free blogs, don’t like maintaining their own servers, but aren’t so large that they have extreme hosting demands. That’s our profitable niche2. 2 Editor’s note: This was written about 1 year into WP Engine’s life; in 2023 WP Engine is 13 years old with 200,000 customers, and powers more large WordPress sites than anyone on Earth. This was a great segment to start off with, but we evolved as we scaled. Or so we think. But if we just say “no” to these big bloggers, maybe we’re closing the door on big, important orders. Perhaps the entire company should pivot—maybe it’s easier or more profitable to serve 100 large blogs than 1000 medium ones. But how do we know if we say “no?” Then again, if we say “yes” we might really be screwed. If we can’t provide them the human and technical service they expect, now we’ve hurt a blogger, we get bad press, and we’ve wasted a bunch of time. Or even worse, we hold on for dear life but it’s extremely unprofitable, and now we have this expensive, time-consuming albatross around our necks. So we’ve said “yes” by quoting high enough that we know for certain we will make good money on the deal, so much so that it will partially fund something else we want to do. Maybe that means a big new advertising campaign, or hiring another WordPress expert for our staff. There was one especially large customer where we literally thought of it like this: This deal needs to be big enough to not only make a reasonable profit on the operating expenses, but pay for an entire developer’s salary (assuming bootstrapped, put-in-elbow-grease-for-stock low salary), because we know this new customer will occupy a lot of that person’s time, but all the remaining time we get “for free.” So we’ve given a lot of qualified yeses, and many were rejected. (P.S. Now we’re able to say “yes” to those same bloggers, but that’s because over time we’ve taken on bigger and bigger customers, and now a blogger with 30 million month page-views is something we know we can handle.) At Smart Bear I used this principle yet again. Companies would fly me out to help them implement a peer code review process, which half the time actually meant that “management” wanted me to convince everyone else that code review was a good idea, and invent a process painless enough that they might actually do it. From a business perspective, this was a poor use of my time. These folks had already bought our software, so it didn’t sell more seats. When you counted a travel day on either side of the engagement, the time I lost could have been spent landing just one additional customer or make some important changes to the code, either of which almost certainly makes us more money. Therefore, initially I just said “no.” But again that’s wrong. Eventually I said “yes,” but the price was $2500/day including travel days, which for these sorts of engagements is unheard of. (Typically you get reimbursed for travel expenses but not paid for that time.) This immediately cut out most trips, but some remained. On those trips I’d haul in $10,000 for a week of easy work, which I’d often combine with a long weekend with my wife. And anyway those people really wanted me there, which made the work that much more enjoyable. So the principle is straightforward: Set the conditions of “yes” such that: If they say “yes,” you’re happy because the terms or money are so good, it more than compensates for the distraction, perhaps funding the thing you really want to do. If they say “no,” you’re happy because it wasn’t a great fit anyway; it’s not a worthwhile return on your time and effort. So that’s the punch-line, but before you leave I’d like to over-emphasize the idea of “funding the thing you really want to do.” This can take many forms, but it’s the single best way of figuring out how to qualify your “yes.” Examples: “Yes” if it pays for an entire additional person. “Yes” if this extends the runway of our startup by at least three months. “Yes” if it completely funds development we’d like to do anyway. “Yes” if it means one of the co-founders can quit her day-job. “Yes” if it will completely pay for three new marketing efforts. Think of it like another form of funding. Funding is always a distraction from actually running your business, so the amount of money you get must be transformative to the business. Each of those bullet points are transformative, in that each has the potential to move your company from “hobby” to “real business.” And if they say “no,” you’re fine with that, because it would have been a distraction which wouldn’t have moved the needle. ☞ If you're enjoying this, please subscribe and share this article! ☜ Subscribe for more, and Thank you for sharing!

For those prices it&#x27;s definitely worth trying to google it first. reply Aurornis 20 hours agoparentprevWhen I look for contractors I ask around my network first.In recent years I’ve been getting more recommendations for who to avoid than who to hire. There are a lot of contractors and small agencies out there who have gotten good at selling the contract but not so good at delivering satisfactory work.Often the negative recommendations are from a situation like you described where they pitched a high price or otherwise played games to charge more and more, then delivered a bare-bones result that barely worked or struggled to deliver anything at all. The gap between the expectations of a high-priced contractor and the reality of a disappointing work product leaves a bad taste.I think a lot of these contractors operate with the mindset that customers will always be available and none of them will talk to each other or seek reference checks, but this approach suffers as the person’s reputation permeates their local industry. There are a few contractors in one niche I worked in where nearly everyone knows to avoid them, or at least to put strict oversight and micromanaging in place on their work and billing. At this point their primary audience is new startups where they can milk them for overpriced work until they catch on. reply creer 16 hours agorootparent> have gotten good at selling the contract but not so good at deliveringThis has been a problem beyond \"recent years\". In part because of splitting the sales function from the technical function - which is many agencies as soon as they decide on growth vs specialization.For clients with a little more time and budget - i.e. a little more forethought in general, it&#x27;s good reason to hire someone more broadly technically competent or at least aware just to help with the process of hiring more specialized work. At least the first time around it can end up being a recursive problem: if you hire a hiring advisor who has their mind locked on just one way to do things, then you just shot yourself in the foot. reply ilyt 17 hours agorootparentprev> I think a lot of these contractors operate with the mindset that customers will always be available and none of them will talk to each other or seek reference checks, but this approach suffers as the person’s reputation permeates their local industry.

In my experience, a more common case is that the buyer has no way to evaluate value other than quoted price and so they&#x27;re actually _much happier_ with a huge price than they would be with a smaller price for the same work. reply Aurornis 20 hours agorootparentYou think they’re happier to pay more than to pay less? I’m having a hard time believing that hypothetical.Regardless, companies that don’t know how to evaluate the value of quoted work will eventually figure out the value later. A client that that is initially happy with a price will likely become retroactively disappointed when they deal with another contractor in the future who has more realistic pricing.In my experience contracting, I’ve encountered a lot of “You paid how much for this!?” situations when dealing with work from prior contractors. Once they realize how bad and&#x2F;or overpriced the work of a prior contractor was, that person’s reputation is done. Ironically, the contractor will often try to use them as references for other clients because they were initially happy. reply bigstrat2003 11 hours agorootparent> You think they’re happier to pay more than to pay less? I’m having a hard time believing that hypothetical.I believe it. Here&#x27;s an anecdote which blew my mind when I saw it as a kid, and which illustrates the point.When I was growing up, we had a guy in our church who made guitars. Beautiful instruments (seriously, look up Petros guitars sometime because they&#x27;re really beautiful), and played&#x2F;sounded good to boot. Bruce was charging between $3000 and $6000 at the time depending on specifics, so while pricey they weren&#x27;t expensive by guitar standards. He told me that he got feedback from customers that they weren&#x27;t sure whether or not his guitars would be good, because they were priced so reasonably (compared to what one would expect to spend on a custom made guitar).So Bruce decided to raise his prices, and see what happened. He said his sales went up after raising prices, presumably because the guitars were now at a price point where people went \"yeah this is what a custom handmade instrument should cost\" rather than \"what&#x27;s the catch here\". Weird, but hard to argue with results. People aren&#x27;t always rational buyers, as someone else pointed out. reply sokoloff 19 hours agorootparentprev> You think they’re happier to pay more than to pay less?People are not rational consumers.See the Palessi story from a few years ago: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;news&#x2F;payless-sold-discount-shoes...Tl;dr: Payless Shoes, a discount shoe retailer, opened a fake high-end store under the Palessi name and got fashion influencers to gush about how great the shoes were. People who actually bought such Palessi shoes probably were happier with them than if they’d bought them at Payless. reply bumby 17 hours agorootparentYears ago, a luxury car company (I believe it was Mercedes) did a study measuring demand with the same car across a relatively wide range of prices. Contrary to economic models that assume rational actors, there was a point where lowering price further made demand go down. People apparently assumed the higher price tag on a car made it more attractive as a consumer. reply SoftTalker 16 hours agorootparentProbably why Mercedes does not bring their lower-end or lower-optioned car models to North America.

Most of those contracts were fabulously profitable. But once in a while a bug would be reported that took five or even ten person-months to fix, scrambling all our other plans in the process. So what: we didn’t charge extra and didn’t complain to the customer. Led to crazy levels of customer loyalty. reply creer 16 hours agorootparentExactly. A high price does not necessarily promise that you have the technical solution ready to go. There is such a thing as building an understanding with the client (even if the contract text itself is more conservative). That leads to a \"relationship\" with some level of solid grounds for it. As opposed to a common practive of throwing a one-off contract over the wall and merely praying that this will go well. reply ozim 14 hours agorootparentUnfortunately this has to be 2 way street, you might want to do it properly but a lot of customers don&#x27;t want to invest time.They want to have stuff done and move on so drop the money and you have to figure out how to do what they want. reply gumby 13 hours agorootparentThose aren’t the customers you want. reply Brian_K_White 13 hours agoparentprevNo one said to LIE.It&#x27;s the opposite.You quote high to inform them honestly what it would take, rather than deciding for yourself what is really their choice not yours. Your choice is to not take a job if you just don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t of course, but is not to tell anyone else what they want or what it&#x27;s worth to them to get it.So as long as you don&#x27;t mind doing the job fundamentally, but it&#x27;s just a matter of resources or time or efficiency etc, (you&#x27;re not being asked to do something you morally object to, or totally unrelated to the kind of work you want to do, or requires something like living on an oil rig for a year etc...) then you have no excuse to do anything but make your best guess at the honest estimate whatever that is however outlandish you think it is, including whatever no-promises cya terms you think should apply, and just tell them that. \"It will be $200k, 4 months minimum, and you might get nothing in the end.\"And part of that is also giving your best honest advice about what they should actually do, and your reasoning. Some other approach that you think is better, or recommendation how to find some other supplier who could do the approach they wanted \"that will require rust and high availability, so you want to look for shops that specialize in rust and high availability...\", whatever.The end result is that they are the ones who decide not to do it rather than you. And if they go for it, well, considering you weren&#x27;t bullshitting them but giving your honest best info, recommendation, and reasoning, you take it and do the job. If that means spending 2 months just learning a new system or language and throwing away a bunch of experiments just to get started, or hiring someone else to do some part you can&#x27;t do, so be it.

Our first child was just born, and I got fired from my job as they discovered I was trying to bootstrap my side-project. There was no non-compete clauses in my contract but the company used it as an excuse to avoid paying me severance as they laid off a quarter of the staff the following week.So there I was, anxious that no one would hire a young developer who has a tarnished work experience with a newborn at home.I was desperate to just find some work. I eventually got two offers with the exact same salary as the job I had gotten fired from. One job sounded more appealing and offered me a chance to learn and grow. The other was for a job to maintain an existing legacy codebase for a struggling company that just went from 100 employees to 10. My wife suggested to just counter-offer with a 50% increase for the unappealing job. If I didn&#x27;t get it, it was no big loss as I had another in hand. Sure enough, they accepted and the job wasn&#x27;t actually that bad in the end.Strangely, when I look back everything turned out in the end for me. I got a 50% pay raise and I also got to spend 3 months at home with my newborn child while unemployed. reply paulsutter 20 hours agoprevFocus means saying no to almost everythingThe hourly rate example is a clear tell.

Make sure you&#x27;re high bar is high enough. Opportunity cost is an underappreciated metric. The exceptional (read: as in a rare exception well above average, mean, etc.) can be addicting, and eventually self-defeating (read: before you know it your temporary digital ditch digger stint gets less stint-y and more permanent-esque). It&#x27;s like a bad-ish romantic relationship that goes on too long. Regrets, and the some.If you&#x27;re going to go this route, be certain to plan your exit. For example, \"The first X weeks are $Y per hour. After that we revisit, if necessary.\" Baking this into the agreement will force you at the end of X weeks to recalibrate the revenue vs the opportunity costs.In fact, for any type of contract work with too many unknowns and&#x2F;or too much possible career friction always include a time limit along with the rate. reply gregw2 22 hours agoparentI think that’s the virtue of setting a high price on what you don’t want to do as your “not saying no”&#x2F;funding strategy.It’s a reflection of your perceived opportunity cost.But you are right to suggest time-bounding your engagement up front to avoid getting stuck in a local maxima.Or, at a certain scale, have a segregated set of people doing these requests where possible to limit and help govern the distraction. reply ghaff 21 hours agorootparentThere are things I don&#x27;t really love doing like ghostwriting company blogs but if the project is short and well-defined (and is something I can actually do a good job of fairly quickly), I&#x27;ll take a few $K from you.

No for the win, so to speak.I&#x27;ve also seen those same agencies start to drink their own Kool Aid. They get in a financial pinch and take on work &#x2F; clients they&#x27;re not tuned for. For example, they don&#x27;t have the in house expertise in the technology &#x2F; solution required.

Just look at the data. BY NICK BLOOM, OPINION CONTRIBUTOR - 09/29/23 10:00 AM ET SHARE TWEET To put a spin on a favorite British saying: I’ve been asked about productivity and working from home more times than I’ve had hot dinners. So it’s time to review all the evidence and serve up one big answer to the question: Does working from home work? In a nutshell, that answer is “yes.” But it’s important to understand why. And this is where the data come in. The numbers paint a picture of small, positive productivity gains for hybrid work. The savings in commuting time more than offset the losses in connectivity from fewer office days. In contrast, the impact of fully remote working on productivity is typically mildly negative. Fully remote workers can struggle with mentoring, innovation and culture building. However, it appears this can be reversed with good management. Running remote teams is hard but done well can deliver strong performance. But this is about more than just worker output. Firms care about profits — not productivity. Working from home massively reduces overhead. It drives down recruitment and retention costs, as employees value working from home. Fully remote companies also slash office costs, and cut wages bills by enabling national or global hiring. Indeed, the widespread adoption of working from home has been a triumph of capitalism. Higher profits have led millions of firms to adopt this, generating the five-fold increase in home working many of us now enjoy. Looking at micro economic studies on working from home productivity, the classic is “The Stanford Study” I helped oversee in 2010-2012. We randomized 250 employees in a large multinational firm into those who would work from home and those who would report to the office. The expectation, of course, was that home-based employees would goof-off, sleeping or watching TV rather than working. So, we were shocked to find a massive 13 percent increase in productivity. The productivity boost came from two sources. First, remote employees worked 9 percent more in minutes per day. They were rarely late to work, spent less time gossiping and chatting with colleagues, and took shorter lunch breaks and fewer sick days. Remote employees also had 4 percent more output per minute. They told us it’s quieter at home. The office was so noisy many of them struggled to concentrate. Other pre-pandemic studies found similar results. For example, Raj Choudhary found US Patent officers gained 4 percent productivity from greater remote flexibility. More recently, a spate of studies has studied the impact of firms moving to fully remote during the pandemic. Papers by Natalia Emanuel and Emma Harrington and by Michael Gibbs and co-authors find large and negative impacts on productivity. Most recently David Atkin and co-authors randomized data entry workers between office and home locations, finding a striking 18 percent drop to productivity from home working. These recent studies highlight major productivity costs from remote working. But they also reflect the importance of good management. Firms that adopted home working at speed in the pandemic often lacked planning, organization and control processes. Remote teams were led by office-based and office-trained managers who provided little support or structure. Remote work is different from office work, and needs managers, software and hardware that can support it. Now for the macro data. Let’s start by celebrating the triumph of the post-2020 U.S. productivity acceleration. In the five years before the pandemic, U.S. labor productivity growth was 1.2 percent; since 2020, this picked up to 1.5 percent. Given the state of the world, that acceleration was miraculous. What could have caused this? Perhaps rising government expenditure and easy monetary policy? Possibly, but greater government activity traditionally is associated with lower, not higher, productivity growth. Perhaps an acceleration in technology and computerization? Possibly, but the pandemic did not witness any pickup in technological progress. Perhaps the five-fold surge in working from home post-pandemic. Maybe cutting billions of commuting hours, replacing millions of business trips with Zoom meetings, increasing the labor supply of Americans with disabilities or child-care commitments, and saving millions of square feet of office space increased productivity? It is honestly hard to say. But we can say just as working from home jumped five-fold, U.S. productivity growth accelerated, reversing decades of pre-pandemic decline. Perhaps the most persuasive data are from the markets. Economists believe firms strive to increase efficiency, profits and growth. Individual firms and managers do make mistakes. But, when millions of firms around the world are adopting hybrid and remote work, there has to be something there. I have spoken to many hundreds of managers and firms over the last three years and I repeatedly hear they use home working as a key part of their recruitment and retention strategy. Indeed, another recent experiment on 1600 employees found hybrid reduced employee quit rates by 35 percent. The work-from-home conversation needs to shift from big-name CEO anecdotes and stories to data and research. When it comes to making decisions impacting millions of employees and firms, we deserve better. The data and research show well-managed work from home can raise and maintain productivity, while cutting costs and raising profits. It keeps employees happy, reduces pollution by cutting billions of commuting miles, and supports millions of employees with care and disability challenges in work. Indeed, what is not to like?

The CEOs push for it, the employers push back, people are looking for new jobs etc. In my particular niche, 70% of jobs are fully remote, and I&#x27;m very happy it is this way. reply 5555624 14 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve became disabled two years ago. My supervisor and I filled out the Reasonable Accommodation paperwork for our EEO and HR offices. At the time, I thought we were filling it out prematurely, since I was not sure what accommodations I&#x27;d need. (And two weeks after losing my leg to Necrotizing Fasciitis and Sepsis, work was not the first thing on my mind.) We did not ask about working from home; but, that was the accommodation they came back with.I had to catch up a lot once I got home from the hospital and rehab; but, since then, I haven&#x27;t missed a beat. It became a major part of my recovery. If I couldn&#x27;t work from home, I&#x27;d be basket case. reply teeray 16 hours agoprevThe problem is that WFH decreases the workforce’s participation in commercial real estate. reply DiggyJohnson 16 hours agoparentI genuinely don’t understand why this perspective is so compelling. CRE is a big deal, but I don’t think companies are so incentivized to optimize CRE value. They’re trying to succeed in their business. reply jedberg 15 hours agorootparentThey don&#x27;t directly care about CRE. But their wealthy friends (and most likely most F500 CEOs) own or are invested in CRE. By convincing all their CEO friends to force RTO, they can boost the CRE. Also some of biggest companies are effectively invested in CRE because they built huge campuses and while those are technically owned by others, they are in super long term leases which require them to have a certain number of people there every day, as well as local tax breaks that they get for having a certain attendance. reply buffington 14 hours agorootparentCan you link to an example of a lease that requires a certain number of people be there every day? I used to have a business that needed office space, and of the several buildings we used over the course of about 10 years, not a single lease ever cared about how many people would show up every day. The closest thing to that would be related to max occupancy and parking spaces. The leases would always have to specify how many people could be in the building at most for fire code compliance, and that number determined the number of accessible and normal parking spaces.Regarding tax breaks, I never saw any, but that was pre-pandemic. That makes more sense to me, but leases requiring minimum attendance counts seems like it could be an oft-repeated myth. reply eli_gottlieb 16 hours agorootparentprevYour average productive firm is not incentivized to optimize CRE value. However, they are often renting commercial real-estate on a fixed-term lease and need to get what value from the remainder of their lease that they can. reply jedberg 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s the sunk cost fallacy. They&#x27;re gonna pay it regardless, it doesn&#x27;t matter if people show up or not. It&#x27;s still cheaper to not have folks show up because then you don&#x27;t have to pay for all the ongoing incidental charges. reply thrtythreeforty 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been hearing this a lot, and I actually think you have the company&#x27;s logic backward. (For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m pro-WFH, and I think a lot of circles don&#x27;t square with the rhetoric from my company regarding RTO, but hear me out.)The lease is locked in. From the company&#x27;s perspective, the building is now free, except for marginal costs per employee that shows up. So the only remaining math for the company to consider is, are the benefits that the company gains from an onsite employee greater than the $2&#x2F;day it costs to provide coffee and toilet paper? Remember, the company is happy to outsource the cost of commuting to employees, and only cares about the value of the building if they own it. And they have great institutional difficulty in weighing intangible employee satisfaction against other perceived gains for the company.Under this logic, I think it&#x27;s easy to see why management, acting in the company&#x27;s best interest, is pushing RTO so hard. If it costs employees $10&#x2F;day but makes the company $3, that&#x27;s free money. reply hn_throwaway_99 7 hours agorootparentSo as soon as the lease is up and needs to be renewed, you&#x27;re proposing exec management is going to be like \"Yeah, you know how we had this major brouhaha forcing everyone to RTO that sometimes it felt like the majority of our internal comms were on this topic? We changed our mind, we&#x27;re all going to WFH from now on.\"The mental gymnastics folks go through to support one side or the other in this debate is just mind boggling to me, especially since their are much simpler and more likely pros&#x2F;cons for both WFH and RTO. reply whateveracct 14 hours agorootparentprevNobody said management is inherently rational. reply bko 13 hours agoparentprevWhat does this mean? This is such a low quality meme. Most businesses don&#x27;t own their buildings. So what&#x27;s the rationale?1. Company leases expensive office2. Realizes that no one has to work from the office anymore so they&#x27;re wasting money on this office3. Inconveniences everyone by making everyone return to the office4. Profit?The lease is a sunk cost. They can try to sublease it out or pay some penalty to get out of it. Even if they owned it, why would they force people to come into the office and not just sell it? If it&#x27;s worthless to them, then again what they paid for it is a sunk cost and they may as well just sell it. And why wouldn&#x27;t they try to greatly expand their application pool to non-local workers if WFH is just as good. It&#x27;s insane.I&#x27;ve never heard a reasonable explanation as to why managers are so invested in commercial real estate prices that they&#x27;ll collectively organize and forsake their interests to keep up the mirage.The more reasonable explanation is that a lot of people work bullshit jobs or can skate by doing very little. These people are harder to control and less visibility by WFH makes it very obvious and managers don&#x27;t feel good about it. reply derefr 10 hours agorootparentI believe the idea is that the same investors that invest in VC firms that in turn invest in companies, also invest in commercial real-estate, and that these investors can apply pressure to \"their\" VC-firm executives, to ensure that \"their\" commercial real-estate is getting used. reply hn_throwaway_99 8 hours agorootparentCome on, let&#x27;s get real. Sure, perhaps this can happen in limited individual instances, but the idea that a major rationale for execs pushing RTO is that they&#x27;re feeling pressure from investors in their VC firms to spend more money to keep the commercial real estate market afloat is just plain silly. Even if I believed it all, it&#x27;s not a conspiracy theory that even makes sense because the incentives it proposes are just dumb - business execs may care about a lot of things and may have to do a lot of juggling, but worrying about the other investments of their VC&#x27;s investors is not exactly high on the list. It&#x27;s like my favorite meme of \"Anyone who believes in conspiracy theories has never been a project manager.\"The RTO&#x2F;WFH debate can be so infuriating because there is so much dishonesty on both sides. Yes, WFH has huge benefits in terms of flexibility, reduced commuting, better supporting those with disabilities, etc., but it also has downsides in terms of less in-person motivation&#x2F;support, loss of in-person mentorship for younger&#x2F;newer employees, worries about building knowledge networks, loss of serendipitous interactions, and more difficulty managing performance for remote workers. Simultaneously, while I can understand the corporate desire for RTO, the reality of the work world has changed, so I see these stories of these execs pushing for RTO, then everyone gets to the office and is on Zoom 80% of the time because their colleagues are spread all over the place.Just wish there could be more of an honest debate about the pros&#x2F;cons of BOTH WFH and RTO, and to see how some&#x2F;either&#x2F;combo may work better for different employees&#x2F;companies, without resorting to silliness like \"business execs are feeling a ton of pressure to save the corp real estate market\". reply CapstanRoller 9 hours agorootparentprevCities give tax breaks to corporations and compete over who gets to host their campuses for a reason. If wealthy tech workers abandon the city, it kills the businesses that they patronize. It also lowers the demand for real estate in the city. reply lusus_naturae 14 hours agoparentprevRepurpose that real estate to housing. reply wenebego 14 hours agorootparentLack of housing is a feature not a bug to the land owning class reply lusus_naturae 13 hours agorootparentBesides the point, though. Land owning class (or any class, really) wants to enrich itself, and renting repurposed housing is a viable option. reply therealdrag0 11 hours agorootparentprevThere are different classes of land owners. Plenty of land owners want to build more housing and are faced with an uphill battle. reply convolvatron 16 hours agoparentprevisn&#x27;t this what the free market is supposed to be about? people don&#x27;t want that product as much anymore. reply yoyohello13 15 hours agorootparentThe free market argument only works when it’s just poor people being impacted. If the rich are losing money then the free market people are suspiciously silent. reply voiper1 17 hours agoprevNOTE: title doesn&#x27;t match the article title.Article title: Does working from home damage productivity? Just look at the data.HN title: WFH significantly increased workforce participation from those with disabilities reply squigz 14 hours agoparentThere is a single mention, in passing, of disabled workers. This is absurdly misleading. reply satvikpendem 15 hours agoparentprevDe-clickbaiting the title is IMO a good thing, it&#x27;s similar to what the YouTube extension DeArrow does, crowdsourcing more accurate and non-clickbait titles and thumbnails. It&#x27;s made by the people who made SponsorBlock and it&#x27;s great. reply some_random 15 hours agorootparentOh wow, I&#x27;ve never seen a paid browser plugin before. It&#x27;s interesting how the idea of paying what to me is a negligible amount of money still changes the way I think about it. reply joveian 14 hours agorootparentprevThe problem here is that the HN title is incorrect for this article. I&#x27;d say a clickbait title matching the submisison is much better than an incorrect title. reply hn_throwaway_99 16 hours agoprevIgnoring the unnecessarily editorialized title, this article is an example of \"lie with statistics\". The are basically arguing \"look at the data\", but every single example I&#x27;ve seen about arguing a data-driven approach to WFH is cherry picking things to fit their desired outcome, and that&#x27;s on both sides of the argument.Yes, it&#x27;s fairly straightforward to look at productivity for rote, repeatable tasks. \"How many calls did a CSR handle?\" or \"How many insurance claims did this person process?\" are easily measurable. But that ignores the fears that business leaders have that, over time, the kind of innovation, motivation and culture that in-person interactions help foster will fade, leading to a sort of slow, long term decline. And the past 25 years have shown that companies that can foster and harness innovation well do much better than companies that simply focus on \"repeatable process improvement\".I&#x27;m certainly not arguing either side is \"right\", but I would say anyone arguing \"look at the data\" on this topic is just using data to match their desired outcome, as there is simply not enough time to assess the long term \"innovation\" impact of WFH. reply smokel 17 hours agoprevIt would be great if we could simply flag an article with the tag \"useless statistics\".What does it even mean to measure a 4% increase in output per minute? Does that include the time spent fiddling with the microphone at the start of a Zoom call?Also, the title on HN does not match the title of the article. reply CharlesW 17 hours agoparent> What does it even mean to measure a 4% increase in output per minute?Based on the context, I read this to mean that the overall 13% increase in productivity isn&#x27;t just explained by remote workers working 9% more minutes. reply xkekjrktllss 17 hours agoparentprevthe boss has entered the chat reply DiggyJohnson 16 hours agorootparentBe kind. Don&#x27;t be snarky. Converse curiously; don&#x27;t cross-examine. Edit out swipes.Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html reply smokel 15 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t really understand your remark. Perhaps you (wrongly) assume that I do not like WFH?Rest assured that it is only the article, the statistics presented, and the title under which it was submitted, that I do not like. reply pierat 17 hours agoprevYou mean the desk IT job (programming, qa, systems, etc) that also has a \"must be able to lift 50 lbs\" was there solely to keep out handicapped people with an arbitrary requirement?Color me shocked &#x2F;sarcasm reply Snild 16 hours agoparent> \"must be able to lift 50 lbs\"Is that a real thing? reply I_Am_Nous 16 hours agorootparentIn a lot of places in America, yes. My ISP technician job has me doing anything from CLI management over SSH to hauling servers to a colo and racking them myself. Especially in smaller companies where one person tends to do a little bit of everything. reply monetus 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m in a right to work state, but I see it listed on many, many job advertisements here. reply voiper1 17 hours agoparentprevWhoever editorialized the title didn&#x27;t have much in the article that actually said that...I&#x27;d assume that people why are handicapped in some way may be better able to manage without a commute while working from the comfort of their home environment that the have control over.Yes, a programming job may only require sitting at a computer... but also commuting to the office. WFH means you don&#x27;t need to deal with the commute. reply great_psy 17 hours agoparentprevSerious question: Why do they have that requirement?Wouldn’t that increase in workforce lower wages which is what companies want anyway ?How does the company benefit from this ? reply jnovek 17 hours agorootparentAccommodating disabilities is cost center and and failing to do so is a liability. Businesses use loopholes to “opt out” so they don’t have to deal with those things. reply lotsofpulp 16 hours agorootparentAnd taxpayers vote to dump the costs on individual businesses as opposed to spreading the cost over the whole population. reply jnovek 12 hours agorootparentHow would this work? I’m pragmatic about the division of public&#x2F;private responsibilities, so I’m not opposed to the idea, but accommodations are highly specific to the impairment and how it affects the person.I’m not sure how the government would manage that in a fair manner; if SSDI is any indication, not very well. The SSA has a lot of outdated bias in its guidelines for providing aid. reply shortcake27 16 hours agorootparentprevI thought the parent was making a joke. Is this actually a thing in America? In Australia I have never seen this in any of my contracts. reply waveBidder 16 hours agorootparentit&#x27;s a thing. companies are responsible for employees health insurance as well, so they&#x27;d rather not have someone who actually uses that a lot. reply 0xcde4c3db 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also pretty common IME for managers of retail and similar public-facing brick-and-mortar positions to have a bugbear about employees \"looking lazy\", which includes things like sitting, leaning, walking slowly or aimlessly, etc.. reply monetus 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m in Appalachia; It is common. reply pierat 14 hours agorootparentprevThe only joke is the laughable enforcement of the ADA, including shallow-as-hell obvious ploys to exclude disabled people without saying \"we don&#x27;t want to work with cripples\". And pregnant people. Again, to business fucks, these people are liabilities - we can&#x27;t use their body up since it&#x27;s already used up.Take a look over here to see a bunch of anecdotes about this very US based &#x27;policy&#x27; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;antiwork&#x2F;comments&#x2F;15dvtwa&#x2F;why_do_so...This also goes directly along side that retail workers are NOT permitted to have chairs at a register, because of the similar reason (standing constantly excludes disabled and pregnant folk).

We&#x27;re allowed to be &#x27;lazy&#x27;. reply satvikpendem 15 hours agoparentprevIT workers may need to physically move things like servers around so it seems to be a reasonable requirement. reply syngrog66 15 hours agoprev [–] its shocking that so many online job apps ask you for your race, gender, sexuality (?!?) and health&#x2F;disability status. and with a straight face ALSO say they Promise-Pinky-Swear to not use the answers to discriminate against youuh huh1. you cant know whether they will or not. you&#x27;re pointing a gun at your head, pulling a trigger and hoping a bullet doesnt come out2. even if they dont, you&#x27;ve just shared that data with strangers. and data lives forever and can leak out to anywhere else, replicating endlessly. ultimately ending up in Enemy Hands (defined here as folks who dont mean you well & plan to act on it), and thus, used to hurt you3. if you give a false answer on a job app they can later cite it as cause for firing you. ie. it givea the biz HR&#x2F;legal dept yet another gun they can point at your head, financially and legallyits a de facto Scam right out in the open. relying on enough people to fall for it, and believe their Spin. nobody should play along with itps. and yes I know its \"required\" by \"law\" in some cases. it doesnt change the point and the tangible impacts of it. it doesnt make it NOT creepy, dangerous and immoral. evil is evil reply faeriechangling 13 hours agoparent [–] >if you give a false answer on a job app they can later cite it as cause for firing you.Lying about being disabled on a job applications is not considered legal cause for firing somebody in many jurisdictions. It&#x27;s still rather career-limiting to start an employment relationship with somebody by LYING to them though, and employers can simply not follow the law and fire you anyways and it will hardly be worth suing them for damages, so this is cold comfort.I have counselled many extremely naive disabled teenager and 20 somethings about disability discrimination and how to get past it and get a job, generally talking to those who have some ability to hide it but would be much more productive and live a higher quality of life with accomidiation:- If you&#x27;re going to reveal being disabled do it through a recruiter who will match you with employers who are looking to fill a quota or whatever. Or do it if you know the people hiring you and know they will respond well.- If you can hide being disabled, don&#x27;t ask for any accommodation, and hide being disabled for at least long enough to get through a probationary period at which point people will be hesitant to retaliate against you because of the sunk costs and everybody involved in hiring you wanting to save face. This is usually what I usually end up recommending.- Where you are disabled, can live without accommodations indefinitely, and want to climb the ladder - never say that you&#x27;re disabled or ask for accomidations. You will be discriminated against for being disabled and then discriminated against again over the perception that you must be a diversity hire. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Doubt it. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]Schlonzig 364 points 1 day ago You know what would be even better than forcing vendors to release Linux drivers? Forcing them to publish documentation for the interfaces. Coincidentally, this would also have less pushback. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Affectionate_Rule341 62 points 23 hours ago I find the approach that the EU took with the Digital Markets Act to strike a sensible balance between companies’ commercial interests to create a “moat” (i.e. some unfair advantage) and the point in time when said companies become gatekeepers and stifle competition. Put differently, I don’t think it is desirable to force even small companies to only create products that are completely “open” and interoperable with every other company’s a service. Only once they accumulate too much power are they required to become more transparent and open. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]SpaceboyRoss 19 points 17 hours ago Yeah, if you're small enough then certain things just aren't possible or easy at your scale. But if you're at the scale of someone like Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc then there should be no reason why this shouldn't apply. Heck, they think getting fined is just the cost of doing business since the fines are so miniscule. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]hishnash 10 points 14 hours ago Many EU fines are done as a % of your global revenue (not profit) so can be very harming (unsell your a company like MS who has a very high profit margin) but for companies like apple with a (comparable) lower profit margin (40% ish) a revenue fine bites a lot harder. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]hishnash 8 points 14 hours ago Fun little aspect of that most vendors do not fully own the IP that would even let them publish this. The law would need to go even higher up the pipe than just the vendor that sells it to consumers. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]LordRybec 5 points 9 hours ago Yeah, a handful of hardware companies have attempted to opensource their drivers, only to discover that there are portions they can't legally even disclose, due to the use of 3rd party IP. A great example is video card manufacturers, who can't open source drivers because they are using closed chips, or even worse, the chip makers themselves, who are using software-side algorithms that they don't own to offload pre-processing and such to the CPU. (And you thought your fancy GPU was doing all of the work!) Old dialup Winmodems had the same problem. They were dirt cheap, because the signal processing was done in software, but that meant it was really hard to make open source drivers, because the software signal processing algorithms were protected. That's why manufacturers didn't make Linux drivers (which would have been trivial to make otherwise), and it's why community drivers were very hit and miss. Most Winmodem Linux drivers weren't open source and were quite expensive, because it was a lot of work to reverse engineer the signal processing code in the Windows drivers. In the end, Linux users just paid 5 to 10 times the price for modems that didn't hammer your CPU with signal processing and were better off for it. (I got my 100% hardware modems for cheap from Salvation Army, but that was around 5 years after phone-line modems had become obsolete everywhere except fairly remote areas. I happened to be in one of those remote areas though, so it paid off.) But yeah, any law requiring drivers to be open source or requiring hardware APIs used by the drivers to be well and publicly documented would create a massive IP mess. Hardware companies might end up legally forced to violate IP claims of others. Those producing that IP might end up being forced to make it public for free. As much as I hate any government enforced monopoly (which includes copyright and patent), if governments pulled something like this, it would massively reduce innovation in the computer peripheral hardware space. In the long run, I'm sure it work itself out, but in the short run, someone is going to get ripped off, and the most likely candidates are the hardware developers or the software developers they are relying on for the driver algorithms. Currently, software in drivers can add functionality to hardware via emulation, to keep older hardware relevant for longer. But that functionality is generally pretty new and still under patent or copyright. So the end use would also get ripped off by this, because it would prevent companies from adding forward compatibility like this. (This is common practice for video cards. It's why games are constantly recommending updating your video drivers. If they are relying on some new OpenGL or DirectX feature that isn't supported by your video card hardware, a new driver version might provide software support for that feature.) Unfortunately government regulation is often not the right answer. It would be nice if we could force companies to make their drivers open source and publish their APIs, but if you do that, it causes all sorts of other problems, and not all of them can be solved. And while it might seem like bigger companies should be able to afford it, they are more likely to be tied down by a complex web of relationships than small companies. Small companies can't afford to make Linux drivers. Big companies often can't legally make them and have far more to lose by violating their IP licensing contracts. The whole thing is a mess, but I'm not convinced it's a mess that can be cleaned up, because economics and business are fundamentally messy. It's more of a thing where we just have to accept certain trade offs. If slower innovation and hardware becoming obsolete at a much faster rate is an acceptable cost for open source drivers and public APIs, then definitely promote that trade off over the current one. If you care more about rapid innovation and longer duration of compatibility, you probably don't want governments forcing open source drivers and public API. Personally, I'm not sure which of those is better. I suspect more openness will lead to more innovation in the long run, but the transition won't be cheap (for the end users not just the tech giants), and the tech/hardware market might not survive it. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (5 replies) load more comments (2 replies) [–]Polygon-Guy 1 point 20 hours ago This is the best answer. It really doesn't make sense to force businesses to funnel additional resources to doing something that might not even be profitable. It's just going to make everything more expensive and potentially stifle innovation or run into other unintended consequences. Documenting interfaces wouldn't run into this problem because they already have said documentation. Take the whole USB C thing, at the moment USB C is the best connector but it is not without it's flaws and now that the EU is forcing everyone to use it any future innovations is going to be severely hampered since any such device couldn't be sold in the EU without them changing that ruling. The whole thing had already nearly worked itself out. Back in the day there were a thousand different connectors and over time the selection narrowed down to where now everything except apple products is already USB C, including display. imagine is the EU decided that micro should have been the mandatory connector before C was a thing. We would still be stuck with 3 different flavors of HDMI and DP, USB would still be directional, and fast charging wouldn't be anywhere near what it is today. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]DaveC90 4 points 11 hours ago Ummm they did, USB-C is the second iteration of that law, the first being microUSB, at the time Apple just put an adaptor in every EU iPhone box or made one orderable for free. They just adapt the law to whichever connector is more future proof, USB-C being a prime example of that. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]r______p 6 points 19 hours ago It's just going to make everything more expensive That's not how pricing works. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Polygon-Guy 9 points 19 hours ago Okay where do you propose a manufacturers get the money to hire the engineers to create those drivers then? permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [+]r______p comment score below threshold (10 children) load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (1 reply) [+]MatchingTurret comment score below threshold (23 children) [–]A_norny_mousse 43 points 1 day ago* Just latching onto the top comment...

This, the EU could mandate driver source be made available for others to compile or backwards engineer for their OS, or make it so that hardware manufacturers have to document hardware features so that it's at least not a massive pain to get drivers working but they're not going to back one specific OS, that's not how they operate. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (1 reply) [–]External-Bit-4202 15 points 19 hours ago I mean. They’re in the process of forcing the return of user removable batteries. So anything is possible. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]dagmx 13 points 16 hours ago* They are not bringing anything back though. This is a common misunderstanding of what user replaceable battery is counted as. They aren’t talking about the old quick swappable battery. They only mandate that batteries must be available for a certain period of time and not require custom tooling to replace, or that tooling be made easily available. Most phones today would already comply with that outside of duration of availability . They’re okay with hour long battery swap operations. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]hishnash 4 points 14 hours ago Yep the law is about being able to replace battires that no longer take a charge. Not taking a few spare charged batteries with you on a road trip and swap them out on a bus. A 1 hour swap operation for a consumer who has not done this before is fine I your doing this ever 3 to 5 years. Swapping them more often would be harmful to the env anyway. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]IntingForMarks 3 points 11 hours ago It's still a big change. I can swap my battery once it runs out on a Xiaomi phone (for example), but not on most Samsung. They use big soldered blocks where the battery is attached to other parts of the phone.

Linux the kernel has such a tiny fraction of consumer percentage compared to Windows and Mac. If you go up to individual distros the percentage will be much lower considering how fractured the distro market is. No person in the EU will know, and even less, care about drivers for linux on consumer hardware. So it’s not really a concern for EU politicians. A lot of people use iPhone and almost everyone knows what an iPhone is. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]ahfoo 12 points 21 hours ago To the contrary, iOS is based on BSD and Android is definitely GNU/Linux based.

It would be good enough to give the OEMs freedom to do what they want and also give the ability for 3rd parties to add support for it in some way. In addition, maybe having a minimum & universal API for the hardware to be used for basic functionality. For example, in the case of WiFi cards all chipsets sould support a common set of commands to operate the device. So the operating system can send the same commands to make the WiFi card connect to a network for any WiFi card. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [+]masutilquelah[S] comment score below threshold (6 children) load more comments (1 reply) [–]Foosec 53 points 1 day ago Impractical, we could however think about forcing them to release documentation on how to interface with their devices, so drivers that aren't released by the manufacturer could easily be written and not rely on reverse engineering or leaked documentation.

They're pouring so much time and money into optimizing their GPUs for machine learning applications, to try to corner the AI market, and seem to have forgotten that most machine learning models are trained and run on Linux machines. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Adorable_Compote4418 24 points 21 hours ago They don’t. From a business perspective (which I find horrible from a dev pov) their approach is good. They don’t want an open source CUDA compatible driver that could unlock let’s says 15% more performance on xyz hardware. They want to sell newer and better AI GPU. But this mentality will hurt them in the long run. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (1 reply) [–]hbdgas 6 points 12 hours ago The Nvidia drivers work fine on Linux, and have for probably at least 15 years. People using Nvidia cards for work/business don't care that the drivers are closed source. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]LordRybec 1 point 9 hours ago Only if all you want to do is mid-range gaming. I'm speaking as someone who has been using Linux for my daily drive for over 20 years, and who has significant experience with video issues. Nvidia used to be better than ATI/AMD, aside from having a deliberate backdoor in their driver. (Nvidia denies that it was intentional, but they also admitted to knowing about for several years before the public discovered it, and the only reason for keeping such a massive liability is that it was intentional from the beginning.) For higher end gaming, machine learning, and even most businesses cases where a high end graphic card is needed, Nvidia is pretty terrible on Linux. Sadly, AMD isn't much better. The main advantage with Nividia over AMD is that it's easier to get the drivers installed property for high end uses. (AMD is a nightmare for that on Linux.) But performance-wise, it's pretty mediocre. If you are doing crypto mining, you can get pretty good results from Nividia on Linux (but AMD is competitive, if you can figure out getting the drivers installed right). If you are doing Blender video rendering, Nividia works pretty well on Linux (but so does AMD). If you are doing gaming? The AMD defaults from the community driver work better in my experience. Machine learning in Linux won't work on AMD, but while it works, it's pretty sad on Nvidia. I've had similar results to Nvidia with CPU machine learning with Nvidia. I hate to say it, but if you are doing machine learning on GPUs, it's pretty hard to get good results outside of Windows. (Speaking as someone with significant machine learning experience here. I've both written, trained, and used my own neural neural network models, and I've done some graphics generation with AI.) Possibly the main problem with Nvidia on Linux is the lack of good quality GPU scaling. On Windows, clock and voltage scaling with Nvidia works really well, and overriding the default clock, voltage, and so on is pretty easy. On Linux, I don't even think there is automatic scaling in the Linux driver, and while manual scaling is theoretically possible, the only software that does it is a few mostly obsolete crypto miners. That makes Nvidia work really well for crypto mining in Linux (significantly better than in Windows), but for anything else where you would need a high end video card, it's pretty bad. You seem to be thinking about people using it for work that doesn't require high end video cards. These are people who could be using CPU rendering or a much lower end video card. If Nvidia GPUs work perfectly fine for that sort of use case and nothing else, then they should be priced for those uses cases and not for higher end uses. It doesn't matter how they perform on Linux for people who don't need their full capacity. Some of us do actually need to get the full capacity out of them though, and outside of a few narrow uses cases you can't on Linux, because the Linux Nvidia drivers are terrible. The only reason it matters to us that they aren't open source is that we can't fix all of the problem, so that it will work the way it's supposed to! permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [+]masutilquelah[S] comment score below threshold (37 children) load more comments (2 replies) [–]rolyantrauts 17 points 1 day ago usb-c was to stop e-waste and need for multiple chargers.

Especially since such a law would probably only lead to the fact that there are drivers for a certain distribution and that they probably work rather badly than well. This would not really help anyone. And the driver problem doesn't only exist for Linux or Mac. A neighbour of mine upgraded Windows 7 to Windows 10 some time ago. After that, his printer (Lexmark) no longer worked. I then found out that there are no official drivers for this printer for Windows 10. And I think it will be difficult to oblige manufacturers to offer drivers forever. In addition, it will probably be difficult to offer drivers for different operating systems that have exactly the same range of functions. Some functions will probably only be supported by Windows. As hard as it sounds, as a customer you should inform yourself about what you are buying beforehand. The hardware I use, for example, can be used very well under Linux almost without exception. And that includes things like a card reader or a USB audio interface and a USB DAC. But yes, I would also like it if Linux drivers were always offered. But if so, then voluntarily. Apart from that, Intel in particular is extensively involved in the development of drivers and the kernel. That's why you can usually use their network cards without additional drivers. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]Koen1999 7 points 1 day ago The basis could be allowing competition in an otherwise largely monopolized market in which relations between different manufacturers are not always clear. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Osayidan 3 points 21 hours ago I think the competition aspect would be able to play a big role in getting some kind of law passed. Focusing driver development on the incumbent OS only (windows) hinders competition in both the OS and hardware markets if people are forced to make hardware purchasing decisions based on OS compatibility, or forced to use a specific OS because of their hardware purchase. I think it's a much more serious issue than what your default browser is when installing windows since it has a direct financial impact on consumers, yet that whole browser situation got a big deal made out of it in the EU. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [+]masutilquelah[S] comment score below threshold (1 child) [+]Plan_9_fromouter_ comment score below threshold (0 children) [–]CAP_NET_ADMIN 26 points 1 day ago All of those companies, except for Razer are providing drivers for Linux, AMD and Intel are among the largest contributors to Linux kernel and ecosystem, without their contributions I doubt it would be anything as popular as it is now. \"lawmakers in Europe are regulating for the benefit of the people\" that's a really naive statement, a small group of lawmakers cared about the Apple USB issue and pushed for it, they achieved their goal, there are various groups in EU, pushing different agendas and directions, sometimes the \"for the people\" agenda wins and we get some nice law out of it. Companies are putting most support in places where most of their consumers are, why would, for example, AMD create MacOS drivers for their CPUs if there are no MacOS devices with AMD cpu? Why would Nvidia put 50% of their driver team working on Linux desktop support if a single-digit percentage of their users is using Linux desktop. Device support depends on many things, not only drivers, you need stuff to be available/done in other parts of the OS stack for all the features to be supported. You mention having screen tearing on your laptop, this most probably has nothing to do with any of the companies mentioned, this is probably an issue with your OS, configuration or integration problem on the laptop manufacturer. Linux desktop users are not only a small minority of those companies consumers, they are also a really small minority of EU citizens, so the problem overall has little importance for lawmakers. If you want this change to happen, start a citizen initiative, get some media campaign behind it, try to get voted into EU parliament. I'd say that EU pushing for companies to support some arbitrary operating systems is a bit much and overstepping the legislative boundary. permalinkembedsavereportreply load more comments (1 reply) [–]mystarkfuture 9 points 22 hours ago Trying to regulate this will be problematic. How about BSD, Hurd and other OS/Kernel architectures? Should they support that too. Besides the light at the end of the tunnel is fast approaching.

So, no point in regulating for this. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]Ictogan 9 points 18 hours ago The details of what \"fully working\" means would make this very complicated. You can't expect a video driver for Linux to support DirectX, considering it is windows-specific. So full feature parity is literally impossible. Which other software should be supported? Do both X11 and wayland need to be supported? What about other windowing systems? Is distribution in binary form enough? If yes, which distributions need to be supported and how fast do updates for new OS releases have to appear?

Where would you draw the line? Why stop at Linux, what about xBSD, or even Windows XP today? A much better idea would be to require companies to provide full technical interface documentation for any hardware they sell. Then anyone interested could write drivers for whatever OS they want. The quality of said drivers are likely to be higher than vendor ones anyway. This wouldn't actually cost the company anything either (unlike requiring them to write drivers for extra OSs) since they already presumably already have the said documentation. Note that I'm only talking about interface documentation, they shouldn't be required to publish how their hardware works internally (that would be nice but isn't required to write a driver and would be problematic for some companies). By interface documentation I mean \"write this bit to this register to turn the light on\" or \"send this USB message to start the motor\" or whatever. Doing this would not only help with support for Linux and other OSs but would ensure a longer lifecycle for products and reduce waste. permalinkembedsavereportreply [+]PeepoChadge 2 points 1 day ago (0 children) [+]obrb77 2 points 23 hours ago* (0 children) [–]ObscureSegFault 2 points 23 hours ago Unless you could prove that, say, Microsoft was paying or otherwise coercing hardware manufacturers to purposefully put interfaces behind some DRM that only works with Windows, I don't really see it happening any time soon. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]dgm9704 2 points 21 hours ago I don’t think anyone can force someone do something (in this context).

This could be very positive for manufacturers, as it could help them save a lot of money (they would not need to continuously spend on half-baked driver development). With open documentation, pen source drivers for all operating systems would be possible. A positive example is the Turris Omnia from nic.cz. We could facilitate tax breaks for companies that open-source their drivers and documentation. There could even be tax breaks based on the iFixit repairability score to incentivize the production of more repairable goods. There are many ways this could be improved in Europe and the US. Past discussions, such as “hours contributed to open-source software development being tax-deductible\" and \"Openism: Conversations on Open Hardware,\" have taken place. The ecosystem has become even more closed and centralized in the past years. Enthusiasts spend a lot of time on reverse engineering (e.g., CHDK and iOS Jail breaking). If we had access to the necessary information, we wouldn't need to reverse engineer and could create something of greater economic value. Recently, people have started to reconsider the amount of e-waste produced by the current technology economy and the idea that they may not need a new phone every year. Fairphone 5 has been announced with 10 years of Android support. However, the Fairphone 5 is built on top of a closed chip and runs a proprietary operating system (Android). Linux phones are a small minority (you can check the postmarketOS supported devices to get an idea of the landscape). How do you prevent an \"early mover disadvantage\", and prevent the \"fast followers\" such as competitors to just copy your product? These are the unsolved economics of open source hardware (it is fundamentally different than OSS), and a good example is the company puri.sm with their open source business model. They spent massive amounts in the development of an open source phone. They originally planned to release the schematics 2 years after the phone sales. The question is if such a business model works in a very centralized market of mobile phones. App stores are the monopolies to tackle, the hardware can never be fully open as in verifiable and reprodicible (read in this context: \"RISC-V is not an open-source processor\" and \"Stealthy Dopant-Level Hardware Trojans\"). Looking at the current market conditions - it is the extreme of what Jonathan Zittrain has written about tethered devices in \"Future of the Internet and how to stop it\" (read also: The future of Internet (and how we didn't stop it)\"). The Apple iPhone has a >52% market share in the US in 2023. Apple’s Self Repair Service is Designed to Be Unapproachable. The only way to escape the tethering is a radical open source approach. Closed standards are always creating additional levels of control. Your question about whether the EU could force hardware manufacturers to make fully working drivers for Linux: while I would love to have drivers upstreamed for all new devices, we also have to accept that the whole market share of Linux is about 3%. Does that already qualify as enough to force manufacturers to develop Linux drivers? Also, Linux is not the problem here, but open-source economics and R&D business models are flawed. I would start by lobbying for open documentation, firmware and repair. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]jozefvanerka 2 points 16 hours ago Intel already maintains proper drivers, at least for the NICs and QAT and at least for FreeBSD and Linux. NVidia the same. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]CNR_07[🍰] 2 points 16 hours ago no? lmao what permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]Doikor 2 points 16 hours ago* I don't really see any reason why EU would prefer Linux over any other operating system. Comparison to USB type C doesn't really work as type C is an actual standard while Linux is not. A more sensible approach would be to force the hardware manufacturers to release enough of the spec/data sheet that anyone could write the driver if they want to. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]N00bsl4y3r69420 2 points 16 hours ago IMHO drivers and apis should be open sourced and required by law in order to support all OSs, and avoid technology obsoletion and E-waste permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]Annual-Advisor-7916 2 points 14 hours ago They could, but looking at the overall lacking education of the EU parliament members I'd say most of them never heard of Linux... permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]xtifr 2 points 14 hours ago Most of those companies already do make working drivers for Linux, or at least try to! As for the idea that the drivers should work \"equally in linux, windows and even MacOS\", that seems to reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of what a driver is! A driver adapts the device to fit the needs of the OS. Linux and Windows have different needs! The only way to make a driver that works with both OSes would be to change those OSes to be the same! And nobody wants that! In fact, the main reason Nvidia struggles to provide working drivers for Linux is because the Linux devs aren't really supporting them! Intel and AMD have open-sourced their drivers and taken the time to get them accepted as part of the kernel! Linux devs don't make changes that break the Intel or AMD drivers because that would be breaking the kernel. When it comes to changes that break the Nvidia drivers, though, the kernel devs are under no such constraints! So what's the EU supposed to say to Nvidia? Stop not being supported by the Linux devs? That's not really something Nvidia has a choice about! (They could release the source code for their drivers, but there's no guarantee the Linux devs would accept that code into the kernel. The Linux devs have strong and sometimes arbitrary standards, and there's no reason to believe that Nvidia's code meets those standards.) permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]flowerpowersupergirl 2 points 11 hours ago lawmakers in Europe are regulating for the benefit of the people Chat Control has entered the conversation permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]OptimusCrime73 4 points 1 day ago Yes they could but I have not heard anyone talk about it.

The track record of governments understanding of tech has not been good. Sure maybe you like one or two decisions they make. That doesn’t mean the next one won’t be absolute shit. Don’t give some old worn out politicians too much power permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]daemonpenguin 2 points 21 hours ago It would be really hard to enforce a law like that. Partly because you're demanding companies make software for markets to which they are not selling. Second, you're going to need to draw the line somewhere. You want drivers for Linux, maybe macOS. What about the BSDs? What about Hurd? About about Haiku? I want more Linux drivers and you're going to have a hard time convincing me it's appropriate to force companies to make drivers for all open source operating systems. Or, if not all, then why only Linux? A lawyer would tear this idea to shreds. Third, it's a free speech issue. Code is a form of speech and you cannot force someone to say something (or write something) they don't want to. You can't force speech or association in a free society. What I think could work, and would be better for everyone involved (not just Linux users) is demanding open specifications and API for new hardware. That way there is no burden of code writing on the companies, but they do need to make their interfaces open so anyone (Linux, BSD, Haiku, etc) developers can write their own drivers with no guess work or reverse engineering. You hear it less now, but 20 years ago, that was the big call when Linux didn't work with a lot of hardware. \"You don't need to give us drivers, just give us the documentation and we'll write the drivers.\" I think that's still true today. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]Ictogan 1 point 18 hours ago Third, it's a free speech issue. Code is a form of speech and you cannot force someone to say something (or write something) they don't want to. You can't force speech or association in a free society. Not really a valid point unless you disagree with tons of laws that already exist. Almost all companies already need to create imprints and privacy statements. In many sectors(medical, automative, aerospace, etc.), getting your products certified requires writing literal tons of documentation that needs to be submitted to the relevant agencies. Airlines need to submit flight plans and other documentation for every single flight they make. So in many ways, companies are already forced to write a lot of somethings that they don't want to write. I would argue that this does not violate free speech(except in the most strict possible interpretation) because it doesn't restrict which opinions individuals can express. (Not trying to argue for the law proposed by OP, just disagreeing with this particular point you made). permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]daemonpenguin 1 point 18 hours ago I feel you actually made my point for me. So I'm not sure how you're disagreeing? Companies need to provide documentation and procedures for products and markets they are in to follow the regulations governing their products. They do not need to provide written documentation, testing, or statements for markets they are not in. The OP is suggesting companies be forced to provide products (drivers) for markets the companies are not selling to. It would be like forcing a car maker to also produce parts compatible with airplanes. You mentioned airlines need to file a flight plan, which makes sense because they're flying an airplane. But OP is suggesting the equivalent of suggesting what if airlines were forced to write a new pop song each time they filed a flight plan? That makes no sense and would not be enforceable. Also, we're both in agreement that companies often need to provide specifications and documentation for their existing products, which would allow kernel developers to write their own drivers. This is a solution which is already often used and would be relatively easy to implement and require from the companies. So we seem to have a similar solution in mind. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]MusaSSH 3 points 20 hours ago* Why should they? How the law should work? Do they just make manufacturers fully working linux drivers? Or do they force them to make fully working drivers for mac, windows, linux, bsd, and any other less known os out there? the usb-c law always sounded weird to me, right now it's the only liable option, a shared port to all your devices, what about in the future we find usb-c no more feeding our needs and we need a better new standard? how that eu law will work out, do they keep forcing usb-c for the phones/devices in eu or what? permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]Albertpm95 2 points 20 hours ago About the 2 paragraph, the usb currently exceeds the needs of the vast majority, it will keep evolving, law can change, and it doesn't force you to not use anything else.

Companies would first discontinue support for lots of products, to avoid huge development costs, it would be an actual catastrophe for many companies. And those drivers would simply be implemented in a way to satisfy that law and not to be actually better than any open source implementation. So people would use the open source drivers that are still better. Or even worse, people would accept the okayish driver, and hardware would just suck more and more on Linux. permalinkembedsavereportreply [+]SmellsLikeAPig 2 points 23 hours ago (0 children) [–]Adorable_Compote4418 2 points 21 hours ago I personally want Linux to forever stay at roughly 10% market share. I believe it’s one of the core reason why it’s mostly open source and the way it is. If let’s say it would skyrocket to 50% market share. It would bring a considerable amount of money and the market would react. Windows would become less greedy and Linux would become more greedy/ more closed.

Not so much, because then companies in the free world do all the hard work designing and developing a product, and companies in autocratic nations just steal it then dump copycat products cheaper around the globe. That's how autocratic economic power has built up, on the back of espionage and western CEO's handing over know how and injecting capital. That's why there are rising military tensions and democratic backsliding, just yesterday the Maldives became a vassal of the Chinese Communist Party, the latest in a string of wins for the dark side. Chinese leaders are telling small countries that China will lead the world in AI. If they come to dominate the globe, everyone on this pale blue dot will suffer unless they kowtow to whatever man brutalises his way to the top of the communist party. So let's not be gullible hippies and share any specs related to leading edge AI related tech, be it CPU's, video cards, etc. I regret having to say that, because I believe free software and open hardware are the future for a global society with robust civil liberties and more co-operation than competition.

If any software that can be changed remotely or by the user is off limits. Even firmware. Conversely, software vendors can only sell (or freely distribute) software. For vendors from abroad, don&#x27;t go extra-territorial, just force them to chose: either they only sell hardware in the EU, or they only sell software. Intel and microsoft would have no problem. NVDIA might complain very loudly. Apple would likely have to split itself.Now the complicated part is how to define a company. We don&#x27;t want a single company to just split itself into 2 legal entities that work so closely together they might as well be the same company.Do that, and you&#x27;ll get much better than device drivers for one free OS. You&#x27;ll get the necessary specs required to make it work on all OSes. Even better, the user-facing hardware interface will start to matter, and there will be some selection pressure to drive the more complex ones, or the non-standard ones, out of the market. (Won&#x27;t be ideal, I can see a particular over-complex architecture win out, similar to x86, but at least there won&#x27;t be that many left, so writing a driver for most devices will actually be possible). reply vegetablepotpie 15 hours agoparentI like this idea because it’s incredibly American.

So it is either proven, or not, and then the court issues the verdict. If it is not, like in Microsoft&#x27;s case, they are still innocent. It does not matter whether it was impossible to prove or Apple stopped pursing the case; the court said they are guilty. If you continue say they did it, it is a defamation.Even without regarding the above, the case was really shaky. Microsoft using the same vendor through a chain (via Intel) as Apple does not mean they are \"stealing\".

I can say that about most of the propositions in this thread.I, as a user (and a vim-user, may I add), would like it very much if all the software and hardware in the world would be fully open, customizable, community-maintained. I, as a manufacturer, am less keen on that idea. So, to make it happen, every manufacturer has to be forced to make that happen. So, literally, we are stepping farther from the open market and killing some personal freedom under a promise of a bright happy future.And the realness of that promise is as questionable, as the means necessary to achieve the goal. As I&#x27;ve said, personally, I&#x27;m very excited about that promise. But it really is just a promise, and if it can be fulfilled is a very, very big question.Ultimately, nobody really sells hardware or software. Everybody sells user-experience. It is very obvious in Apple&#x27;s case, but it is always true. It&#x27;s easy to forget that when you are choosing the cheapest light bulbs on the market, because the user-experience of having electric light in your house has been sold to you so long ago, there are so many basically identical products that the only apparent difference to you is the price. Now you perceive GPUs (or bluetooth, or whatever) as light bulbs. But at some point selling a GPU or a light bulb was quite similar to selling a novel iSomething. The seller had to explain to you, not so much what iSomething is, but how iSomething makes your life better. And if the technology that makes this promise of the user-experience a reality is hardware, software or just exceptional marketing — really is just details.So, as much as I hate that my fitness-watch is basically a spying device and I don&#x27;t even own the data it produces (and I mean, I really hate that), I don&#x27;t feel like forcing Garmin to open-source the firmware is the right thing to do. Maybe I would support some more forceful moves to make the generated data my property, but even here the line is blurry. But forcing them (and better think: you, as a manufacturer) to make something other than you wanted to make — …why the fuck should I? Who decides what is that common standard I don&#x27;t want in my product, but I have to, to be legally allowed to sell that? I think, I just like the idea of personal freedom a bit too much to support that. I&#x27;d much prefer Garmin just losing to competition that chooses open firmware, than legally forcing them to produce anything they didn&#x27;t want to produce. reply scarface_74 8 hours agorootparentIf only there were some company that made a watch that stored your health data e2e encrypted and didn’t use it to spy on you… reply scarface_74 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah and that works out well with Android and Bluetooth. reply happymellon 14 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t that literally the point.

Better to manually decide which device that actively \"owns\" the channel. reply smoldesu 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah. Multipoint connection has been a part of the Bluetooth spec since 4.0. Compatible devices will connect to anything available nearby and negotiate audio to whichever device pressed &#x27;play&#x27; last.

He already said examples of how many devices he has and that it works with, and you did the same for yours. You haven&#x27;t presented any standard spec and pointed to the part where the spec states the figure that lists the max number of devices. He shared some spec, I am sure you could find some number there. reply scarface_74 7 hours agorootparentBecause I know how to Google “how many devices does the JBL headphones support” reply donkeybeer 7 hours agorootparentApparently 8 with some gotchas? But in principle this should not be gated to a hardware, what is stopping one from making a bluetooth device that muxes all the signals and sends it to the audio device? Is there any reason thats not happening other than greed of the headphone makers to try to upsell \"higher models\"? reply scarface_74 7 hours agorootparent“8 with some gotchas”. That’s a rousing endorsement of open standards. reply donkeybeer 7 hours agorootparentIts not open enough. If it was open enough I could feed it any signal I want into the audio interface, including from any bluetooth device to MUX them how I want. reply smoldesu 6 hours agorootparentprevYou have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about.1. Your Bluetooth radio determines how many simultaneous connections you get. It is at least 2 on Bluetooth 4.0+.2. You are conflating cloud pairing (Apple&#x27;s feature) with multipoint pairing (everyone&#x27;s feature). They coexist.3. 8 devices is generally the hard limit on all consumer Bluetooth radios, from the iPhone to Nintendo Switch. reply donkeybeer 6 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t even get the point of these hardcore Apple defenders tbh man. You are not Apple, and you only gain to benefit from if supposedly they have good hardware and software, it also becomes more open for you or others to find better uses for it. You only gain not lose from that. Here on an HN linked article I was reading how Asahi managed to find and fix some audio bug in a macbook model.

Why are you so defensive about the idea of Apple being forced to open it up? Are you an Apple employee or do you have Apple stocks or is there any other reason? You lose literally nothing and gain lots from them being opened up. I don&#x27;t care about any \"trouble\" Apple has with it because I am not Apple. I am a person who thinks of his needs first, just as Apple is an entity that thinks of their needs first. They don&#x27;t need your help for that. Just like Apple my needs come first, and my needs definitely think its more enjoyable to see Apple (and other hardware makers) opened up because it benefits me. I always advocate for and practice things that benefit me, I don&#x27;t care if it benefits Apple, if it does, good for them, if it doesn&#x27;t its not my problem either. And Apple thinks the same of you and me and all is customers. reply smoldesu 6 hours agorootparentprevThis website is not a serious place. Intelligent people are not attracted to a platform calling itself \"Hacker News\" - roleplayers and onlookers get sucked in instead. Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs get tricked into thinking that this is problem-solving. DogTV™ gets funded and busts out, destitute shareholders and makers go looking for the next big thing. The cycle continues.With some people, I have no idea where they fall on the spectrum of self-serious argumentation. I usually don&#x27;t even care; pretty much all feedback is valuable on a forum like this. When people preclude good-faith discussion around Apple hardware with weaksauce rhetoric though, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that they&#x27;re putting their emotions first. I&#x27;ll field any discussion around Apple and their altruism, but I won&#x27;t accept petty greed or speculation as a defense. They&#x27;re an opaque company that deserves the scrutiny they recieve, regardless of the unofficial rationale people roll out.This problem isn&#x27;t specific to Apple hardware, or really the tech industry as a whole. Every field has it&#x27;s pundits; you can usually identify them when they use weak rhetoric and avoid directly addressing your argument. It&#x27;s still especially bad with Apple technology though, since so little of it is documented well enough to definitively refute any claim. You can&#x27;t corroborate behavior on your iPhone with source code, or visit the iCloud datacenters to ensure everything is being handled with white gloves.

Also could be charged with only a usb c cable, no special adapter.Why would you doubt there are better options? The whole thing about the PC market is it has a much greater diversity of choices.

But the Apple-silicon MacBook has since barrelled onto the scene, and it wipes the floor with most of the ultraportable Windows laptops that cross my desk on a daily basis. This XPS is no exception. Compared to the M2 MacBook Air, battery life is worse. Benchmark performance is worse. Screen, while good, is worse. Port selection is worse.And the rest.So anyway, I’ve been using the regular XPS 13 for the past few weeks. And, like, it’s fine. It’s just fine. It’s worse than its 2020 predecessor in some ways and better in others. It continues to bring some of the best build quality in the 13-inch space. The display is fine. The speakers are fine. There’s an off-purple color option! It’s certainly one of the best Windows laptops you can buy, and it also doesn’t come close to the performance or efficiency that today’s MacBooks can provide, which says a thing or two about the current state of the Windows laptop space.And the resolution is worseSpecifically, you’re limited to a 1920 x 1200 60Hz IPS panelA similarly configured M2 MacBook Air is currently selling for $1,699, which makes Dell’s pricing attractive — though the performance benefits Apple delivers for that extra price aren’t insignificant, as we’ll soon discuss.One thing to note about the XPS 13, though — the fans get going very easily. They were audible with a couple Chrome tabs and Slack openSpeaking of things that have improved: battery life.

Are you really that addicted to the Apple kool-aid?Go look at some of the Asus models than if you think an XPS can&#x27;t compete. Weighed less than a macbook air, more port including ethernet (via a HDMI port), something like 21 hours of battery life, weight was slightly under a pound IIRC.There&#x27;s plenty of other models&#x2F;companies.The biggest benefit? It&#x27;s not Apple locking you into their ridiculous ecosystem. But I suspect you&#x27;re fine with that.

Can you cite a review of an Asus that compares?Even though the Dell sucks in every dimension, at least you have “freeduhm” reply PrimeMcFly 6 hours agorootparentYeah.

I told you it was an Asus B series, don&#x27;t remember the exact model, but go visit their page. They advertise the fact it has more battery life and is lighter, it isn&#x27;t hard to find.The problem here is you&#x27;re addicted to the Apple kool-aid and will bend over backwards to deny any non Apple product could be superior. reply scarface_74 4 hours agorootparentSo you didn’t read the review because “you did your own research”.Yet you can’t seem to find the magical XPS 13 and cite a review?Did your “research” tell you that by every objective measure it’s worse? The resolution is four times worse, the battery is three times worse, it’s loud, it’s slow.Here is the review of the Asus B series. The newest one I could find. The contemporary MacBook Air at the time which was better in every way came out in late 2020 and was cheaper.Again from the Verge and it’s the nearest one I could find..https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;22239215&#x2F;asus-expertbook-b9450-revi...Just make sure you know what you’re getting — because the low-powered processor and deafening fans certainly aren’t ideal for everyone.but potential buyers should be aware that the processor is mostly suitable for basic office tasks. More on that in a bit.And it’s even worse than the Dell XPS 13 that you were bragging about.The Core i7-10510U is a four-core processor that’s significantly lower-powered than the chips you’ll see in the best laptops on the market like the Dell XPS 13. It’s far from a workhorse.So it’s slower, hotter, louder, with worse graphics and lower battery life. reply PrimeMcFly 4 hours agorootparentI skimmed the review, it didn&#x27;t match up with the models I had seen before, and seeing you basically flat out lie to overexaggerate some of the negative aspects made it easy to basically dismiss it and your reply.I&#x27;m not putting any more effort into replying to you, other than typing in the reply box.

Android manufactures want you to throw the phone away and buy a new one.Since manufacturers didn&#x27;t demand long support, Qualcomm didn&#x27;t provide updates for their SoCs. This meant Fairphone couldn&#x27;t support their phones even if they wanted to, which is why they used am automotive chip in their new phone — which is nearly the same as a phone chip except the 13 years of updates. reply scarface_74 12 hours agorootparent> Apple has an interest in keeping their devices alive, since they can make money of the store and servicesIsn’t that the free market working the way it should without government interference? reply mschuster91 12 hours agorootparentThe problem with an unregulated free market is that eventually one or two companies get so dominant that it is virtually impossible to challenge them as a competition, especially in fields that require immense amounts of money to break into. One might even argue that the end game of capitalism is to acquire a monopoly, which one can then use to extract rents as one feels free to do, or just keep milking locked-in customers (like IBM and Oracle are).It took Apple, flush with cash from iPhones and iPods, a decade worth of work to create a SoC able to throw punches at eye level with Intel and AMD, which themselves grew to the unholy duopoly over decades. Chipmakers have it even worse: TSMC has all the cards, Samsung and Intel have completely fallen behind with no chance in sight that they&#x27;ll match TSMC any time soon. All the other competition has gone bankrupt or stopped at lesser nodes because they couldn&#x27;t keep up the pace.There&#x27;s no disrupting that, not even if you are an actual nation state. reply scarface_74 11 hours agorootparentSo guess what happened when the EU forced browser choice in Windows?

My previous MacBook could not stay on WiFi for more than a couple hours straight, never had been fixed.Also, reversing an existing working driver is different from writing a driver from scratch. In one case you just need to repeat the functionality, produce the same outputs for the same inputs, the quality of hardware is orthogonal here since it&#x27;s already worked around in the existing driver.

An Intel CPU simply isn&#x27;t going to run without microcode, and having to get rid of microcode would easily set back chip design by a decade.Even something as trivial as a USB cable isn&#x27;t pure hardware anymore. It has a programmable eMarker in order to advertise its capabilities, so it is also a combination of hardware and software. Everything but completely trivial chips has some kind of computation embedded in it, requiring some firmware.Chips are complicated and weird. Pretty much nobody writes code which directly interacts with hardware. Even people who write code for embedded microprocessors will use an SDK provided by the chip manufacturer to smooth out the nastiest details. How&#x27;s that supposed to work when the hardware vendor can no longer provide any software?And then there&#x27;s the question of what exactly constitutes \"firmware\". Is code in a separate programmable flash chip okay if they hardwire the Write Protect pin? What if the exact same code is stored in programmable space in the MCU itself? Is it fine to place that code in One-Time-Programmable memory? Bake it into the chip during wafer manufacturing? If anything, being able to update the firmware in the field is better for the consumer when it comes to fixing bugs. reply loup-vaillant 11 hours agorootparent> The problem is that you cannot make a hard distinction between hardware and software. An Intel CPU simply isn&#x27;t going to run without microcode, and having to get rid of microcode would easily set back chip design by a decade.Yes you can make the distinction, and no it doesn&#x27;t require getting rid of the microcode: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37731829Simply put, if the microcode can be updated by the user or remotely by Intel, then it count as \"software\", and Intel should stop shipping it. But if those update are either impossible or require a factory recall, then it&#x27;s \"hardware\", and Intel can happily continue to ship it.The same logic applies to the USB cable, and even FPGA: if the bitstream is locked into the NVCM, that&#x27;s hardware. If it&#x27;s merely written in the rewritable SPI flash, that&#x27;s software. It&#x27;s not a property of the bitstream itself, it&#x27;s a property of how it is stored.Obviously the cost of micro-code bugs will sharply increase. That&#x27;s kind of a feature though: now hardware vendors must be really careful. reply dumpsterdiver 10 hours agorootparentCan you imagine the nightmare alternate universe of waking up to hear that Rowhammer is raging uncontrolled in the world, and the only way to fix it is to either return a data center full of affected products to the manufacturer or pay a specialist (who would probably be booked out for a long time to come) to come onsite? reply Someone 13 hours agoparentprev> Force hardware vendors to only sell hardware.

Perhaps allowing some third party to bundle the two could be a nice convenience, but then we must make absolutely sure that they never sell the bundle for less than the separate parts, that would be anti-competitive.Also, I&#x27;m sick of paying for a Windows copy I never use.

If it can conveniently be changed, that&#x27;s software, and the actual interface to the CPU is not the final ISA, but how to encode that micro-code to make the final ISA. If however the microcode is etched or locked, then it&#x27;s part of the hardware.Another example would be an FPGA implementation of a RISC-V core: if the bitstream is locked into the NVCM it can no longer be modified, and thus counts as hardware. But if it&#x27;s in the easily rewritable SPI flash, then it&#x27;s software, and it can&#x27;t be bundled with the FPGA itself.While I&#x27;m not absolutely certain my border is the right one, I believe it&#x27;s at least one that can be fairly easily delimited.> Software company C could pay hardware company H to build hardware according to specs they give, with the specs under NDA, possibly even forbidding H to sell that hardware design to others than C.Correct, some trade secrets need to be banned. Even further, I would void all ISA related patents and copyright. Specifically, cloning the functionality of any piece of hardware should be allowed, similar to how the IBM PC was cloned.Note thought that splitting the activities is still worth it: when software is bundled with the hardware, we still need exploitable specs. Banning trade secrets doesn&#x27;t force vendors to disclose them, and even if they do disclose them, nothing forces them to make especially readable beyond regulatory mandate, and nothing forces them to simplify their hardware interfaces.

And don&#x27;t offer tax cuts to companies that don&#x27;t publish their schematics and interfaces. reply chme 15 hours agoparentprevI get you in principle, but the company should still be allowed to sell hardware with some default software installed, because if I had to search for someone on the internet that wrote software for my specific smart TV, washing machine or whatever this becomes much more painful.I would rather see a &#x27;right to repair&#x27; extended to software bundled. Any device or software that can connect to a network or can be interfaced with in any way is prone to security (or any other) bugs, which the customer should have the right to fix themselves, because they bought it, and in order to do so, the company needs to hand out the source code and documentation for all their devices.Also about vendor writing Linux drivers, you probably don&#x27;t want them too, there are already vendor board support packages (BSP) out there that enabled their hardware on Linux, but those are overwhelmingly abysmal in quality.What you rather want is for vendors to upstream their driver into the kernel, so that it is properly integrated, doesn&#x27;t break the hardware of others and has a high quality, but that process is not something you can regulate and force. reply thomastjeffery 15 hours agorootparentOf course your hardware would come with software installed! That software would simply be written by a separate company.We already do this! HP didn&#x27;t write Windows, but they sure as hell sell laptops with Windows preinstalled. reply kanbara 3 hours agorootparentvendor sw (hp, samsung, htc, gateway, dell) is some of the worst sw i’ve ever experienced.i want safari, mail, and messages tyvm reply PrimeMcFly 5 hours agorootparentprevTrying to leverage right to repair to apply to software, as a way to demand source for commercial apps is a huge stretch. reply kanbara 16 hours agoparentprevterrible idea.people buy apple products precisely because of how integrated they are. this idealism and desire to force companies to support everything (as much as i want gaming on mac&#x2F;linux and drivers for things supported) is the single most dangerous idea that would completely ruin the user experience for millions. reply loup-vaillant 14 hours agorootparent> this idealism and desire to force companies to support everythingI&#x27;m sorry, where did I proposed we do that? As far as I am aware my proposal would only force Apples to split itself in 2: a hardware company that sells top notch hardware (so top notch in fact that even the hardware interfaces are as clean and slick as an iPad&#x27;s case), and a software company that sells a top-notch integrated software suite on whatever hardware they chose to support (and no other hardware).This idea that Apple&#x27;s hardware is somehow better because they don&#x27;t publish their spec sounds incoherent to be honest. As is the idea that their software is better because it runs on company hardware. If there&#x27;s still a company selling good hardware, one can still write good software for that particular hardware.So… forcing hardware companies to support all software? Nope, though publishing their spec does automatically provide some level of support for arbitrary software. Forcing software companies to support all hardware? No more than they do now, possibly even less: hardware vendors will be incentivised to harmonise their respective interfaces to appeal to a maximum number of software vendors, so software vendors will be incentivised to support a relatively limited set of interfaces. reply robertlagrant 14 hours agorootparentWhy split the company? What does that do? reply loup-vaillant 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not proposing that we split companies. I proposing that no company that sells hardware be allowed to distribute software, and no company that distributes software be allowed to sell hardware. The Apple split is only a consequence of that. As would be the likely end of locked down game consoles, now that I think of it.What I&#x27;m hoping to accomplish with this is: reduced or eliminated vendor lock-in, harmonisation and simplification of ISAs, the ability to support any hardware in any OS, and maybe even the the ability to actually write new OSes and see some real competition in this space.Note one important component I haven&#x27;t mentioned: ISA patents should be rendered null and void. Anyone should be allowed to design, make, and sell an ARM or x86 CPU without asking anyone&#x27;s permission. Or a GPU clone, or a network card clone, etc. Without that we&#x27;ll just strengthen monopolies, or maybe allow new ones to arise. reply Jtsummers 12 hours agorootparentThis is a rather amazing comment, I&#x27;m astonished by the bald-faced lie that you open your first paragraph with:> I&#x27;m not proposing that we split companies.Also you, only a couple comments up:> As far as I am aware my proposal would only force Apples to split itself in 2: a hardware company that sells top notch hardware (so top notch in fact that even the hardware interfaces are as clean and slick as an iPad&#x27;s case), and a software company that sells a top-notch integrated software suite on whatever hardware they chose to support (and no other hardware).Which is it, split companies or don&#x27;t split companies? You can&#x27;t have it both ways. If you aren&#x27;t proposing that we split companies then you can&#x27;t propose we split Apple unless you want to be a pedantic twit and point out that that&#x27;s just one company and not companies. reply loup-vaillant 10 hours agorootparentListen to any pro-gun advocate: the goal is not to kill the bad guy, the goal is to stop the bad guy… though unfortunately sometimes this means reducing their blood pressure to zero.The law as I propose it would not legally force Apple to split. They would have 3 alternatives: stop selling software, stop selling hardware, or split. They could fire half the company, but we all know what they would actually do. Same deals with banks: enforcing the separation between deposit and investment wouldn&#x27;t force the banks to split, but we all know that in practice they would.Understand here that splitting Apple is not my goal. My goal is to separate the activities, in the hope of fostering more competition and personal freedom. reply robertlagrant 4 hours agorootparentBut how would that actually work?

It&#x27;s nowhere as revolutionary as separating hw development from sw development, but may thus be more realistic. One clause (of maybe six) concerned \"Forced licensing of must-have drivers, algorithms, codecs, file formats, etc. to any viable OS, and for a price that market can bear\".At the time I was thinking of technologies like the Unisys GIF patent, Flash, various audio and video codecs, and peripheral drivers. If not having a technology makes an OS vitally less useful and appealing to a user then there&#x27;s potentially a path to developer documentation. Who decides? I think the current system for DMCA exemptions works pretty well (noting that I despise the DMCA), so maybe a branch of the US Copyright Office or another government&#x27;s similar branch? A viable OS is one with a notable following and which can use the technology. If I write RadiumOS for myself, that doesn&#x27;t count. Likewise Widevine for the Atari 800 is out. But Linux anything would, the BSD family, and Amiga, BeOS&#x2F;Haiku, etc. would have a fair shot. Making a free, public developers kit is always better, but offering an NDA to a developer representing each OS family would likely be common. No, it wouldn&#x27;t be an instantaneous process, yes, there would be paperwork and maybe a lawyer involved, but the burden has to be bearable for each OS&#x2F;developer. If you&#x27;re Apple wanting the MS Office file formats, MS is allowed to charge a not insignificant amount, but if you&#x27;re a free, open source OS, then the cost would be either free or nearly so. Not every vendor in a field would be cracked open. If AMD is very friendly to developers, then Nvidia could keep their video drivers proprietary. With all the OSS available today vs. 20 years ago, something like this is maybe a bit less useful, but IMHO still a significant step forward, and a hedge against companies suddenly taking their specs private. reply thomastjeffery 15 hours agoparentprevWe live with such an extreme amount of vertical integration today that people actually believe it is benefiting them.Every time I see an Amazon delivery truck, part of me dies inside. reply tbrownaw 13 hours agoparentprev> either they only sell hardware in the EU, or they only sell software.

That seems like a decent compromise because there’s very little margin in hardware alone and if you force hardware makers to go that route pretty soon there won’t be any because they’ll all have gone out of business. reply unix_fan 15 hours agoparentprevThis would be terrible for specialized hardware, such as assistive technology. Open source software doesn’t really exist for it because there is simply no interest. reply loup-vaillant 14 hours agorootparentWe could carve out exceptions for specific niches. Ugly, but could work.Who says the software has to be open? It would be better for sure, but companies may be interested in selling software for assistive technologies.Interest may go up if the barrier to entry lowers. Undocumented hardware is quite the turn off. reply unix_fan 10 hours agorootparentYou can&#x27;t really sell software for running a braille display on its own, for example. As for interest going up, I doubt that very much, as linux is still lacking good vision accessibility, such as a screen reader that doesn&#x27;t brake with every update to the gnome desktop. windows and macOS figured that one out years ago, and the only decent open source screen reader is windows only. reply loup-vaillant 10 hours agorootparentBraille displays were precisely on my mind: there is a sizeable community of blind programmers out there. And realistically: how hard could it be to operate such a device? The thing is basically a super-low resolution screen with an abysmal refresh rate. A sufficient design could be a serial interface where you send all the pixels in a single packet. Or perhaps we could go fancy with modifying single characters or shifting the display left or right… done right, writing a driver for this thing is nearly trivial, to the point of being possible in user-space.One reason for the blight of the blind here is the ludicrous complexity of the software, much of it comes from the ludicrous complexity and diversity of hardware interfaces, such that there is no competition and everything is terrible.Most people however sharply underestimate the mountain of avoidable complexity we&#x27;ve accreted over the decades. I would situate it between 99% and 99.9% for personal computing. No silver bullet perhaps, but I know almost for a fact that there&#x27;s enough silver dust around to gather 2 or 3 bullets. reply pasabagi 5 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a cool idea, but where do you draw the line?

How do we conclude that, yes, a hardware manufacturer hasn’t lived up to the regulation? Perhaps the operating system is “using it wrong”. Do governments have entire departments running tests on these devices? reply loup-vaillant 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s in part why I didn&#x27;t propose that we force manufacturers to specify their products, but simply make sure that if they don&#x27;t, nobody would want to use their product. Who would buy a CPU they don&#x27;t know the ISA of?Forcing the separation between software and hardware companies may be more stringent, but it may be simpler to enforce, and likely even more effective at making sure the hardware is humanely specified than direct regulation would be. reply amelius 13 hours agoparentprevYes, and I&#x27;d also like hardware and software companies to not have access to my data.

Do you think corporations were the ones doing the lynching?Even in the context of the extreme hyperbole of this entire comment chain, your analogy is pretty extreme and does not make sense. Jim Crow laws weren&#x27;t stopped by regulation, they were stopped by dismantling government enforced rules.And yes, it might sound crazy but individuals can actually decide what light bulb to buy or what computer to buy. And thinking so isn&#x27;t even remotely libertarian or hyper capitalist. We aren&#x27;t talking about labor rights or healthcare or other very asymmetric power imbalances.

These are all aggregates of hardware made by other companies. Yet they are also hardware. Being unable to develop such devices along with the firmware that runs them would make it more or less impossible to develop them at all. So where does \"hardware\" stop and \"device\" start? reply loup-vaillant 14 hours agorootparentLet&#x27;s say one wants to make hardware made of 3 pieces of hardware that talk to each other. They may need to write firmware to do that. At a first approximation, I would say one of the following should apply:Either the firmware can be modified by the user, or remotely, in which case it should not be shipped.Or it is an implementation detail of the communication between the 3 pieces of hardware, not reasonably modifiable without returning the whole thing to the factory, in which case that firmware is actually part of the 3-piece hardware, and can be shipped. reply crote 12 hours agorootparentBut it is often both. Just because it is essential for proper operation and therefore an implementation detail, doesn&#x27;t mean it cannot be updated.Even a device as trivial as a keyboard, mouse, or SSD drive has firmware which can be updated. Shipping them without firmware would be completely ludicrous, and you&#x27;d basically buy a fancy brick. Hell, you need to flash firmware onto it in the factory to make future updates by the user possible! reply loup-vaillant 10 hours agorootparentThe prudent manufacturer makes sure that some of the firmware is truly immutable, to prevent bricking the device if some firmware version is botched enough.I&#x27;m not proposing that no hardware ships with firmware. I&#x27;m proposing the hardware manufacturer choses: enable updates and don&#x27;t ship the parts that can be updated, or disable updates entirely. reply olliej 11 hours agoparentprevSo your saying apple would have to stop making operating systems?Or are you saying Qualcomm would be required to not provide drivers?This is a super dumb take, like beyond stupid, and I get that it’s directed at apple.Here’s the thing: since day 1 apple has been a hardware company, and what makes hardware good or bad is often the software that drives runs it.

On display as part of the Design Transforms exhibition at CSM during London Design Festival, MyPowerbank was designed to slot onto the chain of any Santander bicycle – rentable bikes provided by Transport for London – parked in one of the 800 docking stations across the capital. MyPowerbank is charged up using Santander city bikes Talbot's product takes advantage of the fact that, without having to pay to take out one of these bikes, their chain will still move when pedalling backwards. This can power up the tiny pedal-powered generator contained in the portable charger. The electricity generated in the process is then stored in MyPowerbank's internal batteries, with around 25 minutes of pedalling equating to one full phone charge. Luke Talbot created the design for London's homeless While most homeless people own a phone, Talbot conducted interviews with people sleeping rough across London and found that many struggle with finding a place where they can actually charge the device. This can restrict their access to crucial digital services, from texting and banking to applying for benefit schemes. The powerbank's gear is designed to slot onto the bike chain \"When they started bedding down at night, becoming rough sleepers, a phone was their biggest priority because without that everything is so much harder,\" he told Dezeen. \"Every facet of our daily life revolves around the convenience of what a phone can do for us, from Google Maps to transferring money to messaging our friends, which keeps us sane,\" he continued. \"They're just so life-or-death crucial.\" Read: ProxyAddress gives those facing homelessness a fixed address The project was born out of Talbot's research into how urban infrastructure, often designed to make life hard for homeless people, could be hacked for their benefit. In particular, his design was inspired by the blow-up homeless shelters of American artist Michael Rakowitz, which are inflated using buildings' hot air vents. \"I really fell in love with this idea of having this city that was designed against a certain group of people to segregate them socially, taking what the city gives away for free and using it against itself,\" he explained. An internal magnet connects the power bank to the bike's metal frame MyPowerbank works using an integrated dynamo like the kind commonly used to power bike lights, which turns kinetic energy from pedalling into electric energy. A small gear at the back of the device is designed to slot onto the bike's chain, while an internal magnet clips onto the metal frame. \"The chain spins that gear, the gear spins the dynamo and the dynamo charges the two lithium-ion batteries inside,\" Talbot said. \"The thing I like about it is that it's not new fancy tech, it's actually really old tech that's been reformatted for a new purpose.\" A full phone charge requires 25 minutes of pedalling Talbot's working prototype features a 3D-printed shell, finished in the same navy blue as the Santander bikes' frames so as not to draw undue attention, while instructions are printed in UV ink so they are legible at night. He built the dynamo from scratch using a Youtube tutorial and the two batteries, which each hold up to four full charges, are reclaimed from old powerbanks. After being named one of the winners at this year's MullenLowe NOVA Awards, Talbot is now using his prize money to help make the design production-ready and cut down on the pedalling time needed per charge. Talbot is hoping to get the design production-ready With components being sourced in bulk, he believes the powerbanks could be manufactured in collaboration with a charity or NGO for as little as £3 and distributed by homeless shelters to those who are most in need. \"Hopefully there'll be a circular repair system behind that so if it's broken, they could give it back to the shelter and the shelter would send it back to whoever ends up running it,\" Talbot said. Other standout projects from this year's London Design Festival include a traditional West African bench reimagined as a giant game of Oware, a handbag made from bacterial leather and a furniture collection crafted from a single car. Design Transforms was launched as part of London Design Festival and is on show at Central Saint Martins' Lethaby Gallery until 15 October.

Also regarding hand cranking: pedalling is almost surely far less strenuous and more efficient reply imtringued 10 hours agoparentprevDon&#x27;t tell me you have never used a hand crank. The bicycle dynamo thing is stupid, but at least the expectation is that you charge while you are on the go without thinking too much about it. It makes your bicycle slower, but that is about it. Meanwhile your idea requires hours upon hours of doing nothing but handcranking. reply mcpackieh 18 hours agoparentprev> USB hand crankAre any of those actually effective for charging a phone? I used to have a hand cranked radio, but radios built for this only need a minuscule amount of power. Does anybody have real experience using one of these to charge a phone? How long does it take? reply keep_reading 17 hours agorootparentI have an emergency radio &#x2F; USB-C battery combo thing with like 5000mah and the math on the hand crank says I&#x27;d have to crank it continuously for like 48 hours to charge it. It&#x27;s completely useless. I&#x27;d die from exertion just trying to charge it if I was stranded. reply kmeisthax 16 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t need to crank the whole 5000mAh, you just need to crank enough for your phone to get a phone call or two out, and that&#x27;s assuming the battery wasn&#x27;t already charged prior. reply mynameisvlad 16 hours agorootparentI mean, sure, the person you replied to wouldn’t but if this was your primary method of charging your device, as the original comment suggested, then you would need to crank the whole 5000mAh. Multiple times, since I assume you’ll want your phone charged more than twice. reply imtringued 10 hours agorootparentprevIf a phone call or two was enough to end homelessness then it would have ended a long time ago. reply Kirby64 14 hours agorootparentprev5000mAh battery at 3.7V nominal has roughly 18-20Wh of juice. Your crank would only be putting out 400mW of power if it truly took 48 hours to charge.Internet seems to think most hand cranks can output somewhere between 5-15W, which would mean you&#x27;d only take 1.3-4 hours to fully charge said pack. Plenty of juice in an emergency situation, and certainly plenty for a phone call or something. Maybe that&#x27;s a big giant crank thing though, and the tiny plastic crap ones only put out the wattage you&#x27;re talking about though. reply nimos 17 hours agorootparentpreviPhones charge at 20watts. Doing that sustained by hand is probably fairly tiring but would be trivial wattage for say biking. From my experience the hand crank radio&#x27;s would be pretty futile for charging a phone. There are some charging specific devices out there that can generate decent power.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;Powerhouse-Watt-Hand-Crank-Generator-Q... reply rzzzt 17 hours agorootparentThere was a video a few years ago in which a professional cyclist is connected to a generator (bike included) and their continuous power output was around 100 W which they could maintain for a few hours. But it would be unreasonable to expect this amount of exertion from an untrained person.Edit: weeeelll. I&#x27;m either thinking of a different one or completely messed up the numbers and duration: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;S4O5voOCqAQ reply nimos 17 hours agorootparentAssuming my exercise bike wattage is accurate I think most decently fit people could average 100 watts for an hour with a bit of sweating but not like, full on panting. 20 watts is low enough that it&#x27;s awkward to generate that little power in terms of speed&#x2F;resistance. reply snovv_crash 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah, pro cyclists can put out 400W for an hour. The 20W it takes to charge a phone is less effort than walking, it&#x27;s honestly the bare minimum a grandma puts into a bike to get it to roll down the road. reply tmpX7dMeXU 20 hours agoparentprevComputer people have the biggest case of “everything looks like a nail”. reply netsharc 20 hours agoprevMan, when I saw \"hack\" I thought the Santander bikes are e-bikes, and the hack would be a device that leeches power off their batteries... reply op00to 19 hours agoparentSame!

I wonder if the dock also charges those? reply chedabob 17 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re powered by a dynamo, so probably only have the tiniest of batteries or capacitors necessary to keep the low-power lights on when not moving. reply kioleanu 19 hours agoparentprevNope just a fancier dynamo reply Waterluvian 20 hours agoprevHomeless people are known for having so much free time and energy that an hour of pedalling is a better solution than the two cents of wall power needed to charge things while they sit and correspond with potential employers, deal with paperwork, pay bills, figure out their kid’s school plans, and working out how to keep their healthcare without a full address.I dunno… this “idea” feels so ignorant that it’s basically offensive. reply gnsdrths 20 hours agoparentI&#x27;m American so as ignorant as I&#x27;m sure this sounds... Are the people who become homeless in London doing so for significantly different reasons than over here? Because most of the homeless in my city (a fairly large California coastal) aren&#x27;t significantly engaged in any of the things you&#x27;re alluding to and frankly would probably be happier with a bike that charged their phones since the ones who aren&#x27;t just living in tents outside the &#x27;clinic&#x27; typically roam the tourist districts to pan handle. The main issue I imagine that might be inconvenient for them is the ease of theft. reply Waterluvian 20 hours agorootparentI’m not sure of the demographics in your region but are you sure your perception of homelessness is correct? Or is it just a bias where you only see the ones who aren’t busy trying to dig out? reply gnsdrths 20 hours agorootparentMost of the homeless in my city migrated here from outside of the city (and often State) to come here for our weather, services, and lax attitude towards drug use as far as demographics go. We&#x27;re a navy town so there&#x27;s also a tragic sub-group of veterans with mental health issues but the bulk of our homeless (we actually use the term \"transient\" as side context) don&#x27;t fall into this category and mainly came here for the conveniences. I&#x27;m sure there are some who are trying to \"dig out\" as you say but it&#x27;s certainly not most of them and for the ones who aren&#x27;t trying to do so a bike with charging capabilities would be both a mobility boost (again assuming theft wasn&#x27;t a concern) and a general utility boost (smartphones are largely ubiquitous amongst our homeless and are actually extremely valuable as tools since they&#x27;re both navigation aids and access points for online services offered to them in my city). This is why I was asking what the demographics of the homeless in London are like since if they resemble our population then the bike wouldn&#x27;t be such a terrible idea (but I&#x27;m also still unsure about the practicality since while some of our homeless ride bikes most get around via public transit and so just putting chargers on busses would probably be more pragmatic as a service to them). reply gilleain 19 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know the demographic breakdown of London homelessness, but I do walk around the city (of Westminster) a lot and have read the Big Issue a fair bit. There are all sorts of reasons to be homeless in London, including (in no particular order):* Drug&#x2F;alcohol problems * Domestic abuse * Prison * Mental problems * Financial disasterObviously there is overlap between these, and some can cause the others. Also note that being &#x27;homeless&#x27; does not just include literally sleeping on the streets (as many do) but also staying in temporary hostels, couch-surfing, and so on.London is not the sort of climate that it is comfortable to sleep outside, even in a tent. It is difficult to imagine many people that would be &#x27;transient&#x27; on the street given any alternative options. Of course it is possible, and there are long-term homeless people who might even plausibly enjoy some of the benefits of the &#x27;freedom to live under a bridge&#x27;, but I _suspect_ the majority are in a very bad place and want to get out of it. reply blacksmith_tb 16 hours agorootparentprevThe statistics I&#x27;ve seen (on California[1]) suggest that homeless folks are generally locals, not migrants? But I agree that just providing some usb ports on public transit (likely also in stations or at stops) would be a low-cost&#x2F;high-benefit approach. For human-powered approaches, I will say that old OLPC hand crank was a good design, since it clamped to a table or railing, which allowed for clever &#x27;hacks&#x27; like hoisting a bucket or water bottle and letting the weight coming down turn the shaft [2]. Still less practical than just plugging in, to be fair.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;californiahealthline.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;article&#x2F;california-hom...2: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.olpcnews.com&#x2F;hardware&#x2F;power_supply&#x2F;two_awesome_ex... reply mulmen 15 hours agorootparentI would love to see a USB port that can withstand public transit use. Just as a design exercise that would be fascinating. reply blacksmith_tb 7 hours agorootparentNot an EE, but my gut says \"modular, replaceable\" would be essential. As they wear out, have drinks spilled in them, etc. someone with only hand tools should be able to pop them out and slot in new working ones (probably with minimal security bolts, just to keep bored riders with pocket screwdrivers taking them apart). reply summarity 6 hours agorootparentprevThat’s standard in say Berlin busses. Just a small pod with two connectors. Probably gets replaced once damaged enough. reply jeffbee 16 hours agorootparentprevEvery aspect of your statement is false and you can&#x27;t have gained this understanding from speaking to actual homeless people in California. California homeless are from their local area and they just ran out of money. This has been demonstrated over and over again. For example, of Alameda County&#x27;s 10k homeless individuals, 82% were living in Alameda County before they became homeless and 96% were living in California at that time. They don&#x27;t come to our county for the services, because there aren&#x27;t any. The idea that homeless people migrate around to find good weather and free stuff is just propaganda. No significant subpopulation of homeless people does that. reply denton-scratch 15 hours agorootparentNone of the homeless people in my town seem to be from here. They don&#x27;t speak with the local accent; they speak with the generic London \"druggie\" accent. (The local accent is quite easy to recognize)This is a nicer town than London, generally; at least, it is in the centre, where the homeless people concentrate. The police seem very tolerant of homeless tent-dwellers. There was a small encampment around the corner from where I live, camped directly outside the courthouse and opposite the police station (!), for about two months. I found them rather intimidating - they were very shouty. reply HWR_14 10 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d imagine panhandling gets money that the desperately need. It&#x27;s not an idle activity that can be replaced by \"generate electricity\" at no cost to them. reply tmpX7dMeXU 20 hours agorootparentprevI’m all but certain that this says a lot more about perception than the actual attributes of people sleeping rough in your area. reply exabrial 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m all but certain you&#x27;re certain you&#x27;re incorrect.I would invite you to do a ride along with your local police, local EMS &#x2F; Fire Rescue if allowed, to develop a more informed opinion, as they spend a significant amount of time interacting with the homeless population. reply enragedcacti 14 hours agorootparentHave you considered that people who are called specifically to emergency situations might not have the most representative sampling? reply DANmode 9 hours agorootparentPossibly a better view than the rose-colored glasses perspective many have from viewing the \"comfortable\" homeless.No one&#x27;s perception of the homeless in these discussions seem to take into account the person that died last week, I guess is what I&#x27;m getting at. replyvidarh 19 hours agoparentprevNote that the person who made this actually interviewed homeless people about whether or not this was a problem beforehand. Whether that extended to running the idea past them to see if they thought it was helpful as well, I don&#x27;t know, but that he even bothered to listen in the first place makes it stand out. reply FollowingTheDao 19 hours agoparentprevAs someone who is homeless, I agree. This is a solution looking for a problem.Most people do not know how easy it is to access a power source in most towns and cities. reply GaryNumanVevo 15 hours agoparentprevnot to mention, making someone who&#x27;s probably food insecure spend calories pedaling to make 2 cents of power is pretty bleak reply imtringued 10 hours agoparentprevI completely agree.

Instead, pull yourself up by the bootstraps and pedal your way to being a participant in the rat race!” reply londons_explore 21 hours agoprevNice prototype, but it doesn&#x27;t actually work does it?Turns out that to transfer any significant torque (and therefore energy), you need either a larger gear, or a larger subtended angle, or a higher chain tension - and ideally all three.Since this device has none of those, I can be pretty confident that even after hours of pedalling, you won&#x27;t have a charged phone. In fact, the video even shows the chain jumping showing that the generator gear isn&#x27;t turning. reply ecshafer 19 hours agoparentThat seems like par for the course in this day and age. A nice sentiment and idea, but it doesnt actually work. But that doesn’t stop it from going on the cv and a small marketing push about it. reply Groxx 20 hours agoparentprevProbably also can&#x27;t use magnets that can slide along the axis of power transfer... there&#x27;s no way this works as designed.I do like the base idea of \"why not just use the machines that are already idle everywhere\" though. reply diydsp 18 hours agoparentprevYour comments about the gear size, etc. are interesting, but I don&#x27;t see how they&#x27;re strictly necessary. Can you explain? For example, can&#x27;t an arbitrarily small gear work as long as the force contributing to the torque is sufficient? And isn&#x27;t the force a product of the driving force (human leg&#x2F;crank) and the load on the generator? And we can&#x27;t see the load on the generator, so there may well be step-up gearing and high-flux motor inside the housing?BTW, I respect your project at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;omattos.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;gym-power.htmlI have also worked with human-powered generators (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=huYJa2Du57g) and made a quick feasibility spreadsheet on the MyPowerbank at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1X39ZgL86tmemdYv0r1Jg...From my spreadsheet, this project looks plausible, but please feel free to add comments to it as you see fit.My spreadsheet&#x27;s calcs indicate an average power of about 25 Watts to reach the 25 minute charging time claim. Note that average humans can easily sustain 100 Watts. I have assumed an iPhone 12 battery as that&#x27;s the first that came up when I searched: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=ihpone+...As far as the shaking chain, note also that the device base is shaking so we can not directly infer the cog idler pulley-cum-prime-mover is not also moving.In my experience with human-powered generators, the real obstacle was getting people to relax and focus and do nothing for longer than 2 minutes. reply dazc 19 hours agoprevMost homeless people in the UK will be aware that they can charge phones in any public library.Also, most will have access to some kind of facility where they can also do stuff such as charge phones, have a shower and do laundry.If you present to the local authority as homeless you will usually be directed to a local charity that has these facilities. You will, likely, stay homeless but there is some basic help out there. reply WarOnPrivacy 19 hours agoparent> Most homeless people in the UK will be aware that they can charge phones in any public library. ..have access to some kind of facility to charge phones, have a shower and do laundry.You describe a different universe from US homelessness.

Rather than expecting those without homes to pedal for basic access to services, access to basic infrastructure like charging should be expanded – and dare I say, be bold and actually make housing available to all people. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 13 hours agorootparentHaving to stay there while charging would still be a hurdle. Do they typically offer e.g. code-locked charging cabinets where you can leave a phone or power bank, or power bank swaps where they would lend (or give) away standardized power banks that could then be exchanged for full ones when empty? reply afavour 20 hours agoparentprevIt’s definitely more of an attention grab than practical solution. Doesn’t invalidate it though. reply fullspectrumdev 16 hours agoparentprevShelters in the UK have a pretty bad rap in some cities (including London) among the homeless.Also yes, it’s an art project by an art student at CSM (an art college). reply tgsovlerkhgsel 13 hours agorootparentI understand why people don&#x27;t want to stay there, but shelters could also provide \"walk-in\" services like swapping an empty power bank for a full one. reply fullspectrumdev 12 hours agorootparentThey could and&#x2F;or should, but many shelters basically are night shelter only - you get kicked out in the morning.There’s nowhere near enough drop in daytime places to charge a phone or access internet or get help with paperwork, etc.there also a shortage of places that will let you open a mailbox&#x2F;use the address to get postage.You would be amazed at how much difference it makes being able to receive a letter at an address - it’s vital for a lot of services still. reply bluescrn 14 hours agoprevThis seems about the most ridiculous way possible for a homeless person to charge a phone.If phone charging is really something that&#x27;s been overlooked by the many organisations trying to help the homeless already, it&#x27;s just a matter of providing a space with mains power and a few chargers - maybe homeless shelters, churches, or community centres, and letting people know where+when this is available.But I&#x27;d imagine that this is already a thing, and there&#x27;s not really a need for silly contraptions?(Then try to draw attention to the problem of phones with non-user-replaceable batteries, as the world has a vast supply of inexpensive older phones, but they&#x27;re no use to anybody if the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge...) reply EdSchouten 21 hours agoprevWhat’s the advantage of using those bicycles, as opposed to just having a crank on it? Pedaling a bicycle backwards isn’t really ergonomic. reply londons_explore 20 hours agoparentRegular humans can put out ~100 watts on a dual foot crank (like a bicycle) for hours. Since a phone battery is ~12 Watt-hours, you can collect energy for a full phone charge in ~10 mins (but you&#x27;ll need a special buffer battery, since few lithium cells can charge that fast).Yet on a single hand crank, even 20 watts and you&#x27;ll get tired pretty quick.Part of that is that leg muscles are bigger. Part of it is that you&#x27;re used to walking or standing for long periods of time. Part of it is that with a dual crank you aren&#x27;t putting useless effort into holding the device up and holding the weight of your own arms up.End result: Hand cranks are useless unless you only need tiny amounts of energy out of a human. reply bee_rider 20 hours agorootparentIt looks like the device even includes a little battery; I wonder if it holds enough charge to charge a phone battery fully, or if it just needs to be active charged for a while.This is definitely more about the message, but actually, if a person could pedal pretty hard for like a half hour and get a couple charges out of it, that doesn’t see too impractical (ignoring the obvious objections, like usually coffee shops will let you get a little charge).It could be a nice camping accessory. I bet a product already exists. reply londons_explore 19 hours agorootparentSuch a product does already exist (with a hand crank).The buffer battery is needed because phones generally don&#x27;t like having variable voltage&#x2F;current to charge from. They normally choose what speed they wish to charge at (depending on charger type), and if they can&#x27;t draw their desired current and the voltage drops then they stop charging entirely.Also, humans generally expect a crank to have constant torque. Whereas if you wanted constant charge power, then the faster you crank the easier it gets, and conversely the slower you go the stiffer it gets, which is very unintuitive.By using a buffer battery, you can solve both problems. And users can choose to crank faster to charge the buffer quicker, which is what humans expect. reply EdSchouten 16 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t doubt you can generate ~100 watts cycling forward for hours. But the approach this system uses is that you need to cycle backwards. As far as I know, that&#x27;s pretty annoying way to move your legs. reply helsinkiandrew 21 hours agoparentprevThis is an art&#x2F;design project by an undergraduate student - not necessarily a serious product. But I wonder if cycling backwards is still easier than using a hand crank reply londons_explore 20 hours agorootparentI made a bidirectional pedalling exercise bike. Turns out there isn&#x27;t much difference between forwards and backwards, but you do need to adjust the seat back by about 6 inches if you want maximal power output for backwards pedalling. reply mytailorisrich 21 hours agorootparentprevUsing a hand crank for 30 minutes? Nah... pedaling will definitely be easier. reply helsinkiandrew 4 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s actually what I meant. reply helpfulContrib 21 hours agoparentprevBicycles are among the most efficient energy conversion systems human-kind has ever invented .. the difference between a single lever (which, after all, is still an option with the existing design) and a bicycle lever&#x2F;gear system, means all the difference in the world when the calories are, already, a regular daily concern for the target user.Plus, it gives the bikes utility when they&#x27;re not being rented, since the rental bays often take up space in areas accessible to the homeless, its also quite convenient for the target users. reply extraduder_ire 20 hours agorootparentThis doesn&#x27;t use the gear system though. (aside from the large front sprocket driving the smaller one on the device)I&#x27;m quite surprised it can be built for £3, unless the battery is incredibly small. reply helpfulContrib 20 hours agorootparentI believe there is also a social element to this, as it is rather an unfortunately overlooked detail that bike-rental bays are often installed by businesses throughout metropolitan regions as a means of discouraging the homeless, who cannot afford to use these devices, which storage after all consumes public space .. giving the homeless a way to extract value from things is, in my opinion, an admirably placed bit of design altruism, and I, for one, hope to see many more examples of this kind of thinking.I have often wondered what sort of conversion it would take to use an AK47 and a box of ammo to drill a well&#x2F;pump water, instead of suppress human beings.. transformative technology is highly interesting, don&#x27;t you agree?>I&#x27;m quite surprised it can be built for £3, unless the battery is incredibly small.Herein lies the rub - can the homeless build these things for £1 a piece, somewhere in London?Because if the answer is more oil-based traffic across the worlds oceans to get these things made, I&#x27;m afraid the irony of the builder&#x2F;user distinction is rather unfortunate... reply SV_BubbleTime 19 hours agorootparentprevThat cost would be at a volume no one would ever produce this at. reply Brian_K_White 18 hours agorootparentWell, the volume could possibly exist if it weren&#x27;t limited to one city, or one model of bike. reply SV_BubbleTime 15 hours agorootparentNo, it couldn’t. This is all very dumb, it’s a fantasy product with no effective use targeting a population that didn’t ask or want it, done so that everyone can say it’s great which makes them feel like they are good people. reply Brian_K_White 13 hours agorootparentYes the specific object is dumb, both because it&#x27;s design has holes, and because there are better ways to get it&#x27;s ultimate function.But the market for something like that is not limited to the exact specific population of homeless in London. A thing like that could be produced in the volume necessary to get economy of scale, simply by not being limited to one city and a single particular model of bike, or even limited to the homeless for that matter.If you don&#x27;t understand that, then you are in a poor position from which to call anyone else dumb. replyop00to 19 hours agoprevOr you can do what NYC did and (sell the right to) put USB charging ports on every other block or so.

This can power up the tiny pedal-powered generator contained in the portable charger.The electricity generated in the process is then stored in MyPowerbank&#x27;s internal batteries, with around 25 minutes of pedalling equating to one full phone charge. reply khaki54 19 hours agoprevThere is approx zero chance that you can get a homeless person to do labor for 20 minutes, let alone the 2-5 hours this would actually take. By and large homeless are in such despair that they won&#x27;t invest in activities that will benefit them in the future.If by some miracle this actually took off and all the bikes were now in use by homeless, non-paying customers, bike rental companies would implement blocking measures so they could actually get revenue.If the author used his resources and energy deliberately to get even a single homeless person back on track through conventional means, it would have a better impact on the world than this which is probably a net negative, all things considered. reply kingTug 19 hours agoparentIn America, about half of the homeless population is employed. \"Homeless won&#x27;t do labor\" is a common misnomer. reply dazc 19 hours agoparentprevI think you have a limited of view of what being homeless is actually like? Walking around 30 miles a day (because there is nothing else to do and, sometimes, you may otherwise freeze to death) with your belongings in a backpack isn&#x27;t exactly easy. reply WarOnPrivacy 19 hours agoparentprev> There is approx zero chance that you can get a homeless person to do labor for 20 minutes, let alone the 2-5 hours this would actually take.And yet homeless people do labor. In fact routine living often requires much, much, much more labor when homeless, than when housed.They even have jobs. I worked when I was homeless (but was fired when they found out). That was long ago. Since then it&#x27;s more difficult to find work; job portals erased most job opportunities. Of the few folks willing to give you work, you have a segment who take advantage and act in bad faith. reply thefurdrake 18 hours agoprevI see a lot of people who are down on this. I read the comments before the article, which was perhaps a mistake, because I went into the article thinking this was a lot less clever than it actually is.This is neat. This may not be The Most Practical Solution, but the idea of having a thing that you can carry around and turn local bikes into power generation seems like a perfectly-reasonable invention for me.We&#x27;re talking about helping the homeless. They don&#x27;t need the minmaxxed optimal solution. Not every homeless person may have access to a power outlet-- I don&#x27;t know who wouldn&#x27;t be able to move enough to pedal a bike but not enough to get to a public library, but that&#x27;s really &#x2F;not the point&#x2F;. There are a lot of reasons that people end up homeless, and they can cause some really spotty&#x2F;unreliable behavior.There&#x27;s nothing wrong with adding ideas&#x2F;solutions to the mix. There&#x27;s no need for a concept like this to replace other solutions. We can use all the viable solutions at the same time. reply serpix 21 hours agoprevA wall socket can be found just about anywhere, if you really need power quick there are fast charging powerbanks. reply helpfulContrib 21 hours agoparentHomelessness is a serious subject, especially in a city like London. The assumption that the homeless masses all have access to a powerbank, or a wall socket in one of the cities most notorious for class boundaries, is rather coarse.. perhaps you might at least think of it as more of a survival device for those who are using their bicycles to get far, far away from the grid .. reply dmw_ng 21 hours agorootparentPlenty of locations that used to be BT phone boxes were replaced with pillars featuring WiFi and USB charging. Is this not pretty widespread?This device seems a bit.. daft. Renting a Santander cycle costs 1.65 GBP. Add the high energy food required to supplement your diet after a 30 minute ride and this is looking closer to 3 or 4 quid for a phone charge, and that&#x27;s before considering where the homeless person is going to securely stow their belongings while cycling. Luggage storage in Victoria is 5 GBP for 3 hours.. reply jebarker 21 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t have to pay to rent the bike. The homeless person attaches the devices and then peddles on it stationary in the dock. reply vidarh 19 hours agoparentprevFrom the article:\"While most homeless people own a phone, Talbot conducted interviews with people sleeping rough across London and found that many struggle with finding a place where they can actually charge the device.\"So apparently at least part of the homeless disagree with you. reply SgtBaker 19 hours agoparentprevMost places that are available to you and me aren&#x27;t necessarily available to homeless people and some modern cities are getting more and more hostile architecture built to make life harder for homeless people.It might be a niche thing (it&#x27;s a gradschool project after all), but it&#x27;s pretty cool way to exploit things that are not supposed to be available for use. reply mytailorisrich 21 hours agoparentprevIt is illegal to use a socket without permission and there aren&#x27;t that many sockets accessible outdoor. reply devoutsalsa 20 hours agorootparent“So how did you end up here in prison?”“I was charging my phone :(“ reply mytailorisrich 19 hours agorootparentThe fact is that this is an offence [1]It does not help homeless people or anyone to suggest they should break the law.This device that uses bike chains is a bit cheeky but it is a smart idea and it should be legal, or at least not a crime (ianal). So nice, clever hack.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Abstracting_electricity reply op00to 19 hours agorootparentprevI for one live in fear of the storm trooper squads that come after you plug your charger into an unattended wall socket.In my major Northeast US city, there are wall sockets on the outside of most buildings (if you know where to look), on every car of the subway&#x2F;bus, in public concourses, etc. reply snvzz 14 hours agorootparentYet, Isn&#x27;t using them w&#x2F;o permission illegal? reply fullspectrumdev 16 hours agoparentprevNot my experience in London tbh. It’s hard to find a power outlet somewhere that you don’t need to pay some sum of money to spend time in. Which makes it a problem for the homeless. reply tgdnt 20 hours agoprevThis has to be a joke. reply version_five 19 hours agoprevI have an emergency radio with crank for power outages. I know it probably takes a lot of cranking to charge a phone, but I think that would reduce complexity and make it more universal than having to occupy a specific kind of bike sharing bike reply cultofmetatron 15 hours agoparentyou&#x27;d be cranking for two days straight to charge up your phone. reply Eumenes 17 hours agoprevhomeless have iphones? reply fullspectrumdev 16 hours agoparentYes.Just because you become homeless, doesn’t mean you lose every single item you own.A phone is one of the more useful&#x2F;valuable possessions for a homeless person - you need some kind of internet&#x2F;telephone device to engage with the services that can help you, for navigation, etc etc reply tiahura 21 hours agoprev [12 more] [flagged] circuit10 20 hours agoparentThese are people with a life and feelings and needs just as much as you. If you were in a rough situation and needed some help, how would it feel to have people dehumanise you with comments like this as if you’re some sort of pest and just want you to go away somewhere else instead of helping? reply gruez 20 hours agorootparentAll of this is easy to say when you&#x27;re personally not affected by them. reply circuit10 20 hours agorootparentBut is that really a good enough reason to dehumanise people? Because them existing annoys you? reply dmbche 20 hours agorootparentprevHow do \"they\" affect you, poor soul? reply mcpackieh 18 hours agorootparentHours of blood-curdling screaming in the middle of the night, waking up people who are trying to get sleep before going to work. But I can tell from your tone that you&#x27;ve already decided you don&#x27;t care about anything the homeless might do to other people. reply NotYourLawyer 19 hours agorootparentprevThey shit and piss on the sidewalk. They yell profanities at people walking by. The (occasionally at least) assault people.How do they not affect you? reply helpfulContrib 21 hours agoparentprevMaybe the strategy should be more to incentivize people to live more safely and comfortably in nature and less in their boxes of inordinate consumption.Homelessness could become a good thing, if we get our tech right.(Disclaimer: Tree-hugging hippy who believes we should be dropping Kelly Kettles, not bombs..) reply sp332 21 hours agoparentprevAverage rent in London is over $2,000 per month. You don’t have to be a bum to be homeless. reply jebarker 21 hours agorootparentand median income in London appears to be ~41K GBP, so that rent would be about 80% of the income. No wonder there&#x27;s lots of homelessness. reply devoutsalsa 20 hours agorootparentIf you can’t buy boots, you can just buy the laces, so there’s no excuse to avoid pulling yourself up by your bootstraps #sarcasm reply Sakos 21 hours agoparentprev [–] Yes, the solution must be to redirect homeless elsewhere so they&#x27;re no longer your problem, instead of actually helping people. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
