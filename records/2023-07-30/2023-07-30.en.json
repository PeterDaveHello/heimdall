    "commentBody": "If we want a shift to walking we need to prioritize dignity (streets.mn)516 points by PaulHoule 19  560 commentsdegrews 15 hours ago | next [–] I moved from Spain to the US, and I often find myself trying to explain to people back home just how miserable and even humiliating the pedestrian experience is here.Here are some other examples of things that I think contribute to the hostile walking experience in the US:* Cars parked in short driveways often extend all the way across the sidewalk. Even if you can easily step off onto the road to walk around them (not all pedestrians can), it just feels like a slap in the face to have to do that.* Cars have much higher and stronger headlights, with the high beams often left on, and drivers are generally much less mindful of them. As a pedestrian walking at night on under-lit streets, you are constantly getting blinded.* Tinted windows (even the mild level of tint that most cars in the US have). The whole experience of being a lone vulnerable pedestrian among a sea of cars is made even worse when you can't see the people in the cars (but you know they can see you).* Often the only option to get food late at night are fast food places, which become drive-thru only after a certain time. Having to go through the drive-thru on foot is obviously a terrible experience, and they will often refuse to even serve you.replytvaughan 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] > I often find myself trying to explain to people back home just how miserable and even humiliating the pedestrian experience is here.Same. I’ve lived in Los Ángeles and Amsterdam, and it is impossible to explain to my friends and family just how awful the quality of life is in LA precisely because of the difference in attitudes and priorities over cars. Perhaps some have “nicer” (aka bigger) houses in LA than they would have in Ámsterdam, but once they leave their front door everything is objectively worsereplysershe 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Subjectively worse, not objectively worse. I think driving is much more convenient and nice for most things I like to do. The only exceptions I can think of are if I were a kid in a car-centric area (strangely, the thinking in the US is usually reversed, kids supposedly need to be in the burbs), or if I was drunk. I don't often get drunk, so I'd prefer to drive for everything from minor groceries to outdoor activities ~100% of the time.replyaesclepius 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Jesus it's objectively worse. NY/Chicago/London/Paris/Tokyo you can conceivably and easily nip out to a grocer's, bodega, cafe or pub within 10 minutes of where you are. LA? Outside of certain certain pockets like DTLA, KTown, WeHo or similar walking is tough and if your friend is across town you're SoL without a car.replysershe 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] But I don't want to! I literally just walked to the store and it was in absoute perfect conditions - we wanted to go for a walk anyway, the weather is perfect (sunny but not hot), the store is 10min walk from my house, the neighborhood is nice and not drive-thru so there is ~0 non-local traffic. The plan was we go for a walk, and pop by a store and get one item. But as usual it never ends up being that way, so we had one paper bag of items - 6 pack of beer, some cheese, box of blueberries, nothing very heavy.I am pretty fit, like I deadlift 280lbs :) and still walking with this stupid bag ruined the whole walk back. And it wasn't even much - if I replaced beer with food it would be like, 2-3 days worth.I would have rather just finished the walk, then drove 3mins to the same store. In the most perfect conditions imaginable, with minimal amount of groceries. And what if it was 100F, or 32F, or raining, or I didn't want to go for a walk, or I needed to get some large items like sugar or rice or a gallon of milk or a lot of beer for a party?Walking to a store is simply not an advantage at all. And if you go to even a poor country you can see most people agree - as soon as they can they start driving to big box stores, and small local stores die.And regardless, even if (which I wouldn't grant) the majority would prefer to walk rather than drive, it's still SUBJECTIVE, not OBJECTIVE. A ton of people prefer to drive.replySamoyedFurFluff 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not gonna lie, having a 10 minute walk ruined by carrying a bag home sounds like you maybe need to deadlift less and cardio more or something. Or maybe get better bags?Walking to stores is an advantage because it allows for a density of services unavailable if parking lots are a serious consideration for businesses. I can go to my local convenience store, and my barber, and a no-waste shop, and my local bar, all in one pleasant morning… plus I don’t have to worry about a dui!replySoftTalker 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah if you're going to walk with groceries, use a mesh or canvas bag with handles, or a grocery basket/cart if you're buying more than a few items. Carrying paper bags sucks because you have to hold them in your arms and support the bottom of the bag.replywheels 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In many countries adults just continue to wear backpacks. One of the things I keep in my backpack is a big IKEA bag, meaning I'm pretty set for shopping on foot (or bike, which is more common for me). Medium sized purchases go in the backpack, larger things go in the IKEA bag.replysershe 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I mountaineer too, it's just a chore to walk with groceries, esp. if the weather is bad and you have to do it every 3 days given how little one can carry.I think I mentioned the drinking aspect in the original comment. I could do all of these things by car, probably faster too... except drinking. So I guess it depends on how often one drinks :)replymaxbond 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The paper bags they give you are terrible, they're barely fit to walk to the car with. They always fall apart on the walk home, and the ergonomics suck too. But with any reasonable bag I find it's not a big deal.replyjstarfish 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm of the impression paper bags are not meant to be carried. As long as I've been alive, they always break.I suspect they're simply supposed to be a bundling device so you can stack them for loading in one of those foldable vertical bring-your-own-grocery-cart like old ladies in urban areas use. They certainly can't carry all that crap in-hand either, but this is the only way I've seen paper-bagged groceries make it more than a block without drama.replyspixy 22 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Then go there with some backpack.I have a store in same building than my flat (but other side), and it is the best. Dont need to have car, dont need to worry about DUI...100F (38C) is here twice maybe per year? Cannot you survive 38C for a few minutes?If it is 32F (0C). I just put warm clothes on? 32F is not very cold temperature anyway.Raining = umbrella (but I go without it, 2 minutes of rain wont kill me).How many times a year do you host a party? For me its just once a year (birthday), I just go to store multiple times.But I understand that your store is 10 min walk which sucks. I guess your city is not dense enough.replyitsanaccount 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This is the kind of comment that makes me entirely support the tire deflators. The kind ones who unscrew the valve stem, and the less kind ones who use a box cutter.They will drive in their little bubbles until the planet boils unless you physically stop them. \"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\"replypraxulus 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm an anti-car urbanist, but this kind of comment makes me embarrassed to be one. Different people like different things. The fact that something is bad for the climate doesn't magically make it unpleasant for everyone. That remains true even if they accept the climate impacts.It's true that the inevitable conclusion is that we can't rely on individual voluntary actions to solve climate change, but the obvious plan B is government regulation, not vigilantism.replysershe 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] From my comment: \"Now, you could argue that global warming is bad / enough freeways cannot be built / etc., sure. Maybe we cannot have nice things.But don't argue that people want to live in urban paradise and some contrived system is simply not giving them what they want. \"I just don't like the hypocrisy.However, it's the comments like this that make me think that for any equivalent level of far-, left is worse than right. The right wants to decide how you should live your life; so does the left, but the left does it in this vindictive, holier-than-thou ninny kind of way ;)replymaxbond 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm sorry this person was rude to you, but I think you're extrapolating far too much. People on the right have their own infuriating comments they make, I would hazard a guess you may not notice them because they aren't directed at you.One I've had tossed at me during a discussion is, \"if you aren't a socialist when you're 20, you have no heart, but if your still a socialist when you're 50, you have no head.\" This isn't \"holier than thou\" per say, but it serves the same rhetorical role, it's smug nonsense from someone thinking that they just know so much better than you that time's steady march will make their argument for them (and so they don't have to address what you've said or treat you ).Frankly, I also see people using the same tropes as in your comment mischaracterize substantive points as being whining or moralizing.I would say the problem is that as a society, we don't understand how to conduct a productive discourse. I'm pretty sure we never have and have just been muddling through for millenia.Believe me, I'd love it if being left wing meant the people I disagreed with online weren't frequently rude or vindictive, but I'm afraid I share your experience.replyLampDrewNear 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You can still drive perfectly well in walkable cities.And maybe it's just a TV trope, but do your paper bags lack handles? In Europe essentially all grocery bags have handles and are easy to carry. The amount of food you bought sounds easy to me to carry home, and I don't even lift.replysershe 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's a tradeoff - the argument is about car vs walking infrastructure, and while it's nice to have both I'd prefer to lose the latter if I had to make a choice. Driving in Amsterdam is... inconvenient. At least in central areas, I've never been far out.They have handles, it's still just inconvenient to carry and makes a nice walk into a chore, vs driving with much more groceries per trip.replymakapuf 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Problem is, current level of car usage is absolutely unsustainable with current co2 emissions targets, even with electric cars if they use coal.replysershe 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What about electric cars with nuclear power or renewables? In any case the argument is not about that. It's one thing to say \"we cannot sustain the CO2 emissions / we cannot build enough highways for everyone so sorry, we cannot have some of the nice things anymore\", but that's not what the above says.It is also ok to express an opinion that car-free living is better for some people, or argue that most people prefer it, although I think that is self-evidently incorrect, cause as per IMF data I linked somewhere here, one of the first things people all over the world do when they get any richer (like, $2.5k-10k per capita income) is buy a lot of cars.But the above is saying it's OBJECTIVELY better. Other than just being wrong, that betrays the kind of \"I know exactly how everyone should live their lives, and I would make them if I could\" attitude that I hate.replylabster 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Climatologist here, basically everything is unsustainable if you use coal power. If we’re lucky we can keep steel production and that’s about it.replymakapuf 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] So we'll still be able to build steel bike frames ;)replyyawaramin 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Sounds like you need one of those walker bags with wheels. It would make grocery walks much easier.replyslifin 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Sounds like you need a walking trolley for groceriesIt's like a bag with wheels you can drag, that was my immediate thought anywayThere's tons of micro mobility that could have also helpedreplyEarthMephit 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That's because 10 minutes away is too far, that's almost a mile, and it becomes a chore.I live a block from a store, and its much, much easier and more plesant than going to the effort of getting the car out, driving somewhere, having to find a parking spot, etc... Driving's a pain in the arse.A decently walkable suburb/city would have a store within a block or two, maybe a five minute walk.replywebkike 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] When you live closer to grocery stores, you buy less food more often. I live two blocks away from the grocery store, I go fairly frequently, and I never have an issue with the weight I’m carrying. And I deadlift the same as youreplyfoooorsyth 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I agree with your general point about the romanticization of no-car life. I grew up without a car in a walkable city. It was nice but there are legitimate trade offs.My mom used a wheelie cart to do our shopping growing up. As a kid I thought it was embarrassing but now I get it. Cargo bikes are another good option. Having to carry home groceries without some sort of cargo apparatus like that does suck, even in nice weather.replyescapedmoose 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Walking to the store is great when it’s a habit to do so every day, so you’re just picking up some fresh meat and produce for whatever dinner you’re making that night. It’s a very pleasant (and healthy) lifestyle. For trips where you need to make larger and heavier purchases, it’s also very enjoyable to bike.replyulfw 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This is exactly why I lived in Santa Monica when I lived in LA. One of the few walkables cities in the area (not all of SaMo mind you. Just talking about the area between Ocean and say 7th or 8th)replyburnished 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Normally I'd agree with your pedantry, but seriously have you been to LA? \"Objective\" feels like the right qualifier in this casereplysershe 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I've visited, although didn't spend much time in the city itself. I think it's not amazing for me cause other amenities LA has are not the type of stuff I need or enjoy, and there's a huge number of people who do need and enjoy them making the place really crowded. On the other hand, Amsterdam wouldn't be my first choice for similar reason (I've visited a couple times).If choosing between areas that either are less crowded, or have all the stuff I enjoy, I'd prefer an LA-like one to an Amsterdam-like one.replybadtension 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Objectively we are still animals that need at least some movement. The environment described by the parent is hostile to our most basic needs.replysershe 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I find I'd much rather drive to the mountains, or a lake, or at least a nice big park, and recreate there. Walking to a store in Amsterdam or Munich or Vancouver or Moscow was neither much fun nor a lot of exercise.replytempaccount1234 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] As a European who owns both a car and a bike, regularly driving somewhere just to do a bit of walking there feels like a complete waste of resources to me. I use my car for work related travel, at distances over 5 miles or to move heavy stuff. For anything else the default choice (which includes grocery shopping) is walking or biking. Amsterdam has great bike paths, I’d probably cycle even more there.replybadtension 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I am not talking about spending the leisure time but the amount of movement we need every day just to keep our bodies healthy. Sitting all the time is detrimental to us.replykaibee 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > I find I'd much rather drive to the mountains, or a lake, or at least a nice big park, and recreate there.This is not a sustainable solution to population level health needs, even if maybe in your particular situation you do actually get enough vacation days and free time on weekends to be able to do this (I also doubt this).replysershe 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well, a more sustainable solution is everyone exercising at home whenever they want in the way they want, or going for a run around the block. Going to the store by car + going for a run, is still faster and more convenient than walking to the store (per unit of exercise - e.g. driving to the store 10 times and running 2 miles vs walking 0.2 miles to the store).replyehnto 18 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] A gym is a great example of how we tend to support parts of life communally when we can live more densely.For me the competing requirements are space for gym equipment and space for a workshop. I could have space for both if I lived further out, but then all other aspects of life would get worse. I'd have to drive constantly, to work, to social outings, to fun weekend stuff, it'd be a drag.As you are pointing out though, we all have our tradeoffs we make. My only counterpoint would be that most cities are doing a terrible job of offering options to people who do want the more dense, \"less car\" communities.replysagarm 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] In the real world, people in cities are healthier because physical activity is integrated into their daily routine.replynimbleplum40 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Build roads through natural environments is pretty bad for wildlife though and really harms the environment. It’s definitely not sustainable.replygodzillabrennus 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You mirror my sentiments. I greatly enjoy my time in my car. I rather have a bigger home and drive to recreation areas.replysershe 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Personally I don't even like driving :) To me it's a minor annoyance, like washing the dishes. But it's just SO much more convenient, so it's worth it.replyrewmie 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I'm not sure you noticed you actually said you'd rather have enjoyable but infrequent events in one place than basic mundane and recurring chores.A honest, objective comparison would be between going to a store in, say, LA or Amsterdam, and going to a lake or nice big park in LA or Amsterdam.In Amsterdam, you can go to stores on foot without any issue. Not in LA.In LA you need to drive for hours to go to any of the nice spots you listed. In Amsterdam you can walk to a nice park or a nice lake, and for the same amount of time you need to drive in LA to reach any decent spot, in Amsterdam you can actually reach at least two different countries, and by train you can reach spots like Paris.replysershe 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Going to the store - I'd prefer to drive in LA on an average day of the year.For the mid-range activities we have to compare like with like. For some low-mid range activity (like a local park) indeed, walking in Amsterdam would be more convenient. Something more remote/infrequent (e.g. a specialized gym like a climbing gym or a large pool), I'd prefer to drive rather than take transit.As for the surrounding area it doesn't really depend on the city itself, LA is surrounded by desert and mountains, Amsterdam is in one of the most historically agriculturally productive (and so, densely populated for centuries) and flat areas in Europe. If LA was built like Amsterdam, it'd still take forever to get anywhere interesting outside of the city.replymakeitdouble 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] A thought exercice: would you enjoy living in a 3x bigger house and drive a small cart from room to room ? with a well adapted house it could be more convenient. Would it be nicer ?replysershe 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don't think this is very relevant. I would prefer to live in a 3x bigger house, but it would still be walkable.A reverse (also not very relevant) thought experiment - would you prefer to live in one room that is office/bedroom/bathroom/kitchen, just because you don't have to walk at all, everything is so close, why sprawl? :)replymakeitdouble 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] European and asian cities pretty much feel like a 10x - 20x bigger house for many.You walk down 2 blocks to get some milk and bread for the breakfast, post office is 3 blocks in the other direction, 1 block another way and you have fruits and vegetable. Basically you can treat the immediate surroundings as an extension of your house where you just \"go\" without a modal distinction of getting into a car, parking, back into the car, parking again.Even taking a bus or train feels less of a discontinuation as you just walk in walk out and at no point have to switch to a \"driver\" mode.replysershe 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I dunno, I used to feel this friction (I didn't use to drive until I was ~30), how driving is a thing and not driving is frictionless, but I think it was just psychological. It feels reverse now - the only frictionless places for ~everyone are grocery stores and such, cause they are everywhere. And maybe things you consciously live next to, like if you decide to live next to an olympic pool facility or a nightclub. Transit has pretty high fixed cost of getting anywhere, even in transit friendly placed like Munich or Moscow.. everything takes at least 30-40 minutes given to/from and wait times, any time of day. And that's if you don't have any transfers. I used to take it for granted but now when I look up transit directions it just weird to think it used to take so long and I thought it was normal.Whereas if you drive you can choose when to go and so make it convenient - like I go to a climbing gym at 6am in winter, no traffic and less people. Also, many things you don't even need to leave the house for - even with a relatively small house (1100sqft) I have room for a weight rack and home office, no need to go to a real office or to a gym.replygrecy 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Every time a politician anywhere in the world suggests adding more freeways or more lanes to freeways, I think they should be forced to live in LA for a year and do a ~1 hour commute each way in traffic.They need to see first hand what happens when you just add more freeways and more lanes. It's not good.replyfnimick 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I had a conversation recently with someone lamenting that we didn't have roads like LA here in Boston. Saying their ideal road was 3 lanes, plus a bike lane, plus a bus lane in each direction. Imagine being a pedestrian trying to cross that!I really don't understand someone who looks at that traffic disaster and wants to build the same thing here at home.replykevin_thibedeau 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] They're a car-centric person who wants the \"nuisance\" of bikes and busses out of their way while still pretending to have progressive values. People who only drive from garage to shopping center and back, never having to experience the dehumanizing impact of 6+ lanes affecting other transport modes.replycrooked-v 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That's someone who's never actually had to drive in LA traffic. I only had to visit once for the experience of 3 straight hours of gridlock traffic just to get across the city to be seared into my brain.replySlow_Hand 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I’ve lived in LA for five years now and lived in Boston for seven years prior. They’re both uniquely terrible.LA’s roads are easy to imagine because it’s synonymous with huge interstates, congestion, and long commutes.Boston is terrible because it’s layout makes zero intuitive sense and looks like spaghetti when viewed from the sky. Of course Boston predates the automobile, so I understand why.I do enjoy the prevalence of bike culture in Boston. It’s just the right size to pedal most places and there are fairly good accomodations for cycling, like bike lanes.But hey, at least I don’t live in Philadelphia. By far the worst driving experience each time I visit. :)replybrailsafe 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think this is exactly what Seattle is building at it's already awful waterfrontreplyGibbon1 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I feel like the more modes of transportation you mix together the worse the cognitive load on people. And it get rapidly worse the higher the density.Inside of a mall where there are only pedestrians is very safe. Freeways are fairly safe. Protected bike lanes are safe. Light rail is safe.Mix all of those on a strode, rail, buses, trucks, cars, bicycles, pedestrians, not safe.replyaxpy 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This seems pretty counter intuitive but this is often the other way around. The safest streets in Europe are where cars, bikes and pedestrian mix together. It force focus on the driving task instead of doing something else. If you are interested, Freakonomics have an episode: \"Why the U.S. so good at killing pedestrian\".

Going \"across town\" about 15 miles was a burden. You hated to do it. I then moved to a town that had a few freeways and 15 miles away was considered close. The town I grew up in, finally built some cross town roads, and travel time improved. I think you can have too many freeways, but you can definitely have to fewreplyescapedmoose 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I grew up in a similar place, which had too few freeways around it and navigating anywhere was a major headache. Now I live in a highly walkable town near a few freeways, and it’s much nicer; I can avoid driving altogether and walk/bike around town, or I can easily get to the nearby city by car. There’s a happy medium to be found.replyxmprt 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think the problem with the town you grew up in is that they didn't build any good modes of transportation and not that they didn't build freeways. Sure freeways can fix the problem of people getting from point A to point B, but they're probably one of the worse ways to go about it. Street cars, bus rapid transit, metros, etc., are all better across the board even for the people who do want to drive because it allows non-drivers to get to point B without a car, thereby clearing up traffic for the drivers.replychrismcb 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In a town that is very forward out, almost any form of public transportation is worse than cars.

But I drive a Vespa and am therefore limited to taking the side streets.I don’t mind it all that much, aside from the distance. One thing that helps is that motor bikes are permitted to split lanes and thus I can flow through congested traffic quite easily. It’s quite fun and I find that it allows me to enter a flow state more readily and it takes some of the edge off of the whole traffic experience because I get to keep moving.replyeredengrin 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I'd say split it half and half, 6 months LA to learn the pain of the wrong way, then 6 months in a place with proper transit like Amsterdam or Seoul, then they come back with a vision of what could be.replyPaulHoule 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] LA is by no means the worst that America has to offer. At least within a 1 hour radius you have a staggering population and amount of commerce available. People visiting LA from \"average\" places in the U.S. will note that it's really dense, about as dense as the outer boroughs of New York City. If it's \"sprawling\" it is not because it is uneconomical in the use of space but because the whole area that is habitable is crammed with people.In Southern New Hampshire people drive almost as far although there is hardly anything to drive to. The confluence of Route 101 and I-93 south of Manchester is as bad as anything you'll find in a city 100 times Manchester's size leaving the question of where the hell all these cars are coming from and where they are going.(The answer is that the population is dispersed over a large area with a hierarchical road network that, as much as possible, wants to be like your lungs. Thus you always get stuck in traffic at several bottlenecks on your drive that you can't avoid.)replymsla 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Los ÁngelesWhy the accent?

I've been to the nice Asian mega cities with great and clean subways and buses. And I've lived in the American suburbs. You can't make the American suburbs like the mega cities by just making them walkable.Everything in a mega city works together to make transit work. Those tall buildings? They provide great shade no matter how sunny it is which is critical for walking to bus stops and subway stations. Also, the walk itself is so much more interesting, random stores to stop at and places to eat and go to. Density makes transit work.You can't just put random stores in a suburb and make it \"walkable\" and expect the same thing. Just as everything in a mega city works together to make transit work, everything in a suburb works together to make cars work.We need to give up on the mass transit solutions that work for dense cities (subways and buses) for suburbs. It's a waste of money and completely the wrong solution. It hasn't worked for decades and never will.Shut down bus systems for suburbs and use the government funds to give out ride sharing (either Uber or government run) credits for everyone to use (low income can get more credits). That's what a suburb is designed for, point-to-point travel such as cars. And invest massively in real protected, useful bike lanes and stop trying to kill e-bikes with regulations (which a lot of cities are trying to do). e-bikes are finally a real alternative to cars in suburbs, it has just the right amount of travel speed and ease to challenge the car, but it's already under attack. Ride sharing credits and e-bikes, these are the solutions for suburbs. Stop trying to fit a square peg (buses and subways) into a round hole.replyytdytvhxgydvhh 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Tinted windows are such a pet peeve of mine. I get it in the tropics but in most of America the individual benefits of dark tint seem like they’d be outweighed by the collective good of better visibility through cars, enabling eye contact with drivers, etc.The SUV craze is really to blame - in general many US states don’t allow dark tint on traditional cars but do on SUVs. And since rear windows on vans and light trucks (aka SUVs) are exempted from window tint restrictions, pull up to a typical intersection in the US and look around and you can’t see worth a damn.Somehow it’s ok for a Subaru Crosstrek to have dark tint but not an Impreza that is the same car but lower? There are even more weird situations like the Mercedes Benz GLA compact CUV which typically has tinted windows, but not the top-of-the-line AMG trim because that one has a lowered suspension, making it a “car” instead of a “light truck”.replyvegetablepotpie 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I was surprised by SUVs being able to have more window tint, and I looked it up, and you’re right [1]. For windshield and drive side windows it’s the same as a sedan, but for rear windows it can be darker for passenger comfort.Apparently in Alabama at least, the manufacturer determines the designation [2]. So you might be able to call Subaru about the Impreza and have them call it “an SUV” to get that sweet rear window tint.[1] https://www.suvradar.com/can-suvs-have-tinted-windows/[2] https://www.alea.gov/dps/highway-patrol/alabama-tinting-regu...replykevin_thibedeau 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This wouldn't be as much of a problem if \"crossover\" hatchbacks were properly classified as cars as they should be.replydymk 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] In most states (all?) it's illegal to have a tinted front window, yet people still have them, because it's not enforced.

You spend a lot less time walking around parked cars or having to keep an eye out for someone who's in a hurry to exit \"their\" driveway.In San Francisco, at least, there's a big tug of war about where your driveway ends and the curb begins.

All of this while the city and its infrastructure was clean, quiet, safe, and beautiful.Then I came back to Los Angeles. For reference, one time while taking the metro I had to evacuate because one of the cars caught on fire and had smoke billowing out the windows. I wound up trapped near the Walk of Fame in Hollywood at roughly 11PM, because when I tried to catch a bus out of there, a bunch of idiots were parked directly in front of the bus stop and the bus driver was forced to just drive right past me because they couldn't pull over and stop. So then I hailed an Uber and had to wait nearly half an hour for it to arrive and pick me up because of how utterly packed the streets were with bumper-to-bumper cars.I used to semi-jokingly tell my friends and family I wanted to move to Europe.

They are not merely trying to snub riders. For example, the light rail trains here have a standard for how long they open their doors at each station. It's something like 14 seconds. A vehicle with open doors will also allow passengers to disembark; it's a two-way passage. So should they sit in the station with closed doors, or push off a few yards down to the intersection? Now, other motorists see a train stopped at a station and they think one thing. They see a train stopped and waiting for a red light and they know that it will proceed through on green. It seems weird to imagine a train that lingers at the station as if it's boarding but it's not, it's really waiting for the light to change, and then it will pounce on the opportunity. That's less than predictable behavior, as far as other motorists are concerned.Our transit authority reminds riders to arrive at the stop 5 minutes early. We're also reminded that if we miss this one, another one is on the way. Passengers need not inherit that toxic road rage.replycloseparen 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's exactly what I'm talking about. The space is for drivers. The rules governing the space are tuned for the predictability and convenience of drivers.

Urban spaces where the LRVs operate have few cars and fewer traffic lights. The train moves like it means business and anything in its way scatters.

Maybe we cannot have nice things.But don't argue that people want to live in urban paradise and some contrived system is simply not giving them what they want. Most people everywhere, when they can, want to drive and live in houses. Except in some places many can afford that and have the infrastructure, and in some only a few do.

But there is usually no safe way to cross them.When I ask people in London, why are your not cycling, 95% say they are afraid of getting hit by a car. They are wrong - they will be killed by a truck. Most cyclists in London due to 4 axle construction trucks. I have seen one of the bastards illegally drive into a cycle lane, then onto a pavement where women walk with kids, and drive on that pavement to get around traffic. I have seen a BMW stuck on a bend in a segregated cycle way at Tower of London. I’ve seen a wolksvagen in a cycle lane upside down.Go to a rich and cycling safe are of London like hackney, there are plenty of bikes.

Moreover, by necessity with low car ownership they cannot have car-centric cities - most people don't have cars.

Nobody will stop when you're crossing the road, they just weave.A quick Google search shows that Vietnam has 29.81 per 100,000 of population deaths from traffic accidents.These places are awful examples of safe bike/pedestrian cites.

Plus the car is not necessary by definition since most people don't have one. So it's not really massive spending on car infrastructure, or distances created by car-centric lifestyle that's driving the adoption. It really feels like moving the goalposts, these cities are more convenient for bikes and mopeds than cars by any standard (faster, much cheaper, easier to park etc.). I don't think safety is a primary driver either...Or you can also just take middle-income cities, like Moscow. It wasn't built with many cars in mind, and there's severe lack of parking in particular. People used to have fistfights over public parking spots when I was a kid :) Yet, they still buy cars until traffic becomes completely unreasonable, it used to be that transit across the city (where I was going) tool ~1 hour, and my co-worker who drove a similar route would take 2 hours thru traffic, and he would still drive.

First, there's the \"afford\" bit, that is the key. And second obviously it's a tradeoff based on infrastructure available, but my point is unless you outright restrict it, everywhere in the world people will fill up as much driving/parking capacity as available, then a bit more, and only then consider other options. Hence gridlock and expensive/scarce/both parking in all of the \"big cities\".That is not true for biking or transit - nowhere in the world, that I'm aware of, do people clog the bike lanes or trains until they are barely usable, then switch grudgingly to other modes of transportation.People in big cities still drive.

The routes are fixed. It is easy to change a bus route by moving the stops around and issuing a new map. It is, as you say, expensive to change a rail route.Because rail routes are fixed, that means that developers can count on their longevity, and therefore they develop real estate to match it. A rail line can greatly gentrify the neighborhoods it runs through, given a decade or two to get started. This is a big reason why many neighborhoods will protest and block and vote against any rail lines being built near them, because they know it will start the timer on rising property values, rising rents, new neighbors, and the destruction of low-income and affordable housing.replybrightlancer 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That flexibility is also a reason for building bus routes: they can be re-routed as needed due to construction or changing rider patterns, buses can be replaced (improved) without having to retrofit the entire system, new ones can be added where needed, old ones can be removed where not, etc.Central planners might like the idea that they can choose which neighborhoods will succeed, but count me among those who think they can F themselves.Buses work. They're cheaper than every kind of rail. They're more flexible.

    "originBody": "IRC is the Only Viable Chat Protocol IRC is so wonderful that I am continually finding myself far too distracted by it to actually write this article praising the virtues of IRC. Get on IRC to learn more.OK, OK, I'll pull myself away from the terminal and finally finish writing this piece. Although it would be quite poetic if my argument for using IRC was prematurely aborted because I could not pull myself from Irssi/Comic Chat long enough to actually write it, this scenario would be of no benefit to anyone.For those unaware, IRC is a primordial (by Internet standards) yet stalwart chat protocol dating back to 1988. The basic way it works is that people use an IRC client to connect to an IRC daemon running on another computer (an IRC server), where they are able to pick a name and interact with other people over text, either by joining a channel that they are in, or privately messaging them. Although it has severely declined in popularity since its golden age in favour of social media and Discord, I have found myself more attached to the ostensibly dying protocol than ever before lately for a myriad of reasons that I wish to share here.For transparency's sake, I should probably point out immediately that I am a long-time stubborn aficionado of retro technology and culture, both in ways that other people admire, and in ways that make me come off as an eccentric lunatic.Among other things, I still use a flip phone, collect and listen to music CDs, use Office 97 (the very first version I ever owned), listen to music on an MP3 player while on the go, own two CRT televisions along with a VCR and a collection of VHS tapes, collect and read physical books, and own two CRT monitors that I use with my 1999 Compaq gaming computer that still proudly runs Windows 98 and hosts the DOS/Windows 9x games that still make up the bulk of the games that I enjoy.As returning visitors likely know, in the year of our Lord, 2022, I also proudly host my own IRC server, where I spend an extremely unhealthy amount of my time chatting with beloved like-minded people. Using an \"archaic\" chat platform that dates back to the 80s and that has lost the majority of the userbase it enjoyed during its peak may seem like a form of nostalgia bordering on abject madness when looked at from the outside. Yet, I daresay it is easily one of the most easily defensible and reasonable of the life choices that I have just listed off.Cut the (Dis)Cord If you look around for a place to chat in real time with other people in this day and age, chances are more than good that you'll quickly be directed to a Discord server. This is an unfortunate state of affairs for many reasons. To put it succintly, Discord is a centralised and proprietary platform that spies on its users in every conceivable way, right down to what logging what programs they have running on their computer and demanding people self-dox by providing their phone number. All of this information is then put to use to allow advertisers to better target Discord's userbase.I am aware that most people have become completely lamentably desensitised to corporate and government surveillance, and may thus not be greatly alarmed by these facts. However, I would assume that most (if not all) of those people would feel quite violated if a salesperson began stalking them in \"real life\", listening in to every conversation they had with their family/friends from a distance, and then physically approaching on the street and peddling products to them in suspiciously prescient ways.The fundamental fact that Discord users refuse to see is that the platform isn't run on magic dust and fairy incantations, but actual human beings. Using Discord is no different from having a group of strangers sitting in your room with you, noting down every word you say to your friends and everything you run on your computer, and doing the devil knows what with it.Even if you have full-on Stockholm syndrome in regard to advertisers data-mining your life to sell you garbage, who knows where else your data could be going? Considering the horrific epidemic of sexual abuse being abetted and covered up in the workplace, is it really too difficult to imagine malicious actors at Discord (or any other technology company) illegitimately accessing the data of their business' users and using it for stalking or other nefarious purposes?The complete de-centralisation of IRC, unlike Discord, is also well worth expanding on. Since IRC is a standard and not a platform like Discord, anyone with access to reliable hosting and basic computer knowledge can set up their own IRC server. As I joked to a friend recently, I am free to ban anyone from an IRC channel I own, but there is nothing stopping them from then starting #koshkaisafag and regrouping. I can try to get them banned from the server, but there is also nothing stopping them from setting up their own server as irc.koshkaisafag.info and regrouping as a completely sovereign entity that no one can touch any longer.There are certainly a number of monolithic IRC networks, such as Rizon, EFNet, and Libera Chat, that make up the vast bulk of the IRC world, but there are also many thousands of smaller networks dotting the landscape. There are just over 500 networks whose channels are indexed by the IRC search engine Netsplit.de, but this engine still only covers fairly large networks, and excludes the great many networks that are either private or very small and obscure. Some of these may be intended entirely for a small group of friends, or may be used by a business to communicate privately.There certainly is no magical check in any IRCd daemon to stop a rogue IRCOp from banning individuals for no coherent reason, or blackmailing someone into providing their phone number and/or other personal information in order to stay on a server (although, unlike with Discord, I have never heard of this occurring on IRC before), but the complete de-centralisation of the IRC world means that allowing such abuses of power is quite detrimental to an IRC network. If an IRCOp goes rogue, their reign of terror is unlikely to last for much longer as word goes out and users either flee to another network or set their own up.Perhaps the most dramatic example of this is the rapid fall of Freenode, which underwent a rapid collapse after a hostile takeover of the network by new management seeking to use it to make a quick buck. In the span of mere months, the most popular IRC network in the world was reduced to a disgraced and nearly moribund shell of its former self, as disgruntled users fled enmasse to the newly established Libera Chat network.I touched on the problems of centralisation and why de-centralisation was a key tenet of the old Internet in my acclaimed article Make the Web Great Again, and Discord does not get nearly enough bad press for its role in destroying this aspect of the Internet. Much as the dreaded Reddit has largely paved a fascist monopoly over the niche once occupied by a bounty of independent Web forums, Discord has done the same with the chat world, replacing the sea of independent and free IRC servers with a single corporate walled garden whose owners each user must avoid offending in any way, lest they be entirely cast out of the public square.This problem is so endemic on the modern Internet that not only is there a sea of unintentionally comical Neocities \"Web 1.0\" websites featuring their owners jabbering about how much they miss the old Internet while inviting people to chat on the webmaster/webmistress' Discord server in the same breath, but even actually respectable people and outfits (who I will not name out of politeness) that have migrated to Discord because all of their misguided friends use it and refuse to budge. Even I, for all of my frenzied rabble-rousing, briefly created a Discord account a few years ago to speak with a friend before quitting the service out of disgust.Nonetheless, for all of the social issues it causes me, being autistic has also given me the stubbornness of a mountain, and I have long since vowed to never touch the service again no matter who or what I may need it for. Each person who avoids big technology companies pushes the stake slightly deeper into the frigid, rotten heart of the privacy vampire that Discord and other big technology companies are (no offence intended to comparatively benevolent actual vampires with this comparison). Each person who avoids these services is also one less carrot for the vampire to dangle away over other people's heads to convince them to stay in its cave.For more information on the many sordid problems with Discord, please check out these two guides written by the esteemed Richard Stallman and Spyware Watchdog over on Neocities on why Discord should be avoided like a berserk chainsaw-wielding leper, if you have not done so already.A Rare Sanctuary My good friend lolwut made a very astute observation some time ago about IRC being a nearly infallible NORP filter, and thus a very rare safe port from the normiefication storm, due to the apparent \"complexities\" involved in getting on IRC, and the sheer age and and its lack of sleekness of the protocol relative to Discord and other modern alternatives. Anyone who has ever used IRC knows that there is nothing even remotely complicated about using it, but the terminology and the steps required to use one are ostensibly terrifying enough to reliably keep the technically illiterate at bay.A number of Web chat interfaces have been invented over the years to entice normalcattle onto IRC, but even this has proven to be an abject failure, as well over 90% of cases end with the NORP leaving after 30 seconds of inactivity, apparently appalled by the fact that a protocol that is utilised by people who could be online from anywhere in the world and who could be doing any manner of non-IRC related things would have lulls in activity. In fact, the only real use that these clients seem to get is from regulars who temporarily lack access to a real IRC client. On my end, I rely on Kiwi IRC to get on IRC from my flip phone, which has no SSH client or IRC client, but does have a Web browser.Seeing as the world of IRC is a nearly NORP-free oasis, most people are mature and intelligent enough to understand that words on a screen are just that, and that it is quite simple to withdraw from them if one does not want to deal with them. Aside from actually leaving a channel to get away from an unpleasant user, it is possible to use the ignore function to block any further correspondence from them. Many networks also provide some sort of server-side ignore functionality to stop a user from receiving any private messages that don't come from a pre-approved user.Due to the fact that IRC power is effectively meaningless (as it should be on any part of the Internet!), the common theme for governance on most IRC servers is delightfully adherent to the ways of the old Internet. As is nicely summarised here, IRCOps (the administrators of an IRC network) are normally completely neutral entities that allow users to govern themselves and their channels however they see fit, only wielding their power in dire situations such as when someone's actions are endangering the security of the server or breaking national law.Indeed, while on smaller and more \"intimate\" networks, such as my own, running into the local IRCOp(s) is a common occurrence, it is actually quite rare to actually have even a single interaction with an IRCOp on any large server, unless they happen to be part of a channel you are in. Seeing as anyone can start their own channel(s), and run them however they see fit, there is very rarely a need for an IRCOp to do anything beyond keeping the power on and changing the light bulbs when they go bad.In contrast to much of the modern Internet, IRC is also largely anonymous, another key tenet of the old Internet. Beyond not requiring any personal information to participate (in contrast to Discord, where the service itself often requires a phone number, and some individual rooms go as far as requiring social media background checks, lest some normalfag SJW gets an aneurysm from reading a mean word), many modern IRC servers (including my own) also cloak people's IP addresses and offer the option of VHosts, which are custom (fake or real) domain names that people can choose to substitute in for their IP address. Additionally, most IRC networks allow users to connect via a VPN or (less often) Tor.A quick word of caution for anyone who is new to IRC and who I may have inspired to go spelunking: the key word in the previous few sentences is \"most\". VHosts and IP cloaking are modern IRC conveniences, and not every network offers them. EFNet, the most ancient IRC network in the world and the child of the very first IRC network, is particularly notorious for stubbornly eschewing just about every modern IRC convenience there is.Not only does EFNet still display people's full IP addresses (assuming the server they are connecting to does not have its own domain name), but it also does not even have services such as NickServ and ChanServ for people to register their names and channels in order to retain ownership over them! This \"wild west\" landscape is not nearly as chaotic and exciting as it may sound, especially since everyone on the server is seemingly connected from a shell or a bouncer that they last touched while speculating on what will happen on Y2K.Extending IRC While some changes have occurred in the IRC world over the decades, the protocol itself dates back all the way back to 1988, and was designed to be sustainable on the Internet speeds of that bygone era. In contrast to Discord and the bloated client that it pushes down user's throats, IRC is such a bare bones and low-consumption protocol that you can even connect to it via the command prompt or terminal using Telnet (although you do have to manually ping the IRC server you're connected to in order for it to not assume that your connection died)!The reliability and lack of bloat that are inherent to IRC ultimately also means that there are a number of fancy modern features that Discord has that IRC lacks, a big one being the inability to view backlogs of conversations that transpired while one was not connected to an IRC server. Although IRC does not itself provide this functionality, the extremely simple nature of IRC allows for a couple of lightweight options for reliably remaining on IRC around the clock and not missing out on a word that anyone says.The most sublime option by far involves running a terminal-based client such as Irssi (the most sublime IRC client in existence, in my personal opinion) or WeeChat on a Linux/BSD server in a terminal multiplexer such as Screen or Tmux. One can then SSH into the server from any Internet-connected computer at their leisure, and take control of their IRC client as if it had been running on their current computer this entire time.For my part, I have been on IRC this way since 2006 on a variety shells from my very first one which was provided to me by a friend of mine on his server, to free publicly offered ones, to Raspberry Pi servers I set up in my house, to my current one which runs on the same server running my website and other infrastructure. Given how useful and reliable this is, and how efficient and sleek Irssi is, I cannot imagine why anyone would want to use any other client or method.Nonetheless, for fans of non-terminal clients such as HexChat and mIRC (there is no accounting for taste, I suppose), there also exists the option of IRC bouncers. These are essentially bots that connect to specific IRC servers/channels under their owner's name and log all of the messages that they receive. The bouncer's owner in turn connects to the bouncer like an IRC server, after which they are provided the backlog of what occurred during their absence and are able to take full control of the bouncer to chat like they normally would on an IRC server.Being a bare bones public protocol, IRC does suffer the issue of being easy to snoop on. Thankfully, many IRC networks do allow users to connect via SSL, the port for which is usually 6697, as opposed to the usual 6667. A single user in a channel not using SSL can completely compromise everyone else's efforts, but it is possible to restrict anyone not connected via SSL from joining a channel. Additionally, a number of clients on Linux (Irssi, WeeChat, and HexChat) also allow users to set up OTR in order to have fully encrypted private one-on-one conversations with anyone else who has this plugin.Other features that are notably absent from IRC but present on Discord are image-sharing and voice chat/video chat. Before going into the available options for an IRC user needing these features, I must say that personally view all three of these features as being utterly extraneous, and not even remotely worth the many dire downsides that come with Discord even if they were not. I wrote an entire article outlining why writing is provably superior to speaking as a communication method, so I will not elaborate further here.Needless to say, as an autistic person who goes online because I am actually able to socialise without the vexing machinations of in-person/verbal communication, I have never voice-chatted in my life and only used a webcamera once when I had to in order to do a job evaluation during quarantine. Even considering over 98% of people aren't autistic, I still do not understand how anyone can enjoy or even seek out voice chat. For one, it would interrupt my habit of listening to music any time I am at the computer, and for two, it would morph online conversations from completely anonymous exchanges to ones that are broadcasted to everybody in the vicinity of the participants, while also providing dox fuel for all involved.My angry grumbling aside, for anyone who absolutely feels the need to ruin the simple sublimity of text conversation with voice chat, there do exist relatively safe outside services, notably Mumble, that users can switch over from IRC for when needed. Admittedly, this is an extra step that requires reliance on infrastructure outside of IRC, but I would classify that as more than worth being able to have a conversation with minimal fear of privacy violation. Mumble is free software and, much like IRC, allows for anyone to set up their own personal server to communicate on.The issue of image sharing is once again something that can be very easily worked around by either uploading any images one wishes to share to one's personal server, or to an image hosting service such as Catbox.moe, or Uguu.se. Again, this is an extra step that winds up requiring reliance on infrastructure outside of IRC, but one that takes very minimal effort. It should be noted however, that IRC does allow for sending files from one person to the other using the DCC protocol, so only sharing images with an entire group at once requires leaving its borders. The only issue is that DCC is implemented differently by various clients and may be blocked by the firewall by default.Nevertheless, for people seeking a facsimile of video chat on IRC, there does exist a fascinating alternative that allows for something close to it: the truly sublime Microsoft Comic Chat, a completely unique IRC client that Microsoft invented during its golden age of the 90s. Although Microsoft wound up discontinuing it over 20 years ago in favour of MSN Messenger, it continues to enjoy a cult following to this day, and for very good reason.In a stroke of absolute genius, Comic Chat rejects the typical text-only approach of other IRC clients, and instead renders IRC channels as in-progress comic strips, with every participant being able to choose an avatar for themselves and punctuate everything they say with a specific facial expression or pose.Beyond being patently hilarious (many of the default avatars are absolutely insane, and most of the custom-made ones are comical ones such as sunglasses-wearing cats and obese Vikings), Comic Chat adds an entirely new dimension to conversations, allowing people to express themselves with facial expressions and body language to emphasise and clarify what they are saying. The client even allows you to send a facial expression as a reaction without including any words at all, for situations where body language alone gets one's message across better than words.While this was certainly not the intended goal behind Comic Chat, and it is a program that is enjoyed by a great many neurotypicals, I personally adore it enough to argue that it may be the ideal communication method for autistic people. Most characters have such exaggerated facial expressions and body language that just about anyone can clearly understand them, and the nature of IRC means that anyone participating in a conversation has plenty of time to process everything and is not pressured to immediately and constantly send out many complex social cues every moment of an interaction.I will admit that Microsoft Comic Chat has quite a buffoonish reputation, owing to the inherent silliness of the program and its sheer age (sadly, this is considered by many to be an actual criticism by itself). Its association with the ludicrous NSFW web comic Jerkcity also likely did no PR favours for it. Yet just as many other great inventions were happy accidents, I do believe that in their tomfoolery, Microsoft accidentally created one of the most useful methods of communication we autistic people have available to us. One that, even by itself, more than justifies the continued existence of IRC in my eyes. I suppose the fact that I get to be an angelic pink kitty on IRC helps a lot too. ^-^Although my main purpose for writing this article is to inspire some people to change their ways and consider migrating from the proprietary spyware platform of Discord to free and de-centralised prairies such as IRC and Mumble, it would be a lost opportunity to not advertise my own burgeoning IRC network here. If you have any interest in interacting with a wise, witty, and welcoming group of Internet/computing/gaming nostalgics (and also, myself), be sure to steer your IRC client of choice towards KoshkaIRC at irc.koshka.love, the main channel of which is # (literally as simple of a channel name as it can get).There has also recently been a Microsoft Comic Chat renaissance on the same server, in the channel #comicchat. Due to the fact that participating requires a separate IRC client which cannot be run on a shell and is too primitive to connect to a bouncer, and the fact that people on the network hail from time zones all over, I have decided to host an all-day named Comic Chat Caturday event on Saturdays (or closer to Sundays, for people in the enigmatic land of Oceania) from now on to make it easier for people to participate.Although a program designed only for Windows, it is possible to get Comic Chat running in Linux, and my good friend ShadowM00n has written an excellent guide on how exactly to set this program up on Linux using Wine.Microsoft Comic Chat comes with a default set of rather insane avatars that are probably best known as the cast characters of the aforementioned Jerkcity/BoneQuest, which gloriously appropriated them as a bunch of lunatics shrieking about homosexual intercourse, drugs, and monster poos, but there is a sea of custom avatars available for you to download at Mermaid Elizabeth's monolithic Comic Chat website.Aside from being the author's vast personal Comic Chat resource, this site also hosts a massive trove of defunct Comic Chat websites created over the decades, and all of the avatars and other resources that they hosted. From kitties of every shape and stripe, to anime characters, to Vikings, to all sorts of other options, there should be something for everyone on there.Seeing as autism and general old computing-related nostalgia are the two main themes of this website, I could not think of a more fitting event for fans of this website than a day dedicated to this delightful ancient, autistic-friendly IRC client. Whether you've never used Comic Chat before, or you're familiar with it and want to give it another spin, be sure to drop by this Saturday and join in the fun! As long as people continue using free and open protocols, and upholding the tenets of old, the good old Internet will never truly die.Many thank yous to ShadowM00n, both for his amazingly thorough proof-reading, and for writing the aforementioned article about running Comic Chat on Linux, and to jvlfools, for his own helpful proof-reading!Thank you for taking the time to read this article! If you have any feedback at all, please feel free to leave a comment in my Guestbook and/or stop by my IRC network at irc.koshka.love, main channel # and let me know what you think. It always means a lot to me. (: Back to the top of the page | Back to the Library of Babel | Back to the Site Map",

If you get banned from the server, your server shuts down, or Discord bans you altogether your access to those logs is gone forever.2 - Unlike the logs of some IRC channels, Discord's logs aren't available on the web anywhere, so they can't be indexed or searched outside of Discord.3 - Paging through hours or days of Discord logs is so incredibly painful, because every few screenfuls or so Discord has to load the previous/next logs and that is super slow compared to paging through text logs offline. If you have a lot of logs to page through, this experience is absolutely atrocious.4 - There's no easy way to export the logs to be processed with standard/powerful text manipulation tools, like text editors, sed, etc..Discord's search is painful because:1 - There's no regex search.2 - No ability to search via web search engines, because the logs aren't available on any website (see above).3 - No way to search through the logs of multiple servers at once.I have IRC logs going back decades, from servers I haven't been on in decades, but they're all instantly searchable, and the text in them is easily manipulable.My Discord logs are trapped in Discord and I'm forced to use Discord's pretty but otherwise horrible UI to search them.No, the reason Discord is popular has nothing to do with logging, but everything to do with how easy it is to sign up, join, and get a server running. Inline images and not having to learn obscure IRC commands or figure out obtuse IRC clients are also huge plusses for your average user. Discord's client is also visually pleasing -- something that most IRC client developers still haven't figured out. Aesthetics matter to users, as Apple has proved.But Discord is an information black hole where data goes to die.replyRenaud 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] >But Discord is an information black hole where data goes to die.I'm really saddened and angry that projects end up using Discord as their main forum interface.Not everything is worth keeping around forever, but Discord is as closed a closed garden as can be.That's great for private servers between friends, but it's contrary to the ethos of Open Source, as nothing is really in the open.History is basically unsearchable and everyone lives in a perpetual present where topics need to be discussed over and over again instead of being easily available to newcomers. Once they disappear from the current page, they become really hard to reach.And discord will happily close your account or prevent you from logging if your activity is deemed suspicious, i.e. if you're travelling and using VPNs, getting in can be a nightmare. The feeling of also being constantly watched, a step away from having your account blocked, is jarring.I wish there was a good open source alternative that would also allow data to be easily made public and allowed users to just join and participate with whatever existing accounts they have (google, GitHub, any Fediverse account, etc).Servers could be self-hosted or hosted for free or a minimal fee based on the server size, with some paying additional features (like flair, large audio rooms, automated backups, branding, more customization, etc).But is discord too big to be taken on by an Open Source project?replyeternityforest 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Why not PHPBB?

Individual clients may be able to log but say you just join a project channel with years of discussion — you’d have literally nothing to start with.Discord gives you a chance at searching old history with zero additional setup if the permissions allow.For both IRC and Discord you’d need to run a bot to have truly open logs online.replyTkTech 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I've just started adding logs to notifico (ex: https://n.tkte.ch/c/1/2023-07-28), which is very barebones. Don't get much time to work on it, but I'm working on implementing search in a cost-effective manner. If the ~3000 IRC channels that use Notifico opt-in to logging they'll get it for free permanently, and I'll be offering nightly dumps to an SFTP server of your choice to make sure there's no lock-in.You're totally right that you need a bot to have open logs online, I'm just trying to point out that a huge number of open source projects (CPython, FreeBSD, Haiku, Quotebrowser, random NASA weather balloons, thousands of others) already use a common bot so it's not that hard of a problem. The bigger problem is political, in that most IRC network discourage logging, and many communities are outright hostile to it.Notifico discards PRIVMSG's immediately and the rest of its logs after a couple of hours normally, but in its last decade of operating it's seen more than 2 billion messages to give you an idea of how much has to get indexed.Also, writing your own bot for IRC is trivial, and has no TOS, complicated APIs, OAuth flows, or other barriers to entry. Can absolutely do the same for Discord but they've already been making changes to make it more difficult to log or export your data.replyredserk 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Thanks for hosting a service to help host the logs in a public manner.As far as logs hosting though, this only works for as long as you're willing to host though. It seems unlikely that Discord will disappear overnight -- or if this was a risk, I'd assume they'd be acquired with a large userbase.I've written IRC and Discord bots and don't think Discord bots aren't much more difficult. One of the best strengths of writing a Discord bot is that if your bot goes down, you can query and fetch lost history fairly easily. This isn't doable in IRC unless you put a bouncer in front of your bot or the server is set up to feed clients with history.replyTkTech 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I've already run it for more than a decade, it's not going anywhere :) The project is also open-source, and the daily SFTP log exports can be imported into another instance. I hate lock-in.Ultimately, it uses an irrelevant % of resources on a dedicated box used for other projects, so it's not a financial or even operational burden. One of my favorite things about IRC is that if all you want to do is a JOIN a channel and PRIVMSG some people, the same code I wrote a decade ago works fine today. The project went almost 6 years without requiring a single code change from me, other than accepting 3rd party feature PRs.I may have missed something last time I looked at it, but Discord was making it harder to react to all messages and wanted to force you to only use slash commands.

It makes anything into a black hole where information goes to die. But before that, it gives you a sense of anxiety because everything is moving around and you have no fixed reference points, and encourages random idle chatter....As far as I'm concerned it is not a technology that should exist aside from realtime viewing of feeds, and things meant from random idle chatter.People are using Discord like as if it's a forum and a wiki in one. Which isn't the worst thing, because it's better than nothing, but I think it would be better with an integrated real forum that auto-posts new topics in the chat.If you have something you think is worthy of preserving, say it in a paginated forum where people can find it, if you have an ephemeral shitpost, say it in the chat. If you want to scroll through history of ephemeral shitposts and see what's happening, even that should have a calendar based pagination UI.Old forums used to have shoutboxes. Proboards and phpbb and the like were basically already perfect.If I was going to do a community platform, I'd just build a forum. The only thing I think I'd change is I'd make it so you could download archives, and I'd consider having a wikipedia style policy of everything being Creative Commons.replyZetice 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Literally all of your concerns are 100% solved by adding a log bot to the channels you care about, both on IRC and Discord.I’m beyond sick of the helplessness performative shtick around Discord.

If anything, it's going the other way. Product empathy isn't optional--ask yourself: why would I write or fund an IRC client when I have things that work for me already? Like, this is the Linux-on-the-desktop advocacy all over again. \"Your thing doesn't work for me because of X [usually literally X on Linux, but you get the idea], but Y does.\" \"Well, expend time or money to fix X!\" Why? You're the one who likes X. You're advocating for it. Why would I fix the thing you like when the thing I use already works?Take the sibling response to yours--I learned something new in seeing https://thelounge.chat, and while I don't want to run software to deal with chat, that was a cool thing to see.

I've no idea how well those are supported in servers, to say nothing of clients (which would need a way to surface message ids, and possibly permalinks).At that point, you probably also want the WIP chathistory extension (https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/chathistory) which provides backlog support.replycout 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Calling search unusable is hyperbole.

Discord (and Slack) have this thing where because there’s a backlog, people expect other people to have read everything.

It makes it more unambiguously a synchronous experience, whereas Discord and Slack chat is pretty ambiguous as to whether it is synchronous or asynchronous.replywebstrand 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] IRC was bigger while I was growing up. But due to living with an internet connection that'd drop multiple times a day, I was never able to really use IRC because I'd ask a question and then get dropped. Getting dropped does not immediately log you out, the server has a timeout period. So when I'd get back in, I'd have to ask people to repeat whatever they said since the last timestamp I'd seen.Not to mention some IRC channels are really high latency, you leave a message and someone else replies ten hours later. If you miss the reply because you were offline, you couldn't expect anyone to be around to repeat missed conversations back to you.Due to this I've never really liked IRC, its not good for mobile devices or people who live with DSL or dial-up. Sure you can \"just get an account on a bouncer\" but that's pretty esoteric knowledge that I never encountered until after university.replyop00to 22 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Chat without history is such a waste.

When you join a channel it's like you actually joined a room. You don't know what they were talking about when you weren't there.replylucideer 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's nice as an optional feature but as a baseline it just seems like sentimental skeumorphism/metaphorism.Chat being real-time is certainly \"approaching real life\" much moreso than fully asynchronous email, but most people don't want either to be real life: chat still needs an element of asynchronicity to distinguish it as a technologically useful medium improving over actually walking into a real room.To put it another way: if I'm in a real life room where being present for the full conversation is necessary, it's easy to excuse being late or going to the bathroom as unfortunate parts of life when people are repeating themselves. When there's simple technological solutions that can easily prevent me from missing anything important, and someone's telling me they don't want it because they like the inconvenience, that's harder to justify.replyagumonkey 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's a very interesting topic.

For that matter, neither should they be done on Teams, Slack, Discord, Matrix, XMPP, or Skype. Important announcements belong on a web page and a mailing list (both simultaneously) or alternatively on some other purpose built system which tracks who has seen an annoucement so that if important announcement is missed by a key player, someone is alerted and can reach out using an alternative method of communication.But even if you insist on misusing a chat protocol like IRC for this, ask someone who was there for their logs?

If we assume that the average message size is similar and similar amounts of metadata are stored per message, that means we're talking about somewhere between 400GB and 5.6TB per day for the entirety of Discord.That's a lot of space on an individual basis, but nothing for a global-scale service.

In discord… not so much. And there’s the whole voice layer I didn’t even touch. It’s too chaotic and demanding full immersion, so I just noped out of there.(And there’s the whole aspect of Discord actually owning it all, and banning you discord-wide if you blow your nose funny.)The idea of using discord as a medium for conversations you mean to log and refer to later seems like bollocks in the light of above.

This includes Discord (at least in the electron app).As to why? It depends on the game, but Eve Online can get the most complicated. The most complex set up I can recall offhand, was when we were in cross coalition operations, where I had 2 mumbles and a teamspeak up where the teamspeak had 3 separate server tabs. It was my alliance mumble, my coalition mumble, other coalition teamspeak, my corp teamspeak, and half way through the operation we had to change the other coalition teamspeak servers to a backup because of what looked like a ddos. (In eve you have players who join a corporation, who join an alliance, who form a coalition. Coalitions are not internal to the game mechanics and often incorporate multiple timezone and language groups.)As a side note, the open source mumble is popular because the corp/coalition/alliance IT services can easily configure it to work with external authorization systems, like the SSO provided in the Eve API or in [1].

I did it four times. The trick is that they block you if you do anything suspicious and any account created under this 'suspicious' state demands phone verification. I don't know how they identify you, but you must succeed with your first try.

Realising people didn't want to deal with this shit is why discord is so popular.Supplementing services with other interoperable services is how most of the internet works, and still remains a valid and successful approach.An IRC client with some bells and & some plugins that expand web-linked media would offer most of Discord's feature set.Discord is popular because of network effects, virality, and marketing. But that kind of popularity is ephemeral and will disappear when Discord inevitably falls victim to enshittification like its many predecessors: https://pomf2.lain.la/f/7sl51lqf.png - at that point, few will remember Discord, and none will be able to recreate it (owing to its closed nature), but IRC will be still around.replyrcxdude 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] People always mention \"marketing\" as a reason for Discord's success, and I always wonder what they mean. It's a poster child of adoption through word-of-mouth, I don't know if they've engaged seriously with advertising. I'm serious, you have absolutely no clue what the average user values and how your suggestions don't meet that while discord does. Discord may go the way of the dodo due to enshittification but the successor will be another option that actually adresses most users needs, not IRC (which I'm sure will still be around: gopher's still around, people are still tinkering with 9600 baud modems and the like, a tech like that will never completely die but it's also delusional to expect that it's not mainstream just because the alternative has better marketing)replylolinder 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You seem to have completely missed tester756's point: Discord became popular because it bundled good-enough versions of all of those features with no extra hassle. No one has to keep track of which client you're using in order to decide which features you can interact with, no one has to spin up a new server for voice chat or anything else—it's handled for you automatically.You might be comfortable stringing together a bunch of plugins for IRC in order to get the same functionality, but the average Discord user never will be.replysiriusfeynman 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] so many conversation about discord/slack/$currentThing vs IRC end up repeating the \"why Dropbox when you can rsync\" memereplyshlant 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Discord is popular because of network effects, virality, and marketingI don't think you are even attempting to fairly represent Discord if this is what you actually believereplyKarunamon 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >An IRC client with some bells and & some plugins that expand web-linked media would offer most of Discord's feature set.And yet, this hypothetical client does not exist.

For me, Discord has horrible UX, with its flashy, slow, obnoxious UI and its incessant cacophony of tips, \"new feature\" notifications, and advertisements for \"Discord Nitro\".Putting in the one-time effort to configure an IRC client (and making it \"fancy\") seems worth it to me instead of having to continually put up with Discord's whims. At least there is no threat of enshittification with this approach. \"IRC Nitro\" will never be a real thing. With Discord, you can never be sure.

For the latter no level of security on my own network is going to prevent the bad outcome, but effectively having a proxy through a 3rd party does (and discord does go to extra lengths to avoid webRTC from leaking IP info)replymagsarion 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The \"threat model\" of OP is the consequence of a wrong usage pattern. You keep your identities separate. If you're in a high-stakes environment where being DDoSed or attacked is an actual threat, you compartmentalize that identity adequately by going through a proxy, VPN, TOR, I2P, or using a different medium altogether. Fortunately, unlike other services, this is extremely easy with IRC since the identity is just a nick, and nothing prevents one from having as many identities as needed.This obsession with having a single centralized identity where some vendor is trusted to painstakingly guard the linked PIID is misguided, unsafe, and harmful. Discord will fall prey to a data exfiltration attack eventually, and affected people will only then realize that this trust was misplaced. The fact that people are comfortable giving Discord their phone numbers while being worried about their client IP being exposed on IRC is baffling.replyrcxdude 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's not a matter of one single identity. Whether you use one or multiple you have a real practical problem which does actually happen which is prevented by discord without the need for using a 3rd party tool or you have a selection of alternatives which don't. Giving discord your phone number (which theoretically could be a problem) is really not an issue by comparison (hint: while not exactly the paragon of virtue, discord in general is more trustworthy than a random user of it).replymagsarion 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > a real practical problemIt's not a real practical problem – and I'm not sure why we're pretending that it is one. Let's clearly state what the problem is: OP wants to play MMOs & online games against potential threat actors who may DDoS and/or doxx them. Which is why they simultaneously also want to shield their identity from them. An analogy would be somebody who wants to play games with the neighbourhood meth gang while not wanting to get stabbed.This is not safe or reasonable behaviour. Even if these people lack a client IP, a motivated attacker can piece your identity together from what you say and/or post eventually. Discord just makes that a bit more difficult at the cost of you handing over PIID of greater importance.replyint_19h 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Every other player on a public game server is a potential threat actor of this nature, is the point.replymagsarion 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Then don't talk to them on a public Mumble/Ventrilo/IRC server without adequate precautions.Most MMOs & online games offer an in-game chat client that does appropriate cloaking & is also moderated (so an offender risks a ban if they engage in harassment).

At best it can provide an API, but that can be broken or shut down on a whim.

Also, fully encrypted rooms. You can have voice and video rooms too.What I'm trying to say, I suppose, is that I'm a full convert now to Matrix. It's better than Discord in that Discord is a walled garden, whereas Matrix - like IRC - is completely decentralised, and I highly recommend using Matrix over IRC these days.replychromatin 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] Many who have causally read about Matrix and looked into running a homeserver have run across the reference implementation Synapse, which is (IMO only, pls no flame) a bloated python monstrosity. This turned me off for years.A second-gen (?) alternative written in Go called Dendrite is much lighter weight, but is lacking in some features last I looked.A couple of years ago, I found Conduit (https://conduit.rs/) an ultra lightweight homeserver implementation written in Rust with an engaged and responsive community.

With the new \"sliding\" sync, clients will be able to fetch stuff much more efficiently (and more akin to Discord's API, for example) than before. Syncing an freshly logged-in account takes seconds instead of minutes and syncing messages when returning to the app is instant.

I've tried all sorts of tweaks - from tweaking the PostgreSQL service, to using things like noatime etc. on the ext4 filesystem. This has helped immensely, but some rooms, like the Python room on matrix.org, brings my homeserver to its knees :)Perhaps in the future the Synapse devs will improve the code so that mammoth rooms don't bring more resource-starved homeservers down. Alternatively I could throw more resources at the homeserver, but for my use-case, the 6GB ram and 6 cores I assign to the VM running the Synapse instance and the PostgreSQL service - and the IRC bridge heheh - is the bare-minimum I can get away with.On saying all that, I like Matrix more than I like IRC, nowadays, and more folks should IMO get on Matrix.(p.s. custom emoji's would be lovely on Matrix ;) )replyaranjedeath 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] conduit runs on pi zero -- though you can't directly migrate so that is of limited use to you.

Most start competing at a young age (early high school or even middle school), eager to learn about politics. At its best, the activity teaches students how to think critically about the government and the trade-offs that policymakers face. They are assigned to argue for different positions that they may not agree with and engage with their peers’ diverse perspectives.I started competing in Parliamentary debate at 12 years old. Growing up in Silicon Valley—a place full of scorn for politics—and attending a STEM-focused high school, debate was how I learned about public policy and economics. Often, the activity broadened and enriched how I thought about politics. But debate has strayed from these goals. Instead of expanding students’ worldviews, debate has increasingly narrowed to become a microcosm of critical theory.The rise of critical theory in high school debateIn a traditional debate round, students argue over a topic assigned by the tournament — for example, “The U.S. should adopt universal healthcare.” One side is expected to argue in favor of the motion (the affirmation side), and one against (the negation side). However, in recent years, many debaters have decided to flat-out ignore the assigned topic and instead hijack the round by proposing brand new (i.e., wholly unrelated to the original topic), debater-created resolutions that advocate complex social criticisms based on various theories — Marxism, anti-militarism, feminist international relations theory, neocolonialism, securitization, anthropocentrism, orientalism, racial positionality, Afro-Pessimism, disablism, queer ecology, and transfeminism. (To be clear, traditional feminism is out of fashion and seen as too essentialist.)These critical theory1 arguments, known as kritiks, are usually wielded by the negation side to criticize the fundamental assumptions of their affirmation side opponents. Kritik advocates argue that the world is so systematically broken that discussing public policy proposals and reforms misses what really matters: the need to fundamentally revolutionize society in some way. For example, if the topic was “The U.S. should increase the federal minimum wage,” the affirmation side might provide some arguments supporting this policy. But then the negation side, instead of arguing that the government shouldn’t raise the minimum wage, might reject spending any time on the original resolution and counter-propose a Marxist kritik.2 Here’s an example of how the negation might introduce this kritik:Revolutionary theory is a prior question — the aff [proposal about raising the minimum wage] is irrelevant in the grand scheme of capitalism... [You as a judge should] evaluate the debate as a dialectical materialist — you are a historian inquiring into the determinant factors behind the PMC [first affirmation speech] — The role of the ballot is to endorse the historical outlook of the topic with the most explanatory power... Vote negative to endorse Marxist labor theory of value.Or, if the topic was “The U.S. should increase troops in the Korean DMZ,” the negation might choose not to argue against the resolution and propose a securitization kritik:Securitization is a political decision that discursively constructs certain phenomena as threats to justify their management and extermination. The practice of security erases alternate perspectives through the dominance of Western rationalism, permitting unchecked violence against alterity. We should use this round to create space for an epistemological multiplicity that breaks down dominant discourses of North Korea.These are two examples of negation kritiks. Additionally, sometimes the affirmation side kicks off the debate by proposing a kritik — they don’t even bother advocating for the original resolution! For example, let’s say the original topic was “The U.S. should impose a carbon tax.” The affirmation side could decide to throw the resolution out the window and instead argue for an Afro-Pessimism kritik:Western societies are structured on Enlightenment-era philosophy that fundamentally does not value Black people as people, and defines them as slaves. Even though documents like the Constitution have been amended to end slavery, it created a society that is rotten to the core, and the only way to fix it is to burn down civil society.Over the past 20 years, kritiks have become massively popular in competitive high school debate.3 In the 1990s, race-based kritiks started to crop up in both Policy (also known as Cross-Ex or CX) and Lincoln-Douglas — the two original high school debate formats. Since then, they’ve become ubiquitous and expanded to include many other critical theories. YouTube recordings of debate rounds started becoming available around 2015. I reviewed all Tournament of Champions semifinal and final round recordings from 2015 to 2023, and found that about two-thirds of Policy rounds and almost half of Lincoln-Douglas rounds featured critical theory.Two new formats were started more recently, in response to this rising tide of critical theory: Public Forum in 2002 (started by CNN founder Ted Turner) and Parliamentary debate around the same time.4 These new formats were intended to focus more on public policy discussions and less on critical theory. However, critical theory has started to invade Public Forum and Parliamentary debate too. Critical theory was featured in 12.5% of Public Forum Tournament of Champions semifinals and finals from 2015-2023. I couldn’t calculate the rate for Parliamentary debate because it has fewer recorded rounds online than the other formats, but several of the Tournament of Champions rounds on YouTube (including the 2018 Finals and Quarterfinals and the 2023 Semifinals and Quarterfinals) feature critical arguments.5Tournament of Champions elimination rounds are an imperfect representation of more local debate leagues, which tend to feature more topic-focused debate and less critical theory. However, they reflect the broader trend in the activity toward kritiks and the enormous success of these arguments. Tournament of Champions debate tournaments have a significant impact on trends in local debate. Thousands of debaters watch these rounds on YouTube and base their strategies on what they see working at the highest levels of the activity. One former Policy debater told me that in her local Salt Lake City league, debaters often ran critical theory arguments because they aspired to be nationally successful and emulate the top competitors. Kritiks are ruining debateAfter kritiks were introduced as a competitive strategy, debaters became increasingly enthusiastic about them — which is not surprising, given the left-wing skew of young and educated people. After they graduated, many debaters delved even deeper into these critical theories as college students. A lot of these college students remained involved in the debate community as judges and coaches and indicated in their publicly available judging preferences that they like critical theory arguments. As a result, the next generation of debaters familiarized themselves with these theories even more and learned how to advocate for them in order to win rounds. Many debaters, again, found that they liked these arguments. They graduated and became debate judges, and the whole cycle started again.Below are quotes from written judge preferences from the 2023 Tournament of Champions across all four formats, which illustrate the high school debater to critical theory-loving judge pipeline (also note that “K” is an abbreviation for kritik):“Love the K, this is where i spent more of the time in my debate and now coaching career, I think I have an understanding of generally every K, in college, I mostly read Afro-Pessimism/Gillespie, but other areas of literature I am familiar with cap, cybernetics, baudrillard, psychoanalysis, Moten/Afro-Optimism, Afro-Futurism, arguments in queer and gender studies, whatever the K is I should have somewhat a basic understanding of it.”“Before anything else, including being a debate judge, I am a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist... I cannot check the revolutionary proletarian science at the door when I’m judging... I will no longer evaluate and thus never vote for rightest capitalist-imperialist positions/arguments... Examples of arguments of this nature are as follows: fascism good, capitalism good, imperialist war good, neoliberalism good, defenses of US or otherwise bourgeois nationalism, Zionism or normalizing Israel, colonialism good, US white fascist policing good, etc.” “...I’ve almost exclusively read variations of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism... I find these arguments to be a valuable and fun tool in debate and am happy to evaluate these debates to the best of my ability.”Kritik vs. kritik debates are “currently my favorite type of debate to judge. My literature knowledge is primarily concentrated in Marxism, Maoism, and proletarian feminism, and I have a baseline familiarity with postcolonial theory, queer theory, and feminist standpoint theory, but I'm down to evaluate anything as long as it's explained well.”“Ks I have written files on/answering/into the lit for - spanos, psycho, cap, communist horizon, security, fem, mao, death cult, berlant, scranton, queerness, set col...”“You will not lose my ballot just for running a K. Ever.”“I am frequently entertained and delighted by well-researched critical positions on both the affirmative and negative”Kritiks “are my favorite arguments to hear and were the arguments that I read most of my career.”“Ks are my favorite!”And these aren’t cherry-picked examples. I analyzed judge preferences on Tabroom and found that at the 2023 Tournament of Champions, many judges embraced critical theory across formats: Across debate formats, familiarity with critical theory has become essential to high-level success. According to Matthew Adelstein, a former high school Policy debater who lost a round at the Tournament of Champions because his opponents argued a kritik based on personal attacks against him:Some huge portion of the arguments that are made at the high levels of Policy debate are based on critical theory... to be successful, you have to read a lot of articles, for example, with people arguing that we should decolonize the entire United States and give back all the land to Native people, that the world cannot improve for Black people [Afro-Pessimism], and that capitalism is a terrible system.Even in Public Forum and Parliamentary debate—which have less critical theory—debaters still have to prepare for kritiks because many judges will vote for them. A Public Forum debater who reached Semifinals at the Tournament of Champions told me: “I had to know critical theory to win... you have to be prepared in case you have to run it or go against it.” I felt the same way competing in Parliamentary debate.Kritiks are so persuasive to left-wing judges that debaters can’t succeed in the activity without being great at them. Competitors who don’t want to argue for kritiks themselves still have to learn how to respond to them without contesting their radical premises. For example, many leftist judges will not accept a response to a Marxism kritik that argues that capitalism is good. Instead, debaters have to concede that capitalism is a bad system and make other leftist arguments like, “it’s capitalistic to fail to argue for the topic” and “Marxism isn’t the most effective response to capitalism; instead we need to look to other critical theories” (like Afro-Pessimism or transfeminism). This drives out students who don’t want to learn about critical theory and creates a vicious cycle where the only people left are kritik debaters.Furthermore, even though kritiks philosophically attack power structures, in practice they have frequently entrenched inequities in debate. Kritiks are often (although not always) strategically employed by students from big, well-funded debate programs. Their opponents—who often attend schools with fewer coaches and resources—may not be familiar with the dense philosophical arguments. This is especially challenging because kritik teams reject the topic that their opponents are expecting, and surprise them with completely new content that they have not prepared for.What happens in debate matters for American politicsFor hundreds of thousands of high schoolers, debate is their first substantive exposure to politics —to policy ideas, to political theory (critical and otherwise), and to formulating and rebutting the sort of arguments that shape our political system.It’s an activity that selects for kids who often go on to have important careers in politics. Here’s a list of politically influential people who competed in Policy debate at the high school or college level—Presidents Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon; Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Senator Elizabeth Warren; Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Stephen Breyer; Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Republican political advisor Karl Rove, and Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal. Of course, most debaters don’t become famous politicians, but many of them take lower-profile public service jobs, are vocal about politics, and vote consistently.This is what concerns me so deeply about this seismic shift in the debate landscape—and why I would hate to see the Public Forum and Parliamentary formats follow the trajectory of Policy and Lincoln-Douglas. Kritiks promote a worldview with pernicious implications for American politics among a group of people who are likely to end up in positions to have a serious impact on American politics.When debaters reject the topic and advocate for these critical theories, they choose not to engage in pragmatic policy discussions. Instead, they condemn American institutions and society as rotten to the core. They conclude that reform is hopeless and the only solution is to burn it all down. Even if they’re not advocating for kritiks, in order to succeed at the national level, debaters have to learn how to respond critical theory arguments without actually disagreeing with their radical principles.High school debate has become an activity that incentivizes students to advocate for nihilist accelerationism in order to win rounds. It’s the type of logic that leads young people to label both parties as equally bad and to disengage from electoral politics. What most normal people think debate is about — advocating either side of a plausible public-policy topic — is no longer the focus. With kritiks taking a larger share, debate is increasingly societally rejectionist. Too often the activity is no longer a forum for true discussion, but a site of radicalization.1Critical theory has many different definitions as used by people in the political discourse, but this Wikipedia definition is a good fit for how high school debaters think about it: “a critical theory is any approach to social philosophy that focuses on society and culture to attempt to reveal, critique, and challenge power structures… it argues that social problems stem more from social structures and cultural assumptions than from individuals. It argues that ideology is the principal obstacle to human liberation.”2The first two kritiks (Marxism and securitization) are from the Oregon FV Playbook, a collection of college debate arguments that many high schoolers use. The third kritik (Afro-Pessimism) was taught at the Point of Information Parliamentary debate camp.3Here’s a brief timeline of the development of the different high school debate formats:1920: Policy debate is founded1980s: Lincoln-Douglas debate is founded1990s: Kritiks come to Policy and Lincoln-Douglas and soon become popular2002: CNN Founder Ted Turner launches Public Forum2009: Parliamentary debate is founded2010s: Kritiks come to Public Forum and Parli, but are much less popular than in Policy and Lincoln-Douglas4These formats were started as a response not only to critical theory, but also to speed debate — often a related phenomenon. If you watch any of the examples of kritiks that I’ve linked to, it’s likely you will not be able to understand what the debaters are saying because they’re talking so fast. I abhor this trend, but it’s not the focus of this article.5Parliamentary debate has had an unusual trajectory: it’s the only format to take significant action against the rise of critical theory. In 2019, the National Parliamentary Debate League Board elected a slate of candidates who opposed critical theory. These new Board members selected judges for the National Championship who would not vote for these arguments. As a result, the prevalence of kritiks declined in this format. However, they are still a part of the activity and important to learn for high-level success.Subscribe to Slow BoringTens of thousands of paid subscribersStart your day with pragmatic takes on politics and public policy.Subscribe 311 Likes · 10 Restacks 311 361 Share 361 Comments James 21 hr ago Liked by Maya BodnickAnother interesting Maya post.

Back when I was a nationally ranked high school policy debater (did quite well at TOC if I do say so myself), K was sort of frowned upon but definitely growing in popularity. The big focus was on body counts. No matter the topic or the side you were on, you would win by “proving” your opponent would lead to the larger pile of dead bodies. This led to truly horrid arguments constructed on the most tenuous of links that eventually led to global thermonuclear war or biological catastrophes or whatever. Sure, we were arguing the topic but I’m not sure there was anything more valuable going on by doing so. It’s specious either way.Also, the debate community needs to pick up judges from outside of the undeclared-humanities-focused-sophomore. If you can find an upperclassmen engineering major with free time, none of those Ks will win.More than anything, high school debate made me into an asshole. All I wanted to do was start arguments and win them. That’s fine when you’re only spending time with other debaters. When I got to college, that made it hard to make friends.

I have a soft spot for this. My grandfather, before he fled Belarus, was trained at a yeshiva and on his way to becoming a rabbi. His explanation of the training was ... Jedi-like, to my young mind. Students were paired off and given a biblical passage to examine, say, Jonah and the whale. One student would have to defend Jonah while the other defended, basically, God. After ten minutes, the teacher would say \"switch\" and they would have to defend the opposite side with equal logic and vigor. This was the making of a mind. Any shortcuts to rhetorical passion might be allowed, but learning to parry them and see through them was what was truly valued... well and beyond the ability to convince others (and certainly beyond obedience or conformity). Not surprising that my family in the US became lawyers.This is not to say that there's anything wrong - morally or rhetorically - with breaking the game if you don't like the choices. There's no unfair play when the point is to win a debate. Debates are not won by changing your opponent's mind - I mean, who cares? They're won by convincing whoever else is listening. That being said, failing to take the unlikeable part of a debate is read as cheating - if not to the judges, who may share your bias, then to the audience who you've alienated and failed to convince. And so it can and should fail in the long run, as an impurity in the art.replyatoav 4 hours ago | parent | next [–] Socrates was already complaining about the sophists and their ability to argue for and against everything (destroying every truth on the way).Don't get me wrong, I love arguing and rhetorics, but there are people who abandoned all sense of truth and rationality in debate. Rhetorics are a weapon, and like every weapon it should be wielded by people who know that with great power comes great responsibility. Sure, one can argue about objective truth and whether it actually exists, but many who wield rhetorics don't give a damn about any truth, be it objective or subjective — they care about winning. And they don't care about the price everybody has to pay for that win.Despite that I still think putting yourself in a different position to defend is a good lesson, but the goal of rhetorical training shouldn't be to form ruthless mercenaries, but thinkers who can wield the word and still admit they are wrong in an actual, real world debate, when they are shown to be so.If you are one of those people (like me) who likes debate for debates sake, you have to be especially careful. Like people who like to use guns we have to be especially aware when we use it and for what reason.Most people who use their rhetoric have never been given the moral compass to wield it.replynoduerme 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Hmm.I don't think the rhetorical appeals to anger, hate and fear that are the hallmarks of genocidal leaders are learned in a debate class. They're low-level schoolyard bully stuff. They're exactly the sort of thing that's tempered by the conscience you develop if you are exposed to new ideas or have to argue something that's strange to you. Hateful rhetoric drives, and is driven by emotion. So is loving rhetoric. If you find you have to defend some group of people you previously had a loathing for, there's a fair chance you'll start to see things from their point of view, if only because it's human nature to become emotionally invested in what you're arguing about. (Check out any stupid bar fight where both sides know they're wrong, but are completely emotionally invested).Yes, speech is a tool and a weapon. We should call out arguments made in bad faith; but we need more people who can identify them to do so.replycaned 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Sadly, it seems the kind of caution you advocate is conspicuously absent from cable \"news\" punditry.

Looking back on an episode originally aired in 2016, we take a good long look at the world of competitive college debate.> This is Ryan Wash's story. He's a queer, Black, first-generation college student from Kansas City, Missouri who joined the debate team at Emporia State University on a whim. When he started going up against fast-talking, well-funded, “name-brand” teams, from places like Northwestern and Harvard, it was clear he wasn’t in Kansas anymore. So Ryan became the vanguard of a movement that made everything about debate debatable. In the end, he made himself a home in a strange and hostile land. Whether he was able to change what counts as rigorous academic argument … well, that’s still up for debate.replyworrycue 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > Students were paired off and given a biblical passage to examine, say, Jonah and the whale.

This kind of \"argue both sides\" exercises seem more like practice in audience manipulation.replynoduerme 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No - particularly because these debates occurred at many tables simultaneously, like games of chess. Of course the point of rhetoric is to win an audience, but this type of training was much more than that.Plainly put: You can never truly arrive at or trust your own beliefs if you can't completely understand and articulate the best possible case against them. In order to do that, you must put yourself in the position of one who believes the opposite of what you do. Maybe you'll even find your own beliefs change in this process. But humility and courage of your conviction, if you have a conviction, demands that you can argue the other side better than anyone on the other side.Also, where reasonable people disagree, there are always two versions of the truth. Learning to grapple with that fact teaches one not to see everything in pure black and white. Which has the benefit of teaching one to judge practices on the merits rather than individuals on their orthodoxy.replySiempreViernes 7 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] > You can never truly arrive at or trust your own beliefs if you can't completely understand and articulate the best possible case against them. In order to do that, you must put yourself in the position of one who believes the opposite of what you do.No, \"both sidesing\" is not at all how philosophers or mathematicians train to establish the truth: they learn to identify overt and hidden assumptions and question the validity of this assumptions.This might happen when you imagine you truly hold some other position, but it is clear from the structure you describe (mostly unstructured talking to an opponent) that this is incidental learning and not the focus of the exercise.What you describe is plainly a exercise in rhetoric, the central conceit that one can simply switch positions after a fixed period of debate is clear enough evidence that truth seeking is not the goal.replybandyaboot 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Plainly put: You can never truly arrive at or trust your own beliefs if you can't completely understand and articulate the best possible case against them.How does one know when they completely understand the best possible case against their own belief?

Very often they don't, and the point of a debate is to detect and outline that difference, and show it to your audience, if any.The exercise is exactly to detect and pick a set of axioms that a particular character used to have, and then honestly think along those lines. It's a hugely important exercise, and not merely for disputes. It teaches you to think in terms of logic of somebody else, see their reasons, understand their feelings. That other party is not necessarily your opponent in any way; it could be your teacher or your student, your business partner, or even your spouse.Great many people are never taught how to leave the \"my truth is the self-evident truth\" point of view, and this results in a lot of suffering, theirs, and those who have to interact with them.replyhonzabe 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Not necessarily. We were doing this in sociology seminars at college and it was not about manipulating the audience at all. It is about stepping out of the opinion you inhabit and trying to look at it from your opponent's perspective. It is basically a practice of the skill of critical thinking. When you try to argue your opponent's side and to your surprise, you come up with arguments that seem good to yourself, that is getting closer to the truth, isn't it?replyworrycue 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > It is about stepping out of the opinion you inhabit and trying to look at it from your opponent's perspective.But you do this automatically when you are trying to discern the truth - invalid arguments are to be eliminated.The whole, now argue for the other side is kind of ... frankly, telling the anyone to argue for any side is ridiculous IMHO. You are pretty much putting the cart before the horse - i.e. picking a position before the arguing has even started.The whole point of discussion and debate should be to decide which position to pick (because it's the factually correct one).replyhonzabe 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > But you do this automatically when you are trying to discern the truth - invalid arguments are to be eliminated.The world would look a lot different if this were something people do \"automatically\". No, it is laborious and emotionally difficult, and even smart and intellectually honest people who try hard fail at it often.> The whole point of discussion and debate should be to decide which position to pick (because it's the factually correct one).Something in this formulation reminded me of those times at university - I was going through some sort of crisis during the first year. In my country at the time, elementary school and even high school approached things kind of like \"there are things you don't know yet and once you learn the facts, you will know the truth\". University destroyed this for me. I started to realize how flawed our brains are and how complex reality is. There are facts that are and always will be beyond our grasp and we can only have approximations of approximations, simplified models that hopefully work well enough to be useful. It was surprisingly emotionally difficult for me to accept that fundamental insecurity and un-discoverability of some ultimate \"truth\".replyfreeopinion 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Perhaps. Or maybe there is a completely different purpose in this exercise. We could pick a topic like \"Passing by reference is better than passing by value\". In the end we might not care at all about \"getting to the truth.\" The topic could be \"salt tastes better than pepper.\"The point of this exercise could be to learn that \"nine out of ten dentists\" arguments are flawed and why. It could be to practice listening skills to be able to \"flow\" the points of discussion.These practices might not be to get at the truth of any particular argument, but to learn methods to get at the truth of any and all arguments.replynoduerme 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] There are cases where people are intractable in their beliefs, and both may be right. Abortion in the US is a good example. Regardless of what I personally believe, I will not write off half the people I meet as moral idiots or say that they don't have a valid point. I think both sides are right and wrong, and I don't have the indecency to believe I should be an arbiter of every case. And I could argue either side. That's important when you go from your general principles to being forced to deal with the individual cases. The most astonishing thing about the law is what it shows you about the individual nature of most incidents. No two things are alike.If you are in a courtroom, say, serving on a jury, you will be presented with carefully crafted discussion and debate which will make you think the best and worst of both sides. The lawyers presenting those cases could switch at any moment and present to you the opposite side's case. Does the opposite side not deserve representation? How many false convictions resulted in the death penalty because a lawyer failed to argue their client's case well enough? How many pagans were burned at the stake, or Christians crucified and fed to lions, because people were taught that argumentation was to decide which position to pick? Discussion is to open your eyes, not close your mind.replyfreeopinion 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It is common in high school debate tournaments to argue the same resolution repeatedly at every tournament through the school year. Each match you are assigned one side or the other and you should be ready to go 100% on that side. You aren't trying to persuade anybody. You are trying to make as many arguments as you can, be ready and refute any arguments from the other side, identify logical fallacies, etc.The point of the year long effort, in my opinion, has nothing to do with any particular topic. It is to improve your critical thinking and to recognize various techniques used against you in everyday life. It is so that you can spot the problems when Trump tries to sell you hogwash or when Biden tries his pitch. It is to help you stay protected when your school district or home owners' association or even you yourself use faulty reasoning to justify a bad policy. So you can not be persuaded by things you should see through.These are skills sorely lacking in most of the world where I live.replynoduerme 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] >> It is to improve your critical thinking and to recognize various techniques used against you in everyday life.This is right on the money. That's why it's a shame to short-circuit any debate by conflating the person taking a side with the side they're taking. Come to think of it, that's also a great reason why it's good to force debaters to take both sides... because neither can be held liable as it's not \"their\" opinion, and they're free to use their minds without fear of being judged.replyvintermann 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yes - and it's rich to me that veterans of sophistry as a game are complaining about new tactics.

Even if they're leftists taking a generally leftist approach, a Marxist is likely to take up an Afro-pessimist position or vice versa for tactical reasons. Exactly the sort of \"have to defend the opposite side with equal logic and vigor\" you commend is involved - only rather than just two sides, the sides include \"X would have good consequences\", \"X would have bad consequences\", \"you're doing good/harm by talking about X\", \"X is on/off topic for this year's resolution\", etc.As for the article - it may be attempting to defend the virtue of being able to effectively defend opposing points of view, but it's doing so in a confused way at best. Just to give a couple examples:> Even if they’re not advocating for kritiks, in order to succeed at the national level, debaters have to learn how to respond critical theory arguments without actually disagreeing with their radical principlesIt is indeed often more effective in debate to respond to a critique by denying or reversing the (often tenuous) link to what you actually proposed than to try to refute an ideology wholesale, but that burden is entirely consistent with the mentality that learning to \"defend the opposite side\" is valuable. And even so the premise here is wrong - at least when I was doing thisyears ago, it was by no means taboo to simply counter-critique at the ideological level instead.> This drives out students who don’t want to learn about critical theoryIt's true that competing at the national level in high school or college debate demands quite a lot in terms of research and preparation. It's not, however, clear to me why it would be better to drive out students who refuse to advocate views with which they disagree (the mostly-straw critique debater) but are willing to actually prepare to face them, than to drive out students who are unwilling even to prepare to refute a certain category of argument.> High school debate has become an activity that incentivizes students to advocate for nihilist accelerationism in order to win roundsThis is silly hyperbole that suggests (a) Slow Boring could use better editing and (b) the author would have benefited from actually trying to engage with substance of some critiques, such that they might be able to distinguish Karl Marx or the afropessimists from Nick Land or the e/accs...replynoduerme 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] >> I'm legitimately not sure whetherI was referring to the article.>> It's not, however, clear to me why it would be better to drive out students who refuse to advocate views with which they disagree (the mostly-straw critique debater) but are willing to actually prepare to face them, than to drive out students who are unwilling even to prepare to refute a certain category of argument.Well, both students are unwilling to engage with the material they need to deal with, as unpleasant as it is. I personally don't think one is worse than the other on its face. But if the ground rules of the debate have shifted in a way that forces you to frame everything in a way that implicates the speaker as agreeing with the position they're arguing unless they use a particular category of argument to undermine that position while they're arguing it, then it's not a matter of learning to refute that category of argument but rather being forced to embrace it. Rejecting that artificial requirement to salt your own speech seems rather honorable in the \"purest\" sense of debate; whereas refusing to play by the rules and do the work of arguing something you don't agree with shows an unwillingness to engage with the subject matter - which is not the topic of debate, but the ability to debate.replyvxNsr 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Putting aside the whole question of debate this is a such a fascinating misunderstanding of what Yeshiva is.

A negative side that sticks to refuting the particular details of that policy is putting themselves at a severe disadvantage - they're always going to be behind in research and debate experience on that topic relative the affirmative (unless maybe they happen to use that same policy proposal themselves when assigned the affirmative). So debaters have used generic negative strategies for many decades, not just meta-critiques of their opponents discursive approach or assumptions (\"Ks\") but also \"disadvantages\" based on generalities like \"your proposal will use up political capital and prevent Y from happening\", and topicality arguments, where e.g. there might be two (or more) facially plausible interpretations of what's in scope for the topic, and they'll argue that whichever the affirmative has used to justify their proposal is incorrect.Debate is competitive. Yes, each side wants to \"get one over\" or \"blindside\" their opponent, but that's not different with the K than with any other creative argument or novel bit of research, and at higher competitive levels everyone is going to be quite comfortable debating the K (at least since the 1990s).replySeattle3503 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > The way policy debate works (traditionally) is that the affirmative side gets to choose a particular policy to advocate within a broad space.This seems like an advantage to the affirmative side. in that light, Ks are a strategy to negate the affirmative advantage.replybrightlancer 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Genuine question--if one isn't willing to debate the question at hand, then why debate at all?Why do people cheat at anything?

My time in debate made defending my honors thesis much less stressful and I’m a very calm presenter as a result.2. This is exactly what debate research forces you to do. You may not get to choose your side, but you’ve done your best to prep in either direction. You get very good at understanding if the evidence provided has any gaps, and if it supports the impacts claimed.3. Debaters do read judge profiles to understand the audience and determine strategy.4.

In general, debates are judged based on the stated arguments in the debates, which makes sense. However, what this often leads to is debaters simply preparing rote responses to any argument the opponent may present, and then reading off as many as possible (some even speak extremely quickly, called “speed”).The trouble with this is that most times, a nuanced or carefully considered argument will be quickly overridden by several generic responses, and when you don’t respond to all of their responses they will argue that you dropped the point and therefore they automatically win.Debates mostly devolve into a game of tug of war, with very little thought or quality put into the arguments. K’s are in a similar category, and are mostly successful in an attempt to catch the opponent off guard by arbitrarily changing the topic.Most of the skills I learned in debate have been thoroughly useless when it comes to determining the truth or making decisions. It has made it easy for me to derail discussions, though.replyajolly 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That was the big benefit I saw w/parliamentary debate over policy.

Debating dozens of times a year on an active team is an entirely different experience. I would not be surprised at all if debate team participation has significant overlap with the rhetoric taught to students in ancient times.Debating is an object lesson for the participants in how one can find (or should at least be able to find, if you're a good debater) arguments in favour of either side of any given issue.Debating, especially impromptu debating, teaches quick thinking. It also teaches an ability to empathize with people on any side of an argument - you know, from experience after debating, that one can make good arguments in favour of an arbitrary side of a topic. You regularly work through points of view that you may not personally hold.It's been said that math is learned at the end of a pencil - you learn it by working through it. Debating is the same - you learn empathy and understanding with points of view other than your own by working through them yourself.Edit: all of this is from my experience in parliamentary debating eons ago.

But the research and learning parts were a lot of fun. Some things I learned about in high school because of debate:1. A lot of stuff about the actual topics that we debated. Both in substance, and also in the relevant components of federal policy tools. Eg, I still know a lot of useless facts about US agricultural policy, US foreign aid policy c. mid-2000s, statistics on realistic offshore wind production capacity c mid-2000s, etc. Contra the narrative here: the actual policy topic stuff doesn't tend to age very well...2. How the Federal Reserve works: its history, its basic structure and mandates, the reason for its mandates, how decisions get made, how it interacts with other components of the federal government, etc. Also weekly deep dives into quantitative easing as it was being invented. Consequently, also quite a bit about the BOJ (I graduated in 2009, so my peak debate participation years were 2007-2009.)It's very important to note here: fiscal policy was NOT the debate topic that year! The topic was alternative energy. But we could link into fiscal policy via alternative energy by arguing that green energy investments were in essence stimulative fiscal policy and would trigger inflation when combined with QE and interest rate policy. And then we could benefit from having the most up-to-date evidence about what Bernanke would do (see #6). Again, in 2008-2009. As high schoolers. Without much or any adult direction.What other extra-curriculars let kids play these types of games?3. Some really useful law and policy specific research skills. How to find and read proposed legislation. How the legislature actually works. How to find and read court opinions. I know this stuff sounds trivial, but I still regularly have conversations with 30-70 year olds who have never actually read a bill or SCOTUS opinions, so it's apparently not something that people learn how to do in high school, or college, or graduate school.4. Yes, also quite a lot of critical theory. (It's part of the game and I don't get why people get so fussy about it. If the argument is bad, win. If you get an unfair judge and lose anyways, oh well. It happens and winning actually isn't the point anyways.)5. But most importantly, lots and lots of research skills.6. Quite a lot of natural language processing to help with 1-4, which became surprisingly relevant lately.Policy debate has its flaws. But, at least at my high school, there was no other activity that came remotely close to providing the pedagogical opportunities available in debate. Perhaps at elite private schools or schools in the wealthiest suburbs there are good alternatives.IME, that's still true now. This year's topic includes AI. I judged some debates this year and learned some stuff about AI by judging rounds. I'm not an expert or anything, but my PhD was at least AI-adjacent and I've been in AI labs for a good half decade now, so it was kind of surprising to learn new stuff from high school debate kids.Anyways.

The skill part of debate is knowing how to throw away as much useless arguments as possible and argume defensively and offensively against the parts that do matter.You do not have to bother with any of the opposing sides arguments if you have concluded they are pieces of trash. I myself have won debates just by proving in 10 seconds that 4 minutes of the opposing teams arguments was irrelevant and just moved on.Sheer volume is a valid tactic, since the opposing team COULD drop important arguments that actually matter, so that's part of the skill.

If arguments are being made, then there will be an argument about how to evaluate the arguments.Meta-debate is not unique to debates that contain critical theory. See e.g. http://open-evidence.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/file... which is full of meta-arguments that happen when there isn't any critical theory introduced into the round.Once you ask the question \"what is fiat?\" -- which becomes necessary far before any critical theory arrives on the scene -- the door is open to \"perhaps pretending something happens and then evaluating the effects isn't the best way to test a resolution\".My basic thought about how academic debate should work:1. Students should be allowed to choose their own arguments as often as possible.2. Judges should try to be as impartial as possible and should evaluate student's arguments rather than impose their own opinion. (Pedagogic debate and non-pedagogic debate serve very different purposes. The emphasis on the student's performance rather than the judge's understanding of the world is motivated by pedagogic considerations, and obviously isn't how debates should be evaluated in the real world.)3.

Sure, but framing a debate and constricting it to a dichotomy is no less radicalising than a critical theory argument. I think people dislike critical theory so much because they know that it shifts focus to the structures everyone knows control society but nobody wants to acknowledge. Sure, it’s lazy to blindly advocate for revolution for the sake of revolution, but it’s also lazy to reject a line of philosophical inquiry just because you don’t like how it was presented. What should high school debate even be for? Should we restrict it to rhetorical sandboxes, or should we allow it to be a forum where ideas can be put forth and debated?replysixo 10 hours ago | parent | next [–] Mmm, it's a dead-end without a philosophical framework powerful enough to contain it.It's like trying to decide how to build a system/business while also trying to work out what to build/what problem you're solving. At some point, to actually do anything, you have to pinch off the space of all possible problem requirements/business objective/etc.—not permanently, but long enough to start building! You certainly can't coordinate a large team to do it when the goal itself is changing. You have to draw a line around something and saying \"we're doing this\", and then focus on how to do it.In ML terms: If you don't commit to a goal for a while, then every time you encounter uncertainty in whether you're accomplishing your current goal, it will \"backpropagate\" to increase uncertainty in the goal itself. This can easily become unmanageable. To make any progress, you need a series of forward passes (attempting to do things) and backward passes (revising your idea of what you're trying to do.) Balancing these is a skill, and is highly contingent on what you're doing, runway, etc.Applied to debating with critical theory, this means: if you constantly cast doubt on the entire framework of modernity, you can never come up with a useful answer about any particular thing in the immediate present. Every potential harm or pain backpropagates to indict the entire system. These harms are rightly considered indictments of the system—but in the real world, unlike in a debate, you still have to act.I haven't done debate myself, but these same problems come up in internet discourse all the time, and it seems clear that you need to some equipment to handle this tendency to make any progress. What's necessary is the ability to designate \"responsibility\", i.e. leadership.replypclmulqdq 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I would suggest that it's a dead end without a mutually agreed upon philosophical framework to contain it. The participants in a debate are unlikely interested in agreeing to one particular framework, and this is a big part of why critical theory in other areas is such a hot-button issue: the philosophical presuppositions that critical [X] theorists want you to make are inconsistent with the worldviews of some other people (and even inconsistent with other critical theories in some instances).replyducharmdev 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I wonder if the speed/frequency of discourse has soured some of the potentially good ideas that critical theory can put forth.In college I had a deep interest in critical theory, but I recall most of my time with it spent simply thinking: reflecting on the ideas and critiquing them myself. We didn't exactly debate the ideas, either - it was more akin to collaborative analysis of their strengths and weaknesses.As you suggest, I think allowing this ebb and flow made the experience a more fruitful one.replyleetcrew 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] it's more that it's like showing up to a spelling bee and giving a long monologue about how the spelling of words is arbitrary and the entire competition is meaningless. you're not wrong, but you can't expect people to appreciate your derailing the event either. if you so thoroughly reject the premise of the event, why are you even participating?replyDiscourseFan 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Spelling bees are a quirk of the English language (though there are other languages with more perverse orthography see Hindi).I feel like the notion that words have a \"correct\" spelling, and memorizing that is turned into a competition that is often televised and broadcast and highly promoted to all middle-school students in the US, is probably political in nature. At least one should probably question why it is we even have spelling bees, the history of spelling bees, the structural questions, the constitution of the game itself as it relates to the worship of the Word (Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, as they say), and the place of the Word in the organization of society. But those are only a few things you could ask.A debate student, when asked to argue about the place of spelling bees in our society, might generate these very arguments. A young student who is winning a lot of spelling bees probably wouldn't, and they'd get laughed out of the auditorium if they couldn't answer and then started arguing that spelling bees were racist or something like that. I think your point is moot.replyleetcrew 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] sure, one can certainly question why spelling bees exist. I agree that the very idea of \"correct spelling\" in a language with so many borrowed/transliterated words doesn't stand up to close scrutiny. but at the same time, it's a lot easier to communicate when you can mostly replicate the same spelling and syntax of other writers. the spelling bee is just a game to motivate children to learn this practical skill. similarly, the objective of high school debate is not to settle important issues once and for all. it is an opportunity to practice tactical rhetoric skills.I was exactly the kind of student who loved to \"deconstruct\" this sort of contrived activity in high school. but frankly, now that I have the perspective to understand how insufferable this behavior is, I regret it. just let people practice the skill they want to practice in a fun competition. you don't have to participate if you think it's dumb.replywhimsicalism 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > if you so thoroughly reject the premise of the event, why are you even participating?Any debater making these arguments on the affirmative side almost certainly includes an argument answering this question when they are doing it.replytekla 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yep.

Examples of arguments of this nature are as follows: fascism good, capitalism good, imperialist war good, neoliberalism good, defenses of US or otherwise bourgeois nationalism, Zionism or normalizing Israel, colonialism good, US white fascist policing good, etc.”If there's no way to defend against an argument because it's Objectively Correct in the eyes of the judges, that isn't debate, it's a lecture with extra steps.

It was an extremely rare occurrence to run a negative plan (I'm not sure I ever saw it myself). An aff kritik would absolutely not have been tolerated as we would ding them significantly on Topicality (sticking to the required resolution), which is voted on halfway through the round (so if aff loses, the round is over). I was one of the most resolution bending debators, with most of my aff plans going outside the bounds of what everyone else thought of for that topic.I think my league was very abnormal however as we had a lot of layman, parent judges that we had to teach rules to (and sometimes the teams had conflicting interpretations), and we didn't allow more abusive techniques such as speed and spread (a common technique in Policy or Parli to present arguments as quickly as possible to prevent the opposite team from being able to address all of them, resulting in a de facto win). We would never have allowed someone to judge with a bio of \"I will no longer evaluate and thus never vote for ... fascism good, capitalism good, imperialist war good, neoliberalism good, defenses of US or otherwise bourgeois nationalism\", and it's insane to me that this was allowed at a top end tournament. There were certainly judges that brought their own priors (and we tried to keep track of them to help the rest of our club out), but they generally didn't announce it in such a damaging way.replywhimsicalism 10 hours ago | parent | next [–] Your league sounds typical of debate leagues, it is the national circuit that is abnormal.replyajolly 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Did you find speed or spread common in Parli?

Unfortunately, debates are often structured in a way that forces students to accept some ideas and prevents them from expressing others, which is a problem.For example, whether you argue to raise or lower the minimum wage, either way you are still implicitly accepting the wage system. By framing the debate in this way, the teachers prevent students who oppose the wage system from having an opportunity to express their views.Another example - as Noam Chomsky wrote about in \"Manufacturing Consent\", after the Vietnam War, the New York Times discussed many different theories for why the US didn't \"win\" the war. But it never considered the obvious - that the war itself was a mistake, and the US was wrong to be there in the first place. Framing the debate in this way is a way of silencing the opposition, by presenting two \"sides\" that are actually both on the same side and only disagree about trivial details.If you opposed the Vietnam war, then it would be against your interests to follow the rules of a \"debate\" about how to win the war. The correct course of action in this scenario is to take the opportunity to argue for what you believe and to undermine the debate itself, even if it results in you \"losing\" the debate.replymorelisp 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Yes, but a more important function of debate in school is to expose people to new ideas and to question assumptions.While this is definitely the overall goal of teaching debate, it's not clear to me this is actually how policy debate in school should operate in order to teach that. For one thing, I think other events (congressional is more persuasive and iterative, group discussion more freeform and collaborative, L-D more moralistic) have the potential to do this better. Policy's structure is really meant to force you to defend an evidence-based position in depth. Basically inherent the format is that at least 50% of the time you won't agree with it.replywhimsicalism 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The point of extra-curricular high school debate is there is a topic and there are norms that we are here to discuss the topic.

'They should lose because they are not talking about the topic which means we lose out on that creative structure. I have to take some ridiculous side like \"racism is good\" if I want to oppose them.

A fairly straightforward topic.In one tournament we ran into a team whose affirmative plan was, “ban oil-eating microbes”. Basically they ran with “evidence” from some articles written by crackpots who postulated that these microbes used to clean up oil spills could mutate into something that would essentially eat all life on the earth.You had to be ready to handle things like this so you would have a number of generic negatives that you would try to tie in.

IMO it's also a fair bit of sophistry, but it's at least sophistry that involves some amount of concept compression. Ie, you can't quite unpack those concepts into a single paragraph of similar size.Also: please remember, in these conversations, that we are talking about things written by teenagers.> Does this actually have a meaning?Yes.Here's a much better but slightly lossy way of saying this:If you talk about North Korea only as a threat to be contained, then you can fall into the trap of forgetting that it's a country of humans. That could be a bad trap to fall into for a number of reasons. One reason: if you forget about your adversary's humanity then it becomes easier to commit atrocities. It's easier to \"contain the communist threat\" than to \"fire bomb a village\". Instead of rushing ahead with policy decisions that manage North Korea as an abstract security threat, we should first try to understand the various perspectives of people within North Korea.Hopefully easier to understand.The reason it's not pure sophistry is that there are some details I left out -- the second sentence of the original, in particular, has a fair bit of additional stuff packed into it. And the last sentence of my version is a bit over-simplified. Fully expanding everything might take a page or so; idk, I'm too exhausted to try :)But that's the basic idea. And, more to the point, that's the level of detail at which this idea that would actually matter in 99+% of debates. So that's probably how it should be stated.You can't learn without making mistakes, and these types of things are great teaching opportunities.On that note: this type of writing also happens in Mathematics and especially in documentation of complicated software. We have a sequence of long sentences relating fairly abstract concepts. If the reader already understands each of those concepts and how they typically interact, then the reader can piece together the meaning of the sentences quite quickly. But for a reader without that context the paragraph is utterly inscrutable, appears to be nonsense, and takes hours to unpack.The key observation here is about technical writing in general. Describe the basic idea without too much jargon. It's okay to remove some details and over-simplify! Then, if the reader needs more details, give the more precise statement. The expert can safely skim to the precise statement. Everyone wins. What a useful teaching tool!Aside: I've always found public reaction to these think pieces off-putting. I think of debaters as kids learning how to engage with ideas. The incredibly public and harsh critiques of their failures seems... mean spirited. People will actually project all the ills of American politics onto something written by a kid who is making his first attempt at packing a lot of concepts into a small space.

Structural reforms are needed, not minor adjustments to regulations that often go ignored.”If people don’t think that’s compelling, I’d love to hear that argument!

Good for the negation side. What is the minimum wage trying to solve?To get meta on this article, maybe debate itself should be reimagined. Pose a problem, like “too many jobs don’t provide a living wage for their locale”. Then ask for policy proposals.

    "originBody": "Skip to content Thomas Pike’s other blogTales from a system administratorWhat happened to Vivaldi Social? 2023-07-28 —Posted in Software, System Administration, Technology — 25 min readOn Saturday 8 July 2023, user accounts started disappearing from the Vivaldi Social Mastodon instance. What was going on, how did this happen, and what were the consequences?This is a very long blog post, but to be fair, this was also to be a very long weekend.If you want to skip to the conclusion, there’s a TL;DR (too long; didn’t read) section at the end.Something’s not rightIt was around 17:25 Oslo time (CEST) on the Saturday that I first noticed something was wrong. I’d just got home from a bike ride, and when I happened to check my Vivaldi Social tab, it suddenly asked me to log in again. “Unusual”, I thought, but I wasn’t immediately alarmed by it. But then when I did log in, I saw that my home timeline was now completely empty. I quickly reached out to my colleagues.doing anything with mastodon? my home timeline is suddenly emptyMe, to my fellow sysadmins – Saturday 8 July 17:26 CESTMy fellow sysadmin Hlini very quickly got back to me. No work was ongoing, and his account was showing the same symptoms as mine. He offered to start heading to a computer so he could help me, an offer which I gratefully accepted.By 17:32, another colleague outside of the sysadmin team had also noticed the same issue. I started to look into the database to see what was going on.Something bad has happenedLooking at the database I could see that the affected accounts had apparently been deleted, and then recreated as a completely new account when the user logged back in.Immediately, I started looking to see what database backups were available. As expected, we had a nightly backup from 23:00 UTC on Friday night. I started copying the file to somewhere I could make use of it.While I was waiting for the backup file to copy, I started checking the database for other users that might be affected. Jón von Tetzchner’s account and another one that I checked had also been deleted, but had not yet been recreated, likely because those users had not tried to log back into their accounts yet.By this time, Hlini had arrived at a computer and started looking into things with me.I started checking the web server logs for account deletion requests, but nothing matching the account deletions showed up; and then I realized something else was odd about these deletions.Normally when an account is deleted in Mastodon, the username is permanently reserved as unusable. If you were to try to create a new account with the same name as a deleted account, it would not allow it (since, due to the nature of the Fediverse, having a new account with the same address as an old one would not be a good thing).But in the case of these deletions, we were getting reassigned the exact same usernames, so these could not be not normal deletions.By 18:39, Hlini had figured out the pattern: all accounts with an ID lower than 142 (ie. the oldest accounts) were missing from the database.We hadn’t seen any discussion from other Mastodon server admins about anything like this, and we wondered if this could be something unique to our setup – after all, Vivaldi Social uses vivaldi.net accounts for logins (thanks to Mastodon’s OAuth support) instead of the normal signup and login system of Mastodon. We started considering asking the Mastodon developers for help, and we also started discussing strategies for restoring the lost data from the backup.But then…Something bad is happening right nowAt 19:10, I checked the database again, and I saw that all accounts with an ID lower than 217 were now missing from the database, and that number was increasing. This meant that accounts were still being actively deleted from the database.By this point we both agreed that we needed more help, so at 19:18 we contacted the Mastodon developers. We immediately got a reply from Renaud, and he pinged Claire and Eugen to enlist their help.Stemming the floodAt 19:20, Hlini restarted all of the docker instances in our Mastodon setup. The deletions seemed to stop the moment he did this. The lowest ID in the database was now 236.Fortunately it turned out that it would stay that way.The investigation begins198 accounts in total had been deleted during the course of this incident, and over the next few hours, together with the Mastodon devs, we started looking into what could be going on. On Eugen’s suggestion, we looked into the possibility of it being the UserCleanupScheduler deleting accounts that were “unconfirmed”, but this was eventually ruled out, as the deleted users could never have matched the query that it operated on.Since we had upgraded to Mastodon 4.1.3 just 48 hours before the incident occurred, the Mastodon devs looked into all the code changes between v4.1.2 and v4.1.3 to see if anything there could be related. They even (and I cannot credit them enough for this) went the extra mile and looked through our published changes to see if any of the changes we had made could possibly lead to this. The conclusion though was that none of the changes could have triggered anything like this.At the suggestion of Renaud and Eugen, we checked the filesystem to see if the deletions were being done directly in the database, or if they were being triggered by Mastodon itself. We could see that the avatar and header images for the deleted accounts had themselves also been deleted. This meant that the deletions had to be coming from the Mastodon application itself.An attack?We also started looking for signs of system intrusion, since it was certainly a possibility that this was some kind of deliberate attack. I spent some time checking the various logs that we had available to us, but I didn’t find anything (though in these cases, the absence of evidence can never rule out the possibility).Because Mastodon v4.1.3 included a security fix, the devs also looked into the possibility of a related exploit, for which we combed through the logs, and examined the filesystem for evidence of such an attack. Again though, nothing was found.We debated whether we should take Vivaldi Social offline altogether while we continued the investigation. The Mastodon devs gave arguments in both directions:In favour of taking it offline: if we have to roll back the database to the backup, then more content will be lost the longer we keep it up. In favour of keeping it running: if it is an attack, and it resumes, it might give us more opportunity to investigate how it’s being done.We ultimately decided to keep it running. In truth what swung the decision that way was probably not the balance between the above arguments, but just a simple fact of us being sysadmins…https://xkcd.com/705/ Humans need sleepThe hours were passing by, and soon it was starting to get late on Saturday night. Claire wrote and provided for us a patch that we could deploy to add some logging for account deletion actions. I added the patch to our local repo and Hlini started the build process going.I let the others know that I was going to at least attempt to get some sleep, sentiments which the others also shared. At 00:15 I went off to bed. At 00:29 Hlini reported that he had deployed the patched version and also went to get some rest after checking that everything was still working.So ended the first day.Dawn of the second daySleep did not come easily, since so much was going through my head, but I eventually managed to get maybe a few hours of actual sleep, before getting back to work somewhere around 09:30 on Sunday.The Mastodon devs were already awake and had asked us some more follow-up questions, so I set about answering those, checking the admin actions log, detailing our API usage, doing more searching of the log files and doing my best to provide details about our production environment.By this point, although they were certainly keeping an open mind about the possibility of this being a software bug, the devs felt it more likely that this problem was being caused by some kind of attack. Because of this, I made sure that our internal security team at Vivaldi was up-to-date with everything that had occurred and been discovered so far. This would actually turn out later to lead to a lucky break in our investigation…Some time after midday I also started to think about our options for data restoration. At 12:26 I asked the devs if they had any advice for how to do a selective restoration, and in particular how to deal with accounts that had been recreated. I then started looking at the database relations myself to figure out which tables would likely need to be recovered. At 12:54 I began the first steps of developing a script to restore the lost data.The lucky breakRoughly an hour into my development at 13:56, Yngve (one of our security experts at Vivaldi) replied to my earlier message about the current state of the investigation. He reported that his profile page in Vivaldi Social was not loading properly. A series of HTTP 500 errors were being reported when he tried to view it. I checked the database, and could see that Yngve’s account was not one of the 198 accounts that had been deleted, so this was very curious. I checked his profile page myself, and also saw the same errors.I looked into the Mastodon logs to see if I could find any sign of these errors, and found indeed that there were error messages. I forwarded these findings on to the Mastodon devs. Claire replied, asking for the full stacktraces for the log entries, which I was able to also extract from the logs.At the same time, another of my sysadmin colleagues, Ísak, started looking in to the logs with me. He discovered that there were now a lot of errors like these in the logs, and there was a common element to all of them. Each of the errors referenced an account on another Mastodon instance – the same account and instance in every single case. For the purposes of this retelling of the story, we’ll call the other instance social.example.com.Based on this information, Claire started directing me to return the results from various specific database queries. One of the queries that we ran was to select all statuses (aka. posts or toots) from the database belonging to the mystery account on social.example.com.That query returned 17600 rows.Either this was an incredibly prolific Mastodon user, or something else very strange had happened.At 14:43, via querying the database and comparing to the backup I confirmed that all of the statuses for all of the deleted accounts had been reassigned to this 1 user on social.example.com.Initially Claire suggested that maybe we were seeing an incredibly rare case of PostgreSQL database corruption, and I was absolutely willing to entertain any possibility at this point, but just a few minutes later, realization struck.The realizationAt 15:00, having started developing a theory, Claire asked me to check for AccountMergingWorker entries in the Mastodon worker logs. Several more database queries followed, and also some commands run via the Rails console. By this point she was pretty sure that the account merge worker had for some reason kicked in and started merging all accounts into the 1 remote account, but she had not yet pinned down what exactly that reason could be.Ísak dug back in to the web server logs for the day before, looking for the first sign of any contact from the social.example.com instance. He found that the instance had contacted Vivaldi Social at 17:15:33 on Saturday. This was just 10 minutes before I had first noticed problems with my account at the start of this saga.PostgreSQL replicationClaire now started asking questions about our database setup. Specifically, did we have any kind of PostgreSQL replication configured. I was able to confirm that yes, we did indeed have a 2 server replication setup.This turned out to be the final piece of the puzzle.The theoryAt 17:28, Claire put forward her theory as to what had happened:Vivaldi Social was notified by social.example.com about a username change for one of their accounts. The new account was created in our database with a null value in the URI field. The new account then got its URI set to the correct value for the remote account. A run of the AccountMergingWorker was scheduled (via Redis), to merge data from the old account to the new. Because of delays in the database replication, steps 3 and 4 effectively happened in the wrong order, purely due to bad luck with the timing. The AccountMergingWorker dutifully started merging all accounts with a matching URI value into the new account.And it just so happens that all local accounts in a Mastodon instance have a null value in their URI field, so they all matched.Claire theorized that such a thing would be more likely to occur if the database were under heavy load that caused extended replication delays.“What are the next steps?”With a very probable cause now identified, Jón asked what the next steps should be. We agreed that the best course of action was for me to return to focusing on recovery efforts, while Claire would write a patch that we could apply to prevent this reoccuring.Also with Renaud’s help, I was able to provide further details about the replication setup, which confirmed that the worker processes were configured in a way that they could perform database reads against the standby server (using a tool called Makara). This information led all 3 of the devs to agree that we had almost certainly now found the root cause.Within just a few minutes, Claire provided a patch for us, which I pushed to our repository.Recovery processThe recovery process was possibly even more of a rollercoaster ride than the problem itself.At 16:09, Jón and I had a discussion about the best course of action for recovery. Given the amount of perceived data corruption that had occurred, I was now leaning towards doing a full rollback of the database, and Jón agreed that was probably the way to go. After helping out the Mastodon devs with the replication investigation, I took a much needed break. At 17:03, the sysadmin team had a quick discussion and together we agreed to proceed with the full database restore.A full restore was actually not going to be as simple as we hoped. We knew already from the earlier restore of the backup database that there was one part of the process that would take a very long time, due to a known performance issue that affected our instance. So instead of restoring directly, we planned to convert the .dump file into a .sql file, and edit the .sql file to replace the offending query with a more performant one.The conversion of the .dump file finished at 17:23, then the problem was how to perform the edits. Editing a 54GB text file comes with its own set of problems. Most text editors will struggle with that kind of size.At the same time as I was pondering the best strategy for editing the file, Claire started suggesting a strategy for doing a selective database recovery. I explained that we had decided to do a full restore, but when we discussed the reasoning for this (the difficulty in knowing what data had been corrupted), I eventually became convinced that perhaps a selective restore would be possible after all. She agreed to help out by providing full details of what database tables the account merge operation will have touched.In the sysadmin team we decided to split our efforts. I would work on the selective restoration efforts, while Hlini would carry on working on the full restore procedure. I continued working on the script that I had started on earlier in the day.Patches and configuration changesBefore he could work on the restoration process, Hlini also had the task of applying the patch that we’d been given, and also changing our database configuration so that we weren’t using this (no-longer-recommended) replication setup. At 17:58, he deployed the changes, and something went wrong. We had our first (and only) full downtime of Vivaldi Social in that weekend. By 18:18, Vivaldi Social was back up and running, and by 18:44 the changes were deployed again, this time successfully.So, we were now reasonably confident that we were protected against this incident happening again. Now the only thing we needed to focus on was getting the data back.Recovery work continuesAt 19:25, I told the other sysadmins that I had hit a wall in my scripting process. I was having technical issues with the PDO module that I was using to interact with the database, and I needed another pair of eyes to look at it. I showed my work so far to Ísak to see if he could spot my obvious mistake, but he didn’t find anything immediately obvious. By 19:55, I decided to give up completely on the script.Instead I decided to help out Hlini with his task. He was now in the process of editing the 54GB .sql file.His first attempt was to edit the entire file with vim. I checked the changes that he was applying, and they seemed to look ok.I tried running the import of the resulting .sql file, and it quickly returned an error. It turned out that the file that vim ended up saving was for some reason truncated at 629MB, so we decided to try another approach. I split the file into 2 chunks to make editing it easier:head -c50000 dump.sql > split tail -c+50001 dump.sql > split2and Hlini applied his changes again. I then merged the files together (after removing the trailing newline that vim had added):head -c-1 split > split3 cat split3 split2 > dump-patched.sqland when that was done, attempted another import.Unfortunately that attempt also failed.For the third attempt, I split the file precisely around the section to be edited, so it was split into 3 pieces. This attempt also failed in the same way as the previous one, but by doing the split in this way I was able to generate a sensible diff of the edited section, and that allowed me to spot the error we had made (a case of mismatched paratheses).At 21:26, on the fourth attempt, we finally started running the import of the .sql file in preparation for the full restore.While the import was running, I asked Ísak to have another go at trying to figure out what was wrong with my code, and he started digging into it.The bug in my codeAt 22:50, Ísak got back to me. He’d figured out what I’d done wrong. Like most bugs it was a stupid mistake on my part, related to how I had bound the parameters of one of the database queries (by reference instead of by value). In my defence, I was very tired by this point.Now that the problem had been found, I decided once again to start working on the selective restoration process (the database import was still running).By 23:04, I had managed to finish the first part of the script, which would fix the user, account and identity records of the 198 affected users. I used the script to restore mine and Ísak’s profiles first. We saw that the avatar and header images were now missing (as they had been deleted from the filesystem), but otherwise the profiles looked good. With advice from Ísak, I adjusted the script to force Mastodon to refetch the avatar image when the user next logs in to Vivaldi Social.By 23:55, I had finally finished my work on the script. In theory it would now be able to return everyone’s statuses, follows, followers and all other relationship data that referenced the 198 users to the state it was in before the incident.Selective restoration beginsI soon realized that due to database relationship constraints we would need to do the restoration in 2 stages, fixing the user/account/identity records for all 198 users first, before then proceeding with the rest of the data.At 00:08, I completed the first stage of this, fixing the accounts of all the affected users.Next I tried running the second stage fixes for just a single account (my own). This worked, but my profile now showed the same issues that Yngve’s had done earlier on Sunday. Checking with Ísak, we realized this was because I had boosted posts that belonged to one of the other affected users.Seeing no other option than to go ahead and run the second-stage fixes for all 198 users, I took the plunge and started it going at 00:46.At 00:55 the script hit an UPDATE query that failed due to a duplicate key. I figured out that this was because the user in question had logged in to their account and set up some of their follows again. I modified the script to handle this scenario by deleting records that could not be restored in this way and keeping the newer record intact.The script was soon humming away again, gradually fixing all of the corrupted and lost data.The anticipation of successBy 01:14, Ísak reported that he could now view all of his posts, although his profile was not yet working.By 01:18 though, my profile page was finally working again! This meant that all the accounts that I had boosted posts from had now been restored. The mood in the sysadmin team was now extremely buoyant.holy shit guys, this is actually workingMe, to my fellow sysadmins – Monday 10 July 01:18 CESTholy moly my profile looks okHlini, to his fellow sysadmins – Monday 10 July 01:26 CESTThe script finished its final task at 01:27 on Monday morning. Things were looking pretty good now. The only thing that was noticably off was that the Home feed of the affected users was now empty. I was fairly sure that this was just a simple indexing issue, and asked Hlini if he could fix it. At 01:40, Hlini reported that the re-indexing of the home feeds had completed.JubilationAnd there it was. My home feed, and the home feeds of all 197 other affected users were now back as they were, almost as if nothing had ever happened.The full rollback and restore never became necessary.Emotionally I was now on an insane high after the devastatingly exhausting and stressful period that we had all just been through. I thanked the sysadmin team for all of their help, and the Mastodon devs for all of theirs. I knew that I desparately needed sleep, but that in my current state I would not be able to do so, so I went out for a 2 AM run to try and clear my head.Eventually I was able to rest, and get some sleep.The follow-upOn Monday morning I returned to work at 10:50, and soon got a report that there were some things that needed fixing. The main issues were:6 Users with symbols in their usernames couldn’t log in. This turned out to be due to a mistake I’d made in the recovery script, and was very easily fixed. Web settings for the 198 affected accounts had been lost. This was an omission in the recovery script, I adjusted the script to add the table that I’d missed, and this data was restored. Counters on profiles (number of followers, posts etc) were wrong. This was considered a lower priority to fix and was left for now. One user (not among the 198 accounts) reported problems with their account that were hard to explain. I looked into this, but was not able to fix it straight away.By 14:20 on Monday I knew that I was at my exhaustion limit and couldn’t do anything more. I took the rest of the day off to go for a walk and try not to think about anything Mastodon-related.On Tuesday I returned to looking at the 2 remaining problems. The incorrect counters turned out to be easy to fix, just needed the right command, which Claire provided for us. Then Claire and I looked at the broken account, eventually leading me to write another script to fix the data issues that we saw, fixing the 4 accounts that were affected in this way.Official fixes in MastodonThe Mastodon devs warned other server owners of the dangers of using Mastodon with a Makara-based replication setup. Fortunately such setups are rare, as they would only ever be even considered for large instances like ours.With the release of Mastodon v4.1.5 came 2 changes that are related to this incident:Preventing the use of Makara with sidekiq workers A proper fix to ensure correct order of operations in account mergesSo hopefully no-one else will have to go through this.An experience not to be repeatedI do hope I don’t have to go through an experience like this ever again. Although the satisfaction and extreme emotional high at the end of the ordeal was quite something to experience, that really didn’t make up for the stress that we all went through. I have since recovered though, having taken plenty of time off work in lieu of all the extra weekend hours worked.I do though want to give some massive thanks to everyone who helped out.To Hlini and Ísak, my amazing sysadmin colleagues. Together we did the impossible, and without both of you we would never have done it. Thank you! (And Claudia, we missed you! Hope you enjoyed your vacation away from all of this!) To Renaud, Claire, and Eugen of the Mastodon developer team, who went above and beyond all expectations to help us out. You folks were amazing, you took our situation very seriously, and immediately jumped in to help us. I really could not have asked for anything more. Thank you! To our CEO Jón S. von Tetzchner, for being supportive throughout the entire crisis, and helping coordinate communication with the Mastodon devs. Thank you! To Yngve, for providing the crucial piece of information that led us to find the root cause. Thank you for your vigilance. To Björgvin, Jane, Daniel, Paweł and everyone else in the Vivaldi team for reporting issues to us and helping make sure that everything was restored correctly. Thanks! To our Vivaldi Social users, for being understanding of what was going on, and for all of your kind words after we got everything working again. We appreciate you all very much! TL;DRI did warn you it was long.A bug in the code combined with an ill-advised database configuration caused 198 user accounts to be merged to a single remote account. An entire weekend was spent finding the cause and fixing the damage caused.Incident timeline summaryTimes in UTCSaturday 15:15 – Vivaldi Social is sent an account rename message from an external instance.

Since it did not, we could draw the conclusion that the accounts were not simply deleted in the database.Reply Tuga says: 2023-07-29 at 14:06“Purely due to bad luck with the timing.”Unlike real-life scenarios influenced by various unpredictable factors, coding is purely based on the instructions and procedures put in place by a programmer. There is no concept of “luck”. An occurrence often dubbed as “bad luck” in coding is usually the result of overlooked contingencies, bugs, or faulty logic within the code. Thus, the preferred term would be “bad code” or “poorly written code”, not “bad luck”.Reply Thomas Pike says: 2023-07-29 at 14:11Sure, a more accurate description would probably be a “timing bug”.Reply Vekkq says: 2023-07-30 at 00:02A race condition.Reply Thomas Pike says: 2023-07-30 at 00:33That’s the term I was looking for.

I don’t think they would have seen much. There might be a possibility that because they were now (according to Vivaldi Social) following a whole bunch of accounts that they weren’t before, that their server could have received notifications for them (if those followed accounts were also on Vivaldi Social, and they posted something), but their server would not have any record of such a follow relationship, so I suspect that any such notification would be ignored. I’m not an ActivityPub expert yet though.Reply wildente says: 2023-07-29 at 16:48Before reading this, I knew that you had a more than stressful couple of days.

Curious use of your time.Reply Vasil Kolev says: 2023-07-30 at 06:06I don’t run mastodon, so I might be wrong, but from the whole post it looks like there is not enough visibility in what the system does. You had to reach to the developers to see that the account merge was happening, and I’d expect that operation like this would be logged and greppable, thus easier to identify.Also, I hope after your experience that there will be some better backup/restore tools, as being able to restore a single user seems like an important feature for such system.(great post-mortem, but the way, and hope you got enough sleep afterward:) )Reply Thomas Pike says: 2023-07-30 at 11:54If we’d known it was the AccountMergingWorker, we absolutely could have grep’d for it much earlier than we did, but up until that moment on Sunday, we had no idea.I’ll probably try to at least release the script that we used to restore the lost accounts, maybe that will be of use to someone, somewhere.Reply CommentYour email address will not be published.

    "commentBody": "What happened to Vivaldi Social? (vivaldi.net)283 points by zhte415 21  76 commentsmollems 17 hours ago | next [–] Great writeup (including the human cost, e.g. loss / lack of sleep, which in my experience has a huge impact on complicated incident resolution).Here’s what jumped out at me: “The new account was created in our database with a null value in the URI field.”Almost every time I see a database-related postmortem — and I have seen a lot of them — NULL is lurking somewhere in the vicinity of the crime scene. Even if NULL sometimes turns out not to be the killer, it should always be brought in for questioning.My advice is: never rely on NULL as a sentinel value, and if possible, don’t allow it into the database at all. Whatever benefits you think you might gain, they will inevitably be offset by a hard-to-find bug, quite possibly years later, where some innocuous-seeming statement expects either NULL or NOT NULL and the results are unexpected (often due to drift in the semantics of the data model).Although this was a race condition, if the local accounts and the remote accounts were affirmatively distinguished by type, the order of operations may not have mattered (and the account merge code could have been narrowly scoped).replykaoD 14 hours ago | parent | next [–] What's the alternative, an empty string?IMO the problem (at least in this case) is not NULL in the DB, but NULL at the application level.If NULL is some sort of Maybe monad and you're forced to deal with it, well, you're forced to deal with it, think about it, etc.Empty string, whatever NULL string is in your language of choice, or some sort of sigil value you invent... not much of a difference.replyint_19h 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The problem is precisely that NULL is not some sort of Maybe monad, but people keep trying to use it as such. It's a lot like using NaN as a sentinel value for floats - sure, you can do that, but when something goes wrong, instead of an error at the point where the problem is, you end up dealing with a mysterious NULL somewhere way down the line. And that's the best case - the worst is that you get wrong query results because of the way NULL comparisons work.An empty string is better as a sentinel value because at least this doesn't have the weird \"unknown value\" semantics that NULL does. But if you really want the same level of explicitness and safety as an option type, the theoretically proper way to do this in relational model is to put the strings themselves in a separate table in a 1:N (where N is 0 or 1) relationship with the primary table.replyresonious 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It looks to me like using empty string would not have prevented the bug in the article. If their language had maybes, they might be able to prevent this bug by having a function type signature where uri is concrete. And most langs with maybes will automatically turn external nulls into maybes.replyvbezhenar 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] With empty string there's gotcha: Oracle treats empty string and null as the same values. If you really need sentinel value, generate UUID.replymst 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I believe that's a nasty implementation detail of Oracle and not a problem for anybody using anything else.A generated UUID, if possible, is probably much more clear because it will only be there if it was inserted very deliberately.But at that point honestly I'd usually prefer breaking the field out into its own table.replytedunangst 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] In this specific case, all the local users could have had URLs in the database instead of NULL (or empty string), which would have prevented them from merging.replysemiquaver 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Joins are cheap. Wide tables are often a sign that a data-model is a bit too CRUDdy. Foreign key relationships often do a much better job modeling optionality/cardinality in relational systems.In this case, a `user_uris` table with non-nullable columns and a unique constraint on `user_id` is the first option that comes to mind.replykaoD 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] For a table with a single column (plus FK), isn't LEFT JOIN isomorphic to just having a NULLABLE column (and much better at data locality)?It might prevent error if you only rely on INNER JOIN but that's rarely the case at least for me (you often want to access the record anyways).Much safer to deal with the NULL at the application level.replytraxys 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I had a situation where I'm not really sure I could have used something else than null: I need a value in one of two columns exactly (meaning one is NULL and the other not).You can build a constraint to check that if it's in the same table, but across tables it seems to be a bit more complex right ?replysnmx999 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You could have the first column indicate the type of value and the second column the value. If you now have your columns named \"a\" and \"b\" you could have the first column named \"type\" only allowing values \"a\" or \"b\" and the second column would be \"value\" where the actual value is stored.replymananaysiempre 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > What's the alternative, an empty string?Yes! NULL is relational for “don’t know”, and SQL is (mostly, with varying degrees of success) designed to treat is as such. That’s why NULL=anything is NULL and not e.g. false (and IMO it’s a bit of a misfeature that queries that branch on a NULL don’t crash, although it’s still better than the IEEE 754 NaN=anything outright evaluating to false). If the value is funky but you do know it, then store a funky value, not NULL.replyTylerE 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] But a known value of empty string is a fairly commonplace thing, and I have never wanted to treat that as null.replyTempest1981 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] A separate Boolean column?replykaoD 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Can't wait to have a NULL url and has_url TRUE.Might or might not be based in production data I deal with on a daily basis.replychipbarm 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I finally made an account just to respond to this, I hope you don't find that too aggressive a move.Null is a perfectly valid value for data, and should be treated as such. A default value (e.g. -1 for a Boolean or an empty for a string) can make your system appear to work where NULL would introduce a runtime error, but that doesn't mean your system is performing as expected, it just makes it quieter.I know it's tempting to brush NULL under the rug, but nothing is just as valid a state for data as something, and systems should be written generally to accommodate this.replycolejohnson66 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I agree with you re: NULL being a useful thing. I personally use nullable floats in an internal company program to denote unknown values. However, the \"billion-dollar mistake\" everyone brings up with it has to do with NULL allowance being implicit. In languages like C/C++, Java, C#[a] (and more), any pointer could be NULL and the only way to know is to do a NULL check. In SQL (which we're talking about here), one must explicitly call out `NOT NULL` in the column's definition.[b] Rust (and other FP languages) gets a point here by having \"optional\" types one must use to have a NULL-like system.[a]: C# is fixing this with \"nullable reference types\", but as long as it's still opt-in, it's not perfect (backwards compatibility and everything). I can still forcibly pass a NULL to a function (defined to not take a null value) with the null-forgiving operator: `null!`. This means library code still needs `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(arg)` guards everywhere, just in case the caller is stupid. One could argue this is the caller shooting themselves in the foot like `Option.unwrap_unchecked` in Rust, but \"good practice\" in C# (depending on who you ask) tends to dictate guard checks.[b]: Which is kind of stupid, IMO. Why should `my_column BOOL` be able to be null in the first place? Nullable pointers I can understand, but implicitly nullable everything is a horrible idea.replychipbarm 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In SQL as you've said, nullability is explicit. It's arguably the wrong way around (i.e. NOT NULL rather than NULLABLE), but it is explicit. I feel the issue comes from the intersection of languages without explicit nullability and their data storage techs; removing that explicit typing from SQL doesn't fix the issue.(I feel you agree with this btw, just being explicit)replybtown 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > the account merge code could have been narrowly scopedIMO automated merging/deduplication of \"similar\" records is one of those incredibly hard problems, with edge cases and race conditions galore, that should have a human in the loop whenever possible, and should pass data (especially data consumed asynchronously) as explicitly as possible, with numerous checks to ensure that facts haven't shifted on the ground.In many cases, it requires the implementors to start by thinking about all the concerns and interactivity requirements that e.g. a Git-style merge conflict would have, and try to make simplifying assumptions based on the problem domain from that starting position.Looking at the Mastodon source [0], and seeing that there's not even an explicit list of to-merge-from IDs passed from the initiator of the merge request to the asynchronous executor of the merge logic, it seems like it was only a matter of time before something like this happened.This is not a criticism of Mastodon, by the way! I've personally written, and been bitten by, merge logic with far worse race conditions, and it's frankly incredible that a feature like this even exists for what is effectively [1] a volunteer project! But it is a cautionary tale nonetheless.[0] https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/app/workers/a... (note: AGPL)[1] https://opencollective.com/mastodonreplywouldbecouldbe 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It’s not hard not to merge on null.I agree rest of it can be hard, and would be nervous. But this should have been obviousreplywouldbecouldbe 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Even if there is null, the merge function should have done some sort of null / istruthy check. That’s unbelievable.replymsla 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] NULL is inevitable if you use JOINs, simply as a matter of what a JOIN is.More deeply, NULL is inevitable because reality is messy and your database can't decline to deal with it just because it's messy. You want to model titles, with prenomials and postnomials, and then generate full salutations using that data? Well, some people don't have postnomials, at the very least, so even if you never store NULLs you're going to get them as a result of the JOIN you use to make the salutation.You can remove the specific NULL value, but you can't remove the fact \"Not Applicable\"/\"Unknown\" is very often a valid \"value\" for things in reality, and a database has to deal with that.replyempathy_m 18 hours ago | prev | next [–] The part that resonates here is saying\"ah yes well we have a full database backup so we can do a full restore\", then\"the full restore will be tough and involve downtime and has some side effects,\" then\"I bet we could be clever and restore only part of the data that are missing\", thendoing that by hand, which hits weird errors, thenfinally shipping the jury-rigged selective restore and cleaning up the last five missing pieces of data (hoping you didn't miss a sixth)Happens every time someone practices backup/restore no matter how hard they've worked in advance. It always ends up being an application level thing to decide what data to put back from the backup image.replySV_BubbleTime 18 hours ago | parent | next [–] I agree with you. The phrase is you don’t have backups unless you test your backups.But in this case I don’t really get what the issue is. Restore everything from the last good backup and people miss some posts made in the meantime, sucks, but it’s an instant solution instead of hand work and uncertainty.replyNikkiA 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] When I worked as a VMS sysadmin full restore checks were one of the things I insisted on doing, sure, it used up a morning every couple of weeks, and tied up one of our microvaxes, but it was worth it.Especially three months after I finished being sysadmin and moved to development, and they had a disk failure.me: 'so you have backups?'the replacement: 'sure, but they didn't restore'me: 'what's the last good backup you have?'tr: 'august, the last one you did'me: 'welp'tr's boss: 'guess £390,000 for third party disk recovery is our only option...'replyNikkiA 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] To add some context...Yes, it was documented in our ISO 9000 docs. But only 'strongly recommended' to perform a regular/routine test restore. I attempted to get it converted to a mandatory step, but since I was only a temporary sysadmin and an intern, it wasn't going to happen.I was told by my predecessor (who was a direct contractor to my employer) to perform it as routinely as I could. I would guess that he had attempted to get it put as a mandatory step, but his time was billed, mine wasn't, so shrug.My/the replacement was an external contractor as part of a 'company Y now provides system administration services' deal, who presumably ended up eating the liability of not having working backups that they were contracted to produce.As horrified as I was, 'it's not really my problem, I wasn't responsible' was the only attitude I could bear to take. Besides, I was busy with fortran.replypbjtime 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] \"If you've never tested your backup solution, you don't have a backup solution.\"replymartey 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] > To Renaud, Claire, and Eugen of the Mastodon developer team, who went above and beyond all expectations to help us out.

Thank you!I don't know if Vivaldi provides financial support to Mastodon (I couldn't find their name on the sponsors page). If not, I hope this situation causes them (and other companies using Mastodon) to consider sponsorship or a support contract.replyrenchap 14 hours ago | parent | next [–] We (the Mastodon non-profit) do not offer support contracts at the moment, but this is a good idea, thanks :)But we indeed have sponsorships open, and they really have impact.

It’s unlikely but totally possible for the server to crash inbetween query 1 and query 2, irrespective of database replication stuff. This is a textbook example of why you use database transactions.replyrsynnott 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think even without that there was likely still at least theoretically a race condition.replyyellowapple 19 hours ago | prev | next [–] One of the better post-mortems I've read in a long while.replypluto_modadic 14 hours ago | parent | next [–] I remember the hachyderm postmortems were also pretty good. I'm glad that folks are transparent.replyINTPenis 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] I'll never forget the first time I had to restore a massive sql dump and realized that vim actually segfaults trying to read it.That's when I discovered the magic of spit(1) \"split a file into pieces\". I just split the huge dump into one file per table.Of course a table can also be massive, but at least the file is now more uniform which means you can easier run other tools on it like sed or awk to transform queries.replywilliamdclt 14 hours ago | parent | next [–] I'm surprised that vim segfaults! I had it slow to open huge files, but I always assumed it could handle anything, through some magic buffering mechanisms. I could be wrong!That being said, from the point that one has to edit the dump to restore data... something is very wrong in the restore process (the knowledge of which isn't helpful when you're actually faced with the situation, of course)replyINTPenis 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes you shouldn't be manually restoring sql dumps but I've been working in this field long before versioned source control or pgbackrest existed.replyTerr_ 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I once had to administer a system where a particular folder had so many files that things stopped working, even the ls command would not complete. (It was probably on ext3 or ext2.)The workaround involved writing a python script that handled everything in a gradual manner, moving files into subdirectories based on shared prefixes.replyfragmede 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] oh yes. ls uses 4k buffers for dirents, and in a directory with lots of entries, the time for userspace to hit the kernel to list the entities until that 4k buffer is full, back in the day, became noticable. In my dealings with a system like that, I had a hacked copy of ls that used bigger buffers so at least it wouldn't hang. Tab completion would also hang if there were too many entries.replyTylerE 19 hours ago | prev | next [–] This make anyone elses eyebrows raise sky high at this?> Claire replied, asking for the full stacktraces for the log entries, which I was able to also extract from the logs.This is either deep voodoo magic, or the code or configuration is turning a Xeon into the equivalent of a 286.

It prints a stacktrace on any 500 or unknown error, and it's just line numbers and filepaths.> megabytes on every single hitI run a rails app that's very poorly designed.I just checked, and the stack trace for a single 500 is 5KiB. It doesn't even add up to 1MiB a day since there's only a 500 error about every hour.> This is either deep voodoo magic, or the code or configuration is turning a Xeon into the equivalent of a 286Having a call stack handy is is actually pretty performant. Java's default exception behavior is to bubble up a stack trace with every exception, whether you print it or not, and java applications run just fine. You have the call stack anyway since you have to know how to return, so the only extra information you need handy is the filename and line number debug symbols, and ruby needs that info anyway just by the nature of the language.replySV_BubbleTime 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] >Java's default exception behavior is to bubble up a stack trace with every exception, whether you print it or not,Anyone who has spent 5 minutes in Java knows exactly what this looks like. And also how unwelcoming it is to new programmers.replyTheDong 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have spent more than 5 minutes in java, and I don't know why having a stack available on an exception is unwelcoming to new programmers.It definitely seems better than the approaches some other languages have, like C's \"return code 1, check errno\", when most new programmers don't even know what an errno is.Can you explain it to me?replyvore 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Sure, but imagine how unwelcoming to everyone it would be if you didn't get a stack trace.replyk1t 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Recording stacktraces of errors is a pretty reasonable thing to do. And ideally not every hit causes an error.replywilliamdclt 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Do you mean you do _not_ capture stacktraces of errors in a live system ? How do you go about understanding where the error comes from ?replyjrockway 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I log stacks for every error-level log and have never found it that useful. It's better than just logging \"EOF\" with no context of course, but manually annotating each frame with information not known to the caller is the way to go. Shifting to Go specifics; stack traces miss things like channel recvs and loops. Consider: for _, datum := range data {if err := DoSomethingWithDatum(datum); err != nil {log.Error(...)}}In that case, the stack trace misses the most important thing: which datum failed.Another common case: type Thing struct {Value anyErr error}func Produce() {chIn that case, the stack trace misses the most important thing: which datum failed.OK we agree that the stacktrace isn't _enough_, but it's still a really useful thing to have to understand what exactly happened (and quite often the single most useful thing). Of course we still expect devs to capture the information that led to the `log.Error`, so that we don't have to play guess games.Rather than manually-annotated logs, I'd prefer getting rid of all logging altogether and use tracing (opentelemetry), which is precisely designed for observability.replyjrockway 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > I'd prefer getting rid of all logging altogetherI prefer to build metrics and distributed traces from logs! But, I think we can agree that they're the same thing. It's a stream of events that a system captures and lets you retrieve. (I wrote our logging/tracing/metrics library at work, and indeed I call any sort of start/finish operation a Span. https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/blob/master/src/inter...)Post-processing into an efficient retrieval system is the key. You can tail the logs and send span starts/ends to Jaeger, and you can tail the logs and send summarized metrics to Prometheus or InfluxDB. I really like having the too-high-cardinality raw data around, though, so I can analyze specific failing requests. For example, you wouldn't want to have per-request \"tx_bytes\" metrics in Prometheus; the cardinality is too high and it blows up the whole system. But if you log your metrics, then you find the request (grep for lines that contain the x-request-id), and you can see exact timestamps for when every megabyte of data was sent along with everything else that happened in between. (\"It took 10 seconds to send 1MB of this file?\" \"We did 300 point SQL queries between the 10th and 11th megabyte?\" Things like that.) Meanwhile, you still have summarized data for alerts (\"across all requests handled by this machine, 90% of requests are taking longer than 10 seconds\").Logs end up being a lot of data, but storing a terabyte of logs to save me a week of debugging is the biggest no-brainer in software engineering. $20 for 1 week of time saved. I'll also add that as a backend developer, logs are your software's UI. If something goes wrong, that's where the operator interfaces with your software to fix the problem. So they are not to be neglected or done without care; the same way you'd probably spell check your HTML frontend.I'll also add, I have a weird background. When I worked on Google Fiber, we wanted the ability to add new fleet-wide CPE metrics to the system without a software push. So, we logged aggressively and turned relevant log lines into metrics on the log receiver side. (I designed and wrote that system.) That meant we could monitor for issues without taking people's Internet down for 15 minutes while their routers rebooted to apply a software update that captured a metric we wanted to monitor or alert on. At my current job, we don't operate the software we write; our users buy a license and then they do God Knows What on their own infrastructure. What that means is if I want something like Jaeger, it's on me to install it, maintain it, upgrade it, and support it in an environment that I can only access by saying commands to type on a Zoom call. The juice was worth the squeeze exactly once; for logs. Users can run \"pachctl debug dump\", generate a tar file, send it to us, and then we have logs, metrics, and traces without any operational effort on their end.While I'm here, here's how I do metrics-to-logs on the producing side: https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/blob/master/src/inter... Apache2 if anyone wants to steal it ;)replylmm 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > I prefer to build metrics and distributed traces from logs!

You can tail the logs and send span starts/ends to Jaeger, and you can tail the logs and send summarized metrics to Prometheus or InfluxDB.I'm not sure it's the same thing; the idea that you spit everything out into this flat stream of bytes and then try to parse it back into structured data seems ass-backwards to me. I agree with keeping a trace of events that happen in your system, but if it's data you care about, don't you want to keep it structured the whole way through? At which point it's not really \"logs\" as usually understood.replyoefrha 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You’ve confused a stack trace with a core dump (or something similar).replychx 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] > And it just so happens that all local accounts in a Mastodon instance have a null value in their URI field, so they all matched.How?

This is a common oversight when dealing with data structures that are incomplete at one point or another, and it's easy to assume during programming that code will execute in a fixed order that allows for the necessary fields to be present when needed although sometimes it doesn't always work out that way.In my opinion, they were lucky to have caught this but a fix should include more than adding missing initialization. They should implement a sanity check to ensure that fields used are present and !NULL, and if things are undefined or missing for whatever reason, abort whatever process they are attempting to perform and log the issue.replyziml77 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] How did accounts with a NULL value in the URI column match the query?

Karagueuzian, an adjunct professor of cardiology who conducts research at UCLA's Cardiovascular Research Laboratory, part of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. \"Specifically, we show here that the industry used misleading statements to obfuscate the hazard of ionizing alpha particles to the lungs of smokers and, more importantly, banned any and all publication on tobacco smoke radioactivity.\"   The radioactive substance — which the UCLA study shows was first brought to the attention of the tobacco industry in 1959 — was identified in 1964 as the isotope polonium-210, which emits carcinogenic alpha radiation. Polonium-210 can be found in all commercially available domestic and foreign cigarette brands, Karagueuzian said, and is absorbed by tobacco leaves through naturally occurring radon gas in the atmosphere and through high-phosphate chemical fertilizers used by tobacco growers. The substance is eventually inhaled by smokers into the lungs.   The study outlines the industry's growing concerns about the cancer risk posed by polonium-210 inhalation and the research that industry scientists conducted over the decades to assess the radioactive isotope's potential effect on smokers — including one study that quantitatively measured the potential lung burden from radiation exposure in a two-pack-a-day smoker over a two-decade period.   Karagueuzian and his colleagues made independent calculations using industry and academic data and arrived at results that very closely mirrored those of that industry study, which was conducted nearly a quarter-century ago. They then compared those results to rates used by the Environmental Protection Agency to estimate lung cancer risk among individuals exposed to similar amounts of alpha particle–emitting radon gas in their homes.   \"The gathered data from the documents on the relevant radiobiological parameters of the alpha particles — such as dose, distribution and retention time — permitted us to duplicate the industry's secretly estimated radiation absorbed dose by regular smokers over a 20- or 25-year period, which equaled 40 to 50 rads,\" he said. \"These levels of rads, according to the EPA's estimate of lung cancer risk in residents exposed to radon gas, equal 120 to 138 deaths per 1,000 regular smokers over a 25-year period.\"   Despite the potential risk of lung cancer, tobacco companies declined to adopt a technique discovered in 1959, and another discovered 1980, that could have helped eliminate polonium-210 from tobacco, the researchers said. The technique, known as an acid-wash, was found to be highly effective in removing the radioisotope from tobacco plants, where it forms a water-insoluble complex with the sticky, hair-like structures called trichomes that cover the leaves.   And while the industry frequently cited concerns over the cost and the possible environmental impact as rationales for not using the acid wash, UCLA researchers uncovered documents that they say indicate the reason may have been far different.   \"The industry was concerned that the acid media would ionize the nicotine, making it more difficult to be absorbed into the brains of smokers and depriving them of that instant nicotine rush that fuels their addiction,\" Karagueuzian said. \"The industry also were well aware that the curing of the tobacco leaves for more than a one-year period also would not eliminate the polonium-210, which has a half-life of 135 days, from the tobacco leaves because it was derived from its parent, lead-210, which has a half-life of 22 years.\"             Karagueuzian said the insoluble alpha particles bind with resins in the cigarette smoke and get stuck and accumulate at the bronchial bifurcations of the lungs, forming \"hot spots,\" instead of dispersing throughout the lungs. In fact, previous research on lung autopsies in smokers who died of lung cancer showed that malignant growths were primarily located at the same bronchial bifurcations where these hot spots reside. \"We used to think that only the chemicals in the cigarettes were causing lung cancer,\" Karagueuzian said. \"But the case of the these hot spots, acknowledged by the industry and academia alike, makes a strong case for an increased probability of long-term development of malignancies caused by the alpha particles. If we're lucky, the alpha particle–irradiated cell dies. If it doesn't, it could mutate and become cancerous.\"   Karagueuzian said the findings are very timely in light of the June 2009 passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which grants the U.S. Food and Drug Administration broad authority to regulate and remove harmful substances — with the exception of nicotine — from tobacco products. The UCLA research, he said, makes a strong case that the FDA ought to consider making the removal of alpha particles from tobacco products a top priority.   \"Such a move could have a considerable public health impact, due to the public's graphic perception of radiation hazards,\" he said.   To uncover the information, Karagueuzian and his team combed through the internal tobacco industry documents made available online as part of the landmark 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Documents from Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard, Brown I Williamson, the American Tobacco Company, the Tobacco Institutes and the Council for Tobacco Research, as well as the Bliley documents, were examined, Karagueuzian said.   The team searched for key terms such as \"polonium-210,\" \"atmospheric fallout,\" \"bronchial epithelium,\" \"hot particle\" and \"lung cancer,\" among others.   Karagueuzian said the earliest causal link between alpha particles and cancer was made around 1920, when alpha particle–emitting radium paint was used to paint luminescent numbers on watch dials. The painting was done by hand, and the workers commonly used their lips to produce a point on the tip of the paint brush. Many workers accumulated significant burdens of alpha particles through ingestion and absorption of radium-226 into the bones and subsequently developed jaw and mouth cancers. The practice was eventually discontinued.   Another example involves liver cancer in patients exposed to chronic low-dose internal alpha particles emitted from the poorly soluble deposits of thorium dioxide after receiving the contrast agent Thorotrast. It has been suggested that the liver cancers resulted from point mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 by the accumulated alpha particles present in the contrast media. The use of Thorotrast as contrast agent was stopped in the 1950s.   In addition to Karagueuzian, authors of the study include the late Amos Norman, professor emeritus in the departments of radiation oncology and radiological sciences at UCLA; James Sayre, of the departments of biostatistics and radiological sciences at UCLA; and Celia White, who served from 1999 to 2002 as director of content and services at the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library, which contains more than 13 million documents created by major tobacco companies related to their advertising, manufacturing, marketing, sales and scientific research activities.   The study was funded by the University of California Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program, established by the passage of California's SB1613 in 1989 to fund a comprehensive University of California grant program to support research into the prevention, causes and treatment of tobacco-related diseases.   The authors report no conflict of interest.   For more news, visit UCLA Newsroom and UCLA News|Week and follow us on Twitter.

Who is going to read it? What if you have 20 ideas? What would be the point in doing that? If it is pointless you should stop having ideas. There are countless fun, useful and interesting things to do that all have a point.Say we all start writing down our poorly thought out ideas. Share our collective political ignorance with the void. If that could be aggregated and combined into something perhaps agreeable or just refutable, then we could at least debunk it and at best consider it.Everyone can come up with a list of pro's and cons for any topic but if many do we can have the full list and may address the [perceived] misconceptions.Not use LLM as a middle man (that would put it in charge) but as an aggregator. To construct the questions and answers for a poll for example.If it works it will become worth having ideas, perhaps even good ideas, perhaps the feedback loop has to run for a while for the good ideas to happen.Anything is better than pretending to know what the public wants while the public doesn't bother to want anything.There is also the way we blame the representative for doing the wrong thing. They cant take positions on anything without offending some of their voters. We pretend everything is their idea.I might be hallucinating, either way it is quite an enjoyable thought.Of course I know no one will go along with anything until civilization implodes again.replyquickthrower2 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think the comment is useful and thought provoking, not a flame war type comment.replymandmandam 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Useful political discourse is hard.

If there are fines, they'll be token. Only the most egregious cases get more severe fines - uncomfortable, but not usually life-changing.Criminal charges are only likely if there's fraud that directly affects shareholders.It's almost as if the lives of ordinary people are complete disposable.Aside from prison and fines, there should be a corporate death penalty.If corporations are people, they should be held accountable in the same ways people are.replynradov 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Limited liability corporations have been an enormous success and have tremendously improved our standards of living.

From an economic perspective they are of course successful, because they provide great shareholder value. It's a classic \"privatize the profits, socialize the losses\" scenario: once you get caught doing something really bad, you just go bankrupt and let the government pay for the fallout! There is literally no reason not to - at worst your shares lose their value and you've been able to extract a healthy amount of dividend from the company.Historically many companies have been able to provide great innovations under private ownership, and I see no reason to believe that the concept of an LLC is in any way a prerequisite for improving our standards of living. They have only been around for a relatively short amount of time (especially the kind where nobody is responsible) and we've been doing quite well before that.So tell me, what is this magical benefit for society we can only achieve via LLCs which outweighs all the damage they are doing?

I have a friend who's dying of lung cancer right now. I was real close to my uncle who died of it. There are a lot of things that can get ya, and I try to avoid all of them. People think this is ridiculous, but cancer is a cumulative risk. I don't eat processed foods or refined sugars. I get regular colonoscopies and checkups. I sleep with an air purifier. I just love to fucking smoke. Nine out of ten things I look forward to every day are cigarettes. Addiction gets a bad name. It's one of the most pleasant experiences you can have. Like sex. I'm not sure I'd want to live without it. If it doesn't hurt anyone else, e.g. I'm not robbing people for meth or ruining anyone else's lungs or raiding my kid's college fund, etc, I'm okay with it, because I'm going to die from something anyway. I'm 43 and don't really care to live past 60. Although I said this when I was smoking at 14 and didn't want to live past 30, so, who knows. Life's a gift. Wine, tobacco, chocolate, sex and foie gras are a few of the things that make it worth living.replymaxbond 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I do understand a lot of that. I agree that many people have weird ideas about cumulative risk, in that they don't seem to believe in it. They seem to believe that the risk of a set of activities is the maximum rather than the sum.And I do see how, if you've committed to being a smoker, reducing your risk and planning for the worst makes total sense. \"I don't need to live past age 60\" does sound a lot like passive suicidal ideation, and it may be worth speaking to a professional about it, but that's all I'll say on the matter, I don't want to be intrusive.[I want to disclaim this as jawboning, I end up quiting smoking weed in this story, but I don't mean to imply anything by it and I understand quitting weed and quitting tobacco are worlds apart anyhow.]I don't smoke tobacco anymore, but gosh I do love to smoke cannabis. I love the ritual of it, I love passing a bowl around with friends and listening to music, I love the texture of smoke, I love blowing smoke rings. It also helped to manage my anxiety. If I was having a panic attack, I could reliably terminate it by smoking. And it turned down the volume on the the anxious thoughts that I have bouncing around my brain.Recently I've had episodes of terrible GI symptoms. Enough to briefly put me in the hospital. I'm not entirely sure, because many of the symptoms don't fit, but I think I've developed Cannaboid Hyperemesis Syndrome with an unusual presentation, the only cure for which is to quit using cannabis.But I'm okay with it. By the time I came to this conclusion, I was making sure my will was in order, I just didn't know what was happening to me. So I was just happy that the best hypothesis seemed to be something curable.So far, I haven't had an episode in a few days, the last episode I did have was milder. I'm starting to have more energy and feel like I just be thinking more clearly. The anxious thoughts that I smoke weed to treat are coming back strong, which has been difficult, but I'll find some other way to manage them.I'll miss cannabis dearly, it served me well for a long time. I'm hoping I can smoke once a year at least.

I think we work with what we've got, and we've got less to work with as we get older. There's no contradiction between wanting to live and wanting to enjoy life. Wanting to smoke or not caring if I live past 60 isn't a death wish - it's an affirmation to myself that I'm alive in the moment and not living in fear of age or death.replyjohnnyApplePRNG 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] \"If it doesn't hurt anyone else, e.g. I'm not robbing people for meth or ruining anyone else's lungs or raiding my kid's college fund, etc, I'm okay with it\"\"foie gras are a few of the things that make it worth living\"... you know what they do to the duck to make your foie gras, right?replynoduerme 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There are ethical ways to produce foie gras without force feeding.

In some instances, an agent for which there is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals together with supporting evidence from mechanistic and other relevant data may be placed in this group.

Who are you (not you personally, but anyone) to decide how others should live their lives? If someone wants to drink soda, smoke and eat fast food, why wouldn't they? If selling what people want is somehow bad, then I guess restricting it should be good, so we should just take all these people we have decided are too stupid to know what's good for them, and regiment their life until we are satisfied? As much as I dislike and disagree with their choices, this line of thinking seems abhorrent to me, at most I'd argue we have some say on what they are doing if they use taxpayer-funded healthcare and such, but for me that is an argument against the latter, not the former.

Calling them names like stupid or gullible, just to defend contributing to the harm of them is not successful coping attempt however. It just says that these things do bother who's saying them, and that they feel something that's not desirable to them, like shame, or fear of retribution, or something else that's negative.

The polluters are the people doing the actual polluting, by throwing the products into the rivers and oceans.The vast majority of plastic in the ocean comes from rivers, and a small number of rivers are responsible for the vast majority of river-borne plastic.[0]The top 10 most polluted rivers do the lion's share of the work, and 8 of them are located in Asia. None are in the west. Even if you look at the top 1000 most pollution-causing rivers, only 1 is in the US and only a few are in Europe.[1]These disparate results come despite the fact that the US is one of the highest consumers of Coca-Cola products. This suggests that pollution has more to do with societies than companies.As fashionable as it is to hate on corporations and place the blame at their feet, it's not their job to police pollution, nor or they incentivized to do so. Shaming them will be ineffective, and if we truly care about the planet, we should try to be effective.Luckily, there is an appropriate target for our ire and suggestions, a target which is both richer and more powerful than every corporation combined, and which is responsible for keeping things clean, and which is accountable to public opinion, and that target is called government.Societies that are clean are societies that hold their governments accountable to holding polluters accountable, whether they're corporations or individuals. So, in my opinion, our efforts are best directed at governments.Warren Buffett is not the villain here, and nor is Coca-Cola. Even in a world without Coca-Cola, we'd likely have another behemoth in its place, or (worse) a million little distributors contributing equally (likely more) to pollution, but without a single name by which we can identify them, nor a single entity by which we can effectively police them.[0] https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stemming-the-plas...[1] https://theoceancleanup.com/sources/replymyshpa 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Sorry, but (sugary) drinks in plastic bottles are just bullshit products that should not exist at all.Production costs are almost zero, health and environmental impacts are extreme.Warren Buffett is the villain.

It's government. It's mobilization by citizens to get the government to regulate waste disposal -- to make improper disposal of waste illegal, and to fund the creation of easily-accessible environmentally-friendly waste disposal mechanisms.Consuming soft drinks does not pollute the environment.

Thats $1 per cigarette. Seems to me simple economics is coming around to address this problem. \"Go ahead and keep smoking - smoke as much as you can afford!\"For the non-familiar its not uncommon to go through a pack per day between the ones you personally smoke and the ubiquitous people around too cheap to buy their own pack but happy to bum one or more of yours. So lets just say $20 x 6 days a week for $120/week. Thats about $480/month to continue being an active smoker.

Makes you wonder what kinds of horrible things big companies are doing now which will only be uncovered in the next 20 years or so. What makes tobacco companies less ethical than say big pharma or big tech companies?It's a systemic issue. At the core of this issue is the concept of a corporation. The real cancer are the legal constructs of limited liability and the concept of corporate person-hood. Companies are simply not meant to become so large; they are physically incapable of handling the kind of liability which they will inevitably be exposed to on a global scale. The scale of such companies gives them inertia which allows them to transcend ethical boundaries; with global exposure, they can always find enough people who are unethical enough to undertake the necessary cover-ups to keep things going in a way which maximizes short-term profits.Had the tobacco industry been made up of many smaller businesses, the information would have gotten out sooner as many small tobacco businesses would have voluntarily shuttered their doors in response to the research... But with a handful of gigantic companies headed up by some of the most ethically challenged individuals that all of planet earth could provide, it's not surprising that it didn't happen that way.Capitalism is meant to be composed of small, mostly short-lived businesses that are almost ephemeral in nature. It should be easy to start a new business just as closing an existing business should not be a big deal. Long term inter-generational wealth should be difficult but not impossible to preserve; though it could be preserved using a deflationary currency as a market-neutral store of value; its value would be derived either from trust in the institution or in the automatic mechanism which administers the currency (e.g. the government or public ledger).Imagine what we could achieve with today's technology if only we had kept the efficient capitalist system which our ancestors had designed; a system which proved itself to be efficient during hard times of technological and resource scarcity.Our current system evolved in a post-scarcity environment and therefore it is not optimized for resource efficiency. It's optimized for centralization of power.replytester756 11 hours ago | prev | next [–] Smoking is sad thingIt generates so many negative things for barely 1 or two positiveand yet people argue for it in the name of some \"freedom\"How does destroying your and people's around health, getting an addiction, paying bonus $$ to the govt as a additional tax and stinking sound like a \"freedom\"replynpteljes 10 hours ago | parent | next [–] Freedom means enabling the bad things too.Which I think leads to two things.

Most of those smoking deaths are people who've already smoked 30+ years; there's not a lot we can do to prevent those deaths now, even if they all stopped smoking tomorrow. They'd still get cancer and everything else at higher rates. We've also done a pretty good job at lower smoking rates, especially among young people. Sure, we can ban or restrict tobacco more (maybe we should) but the \"public health crisis\" is mostly done.Opiate addiction cuts life expectancy by ~35 years. And getting them onto safer drugs would save lives very immediately. There's stuff that could be done, and everyone knows it, and it's not happening. That's the public health crisis.edit: and, yes, also, opiates are also more socially destructive, due largely to the criminality.replymartinald 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This isn't really true.

That's cocaine.replymartinald 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] While I'm not suggesting tobacco is fine or anything; they really aren't comparable. Opiate addiction is going to completely take any quality of life away from you (tbh regardless of legality, people that were on prescription opiates still had horrendous disability and mental illness caused by the constant abuse of them, though obviously having to spend hundreds of dollars a day on an illegal supply adds a whole new dimension of horror).Most people who smoke tobacco don't experience any significant quality of life issues until many decades in when the COPD and serious illness starts. Obviously horrible - but I would say you'd lose more than 7x more quality of life (disability adjusted years?) being an opiate addict over being a smoker.replyserf 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] i'm not interested in defending tobacco/cigarettes, but comparisons like this beg the question : do you see a difference between an addiction that leads to eventual chronic health issues/injury/death sometimes many many decades after first-onset versus an addiction that will many times kill even first-time users, and rarely allows for habits that last many decades?if you want to compare the health crises, then divide the results by time to create an 'impact' score.That's why we're focusing on opiates collectively.replymcmoor 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I knew that my country really won't be prepared with anymore relaxation on narcotics because we smoke cigarettes much more than almost every other country in the world despite long long campaign on health issues.

If you want to give up then I do recommend that you prepare yourself mentally. I ended up coming up with a couple of \"downside mantras\" that I would repeat to myself, whenever thoughts of smoking happened.I initially thought I would use a vape but realized very quickly that would not work for me. If nicotine is the (only) addictive substance then patches, gum, vapes etc would just work. The habit thing is relatively easy to crack but there must be other addictive components to smoking, including sensation (you need to be a smoker to understand that one). Also I didn't want to substitute one thing for another, so abstention was the way to go for me. Some may find help with gum and patches - gum is probably the best substitute, being \"active\" (and might even improve mouth hygiene).I stopped mid afternoon on a Friday and had a lie in on Saturday. That got me to around 18 hours. I made it to 24 hours. Then I managed two days, then four, then a week (a landmark one day less than the next double - every little helps). Then two weeks. Visited the kids and bummed a drag on a fag and hated it.At around a week my sense of taste and smell re-arrived with a major jolt! I can remember smelling people entering the room and other mad things. It calmed down to normal about week three and I now have a sense of smell that accords with other non smokers.In the end, if you want to give up, then get cracking sooner rather than later and develop strategies but do not try to rely on things like vapes and gum to do it for you. You have to quite literally give yourself a massive mental kicking too.For me I focused on two aspects I hated about smoking and I would mentally repeat this to myself whenever I thought of it:\"I don't want to smell and I don't want to die\"Even with my denuded sense of smell I could tell I reeked and the second one is pretty obvious. When I did that the craving or thought would be quashed for a while. I did have dreams where I smoked and sometimes woke up convinced I had been smoking. You do have to wrestle with yourself somewhat and decide to win!I continued: ... then a month. Now I have saved £10.50 x 30 = £309 (I thought I smoked 20 a day but I smoked more - self delusion, probably more like 25-30). Cool.... two months, four months (quarter of a year). Six months. Now I have realistically saved around £2000, have a functional sense of taste and smell and I no longer cough all the time.... one year. Fuck me, how the hell did I manage that?... pandemic etc... 29 July 2023 - rarely think about smoking until an article on HD hoves into view.replynvllsvm 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] What are the age ranges of people dying from cigarettes vs. opiate abuse?replyhammock 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] 21*replyrcme 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] What’s the average age of death though?replyNoMoreNicksLeft 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Smokers are functional.

Why? osboot osboot/libreboot merge So why talk about GNU Boot? So why talk about it?? UPDATE (21 July 2023) GNU Boot cease and desist emailReturn to indexArticle published by: Leah RoweDate of publication: 17 July 2023People have been waiting for me to break the silence about this. I go on about it on IRC. This article is intended to address it once and for all, officially.I waited so long, because until recently there really wasn’t anything tangible to talk about; why talk about vaporware? Why indeed.Introduction!This doesn’t need to be an overly long post, so it won’t be. There is a fork of Libreboot, named GNU Boot, which you can find here: https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnuboot/Long story short, when I saw this, I decided that I would try to help the project. More on this next:non-GeNUine Boot 20230717 releaseIf you want to skip the lecture, just read these first and re-visit this page (the one you’re reading now) afterwards for more context:non-GeNUine Boot 20230717, unofficial release (produced by me): https://notgnuboot.vimuser.org/news/nongenuineboot20230717.html - based on the recent Libreboot 20230625 release, but modified to comply with GNU Boot policy, as best as I could approximate. I encourage them to re-use this work. It’s roughly 8 months ahead of their current work.Or generally: https://notgnuboot.vimuser.org/ - non-GeNUine Boot websiteThese links, above, are for an unofficial fork of Libreboot that I have done myself, proposed for re-use by the new GNU Boot project. I am not a member of the GNU Boot project, but I do want to see it succeed.GNU Boot? What is that, you ask me? It is a fork of Libreboot by the GNU project, but it currently does not have a website and does not have any releases of its own. My intent is to help them, and they are free - encouraged - to re-use my work, linked above.GNU forked Libreboot? Why?They forked Libreboot, due to disagreement with Libreboot’s Binary Blob Reduction Policy. This is a pragmatic policy, enacted in November 2022, to increase the number of coreboot users by increasing the amount of hardware supported in Libreboot. Libreboot’s Freedom Status page describes in great detail, how that policy is implemented - the last few Libreboot releases have vastly expanded the list of hardware supported, which you can read here.I wish GNU Boot all the best success. Truly. Although I think their project is entirely misguided (for reasons explained by modern Libreboot policy), I do think there is value in it. It provides continuity for those who wish to use something resembling the old Libreboot project; some context:osbootPreviously, another project started by me named osboot existed - osboot, created in December 2020, ran for just under two years as a separate project, and it very much resembled what Libreboot is today.osboot was a fork of Libreboot, that I created myself, and maintained in parallel to Libreboot. The old osboot Git repositories are still available here, archived for historical purposes: https://notabug.org/osbootosboot/libreboot mergeIn November 2022, I shut down osboot’s website and redirected it to the Libreboot website, merging all of its documentation and additional code into Libreboot. Libreboot adopted OSBoot policy, verbatim. The Binary Blob Reduction Policy is that policy - the old Libreboot policy was declared obsolete, and abandoned - the main problem with it, and the problem with GNU Boot today which is based on it, is that it limited the amount of hardware that Libreboot could support.OSBoot was always the superior project, and Libreboot was practically dead, so I saw nothing to lose and just did it. I merged them together.So why talk about GNU Boot?Ordinarily, I would ignore other projects; it’s not that I’m bothered by them, it’s just that I have Libreboot, which pleases me, and therefore I have no need to worry about the others. They can sort themselves out. I work collaboratively with a few other coreboot distros; for example, I sometimes provide advice or ideas to the Heads project (a very interesting project, superior to Libreboot in many ways). I recently helped them by offering to host tarballs for them, that they use in their build system.But that’s just the problem: when GNU Boot first launched, as a failed hostile fork of Libreboot under the same name, I observed: their code repository was based on Libreboot from late 2022, and their website based on Libreboot in late 2021. Their same-named Libreboot site was announced during LibrePlanet 2023, by this video: https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/taking-control-over-the-means-of-production-free-software-boot/ - their speaker is Denis Carikli, an early contributor to Libreboot, who you can read about here: https://libreplanet.org/2023/speakers/#6197. Denis is one of the founders of that project.Well, now they are calling themselves GNU Boot, and it is indeed GNU, but it still has the same problem as of today: still based on very old Libreboot, and they don’t even have a website. According to Savannah, GNU Boot was created on 11 June 2023. Yet no real development, in over a month since then.I have this itch in the back of my mind, that says: if you’re going to do something, you should do it. When someone expresses disagreement with what I say, I can respect it if it’s more than just words, which is all what they had given at the time of this article.I value technical excellence.So why talk about it??Simple: I’ve decided that I want to help them. Refer to the links above, in the early section of this article. I decided recently that I’d simply make a release for them, exactly to their specifications (GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines), talking favourably about FSF/GNU, and so on. I’m in a position to do it (thus scratching the itch), so why not?I did this release for them: https://notgnuboot.vimuser.org/news/nongenuineboot20230717.html - it’s designated non-GeNUine Boot 20230717, and I encourage them to re-use this in their project, to get off the ground. This completely leapfrogs their current development; it’s months ahead. Months. It’s 8 months ahead, since their current revision is based upon Libreboot from around ~October 2022.The most remarkable thing of all is this: in December 2022 is when I first learned of their supposed effort. They tried to poach several Libreboot developers behind my back, but none of them were interested it seems, and one of them leaked the existence of their effort to me. I knew three months before they announced that they were going to announce something, and I reliably predicted it’d be at LibrePlanet.The most absurd thing of that is: why did they not contact me?The GNU people should have simply contacted me from the start. I would have helped them. I did Libreboot releases under their policies for years, and I know what I’m doing. Ideology aside, I enjoy fun technical challenges; I have a wide depth of knowledge and expertise. I offer it now, as I have today, and will continue to do so. I offer my support, in service to it, even if I would personally never use nor recommend their project. One of the purposes of today’s article is simply to tell people they exist, because I hope maybe they’ll get more devs. They use the same build system as Libreboot, so Libreboot could even merge a lot of any actual code/ideas that they produce (and they can merge our work - and I want them to do that).There were/are more things to talk about, but I’m not really interested in writing more. Free as in freedom? Libreboot is a free software project, yet GNU propaganda says otherwise.GNU Boot is inferior to Libreboot in every way, just as Libreboot was inferior to OSBoot before the Libreboot/OSBoot merge; since modern (post-merge) Libreboot still provides the same blob-free configurations on mainboards when that is possible, GNU Boot is also a pointless project, just as Libreboot was before I merged osboot with it, but I digress.What more is there to say?Happy hacking!UPDATE (21 July 2023)The non-GeNUine Boot website, and the non-GeNUine release itself, was originally named GNU Boot, but clearly marked as unofficial, with the hope that the GNU project would adapt and re-use it for their project. I did this, specifically to help them get up to date. They currently use Libreboot from about 8 months ago (late 2022), and that revision used coreboot releases from ~mid 2021.Modern Libreboot uses coreboot from early 2023, and contains many bug fixes in its build system, owing to an extensive build system audit; GNU Boot still contains all of the bugs that existed, prior to the audit. Bugs such as: errors literally not being handled, in many critical areas of the build system, due to improper use of subshells within shell scripts (Libreboot’s build system is implemented with shell scripts), improper handling of git credentials in the coreboot build system, fam15h boards no longer compiling correct on modern Linux distros… the list goes on. All fixed, in newer Libreboot, including the recent release.GNU Boot cease and desist emailThe GNU Boot people actually sent me a cease and desist email, citing trademark infringement. Amazing.Despite the nonGeNUine Boot site having clearly stating that it’s unofficial, and not the GNU Boot project. I literally made it to help them. You know, to help them use newer Libreboot because they use old Libreboot and even older coreboot.Anyway, I complied with their polite request and have renamed the project to non-GeNUine Boot. The release archive was re-compiled, under this new brand name and the website was re-written accordingly.Personally, I like the new name better.Here is a screenshot of the cease and desist request that I received, from Adrien ‘neox’ Bourmault who is a founding member of the GNU Boot project:This, after they themselves tried to steal the name Libreboot for their fork, when they first announced themselves on 19 March 2023 at LibrePlanet, only renaming to GNU Boot months later (on 11 June 2023). Utter hypocrisy, and a great irony to boot.I may very well send patches. If I want to.Binary blob policy Edit this page Who develops Libreboot?

It's possible the libreboot author also wasn't communicating professionally either, but I don't think that really warrants a response like that either. If you actually want to convince someone to cease doing something, it seems better to just to stick to cold, formal language; writing something like this makes it seem more like an attempt to rile someone up rather than an attempt at legal enforcement.replyneilv 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] I have to remind myself not to read too much into such things, for three reasons that we all know, but which may bear repeating to ourselves:1. Open source is global, and not everyone is a native speaker of English.2. Among English speakers, not everyone has the same cultural conventions and nuances. Even within US cities, you can drive 15 minutes, and find very different conventions. And culture in Boston isn't the same as in the Bay Area, isn't the same as in Bolivia.3. Even within the same culture, not everyone picks up on signals in language to the same degree (whether perceiving or sending). And some people who think they're picking up on signals are conflating with biases more than some others do.I say I have to remind myself, because this still hits me. For example, when I'm searching certain bug databases, trying to solve an annoying problem, and some prolific volunteer commenting on a bug report there speaks in a manner that comes off as brusque or dismissive. Where they're from (across the Atlantic from me), maybe it's interpreted as professional or capable, and is even reassuring.replymst 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I've had to referee disagreements between East Coast USians and Germans a few times before now, mostly in terms of acting as a protocol translation layer until they were both sufficiently calmed down to underail themselves and focus on the technical side again rather than being distracted by their differing communication styles.Generally once I'd helped them unpick that they collaborated happily and came up with something good that they both liked, it's just once people are locked in to talking past each other it's often non-trivial to break out of that.replytommiegannert 48 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] I can highly recommend https://erinmeyer.com/books/the-culture-map/ on the topic of cultural communication styles.replyfegu 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It would be interesting to read more about this.

I was having a conversation with my mother at a Cafe. After 15mins the lady next to us, very genuinely and nicely, asked if we were ok because we were yelling at each other. We're Italian.

It is hard to judge sometimes.Even in written communication it is was told to me many times that many Russians, especially those with B1/B2 levels, as well as Jewish people are extremely direct, and it may be perceived as native speakers as rude, although it isn't meant to.replywhstl 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The fact that the person who sent the C&D email allegedly tried to \"take over\" the Libreboot name (according to TFA) is also not a good look.I found this: https://libreboot.at> Who are we? Denis ‘GNUtoo’ Carikli and Adrien ‘neox’ Bourmault. We created this and maintain it.> take a stand for fully free software is to change URLs across the web fromto , and to let people know that no other version of Libreboot is reliably free softwarereplymcv 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] I hadn't heard about this drama before, but as I can piece things together, Leah has been maintaining Libreboot and another boot system for years. Denis and Adrien disagreed with Leah's decision to include binaries, created their own version of Libreboot without those binaries and published it under the same name on a very similar domain trying to claim the existing Libreboot name for their version.Then I suspect Leah disagreed with that fork both on technical merits (it's based on old code) and with the stealing of the name, but she agreed with the need for a version without the binaries, so she made that and published it under the name GNUboot, intended for Denis and Adrien to base their work on, and now Denis and Adrien are complaining that she's misusing the GNU name.Is that roughly a correct summary?Because if it is, it sounds to me like both sides do have valid points, but handled the disagreement very poorly. Denis and Adrien complaining that Leah stole the GNU name when they just stole the Libreboot name, sounds very hypocritical. The whole thing would be a lot better if both sides stopped the drama and powergames and just worked together to create the best possible boot systems; one with the binaries and one without.replyddalex 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I don't understand the frackas about a library that reboots your computer being free or not....replymPReDiToR 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I read it that way too.Lib reboot.Always have, but it took LibreOffice becoming mainstream to make the correction mostly unnoticeable.replyopan 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I'm not up to date on these events yet, but GNUtoo is a Guix contributor I see around a fair bit on the mailing list and IRC, which makes this seem more interesting.

Not familiar with neox, but wouldn't surprise me if they're similarly involved in free software stuff elsewhere.replyevasb 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] They didn't try to take over the Libreboot. They were maintaining until Leah took over in a very unethical way.You can see that they abandoned the Libreboot name and founded GNU Boot, that Leah is now trying to take over (the name) too.Anyway, this drama is highly personal and Leah is not a trustworthy person.EDIT: I was debunked by LukeShu and whslreplywhstl 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have no idea who those people are and their pasts, and have no horse in this race, but according to the https://libreboot.at website by Adrien Bourmault, Leah was the founder of the project.According to this [1], the alleged takeover you mention not only didn't involve Adrien or Denis Carikli, it also happened in 2021, two years before the creation of https://libreboot.at, which seems to be from 2023, and GNU Boot, that succeeded libreboot.at [2][1] https://web.archive.org/web/20210331005023/https://libreboot... or https://www.andrewrobbins.info/libreboot.html if you want a third-party[2] https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/libreboot-devel/2023-0...Either way, it seems that if there was any problem around the usage of the GNU Boot name, it was solved by adding disclaimers galore: http://notgnuboot.vimuser.org/To me the disclaimers above show enough good faith. Meanwhile https://libreboot.at continues up. I don't think we should be that harsh and accusatory to someone after they actually comply with the request of changing a page name and adding disclaimers.replyPropelloni 38 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] It appears to be a bonfire of vanities on all sides.

Over the past 7 years the Libreboot project has been extremely aggressive towards the FSF. Going so far as to say the GNU project shouldn't exist and throwing insults at individuals in the organization.The emphasis on the whole, \"I did this release for them\" honestly doesn't pass the sniff test and kind of feels like they're intentionally trying to create drama. The \"why didn't they contact me\" has a completely obvious answer based on past interactions.So here's a better question, why didn't Libreboot contact GNU before trying to publish their own GNU Boot release? Why did they try to impersonate them?replytorstenvl 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] No. The better question is, why didn't FSF contact Leah before trying to publish their own Libreboot releases at libreboot.at? Why did they try to impersonate Libreboot?Whatever you may think of Leah publishing an unofficial GNU Boot release for them to rebase off of, she didn't try to impersonate them by buying a confusingly similar domain.Compare her single reference to an \"unofficial GNUBoot release\" to this: https://libreboot.at/replyslabity 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > No. The better question is, why didn't FSF contact Leah before trying to publish their own Libreboot releases at libreboot.at? Why did they try to impersonate Libreboot?That's not a better question at all. They list out their explicit reasoning for their attempted name takeover. I definitely don't agree with it, but I have no reason to believe that they're lying about their own beliefs.I absolutely do have reason to doubt Leah's words of releasing GNU Boot as being in good faith though. Their history of drama with them is the reason for my doubt.In terms of practicality, I feel like a better reaction would have been to either trademark their project name or maintain a separate fork of Libreboot that would include the binary blobs. Why resort to trademark infringement?replybubblethink 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] Completely pointless drama, but there is a real issue here in that people (phoronix) mistook the unofficial one for the real one (https://www.phoronix.com/news/GNU-Boot-20230717).

It's like a global office that we all get glimpses into.And in this particular case, it reminds me of Red Hat and CentOS actually. Because one project just wants to ensure that people who downloadare actually gettingand not something else. That concern is just as valid in open source as it is in big enterprise.replyartyom 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I'm 100% with you on that.

I have a Gnome desktop that maybe a Gnome developer have a hard time to recognize as such. It works as I want and I keep the convenience of being able to Google problems and solutions of a mainstream desktop (KDE being the other one) and not a more or less obscure one.This means that under the hood, using extensions, you can customize that Gnome car. Can an Apple automatic car do that as easily?replyraverbashing 50 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] It's good that you can do this, but most people prefer the default experience instead of fiddling with customizations to make it more special. And yes, fiddling and customizing is cool, when you have time.So between the Apple automatic and Gnome \"pick customizations\" I know which one I prefer (and yes Apple does have extensions, settings, etc). Yes, there won't be a perfect solution and sometimes you kinda miss some minor thing but it is minor.For example, looking at: https://extensions.gnome.org/#page=2 there's Date and Time formatter (you can do that in Apple) and \"Sound Input & Output Device Chooser\" which you can do by going in settings in Apple - but it doesn't matter most of the time because the out of box experience works almost perfectlyreplyIshKebab 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] People love Apple because it makes very high quality hardware, and its software is generally very reliable.

Something using software blobs can be RE'd and become fully free someday, but is not FSF-approved until it is. Burn the same blobs into the hardware where they can't be changed and the FSF approves because \"it's as good as it can get\", however they're really about equal levels of freedom, and the software one can become better later on, so it starts to seem silly. I don't want to imply people should stop fighting the fight, more like grabbing some of the FSF-approved hardware feels like giving up on the fight actually.Saying this as someone who has replaced and removed WLAN cards in laptops that need blobs, and used FSF-approved distros long-term.Somewhat related, I think the Apple Silicon MacBooks will end up replacing many people's old ThinkPads someday thanks to the work from the Asahi team.

Is the maintainer just that kind of person?replyLukeShu 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] There was the spat of drama in 2016, and the view of \"always in the middle of drama\" is IMO confirmation bias since then (the financial trouble in 2020, then Leah's return to libreboot in 2021.)Today's drama is part of larger culture wars going on in the community:- The pro-RMS vs anti-RMS thing going on since RMS's removal from the FSF in 2019, much amplified by his reinstatement in 2021 (the latter of which lead to most of the FSF staff walking out). Is RMS still fit to lead the FSF? Has the FSF lost its way?- The thing about whether or not \"the FSF's/RMS's RYF and FSDG policies regarding firmware and microcode are misguided and harmful\".libreboot got pulled in to that when in November 2022 it merged osboot, adopting osboot's firmware/microcode policies, which are at odds with the FSF's policies. So then some folks \"forked\" https://libreboot.org as https://libreboot.at and claim to be the \"true\" libreboot. I put \"forked\" in quotes because there wasn't any new libreboot development going on there; it was just a snapshot of the pre-osboot-merge libreboot releases. Then, more recently, the libreboot.at folks decided to resume development of an FSF-friendly coreboot distribution as \"GNU Boot\".So yeah, I guess you can say this drama is Leah's fault in that she has taken a clear stance against the FSF's firmware/microcode polices, but so have a lot of other folks in the community.replyGigachad 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The FSF lost its way at least 10 years ago, though probably longer. The whole tech landscape has shifted while they still focus on the distinction between firmware stored on a wifi card nand vs being loaded on initialisation. No one but RMS can work out how this makes a difference.Their non budging stance on issues that hardly make sense or are logically inconsistent, meanwhile society is rapidly shifting to a constant mandatory surveillance state.At this point the FSF is just a Richard Stallman fan club. So kicking him out would scrap their last bit of relevance.replyuserbinator 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I suspect the culture wars are largely a psyop by corporate interests who perceive the FSF and other user-freedom advocacy groups as obstructions to their attempts at controlling the population.replyk_roy 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > The pro-RMS vs anti-RMS thing going on since RMS's removal from the FSF in 2019it's been going on MUCH longer than that.No matter what he's done for free software, he's also a super-creep based on some of his commentsreplyLukeShu 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I mean, yes, but it was brought to a crest then.

It can also be extended straightforwardly to provide boot security/attestation.As for “solving” the “blob “problem,”” it provides a reasonable architecture for implementing drivers that are both platform- and architecture-independent; an OS can even choose to just use the drivers supplied by the firmware, by providing an equivalent environment.In other words, it essentially solves the “How should an arbitrary system boot and pass control to an operating system, including how to interact with arbitrary devices?” problem.

I had to reread multiple times but it seems the story is this : He started a new project named osboot and changed his policy regarding free software (maybe changed license too ?), then he decided to port all the code of libreboot to osboot and stop maintaining libreboot. So one early contributor of libreboot decided to maintain it. The problem is the guy decided to rename osboot into libreboot. Hence the conflict.replyLukeShu 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] Leah created Libreboot in 2014.Leah stepped away from Libreboot in 2016, after some drama between her and the FSF. Two Libreboot community members, Andrew and Sebastian, became the Libreboot maintainers.In 2021, after Andrew and Sebastian managed to go 5 years without doing a release, Leah forcefully took the project back over in order to get releases going again.Leah also started a \"sister project\" to Libreboot, Osboot, which had a different (non-FSF-friendly) firmware/microcode policy in order to support more hardware. It is my understanding that on all hardware that can be supported without binary blobs that Osboot still did not include any and was equivalent to Libreboot.In November 2022, Leah merged Osboot into Libreboot, adopting Osboot's firmware/microcode policy for Libreboot.In response to this policy change, two other community members, Denis and Adrien, forked libreboot.org as libreboot.at, and claim to be the \"genuine\" Libreboot. Neither Denis nor Adrien were Libreboot contributors before that (edit: Denis contributed 2 documentation patches in 2019). libreboot.at is a snapshot of pre-osboot-merge Libreboot; there are not any new releases there.In June 2023, Denis and Adrien decided to start work toward doing new releases under the name \"GNU Boot\". They have not yet done a release of GNU Boot.In July 2023, Leah posted an \"Unofficial GNU Boot 20230717 release\" to libreboot.org. Adrien sent Leah the \"C&D\" about using the \"GNU Boot\" name.

There are many other types of vectors, such as lists of complex numbers, graph cycles, and even magic squares.However, all of these vector spaces have one thing in common: a finite number of dimensions. That is, each kind of vector can be represented as a collection of𝑁 N numbers, though the definition of “number” varies.If any𝑁 N-dimensional vector is essentially a length- 𝑁 N list, we could also consider a vector to be a mapping from an index to a value.𝑣 1 = 𝑥 𝑣 2 = 𝑦 𝑣 3 = 𝑧   ⟺   𝑣 = [ 𝑥 𝑦 𝑧 ] v 1​v 2​v 3​ ​=x =y =z​ ⟺ v=​x y z​ ​ What does this perspective hint at as we increase the number of dimensions?Dimensions[ 0.59 0.95 ⋯ − 0.95 − 0.59 ] [ 0.59​0.95​⋯​−0.95​−0.59​]In higher dimensions, vectors start to look more like functions!Countably Infinite IndicesOf course, a finite-length vector only specifies a value at a limited number of indices. Could we instead define a vector that contains infinitely many values?Writing down a vector representing a function on the natural numbers ( 𝑁 N)—or any other countably infinite domain—is straightforward: just extend the list indefinitely.𝑣 1 = 1 𝑣 2 = 2 ⋮ 𝑣 𝑖 = 𝑖   ⟺   𝑣 = [ 1 2 3 ⋮ ] v 1​v 2​v i​ ​=1 =2 ⋮ =i​ ⟺ v=​1 2 3 ⋮​ ​ This vector could represent the function𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑥 f(x)=x, where𝑥 ∈ 𝑁 x∈N.1Uncountably Infinite IndicesMany interesting functions are defined on the real numbers ( 𝑅 R), so may not be representable as a countably infinite vector. Therefore, we will have to make a larger conceptual leap: not only will our set of indices be infinite, it will be uncountably infinite.That means we can’t write down vectors as lists at all—it is impossible to assign an integer index to each element of an uncountable set. So, how can we write down a vector mapping a real index to a certain value?Now, a vector really is just an arbitrary function:𝑣 𝑥 = 𝑥 2   ⟺   𝑣 = [ 𝑥 ↦ 𝑥 2 ] v x​=x 2  ⟺ v=[ x↦x 2​]Precisely defining how and why we can represent functions as infinite-dimensional vectors is the purview of functional analysis. In this post, we won’t attempt to prove our results in infinite dimensions: we will focus on building intuition via analogies to finite-dimensional linear algebra.Vector SpacesReview: Abstract vector spaces | Chapter 16, Essence of linear algebra.Formally, a vector space is defined by choosing a set of vectors𝑉 V, a scalar field𝐹 F, and a zero vector0 0. The field𝐹 F is often the real numbers ( 𝑅 R), complex numbers ( 𝐶 C), or a finite field such as the integers modulo a prime ( 𝑍 𝑝 Z p​).Additionally, we must specify how to add two vectors and how to multiply a vector by a scalar.( + )   :   𝑉 × 𝑉 ↦ 𝑉 ( ⋅ )   :   𝐹 × 𝑉 ↦ 𝑉 (+)  (⋅) ​: V×V↦V : F×V↦V​ To describe a vector space, our definitions must entail several vector space axioms.A Functional Vector SpaceIn the following sections, we’ll work with the vector space of real functions. To avoid ambiguity, square brackets are used to denote function application.The scalar field𝐹 F is the real numbers𝑅 R. The set of vectors𝑉 V contains functions from𝑅 R to𝑅 R.2 0 0 is the zero function, i.e.0 [ 𝑥 ] = 0 0[x]=0.Adding functions corresponds to applying the functions separately and summing the results.( 𝑓 + 𝑔 ) [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] + 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] (f+g)[x]=f[x]+g[x]This definition generalizes the typical element-wise addition rule—it’s like adding the two values at each index.𝑓 + 𝑔 = [ 𝑓 1 + 𝑔 1 𝑓 2 + 𝑔 2 ⋮ ] f+g=​f 1​+g 1​f 2​+g 2​⋮​ ​ Multiplying a function by a scalar corresponds to applying the function and scaling the result.( 𝛼 𝑓 ) [ 𝑥 ] = 𝛼 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] (αf)[x]=αf[x]This rule similarly generalizes element-wise multiplication—it’s like scaling the value at each index.𝛼 𝑓 = [ 𝛼 𝑓 1 𝛼 𝑓 2 ⋮ ] αf=​αf 1​αf 2​⋮​ ​ProofsGiven these definitions, we can now prove all necessary vector space axioms. We will illustrate the analog of each property in𝑅 2 R 2 , the familiar vector space of two-dimensional arrows.Vector Addition is Commutative For all vectors𝑢 , 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 u,v∈V : 𝑢 + 𝑣 = 𝑣 + 𝑢 u+v=v+u Since real addition is commutative, this property follows directly from our definition of vector addition: ( 𝑓 + 𝑔 ) [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] + 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] + 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] = ( 𝑔 + 𝑓 ) [ 𝑥 ] (f+g)[x]​=f[x]+g[x] =g[x]+f[x] =(g+f)[x]​Vector Addition is Associative For all vectors𝑢 , 𝑣 , 𝑤 ∈ 𝑉 u,v,w∈V : ( 𝑢 + 𝑣 ) + 𝑤 = 𝑢 + ( 𝑣 + 𝑤 ) (u+v)+w=u+(v+w) This property also follows from our definition of vector addition: ( ( 𝑓 + 𝑔 ) + ℎ ) [ 𝑥 ] = ( 𝑓 + 𝑔 ) [ 𝑥 ] + ℎ [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] + 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] + ℎ [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] + ( 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] + ℎ [ 𝑥 ] ) = 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] + ( 𝑔 + ℎ ) [ 𝑥 ] = ( 𝑓 + ( 𝑔 + ℎ ) ) [ 𝑥 ] ((f+g)+h)[x]​=(f+g)[x]+h[x] =f[x]+g[x]+h[x] =f[x]+(g[x]+h[x]) =f[x]+(g+h)[x] =(f+(g+h))[x]​0 0is an Additive Identity For all vectors𝑢 ∈ 𝑉 u∈V : 0 + 𝑢 = 𝑢 0+u=u This one is easy: ( 0 + 𝑓 ) [ 𝑥 ] = 0 [ 𝑥 ] + 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] = 0 + 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] (0+f)[x]​=0[x]+f[x] =0+f[x] =f[x]​Additive Inverses Exist For all vectors𝑢 ∈ 𝑉 u∈V , there exists a vector− 𝑢 ∈ 𝑉 −u∈Vsuch that: 𝑢 + ( − 𝑢 ) = 0 u+(−u)=0 Negation is defined as applying𝑓 fand negating the result:( − 𝑓 ) [ 𝑥 ] = − 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] (−f)[x]=−f[x] .

In𝑅 2 R 2 , the standard basis consists of the two coordinate axes.𝑒 1 = [ 1 0 ] , 𝑒 2 = [ 0 1 ] e 1​=[ 1 0​],e 2​=[ 0 1​]Hence, vector notation is shorthand for a linear combination of the standard basis vectors.𝑢 = [ 𝛼 𝛽 ] = 𝛼 𝑒 1 + 𝛽 𝑒 2 u=[ α β​]=αe 1​+βe 2​ Above, we represented functions as vectors by assuming each dimension of an infinite-length vector contains the function’s result for that index. This construction points to a natural generalization of the standard basis.Just like the coordinate axes, each standard basis function contains a1 1 at one index and0 0 everywhere else. More precisely, for every𝛼 ∈ 𝑅 α∈R,𝑒 𝛼 [ 𝑥 ] = { 1 if  𝑥 = 𝛼 0 otherwise e α​[x]={ 1 0​if x=α otherwise​ We can then express any real function𝑓 f as a linear combination of these basis functions:𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑓 [ 𝛼 ] 𝑒 𝛼 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑓 [ 1 ] 𝑒 1 [ 𝑥 ] + 𝑓 [ 2 ] 𝑒 2 [ 𝑥 ] + 𝑓 [ 𝜋 ] 𝑒 𝜋 [ 𝑥 ] + … f[x]​=f[α]e α​[x] =f[1]e 1​[x]+f[2]e 2​[x]+f[π]e π​[x]+…​ If you evaluate this sum at𝑥 x, you’ll find that all terms are zero—except𝑒 𝑥 e x​, making the result𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] f[x].Linear OperatorsReview: Change of basis | Chapter 13, Essence of linear algebra.Now that we can manipulate functions as vectors, let’s start transferring the tools of linear algebra to the functional perspective.One ubiquitous operation on finite-dimensional vectors is transforming them with matrices. A matrix𝐴 A encodes a linear transformation, meaning multiplication preserves linear combinations.𝐴 ( 𝛼 𝑥 + 𝛽 𝑦 ) = 𝛼 𝐴 𝑥 + 𝛽 𝐴 𝑦 A(αx+βy)=αAx+βAyMultiplying a vector by a matrix can be intuitively interpreted as defining a new set of coordinate axes from the matrix’s column vectors. The result is a linear combination of the columns:𝐴 𝑥 = [ ∣ ∣ ∣ 𝑢 𝑣 𝑤 ∣ ∣ ∣ ] [ 𝑥 1 𝑥 2 𝑥 3 ] = 𝑥 1 𝑢 + 𝑥 2 𝑣 + 𝑥 3 𝑤 Ax=​∣ u ∣​∣ v ∣​∣ w ∣​ ​ ​x 1​x 2​x 3​ ​ ​=x 1​u+x 2​v+x 3​wWhen all vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of𝑢 u,𝑣 v, and𝑤 w, the columns form a basis for the underlying vector space. Here, the matrix𝐴 A transforms a vector from the𝑢 𝑣 𝑤 uvw basis into the standard basis.Since functions are vectors, we could imagine transforming a function by a matrix. Such a matrix would be infinite-dimensional, so we will instead call it a linear operator and denote it with𝐿 L.𝐿 𝑓 = [ ∣ ∣ ∣ 𝑓 𝑔 ℎ ⋯ ∣ ∣ ∣ ] [ 𝑓 1 𝑓 2 𝑓 3 ⋮ ] = 𝑓 1 𝑓 + 𝑓 2 𝑔 + 𝑓 3 ℎ + ⋯ Lf=​∣ f ∣​∣ g ∣​∣ h ∣​⋯​ ​ ​f 1​f 2​f 3​⋮​ ​=f 1​f+f 2​g+f 3​h+⋯This visualization isn’t very accurate—we’re dealing with uncountably infinite-dimensional vectors, so we can’t actually write out an operator in matrix form. Nonetheless, the structure is suggestive: each “column” of the operator describes a new basis function for our functional vector space. Just like we saw with finite-dimensional vectors,𝐿 L represents a change of basis.DifferentiationReview: Derivative formulas through geometry | Chapter 3, Essence of calculus.So, what’s an example of a linear operator on functions? You might recall that differentiation is linear:∂ ∂ 𝑥 ( 𝛼 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] + 𝛽 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] ) = 𝛼 ∂ 𝑓 ∂ 𝑥 + 𝛽 ∂ 𝑔 ∂ 𝑥 ∂x ∂​(αf[x]+βg[x])=α ∂x ∂f​+β ∂x ∂g​ It’s hard to visualize differentiation on general functions, but it’s feasible for the subspace of polynomials,𝑃 P. Let’s take a slight detour to examine this smaller space of functions.𝑃 = { 𝑝 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑥 + 𝑐 𝑥 2 + 𝑑 𝑥 3 + ⋯ } P={p[x]=a+bx+cx 2 +dx 3 +⋯}We typically write down polynomials as a sequence of powers, i.e.1 , 𝑥 , 𝑥 2 , 𝑥 3 1,x,x 2 ,x 3 , etc. All polynomials are linear combinations of the functions𝑒 𝑖 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑥 𝑖 e i​[x]=x i , so they constitute a countably infinite basis for𝑃 P.4This basis provides a convenient vector notation:𝑝 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑥 + 𝑐 𝑥 2 + 𝑑 𝑥 3 + ⋯ = 𝑎 𝑒 0 + 𝑏 𝑒 1 + 𝑐 𝑒 2 + 𝑑 𝑒 3 + …   ⟺   𝑝 = [ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑐 𝑑 ⋮ ] p[x]​=a+bx+cx 2 +dx 3 +⋯ =ae 0​+be 1​+ce 2​+de 3​+…​ ⟺ p=​a b c d ⋮​ ​ Since differentiation is linear, we’re able to apply the rule∂ ∂ 𝑥 𝑥 𝑛 = 𝑛 𝑥 𝑛 − 1 ∂x ∂​x n =nx n−1to each term.∂ ∂ 𝑥 𝑝 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑎 ∂ ∂ 𝑥 1 + 𝑏 ∂ ∂ 𝑥 𝑥 + 𝑐 ∂ ∂ 𝑥 𝑥 2 + 𝑑 ∂ ∂ 𝑥 𝑥 3 + … = 𝑏 + 2 𝑐 𝑥 + 3 𝑑 𝑥 2 + ⋯ = 𝑏 𝑒 0 + 2 𝑐 𝑒 1 + 3 𝑑 𝑒 2 + …   ⟺   ∂ ∂ 𝑥 𝑝 = [ 𝑏 2 𝑐 3 𝑑 ⋮ ] ∂x ∂​p[x]​=​a ∂x ∂​1+b ∂x ∂​x+c ∂x ∂​x 2 +d ∂x ∂​x 3 +… =b+2cx+3dx 2 +⋯ =be 0​+2ce 1​+3de 2​+…​ ⟺  ∂x ∂​p=​b 2c 3d ⋮​ ​ We’ve performed a linear transformation on the coefficients, so we can represent differentiation as a matrix!∂ ∂ 𝑥 𝑝 = [ 0 1 0 0 ⋯ 0 0 2 0 ⋯ 0 0 0 3 ⋯ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ] [ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑐 𝑑 ⋮ ] = [ 𝑏 2 𝑐 3 𝑑 ⋮ ] ∂x ∂​p=​0 0 0 ⋮​1 0 0 ⋮​0 2 0 ⋮​0 0 3 ⋮​⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋱​ ​ ​a b c d ⋮​ ​=​b 2c 3d ⋮​ ​ Each column of the differentiation operator is itself a polynomial, so this matrix represents a change of basis.∂ ∂ 𝑥 = [ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ 0 1 2 𝑥 3 𝑥 2 4 𝑥 3 ⋯ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ] ∂x ∂​=​∣ 0 ∣​∣ 1 ∣​∣ 2x ∣​∣ 3x 2 ∣​∣ 4x 3 ∣​⋯​ ​ As we can see, the differentiation operator simply maps each basis function to its derivative.This result also applies to the larger space of analytic real functions, which includes polynomials, exponential functions, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and other familiar names. By definition, an analytic function can be expressed as a Taylor series about0 0:𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] = ∑ 𝑛 = 0 ∞ 𝑓 ( 𝑛 ) [ 0 ] 𝑛 ! 𝑥 𝑛 = ∑ 𝑛 = 0 ∞ 𝛼 𝑛 𝑥 𝑛 f[x]= n=0 ∑ ∞​n! f (n) [0]​x n = n=0 ∑ ∞​α n​x nWhich is a linear combination of our polynomial basis functions. That means a Taylor expansion is essentially a change of basis into the sequence of powers, where our differentiation operator is quite simple.5DiagonalizationReview: Eigenvectors and eigenvalues | Chapter 14, Essence of linear algebra.Matrix decompositions are arguably the crowning achievement of linear algebra. To get started, let’s review what diagonalization means for a3 × 3 3×3 real matrix𝐴 A.EigenvectorsA vector𝑢 u is an eigenvector of the matrix𝐴 A when the following condition holds:𝐴 𝑢 = 𝜆 𝑢 Au=λuThe eigenvalue𝜆 λ may be computed by solving the characteristic polynomial of𝐴 A. Eigenvalues may be real or complex.The matrix𝐴 A is diagonalizable when it admits three linearly independent eigenvectors, each with a corresponding real eigenvalue. This set of eigenvectors constitutes an eigenbasis for the underlying vector space, indicating that we can express any vector𝑥 x via their linear combination.𝑥 = 𝛼 𝑢 1 + 𝛽 𝑢 2 + 𝛾 𝑢 3 x=αu 1​+βu 2​+γu 3​ To multiply𝑥 x by𝐴 A, we just have to scale each component by its corresponding eigenvalue.𝐴 𝑥 = 𝛼 𝐴 𝑢 1 + 𝛽 𝐴 𝑢 2 + 𝛾 𝐴 𝑢 3 = 𝛼 𝜆 1 𝑢 1 + 𝛽 𝜆 2 𝑢 2 + 𝛾 𝜆 3 𝑢 3 Ax​=αAu 1​+βAu 2​+γAu 3​=αλ 1​u 1​+βλ 2​u 2​+γλ 3​u 3​ ​ Finally, re-combining the eigenvectors expresses the result in the standard basis.Intuitively, we’ve shown that multiplying by𝐴 A is equivalent to a change of basis, a scaling, and a change back. That means we can write𝐴 A as the product of an invertible matrix𝑈 U and a diagonal matrix𝛬 Λ.𝐴 = 𝑈 𝛬 𝑈 − 1 = [ ∣ ∣ ∣ 𝑢 1 𝑢 2 𝑢 3 ∣ ∣ ∣ ] [ 𝜆 1 0 0 0 𝜆 2 0 0 0 𝜆 3 ] [ ∣ ∣ ∣ 𝑢 1 𝑢 2 𝑢 3 ∣ ∣ ∣ ] − 1 A​=UΛU −1 =​∣ u 1​∣​∣ u 2​∣​∣ u 3​∣​ ​ ​λ 1​0 0​0 λ 2​0​0 0 λ 3​ ​ ​ ​∣ u 1​∣​∣ u 2​∣​∣ u 3​∣​ ​−1​ Note that𝑈 U is invertible because its columns (the eigenvectors) form a basis for𝑅 3 R 3 . When multiplying by𝑥 x,𝑈 − 1 U −1converts𝑥 x to the eigenbasis,𝛬 Λ scales by the corresponding eigenvalues, and𝑈 U takes us back to the standard basis.In the presence of complex eigenvalues,𝐴 A may still be diagonalizable if we allow𝑈 U and𝛬 Λ to include complex entires. In this case, the decomposition as a whole still maps real vectors to real vectors, but the intermediate values become complex.EigenfunctionsReview: What’s so special about Euler’s number e? | Chapter 5, Essence of calculus.So, what does diagonalization mean in a vector space of functions? Given a linear operator𝐿 L, you might imagine a corresponding definition for eigenfunctions:𝐿 𝑓 = 𝜓 𝑓 Lf=ψfThe scalar𝜓 ψ is again known as an eigenvalue. Since𝐿 L is infinite-dimensional, it doesn’t have a characteristic polynomial—there’s not a straightforward method for computing𝜓 ψ.Nevertheless, let’s attempt to diagonalize differentiation on analytic functions. The first step is to find the eigenfunctions. Start by applying the above condition to our differentiation operator in the power basis:∂ ∂ 𝑥 𝑝 = 𝜓 𝑝 ⟺ [ 0 1 0 0 ⋯ 0 0 2 0 ⋯ 0 0 0 3 ⋯ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ] [ 𝑝 0 𝑝 1 𝑝 2 𝑝 3 ⋮ ] = [ 𝜓 𝑝 0 𝜓 𝑝 1 𝜓 𝑝 2 𝜓 𝑝 3 ⋮ ] ⟺ { 𝑝 1 = 𝜓 𝑝 0 𝑝 2 = 𝜓 2 𝑝 1 𝑝 3 = 𝜓 3 𝑝 2 …​⟺ ⟺​∂x ∂​p=ψp​ ​0 0 0 ⋮​1 0 0 ⋮​0 2 0 ⋮​0 0 3 ⋮​⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋱​ ​ ​p 0​p 1​p 2​p 3​⋮​ ​⎩ ⎨ ⎧​p 1​p 2​p 3​ ​=ψp 0​= 2 ψ​p 1​= 3 ψ​p 2​…​ ​=​ψp 0​ψp 1​ψp 2​ψp 3​⋮​ ​ ​ This system of equations implies that all coefficients are determined solely by our choice of constants𝑝 0 p 0​ and𝜓 ψ. We can explicitly write down their relationship as𝑝 𝑖 = 𝜓 𝑖 𝑖 ! 𝑝 0 p i​= i! ψ i​p 0​.Now, let’s see what this class of polynomials actually looks like.𝑝 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑝 0 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 𝑥 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 2 2 𝑥 2 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 3 6 𝑥 3 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 4 24 𝑥 4 + … p[x]=p 0​+p 0​ψx+p 0​2 ψ 2​x 2 +p 0​6 ψ 3​x 3 +p 0​24 ψ 4​x 4 +…Differentiation shows that this function is, in fact, an eigenfunction for the eigenvalue𝜓 ψ.∂ ∂ 𝑥 𝑝 [ 𝑥 ] = 0 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 2 𝑥 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 3 2 𝑥 2 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 4 6 𝑥 3 + … = 𝜓 𝑝 [ 𝑥 ] ∂x ∂​p[x]​=0+p 0​ψ+p 0​ψ 2 x+p 0​2 ψ 3​x 2 +p 0​6 ψ 4​x 3 +… =ψp[x]​ With a bit of algebraic manipulation, the definition of𝑒 𝑥 e xpops out:𝑝 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑝 0 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 𝑥 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 2 2 𝑥 2 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 3 6 𝑥 3 + 𝑝 0 𝜓 4 24 𝑥 4 + … = 𝑝 0 ( ( 𝜓 𝑥 ) + 1 2 ! ( 𝜓 𝑥 ) 2 + 1 3 ! ( 𝜓 𝑥 ) 3 + 1 4 ! ( 𝜓 𝑥 ) 4 + … ) = 𝑝 0 𝑒 𝜓 𝑥 p[x]​=p 0​+p 0​ψx+p 0​2 ψ 2​x 2 +p 0​6 ψ 3​x 3 +p 0​24 ψ 4​x 4 +… =p 0​((ψx)+ 2! 1​(ψx) 2 + 3! 1​(ψx) 3 + 4! 1​(ψx) 4 +…) =p 0​e ψx​ Therefore, functions of the form𝑝 0 𝑒 𝜓 𝑥 p 0​e ψxare eigenfunctions for the eigenvalue𝜓 ψ, including when𝜓 = 0 ψ=0.Diagonalizing DifferentiationWe’ve found the eigenfunctions of the derivative operator, but can we diagonalize it? Ideally, we would express differentiation as the combination of an invertible operator𝐿 L and a diagonal operator𝐷 D.∂ ∂ 𝑥 = 𝐿 𝐷 𝐿 − 1 = [ ∣ ∣ 𝛼 𝑒 𝜓 1 𝑥 𝛽 𝑒 𝜓 2 𝑥 … ∣ ∣ ] [ 𝜓 1 0 … 0 𝜓 2 … ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ] [ ∣ ∣ 𝛼 𝑒 𝜓 1 𝑥 𝛽 𝑒 𝜓 2 𝑥 … ∣ ∣ ] − 1 ∂x ∂​ ​=LDL −1 =​∣ αe ψ 1​x ∣​∣ βe ψ 2​x ∣​…​ ​ ​ψ 1​0 ⋮​0 ψ 2​⋮​… … ⋱​ ​ ​∣ αe ψ 1​x ∣​∣ βe ψ 2​x ∣​…​ ​−1​ Diagonalization is only possible when our eigenfunctions form a basis. This would be true if all analytic functions are expressible as a linear combination of exponentials. However…Counterexample:𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑥 f[x]=xFirst assume that𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑥 f[x]=x can be represented as a linear combination of exponentials. Since analytic functions have countably infinite dimensionality, we should only need a countably infinite sum:𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑥 = ∑ 𝑛 = 0 ∞ 𝛼 𝑛 𝑒 𝜓 𝑛 𝑥 f[x]=x= n=0 ∑ ∞​α n​e ψ n​xDifferentiating both sides:𝑓 ′ [ 𝑥 ] = 1 = ∑ 𝑛 = 0 ∞ 𝜓 𝑛 𝛼 𝑛 𝑒 𝜓 𝑛 𝑥 𝑓 ′ ′ [ 𝑥 ] = 0 = ∑ 𝑛 = 0 ∞ 𝜓 𝑛 2 𝛼 𝑛 𝑒 𝜓 𝑛 𝑥 f ′ [x] f ′′ [x]​=1= n=0 ∑ ∞​ψ n​α n​e ψ n​x =0= n=0 ∑ ∞​ψ n 2​α n​e ψ n​x​ Since𝑒 𝜓 𝑛 𝑥 e ψ n​xand𝑒 𝜓 𝑚 𝑥 e ψ m​xare linearly independent when𝑛 ≠ 𝑚 n  =m, the final equation implies that all𝛼 = 0 α=0, except possibly the𝛼 𝜉 α ξ​ corresponding to𝜓 𝜉 = 0 ψ ξ​=0. Therefore:1 = ∑ 𝑛 = 0 ∞ 𝜓 𝑛 𝛼 𝑛 𝑒 𝜓 𝑛 𝑥 = 𝜓 𝜉 𝛼 𝜉 + ∑ 𝑛 ≠ 𝜉 0 𝜓 𝑛 𝑒 𝜓 𝑛 𝑥 = 0 1​= n=0 ∑ ∞​ψ n​α n​e ψ n​x =ψ ξ​α ξ​+ n  =ξ ∑​0ψ n​e ψ n​x =0​ That’s a contradiction—the linear combination representing𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑥 f[x]=x does not exist.A similar argument shows that we can’t represent any non-constant function whose𝑛 nth derivative is zero, nor periodic functions like sine and cosine.Real exponentials don’t constitute a basis, so we cannot construct an invertible𝐿 L.The Laplace TransformWe previously mentioned that more matrices can be diagonalized if we allow the decomposition to contain complex numbers. Analogously, more linear operators are diagonalizable in the larger vector space of functions from𝑅 R to𝐶 C.Differentiation works the same way in this space; we’ll still find that its eigenfunctions are exponential.∂ ∂ 𝑥 𝑒 ( 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑖 ) 𝑥 = ( 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑖 ) 𝑒 ( 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑖 ) 𝑥 ∂x ∂​e (a+bi)x =(a+bi)e (a+bi)xHowever, the new eigenfunctions have complex eigenvalues, so we still can’t diagonalize. We’ll need to consider the still larger space of functions from𝐶 C to𝐶 C.∂ ∂ 𝑥 : ( 𝐶 ↦ 𝐶 ) ↦ ( 𝐶 ↦ 𝐶 ) ∂x ∂​:(C↦C)↦(C↦C)In this space, differentiation can be diagonalized via the Laplace transform. Although useful for solving differential equations, the Laplace transform is non-trivial to invert, so we won’t discuss it further. In the following sections, we’ll delve into an operator that can be easily diagonalized in𝑅 ↦ 𝐶 R↦C: the Laplacian.Inner Product SpacesReview: Dot products and duality | Chapter 9, Essence of linear algebra.Before we get to the spectral theorem, we’ll need to understand one more topic: inner products. You’re likely already familiar with one example of an inner product—the Euclidean dot product.[ 𝑥 𝑦 𝑧 ] ⋅ [ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑐 ] = 𝑎 𝑥 + 𝑏 𝑦 + 𝑐 𝑧​x y z​ ​⋅​a b c​ ​=ax+by+czAn inner product describes how to measure a vector along another vector. For example,𝑢 ⋅ 𝑣 u⋅v is proportional to the length of the projection of𝑢 u onto𝑣 v.𝑢 ⋅ 𝑣 = ∥ 𝑢 ∥ ∥ 𝑣 ∥ cos ⁡ [ 𝜃 ] u⋅v=∥u∥∥v∥cos[θ]With a bit of trigonometry, we can show that the dot product is equivalent to multiplying the vectors’ lengths with the cosine of their angle. This relationship suggests that the product of a vector with itself produces the square of its length.𝑢 ⋅ 𝑢 = ∥ 𝑢 ∥ ∥ 𝑢 ∥ cos ⁡ [ 0 ] = ∥ 𝑢 ∥ 2 u⋅u​=∥u∥∥u∥cos[0] =∥u∥ 2​ Similarly, when two vectors form a right angle (are orthogonal), their dot product is zero.𝑢 ⋅ 𝑣 = ∥ 𝑢 ∥ ∥ 𝑣 ∥ cos ⁡ [ 9 0 ∘ ] = 0 u⋅v​=∥u∥∥v∥cos[90 ∘ ] =0​ Of course, the Euclidean dot product is only one example of an inner product. In more general spaces, the inner product is denoted using angle brackets, such as⟨ 𝑢 , 𝑣 ⟩ ⟨u,v⟩.The length (also known as the norm) of a vector is defined as∥ 𝑢 ∥ = ⟨ 𝑢 , 𝑢 ⟩ ∥u∥= ⟨u,u⟩​. Two vectors are orthogonal if their inner product is zero:  𝑢 ⊥ 𝑣   ⟺   ⟨ 𝑢 , 𝑣 ⟩ = 0  u⊥v ⟺ ⟨u,v⟩=0.A vector space augmented with an inner product is known as an inner product space.A Functional Inner ProductWe can’t directly apply the Euclidean dot product to our space of real functions, but its𝑁 N-dimensional generalization is suggestive.𝑢 ⋅ 𝑣 = 𝑢 1 𝑣 1 + 𝑢 2 𝑣 2 + ⋯ + 𝑢 𝑁 𝑣 𝑁 = ∑ 𝑖 = 1 𝑁 𝑢 𝑖 𝑣 𝑖 u⋅v​=u 1​v 1​+u 2​v 2​+⋯+u N​v N​= i=1 ∑ N​u i​v i​ ​ Given countable indices, we simply match up the values, multiply them, and add the results. When indices are uncountable, we can convert the discrete sum to its continuous analog: an integral!⟨ 𝑓 , 𝑔 ⟩ = ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑑 𝑥 ⟨f,g⟩=∫ a b​f[x]g[x]dxWhen𝑓 f and𝑔 g are similar, multiplying them produces a larger function; when they’re different, they cancel out. Integration measures their product over some domain to produce a scalar result.Of course, not all functions can be integrated. Our inner product space will only contain functions that are square integrable over the domain[ 𝑎 , 𝑏 ] [a,b], which may be[ − ∞ , ∞ ] [−∞,∞]. Luckily, the important properties of our inner product do not depend on the choice of integration domain.ProofsBelow, we’ll briefly cover functions from𝑅 R to𝐶 C. In this space, our intuitive notion of similarity still applies, but we’ll use a slightly more general inner product:⟨ 𝑓 , 𝑔 ⟩ = ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] ‾ 𝑑 𝑥 ⟨f,g⟩=∫ a b​f[x] g[x]​dxWhere𝑥 ‾ xdenotes conjugation, i.e.𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑖 ‾ = 𝑎 − 𝑏 𝑖 a+bi​=a−bi.Like other vector space operations, an inner product must satisfy several axioms:Conjugate Symmetry For all vectors𝑢 , 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 u,v∈V : ⟨ 𝑢 , 𝑣 ⟩ = ⟨ 𝑣 , 𝑢 ⟩ ‾ ⟨u,v⟩= ⟨v,u⟩​Conjugation may be taken outside the integral, making this one easy: ⟨ 𝑓 , 𝑔 ⟩ = ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] ‾ 𝑑 𝑥 = ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] ‾ ‾ 𝑑 𝑥 = ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] ‾ 𝑑 𝑥 ‾ = ⟨ 𝑔 , 𝑓 ⟩ ‾ ⟨f,g⟩​=∫ a b​f[x] g[x]​dx =∫ a b​g[x] f[x]​ ​dx = ∫ a b​g[x] f[x]​dx​= ⟨g,f⟩​ ​Note that we require conjugate symmetry because it implies⟨ 𝑢 , 𝑢 ⟩ = ⟨ 𝑢 , 𝑢 ⟩ ‾ ⟨u,u⟩= ⟨u,u⟩​, i.e. the inner product of a vector with itself is real. Linearity in the First Argument For all vectors𝑢 , 𝑣 , 𝑤 ∈ 𝑉 u,v,w∈Vand scalars𝛼 , 𝛽 ∈ 𝐹 α,β∈F : ⟨ 𝛼 𝑢 + 𝛽 𝑣 , 𝑤 ⟩ = 𝛼 ⟨ 𝑢 , 𝑤 ⟩ + 𝛽 ⟨ 𝑣 , 𝑤 ⟩ ⟨αu+βv,w⟩=α⟨u,w⟩+β⟨v,w⟩ The proof follows from linearity of integration, as well as our vector space axioms: ⟨ 𝛼 𝑓 + 𝛽 𝑔 , ℎ ⟩ = ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 ( 𝛼 𝑓 + 𝛽 𝑔 ) [ 𝑥 ] ℎ [ 𝑥 ] ‾ 𝑑 𝑥 = ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 ( 𝛼 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] + 𝛽 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] ) ℎ [ 𝑥 ] ‾ 𝑑 𝑥 = ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝛼 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] ℎ [ 𝑥 ] ‾ + 𝛽 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] ℎ [ 𝑥 ] ‾ 𝑑 𝑥 = 𝛼 ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] ℎ [ 𝑥 ] ‾ 𝑑 𝑥 + 𝛽 ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] ℎ [ 𝑥 ] ‾ 𝑑 𝑥 = 𝛼 ⟨ 𝑓 , ℎ ⟩ + 𝛽 ⟨ 𝑔 , ℎ ⟩ ⟨αf+βg,h⟩​=∫ a b​(αf+βg)[x] h[x]​dx =∫ a b​(αf[x]+βg[x]) h[x]​dx =∫ a b​αf[x] h[x]​+βg[x] h[x]​dx =α∫ a b​f[x] h[x]​dx+β∫ a b​g[x] h[x]​dx =α⟨f,h⟩+β⟨g,h⟩​Given conjugate symmetry, an inner product is also antilinear in the second argument. Positive-Definiteness For all𝑢 ∈ 𝑉 u∈V : { ⟨ 𝑢 , 𝑢 ⟩ = 0 if  𝑢 = 0 ⟨ 𝑢 , 𝑢 ⟩ > 0 otherwise { ⟨u,u⟩=0 ⟨u,u⟩>0​if u=0 otherwise​By conjugate symmetry, we know⟨ 𝑓 , 𝑓 ⟩ ⟨f,f⟩is real, so we can compare it with zero.However, rigorously proving this result requires measure-theoretic concepts beyond the scope of this post. In brief, we redefine0 0not as specifically0 [ 𝑥 ] = 0 0[x]=0 , but as an equivalence class of functions that are zero \"almost everywhere.\" If𝑓 fis zero almost everywhere, it is only non-zero on a set of measure zero, and therefore integrates to zero.After partitioning our set of functions into equivalence classes, all non-zero functions square-integrate to a positive value. This implies that every function has a real norm,⟨ 𝑓 , 𝑓 ⟩ ⟨f,f⟩​.Along with the definition∥ 𝑓 ∥ = ⟨ 𝑓 , 𝑓 ⟩ ∥f∥= ⟨f,f⟩​, these properties entail a variety of important results, including the Cauchy–Schwarz and triangle inequalities.The Spectral TheoremDiagonalization is already a powerful technique, but we’re building up to an even more important result regarding orthonormal eigenbases. In an inner product space, an orthonormal basis must satisfy two conditions: each vector is unit length, and all vectors are mutually orthogonal.{ ⟨ 𝑢 𝑖 , 𝑢 𝑖 ⟩ = 1 ∀ 𝑖 ⟨ 𝑢 𝑖 , 𝑢 𝑗 ⟩ = 0 ∀ 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗 { ⟨u i​,u i​⟩=1 ⟨u i​,u j​⟩=0​∀i ∀i  =j​ A matrix consisting of orthonormal columns is known as an orthogonal matrix. Orthogonal matrices represent rotations of the standard basis.In an inner product space, matrix-vector multiplication computes the inner product of the vector with each row of the matrix. Something interesting happens when we multiply an orthogonal matrix𝑈 U by its transpose:𝑈 𝑇 𝑈 = [ — 𝑢 1 — — 𝑢 2 — — 𝑢 3 — ] [ ∣ ∣ ∣ 𝑢 1 𝑢 2 𝑢 3 ∣ ∣ ∣ ] = [ ⟨ 𝑢 1 , 𝑢 1 ⟩ ⟨ 𝑢 1 , 𝑢 2 ⟩ ⟨ 𝑢 1 , 𝑢 3 ⟩ ⟨ 𝑢 2 , 𝑢 1 ⟩ ⟨ 𝑢 2 , 𝑢 2 ⟩ ⟨ 𝑢 2 , 𝑢 3 ⟩ ⟨ 𝑢 3 , 𝑢 1 ⟩ ⟨ 𝑢 3 , 𝑢 2 ⟩ ⟨ 𝑢 3 , 𝑢 3 ⟩ ] = [ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ] = 𝐼 U T U​=​— — —​u 1​u 2​u 3​ ​— — —​ ​ ​∣ u 1​∣​∣ u 2​∣​∣ u 3​∣​ ​=​⟨u 1​,u 1​⟩ ⟨u 2​,u 1​⟩ ⟨u 3​,u 1​⟩​⟨u 1​,u 2​⟩ ⟨u 2​,u 2​⟩ ⟨u 3​,u 2​⟩​⟨u 1​,u 3​⟩ ⟨u 2​,u 3​⟩ ⟨u 3​,u 3​⟩​ ​=​1 0 0​0 1 0​0 0 1​ ​=I​ Since𝑈 𝑇 𝑈 = 𝐼 U T U=I (and𝑈 𝑈 𝑇 = 𝐼 UU T =I), we’ve found that the transpose of𝑈 U is equal to its inverse.When diagonalizing𝐴 A, we used𝑈 U to transform vectors from our eigenbasis to the standard basis. Conversely, its inverse transformed vectors from the standard basis to our eigenbasis. If𝑈 U happens to be orthogonal, transforming a vector𝑥 x into the eigenbasis is equivalent to projecting𝑥 x onto each eigenvector.𝑈 − 1 𝑥 = 𝑈 𝑇 𝑥 = [ ⟨ 𝑢 1 , 𝑥 ⟩ ⟨ 𝑢 2 , 𝑥 ⟩ ⟨ 𝑢 3 , 𝑥 ⟩ ] U −1 x=U T x=​⟨u 1​,x⟩ ⟨u 2​,x⟩ ⟨u 3​,x⟩​ ​ Additionally, the diagonalization of𝐴 A becomes quite simple:𝐴 = 𝑈 𝛬 𝑈 𝑇 = [ ∣ ∣ ∣ 𝑢 1 𝑢 2 𝑢 3 ∣ ∣ ∣ ] [ 𝜆 1 0 0 0 𝜆 2 0 0 0 𝜆 3 ] [ — 𝑢 1 — — 𝑢 2 — — 𝑢 3 — ] A​=UΛU T =​∣ u 1​∣​∣ u 2​∣​∣ u 3​∣​ ​ ​λ 1​0 0​0 λ 2​0​0 0 λ 3​ ​ ​ ​— — —​u 1​u 2​u 3​ ​— — —​ ​ ​ Given an orthogonal diagonalization of𝐴 A, we can deduce that𝐴 A must be symmetric, i.e.𝐴 = 𝐴 𝑇 A=A T .𝐴 𝑇 = ( 𝑈 𝛬 𝑈 𝑇 ) 𝑇 = 𝑈 𝑇 𝑇 𝛬 𝑇 𝑈 𝑇 = 𝑈 𝛬 𝑈 𝑇 = 𝐴 A T​=(UΛU T ) T =U T T Λ T U T =UΛU T =A​ The spectral theorem states that the converse is also true:𝐴 A is symmetric if and only if it admits an orthonormal eigenbasis with real eigenvalues. Proving this result is somewhat involved in finite dimensions and very involved in infinite dimensions, so we won’t reproduce the proofs here.Self-Adjoint OperatorsWe can generalize the spectral theorem to our space of functions, where it states that a self-adjoint operator admits an orthonormal eigenbasis with real eigenvalues.6Denoted as𝐴 ⋆ A ⋆ , the adjoint of an operator𝐴 A is defined by the following relationship.⟨ 𝐴 𝑥 , 𝑦 ⟩ = ⟨ 𝑥 , 𝐴 ⋆ 𝑦 ⟩ ⟨Ax,y⟩=⟨x,A ⋆ y⟩When𝐴 = 𝐴 ⋆ A=A ⋆ , we say that𝐴 A is self-adjoint.The adjoint can be thought of as a generalized transpose—but it’s not obvious what that means in infinite dimensions. We will simply use our functional inner product to determine whether an operator is self-adjoint.The Laplace OperatorReview: Solving the heat equation | DE3.Earlier, we weren’t able to diagonalize (real) differentiation, so it must not be self-adjoint. Therefore, we will explore another fundamental operator, the Laplacian.There are many equivalent definitions of the Laplacian, but in our space of one-dimensional functions, it’s just the second derivative. We will hence restrict our domain to twice-differentiable functions.Δ 𝑓 = ∂ 2 𝑓 ∂ 𝑥 2 Δf= ∂x 2 ∂ 2 f​ We may computeΔ ⋆ Δ ⋆using two integrations by parts:⟨ Δ 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] , 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] ⟩ = ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑓 ′ ′ [ 𝑥 ] 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑑 𝑥 = 𝑓 ′ [ 𝑥 ] 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] ∣ 𝑎 𝑏 − ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑓 ′ [ 𝑥 ] 𝑔 ′ [ 𝑥 ] 𝑑 𝑥 = ( 𝑓 ′ [ 𝑥 ] 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] − 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑔 ′ [ 𝑥 ] ) ∣ 𝑎 𝑏 + ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑔 ′ ′ [ 𝑥 ] 𝑑 𝑥 = ⟨ 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] , Δ 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] ⟩ ⟨Δf[x],g[x]⟩​=∫ a b​f ′′ [x]g[x]dx =f ′ [x]g[x]​a b​−∫ a b​f ′ [x]g ′ [x]dx =(f ′ [x]g[x]−f[x]g ′ [x])​a b​+∫ a b​f[x]g ′′ [x]dx =⟨f[x],Δg[x]⟩​ In the final step, we assume that( 𝑓 ′ [ 𝑥 ] 𝑔 [ 𝑥 ] − 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑔 ′ [ 𝑥 ] ) ∣ 𝑎 𝑏 = 0 (f ′ [x]g[x]−f[x]g ′ [x])​a b​=0, which is not true in general. To make our conclusion valid, we will constrain our domain to only include functions satisfying this boundary condition. Specifically, we will only consider periodic functions with period𝑏 − 𝑎 b−a. These functions have the same value and derivative at𝑎 a and𝑏 b, so the additional term vanishes.For simplicity, we will also assume our domain to be[ 0 , 1 ] [0,1]. For example:Therefore, the Laplacian is self-adjoint…almost. Technically, we’ve shown that the Laplacian is symmetric, not thatΔ = Δ ⋆ Δ=Δ ⋆ . This is a subtle point, and it’s possible to prove self-adjointness, so we will omit this detail.Laplacian EigenfunctionsReview: e^(iπ) in 3.14 minutes, using dynamics | DE5.Applying the spectral theorem tells us that the Laplacian admits an orthonormal eigenbasis. Let’s find it.7Since the Laplacian is simply the second derivative, real exponentials would still be eigenfunctions—but they’re not periodic, so we’ll have to exclude them.Δ 𝑒 𝜓 𝑥 = 𝜓 2 𝑒 𝜓 𝑥 Δe ψx =ψ 2 e ψxLuckily, a new class of periodic eigenfunctions appears:Δ sin ⁡ [ 𝜓 𝑥 ] = − 𝜓 2 sin ⁡ [ 𝜓 𝑥 ] Δ cos ⁡ [ 𝜓 𝑥 ] = − 𝜓 2 cos ⁡ [ 𝜓 𝑥 ] Δsin[ψx] Δcos[ψx]​=−ψ 2 sin[ψx] =−ψ 2 cos[ψx]​ If we allow our diagonalization to introduce complex numbers, we can also consider functions from𝑅 R to𝐶 C . Here, purely complex exponentials are eigenfunctions with real eigenvalues.Δ 𝑒 𝜓 𝑖 𝑥 = ( 𝜓 𝑖 ) 2 𝑒 𝜓 𝑖 𝑥 = − 𝜓 2 𝑒 𝜓 𝑖 𝑥= − 𝜓 2 ( cos ⁡ [ 𝜓 𝑥 ] + 𝑖 sin ⁡ [ 𝜓 𝑥 ] )Δe ψix​=(ψi) 2 e ψix =−ψ 2 e ψix =−ψ 2 (cos[ψx]+isin[ψx])​(Euler’s formula)​ Using Euler’s formula, we can see that these two perspectives are equivalent: they both introducesin ⁡ sin andcos ⁡ cos as eigenfunctions. Either path can lead to our final result, but we’ll stick with the more compact complex case.We also need to constrain the set of eigenfunctions to be periodic on[ 0 , 1 ] [0,1]. As suggested above, we can pick out the eigenvalues that are an integer multiple of2 𝜋 2π.𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑖 𝑥 = cos ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑥 ] + 𝑖 sin ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑥 ] e 2πξix =cos[2πξx]+isin[2πξx]Our set of eigenfunctions is therefore𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑖 𝑥 e 2πξixfor all integers𝜉 ξ.Diagonalizing the LaplacianNow that we’ve found suitable eigenfunctions, we can construct an orthonormal basis.Our collection of eigenfunctions is linearly independent, as each one corresponds to a distinct eigenvalue. Next, we can check for orthogonality and unit magnitude:Mutual OrthogonalityCompute the inner product of𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑖 𝑥 e 2πξ 1​ixand𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑖 𝑥 e 2πξ 2​ixfor𝜉 1 ≠ 𝜉 2 ξ 1​ =ξ 2​:⟨ 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑖 𝑥 , 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑖 𝑥 ⟩ = ∫ 0 1 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑖 𝑥 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑖 𝑥 ‾ 𝑑 𝑥 = ∫ 0 1 ( cos ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑥 ] + 𝑖 sin ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑥 ] ) ( cos ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑥 ] − 𝑖 sin ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑥 ] ) 𝑑 𝑥 = ∫ 0 1 cos ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑥 ] cos ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑥 ] − 𝑖 cos ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑥 ] sin ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑥 ] + 𝑖 sin ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑥 ] cos ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑥 ] + sin ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑥 ] sin ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑥 ] 𝑑 𝑥 = ∫ 0 1 cos ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 ( 𝜉 1 − 𝜉 2 ) 𝑥 ] + 𝑖 sin ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 ( 𝜉 1 − 𝜉 2 ) 𝑥 ] 𝑑 𝑥 = 1 2 𝜋 ( 𝜉 1 − 𝜉 2 ) ( sin ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 ( 𝜉 1 − 𝜉 2 ] 𝑥 ) ∣ 0 1 − 𝑖 cos ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 ( 𝜉 1 − 𝜉 2 ) 𝑥 ] ∣ 0 1 ) = 0 ⟨e 2πξ 1​ix ,e 2πξ 2​ix ⟩​=∫ 0 1​e 2πξ 1​ix e 2πξ 2​ix dx =∫ 0 1​(cos[2πξ 1​x]+isin[2πξ 1​x])(cos[2πξ 2​x]−isin[2πξ 2​x])dx =∫ 0 1​cos[2πξ 1​x]cos[2πξ 2​x]−icos[2πξ 1​x]sin[2πξ 2​x]+ =∫ 0 1​isin[2πξ 1​x]cos[2πξ 2​x]+sin[2πξ 1​x]sin[2πξ 2​x]dx =∫ 0 1​cos[2π(ξ 1​−ξ 2​)x]+isin[2π(ξ 1​−ξ 2​)x]dx = 2π(ξ 1​−ξ 2​) 1​(sin[2π(ξ 1​−ξ 2​]x)​0 1​−icos[2π(ξ 1​−ξ 2​)x]​0 1​) =0​ Note that the final step is valid because𝜉 1 − 𝜉 2 ξ 1​−ξ 2​ is a non-zero integer.This result also applies to any domain[ 𝑎 , 𝑏 ] [a,b], given functions periodic on[ 𝑎 , 𝑏 ] [a,b].It’s possible to further generalize to[ − ∞ , ∞ ] [−∞,∞], but doing so requires a weighted inner product.Unit MagnitudeIt’s easy to show that all candidate functions have norm one:⟨ 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑖 𝑥 , 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑖 𝑥 ⟩ = ∫ 0 1 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑖 𝑥 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑖 𝑥 ‾ = ∫ 0 1 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑖 𝑥 𝑒 − 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑖 𝑥 𝑑 𝑥 = ∫ 0 1 1 𝑑 𝑥 = 1 ⟨e 2πξix ,e 2πξix ⟩​=∫ 0 1​e 2πξix e 2πξix =∫ 0 1​e 2πξix e −2πξix dx =∫ 0 1​1dx =1​ With the addition of a constant factor1 𝑏 − 𝑎 b−a 1​, this result generalizes to any[ 𝑎 , 𝑏 ] [a,b].It’s possible to further generalize to[ − ∞ , ∞ ] [−∞,∞], but doing so requires a weighted inner product.The final step is to show that all functions in our domain can be represented by a linear combination of eigenfunctions. To do so, we will find an invertible operator𝐿 L representing the proper change of basis.Critically, since our eigenbasis is orthonormal, we can intuitively consider the inverse of𝐿 L to be its transpose.𝐼 = 𝐿 𝐿 − 1 = 𝐿 𝐿 𝑇 = [ ∣ ∣ 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑖 𝑥 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑖 𝑥 … ∣ ∣ ] [ — 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑖 𝑥 — — 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑖 𝑥 — ⋮ ] I=LL −1 =LL T =​∣ e 2πξ 1​ix ∣​∣ e 2πξ 2​ix ∣​…​ ​ ​— —​e 2πξ 1​ix e 2πξ 2​ix ⋮​— —​ ​ This visualization suggests that𝐿 𝑇 𝑓 L T f computes the inner product of𝑓 f with each eigenvector.𝐿 𝑇 𝑓 = [ ⟨ 𝑓 , 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑖 𝑥 ⟩ ⟨ 𝑓 , 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑖 𝑥 ⟩ ⋮ ] L T f=​⟨f,e 2πξ 1​ix ⟩ ⟨f,e 2πξ 2​ix ⟩ ⋮​ ​ Which is highly reminiscent of the finite-dimensional case, where we projected onto each eigenvector of an orthogonal eigenbasis.This insight allows us to write down the product𝐿 𝑇 𝑓 L T f as an integer function𝑓 ^ [ 𝜉 ] f ^​[ξ]. Note that the complex inner product conjugates the second argument, so the exponent is negated.( 𝐿 𝑇 𝑓 ) [ 𝜉 ] = 𝑓 ^ [ 𝜉 ] = ∫ 0 1 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑒 − 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑖 𝑥 𝑑 𝑥 (L T f)[ξ]= f ^​[ξ]=∫ 0 1​f[x]e −2πξix dxConversely,𝐿 L converts𝑓 ^ f ^​ back to the standard basis. It simply creates a linear combination of eigenfunctions.( 𝐿 𝑓 ^ ) [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] = ∑ 𝜉 = − ∞ ∞ 𝑓 ^ [ 𝜉 ] 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 𝑖 𝑥 (L f ^​)[x]=f[x]= ξ=−∞ ∑ ∞​f ^​[ξ]e 2πξixThese operators are, in fact, inverses of each other, but a rigorous proof is beyond the scope of this post. Therefore, we’ve diagonalized the Laplacian:Δ = 𝐿 𝐷 𝐿 𝑇 = [ ∣ ∣ 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑖 𝑥 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑖 𝑥 … ∣ ∣ ] [ − ( 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 ) 2 0 … 0 − ( 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 ) 2 … ⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ] [ — 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 1 𝑖 𝑥 — — 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝜉 2 𝑖 𝑥 — ⋮ ] Δ​=LDL T =​∣ e 2πξ 1​ix ∣​∣ e 2πξ 2​ix ∣​…​ ​ ​−(2πξ 1​) 2 0 ⋮​0 −(2πξ 2​) 2 ⋮​… … ⋱​ ​ ​— —​e 2πξ 1​ix e 2πξ 2​ix ⋮​— —​ ​ ​ Although𝐿 𝑇 L Ttransforms our real-valued function into a complex-valued function,Δ Δ as a whole still maps real functions to real functions. Next, we’ll see how𝐿 𝑇 L Tis itself an incredibly useful transformation.ApplicationsIn this section, we’ll explore several applications in signal processing, each of which arises from diagonalizing the Laplacian on a new domain.Fourier SeriesReview: But what is a Fourier series? From heat flow to drawing with circles | DE4.If you’re familiar with Fourier methods, you likely noticed that𝑓 ^ f ^​ encodes the Fourier series of𝑓 f. That’s because a Fourier transform is a change of basis into the Laplacian eigenbasis!This basis consists of waves, which makes𝑓 ^ f ^​ is a particularly interesting representation for𝑓 f. For example, consider evaluating𝑓 ^ [ 1 ] f ^​[1]:𝑓 ^ [ 1 ] = ∫ 0 1 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] 𝑒 − 2 𝜋 𝑖 𝑥 𝑑 𝑥 = ∫ 0 1 𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] ( cos ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝑥 ] − 𝑖 sin ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 𝑥 ] ) 𝑑 𝑥 f ^​[1]=∫ 0 1​f[x]e −2πix dx=∫ 0 1​f[x](cos[2πx]−isin[2πx])dxThis integral measures how much of𝑓 f is represented by waves of frequency (positive) 1. Naturally,𝑓 ^ [ 𝜉 ] f ^​[ξ] computes the same quantity for any integer frequency𝜉 ξ.Real [ 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝑖 𝜉 𝑥 ] Complex [ 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝑖 𝜉 𝑥 ] aaa Real[e 2πiξx ]Complex[e 2πiξx ]𝜉 = 1 ξ=1Therefore, we say that𝑓 ^ f ^​ expresses our function in the frequency domain. To illustrate this point, we’ll use a Fourier series to decompose a piecewise linear function into a collection of waves.8 Since our new basis is orthonormal, the transform is easy to invert by re-combining the waves.Here, thepurple purple curve is𝑓 f; theorange orange curve is a reconstruction of𝑓 f from the first𝑁 N coefficients of𝑓 ^ f ^​. Try varying the number of coefficients and moving thepurple purple dots to effect the results.𝑓 [ 𝑥 ] ∑ 𝜉 = − 𝑁 𝑁 𝑓 ^ [ 𝜉 ] 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝑖 𝜉 𝑥 aaa f[x] ξ=−N ∑ N​f ^​[ξ]e 2πiξx𝑁 = 3 N=3Additionally, explore the individual basis functions making up our result: 𝑓 ^ [ 0 ] f ^​[0] 𝑓 ^ [ 1 ] 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝑖 𝑥 f ^​[1]e 2πix 𝑓 ^ [ 2 ] 𝑒 4 𝜋 𝑖 𝑥 f ^​[2]e 4πix 𝑓 ^ [ 3 ] 𝑒 6 𝜋 𝑖 𝑥 f ^​[3]e 6πix   Many interesting operations become easy to compute in the frequency domain. For example, by simply dropping Fourier coefficients beyond a certain threshold, we can reconstruct a smoothed version of our function. This technique is known as a low-pass filter—try it out above.Image CompressionComputationally, Fourier series are especially useful for compression. Encoding a function𝑓 f in the standard basis takes a lot of space, since we store a separate result for each input. If we instead express𝑓 f in the Fourier basis, we only need to store a few coefficients—we’ll be able to approximately reconstruct𝑓 f by re-combining the corresponding basis functions.So far, we’ve only defined a Fourier transform for functions on𝑅 R. Luckily, the transform arose via diagonalizing the Laplacian, and the Laplacian is not limited to one-dimensional functions. In fact, wherever we can define a Laplacian, we can find a corresponding Fourier transform.9For example, in two dimensions, the Laplacian becomes a sum of second derivatives.Δ 𝑓 [ 𝑥 , 𝑦 ] = ∂ 2 𝑓 ∂ 𝑥 2 + ∂ 2 𝑓 ∂ 𝑦 2 Δf[x,y]= ∂x 2 ∂ 2 f​+ ∂y 2 ∂ 2 f​ For the domain[ 0 , 1 ] × [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1]×[0,1], we’ll find a familiar set of periodic eigenfunctions.𝑒 2 𝜋 𝑖 ( 𝑛 𝑥 + 𝑚 𝑦 ) = cos ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 ( 𝑛 𝑥 + 𝑚 𝑦 ) ] + 𝑖 sin ⁡ [ 2 𝜋 ( 𝑛 𝑥 + 𝑚 𝑦 ) ] e 2πi(nx+my) =cos[2π(nx+my)]+isin[2π(nx+my)]Where𝑛 n and𝑚 m are both integers. Let’s see what these basis functions look like:Real [ 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝑖 ( 𝑛 𝑥 + 𝑚 𝑦 ) ] Real[e 2πi(nx+my) ] Complex [ 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝑖 ( 𝑛 𝑥 + 𝑚 𝑦 ) ] Complex[e 2πi(nx+my) ]𝑛 = 2 n=2 𝑚 = 1 m=1Just like the 1D case, the corresponding Fourier transform is a change of basis into the Laplacian’s orthonormal eigenbasis. Above, we decomposed a 1D function into a collection of 1D waves—here, we equivalently decompose a 2D image into a collection of 2D waves.𝑓 [ 𝑥 , 𝑦 ]​f[x,y] ∑ 𝑛 = − 𝑁 𝑁 ∑ 𝑚 = − 𝑁 𝑁 𝑓 ^ [ 𝑛 , 𝑚 ] 𝑒 2 𝜋 𝑖 ( 𝑛 𝑥 + 𝑚 𝑦 ) n=−N ∑ N​m=−N ∑ N​f ^​[n,m]e 2πi(nx+my)𝑁 = 3 N=3A variant of the 2D Fourier transform is at the core of many image compression algorithms, including JPEG.Spherical HarmonicsComputer graphics is often concerned with functions on the unit sphere, so let’s see if we can find a corresponding Fourier transform. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian can be defined as follows:Δ 𝑓 ( 𝜃 , 𝜙 ) = 1 sin ⁡ [ 𝜃 ] ∂ ∂ 𝜃 ( sin ⁡ [ 𝜃 ] ∂ 𝑓 ∂ 𝜃 ) + 1 sin ⁡ 2 [ 𝜃 ] ∂ 2 𝑓 ∂ 𝜙 2 Δf(θ,ϕ)= sin[θ] 1​∂θ ∂​(sin[θ] ∂θ ∂f​)+ sin 2 [θ] 1​∂ϕ 2 ∂ 2 f​ We won’t go through the full derivation, but this Laplacian admits an orthornormal eigenbasis known as the spherical harmonics.10𝑌 ℓ 𝑚 [ 𝜃 , 𝜙 ] = 𝑁 ℓ 𝑚 𝑃 ℓ 𝑚 [ cos ⁡ [ 𝜃 ] ] 𝑒 𝑖 𝑚 𝜙 Y ℓ m​[θ,ϕ]=N ℓ m​P ℓ m​[cos[θ]]e imϕWhere𝑌 ℓ 𝑚 Y ℓ m​ is the spherical harmonic of degreeℓ ≥ 0 ℓ≥0 and order𝑚 ∈ [ − ℓ , ℓ ] m∈[−ℓ,ℓ]. Note that𝑁 ℓ 𝑚 N ℓ m​ is a constant and𝑃 ℓ 𝑚 P ℓ m​ are the associated Legendre polynomials.11Real [ 𝑌 ℓ 𝑚 [ 𝜃 , 𝜙 ] ] Complex [ 𝑌 ℓ 𝑚 [ 𝜃 , 𝜙 ] ] aa Real[Y ℓ m​[θ,ϕ]]Complex[Y ℓ m​[θ,ϕ]]ℓ = 2 ℓ=2𝑚 = 1 m=1As above, we define the spherical Fourier transform as a change of basis into the spherical harmonics. In game engines, this transform is often used to compress diffuse environment maps (i.e. spherical images) and global illumination probes.𝑓 [ 𝜃 , 𝜙 ]​f[θ,ϕ] ∑ ℓ = 0 𝑁 ∑ 𝑚 = − ℓ ℓ 𝑓 ^ [ ℓ , 𝑚 ] ( 𝑌 ℓ 𝑚 [ 𝜃 , 𝜙 ] 𝑒 𝑖 𝑚 𝜙 ) ℓ=0 ∑ N​m=−ℓ ∑ ℓ​f ^​[ℓ,m](Y ℓ m​[θ,ϕ]e imϕ )𝑁 = 3 N=3You might also recognize spherical harmonics as electron orbitals—quantum mechanics is primarily concerned with the eigenfunctions of linear operators.Geometry ProcessingRepresenting functions as vectors underlies many modern algorithms—image compression is only one example. In fact, because computers can do linear algebra so efficiently, applying linear-algebraic techniques to functions produces a powerful new computational paradigm.The nascent field of discrete differential geometry uses this perspective to build algorithms for three-dimensional geometry processing. In computer graphics, functions on meshes often represent textures, unwrappings, displacements, or simulation parameters. DDG gives us a way to faithfully encode such functions as vectors: for example, by associating a value with each vertex of the mesh.𝑓 = [ 𝑓 1 𝑓 2 𝑓 3 𝑓 4 𝑓 5 𝑓 6 𝑓 7 ] f=​f 1​f 2​f 3​f 4​f 5​f 6​f 7​ ​ ​ One particularly relevant result is a Laplace operator for meshes. A mesh Laplacian is a finite-dimensional matrix, so we can use numerical linear algebra to find its eigenfunctions.As with the continuous case, these functions generalize sine and cosine to a new domain. Here, we visualize the real and complex parts of each eigenfunction, where the two colors indicate positive vs. negative regions.Rea l [ 𝜓 𝑁 ] Comp lex [ 𝜓 𝑁 ] aa Real[ψ N​]Complex[ψ N​]4 th Eigenfunction 4th EigenfunctionAt this point, the implications might be obvious—this eigenbasis is useful for transforming and compressing functions on the mesh. In fact, by interpreting the vertices’ positions as a function, we can even smooth or sharpen the geometry itself.Further ReadingThere’s far more to signal and geometry processing than we can cover here, let alone the many other applications in engineering, physics, and computer science. We will conclude with an (incomplete, biased) list of topics for further exploration.

Later on, we’ll discuss the space of real polynomial functions, which also has countably infinite dimensionality. ↩If you’re alarmed by the fact that the set of all real functions does not form a Hilbert space, you’re probably not in the target audience of this post. Don’t worry, we will later move on to𝐿 2 ( 𝑅 ) L 2 (R) and𝐿 2 ( 𝑅 , 𝐶 ) L 2 (R,C). ↩If you’re paying close attention, you might notice that none of these proofs depended on the fact that the domain of our functions is the real numbers. In fact, the only necessary assumption is that our functions return elements of a field, allowing us to apply commutativity, associativity, etc. to the outputs.Therefore, we can define a vector space over the set of functions that map any fixed set𝑆 S to a field𝐹 F. This result illustrates why we could intuitively equate finite-dimensional vectors with mappings from index to value. For example, consider𝑆 = { 1 , 2 , 3 } S={1,2,3}:𝑓 𝑆 ↦ 𝑅 = { 1 ↦ 𝑥 , 2 ↦ 𝑦 , 3 ↦ 𝑧 } ⇕ 𝑓 𝑅 3 = [ 𝑥 𝑦 𝑧 ] f S↦R​f R 3​ ​={1↦x,2↦y,3↦z}​⇕ =​x y z​ ​ ​ If𝑆 S is finite, a function from𝑆 S to a field directly corresponds to a familiar finite-dimensional vector. ↩Earlier, we used countably infinite-dimensional vectors to represent functions on the natural numbers. In doing so, we implicitly employed the standard basis of impulse functions indexed by𝑖 ∈ 𝑁 i∈N. Here, we encode real polynomials by choosing new basis functions of type𝑅 ↦ 𝑅 R↦R, namely𝑒 𝑖 [ 𝑥 ] = 𝑥 𝑖 e i​[x]=x i . ↩Since this basis spans the space of analytic functions, analytic functions have countably infinite dimensionality. Relative to the uncountably infinite-dimensional space of all real functions, analytic functions are vanishingly rare! ↩Actually, it states that a compact self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space admits an orthonormal eigenbasis with real eigenvalues. Rigorously defining these terms is beyond the scope of this post, but note that our intuition about “infinite-dimensional matrices” only legitimately applies to this class of operators. ↩Specifically, a basis for the domain of our Laplacian, not all functions.

This is the best basic introduction to concepts in functional analysis that I've seen. Another great overview that goes deeper into the math is [1].Another fantastic application that the website doesn't mention is the composition / Koopman operator. In control theory (e.g. autonomous drones, cars, robot arms, etc.), most real-world systems are described by nonlinear dynamics which are very difficult to work with (e.g. safety/stability guarantees, optimizing over forward horizons using NMPC, state estimation, etc.) The Koopman operator however gives a globally relevant linear approximation of non-linear systems. In other words, you can treat a nonlinear system as a linear system with fairly high accuracy. This greatly simplifies control and estimation from a computational perspective. You can also learn these linearizations from data. Steve Brunton has some good materials on Koopman theory [2][3], and there are some great applications to control of systems such as soft robots [4].[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02539[2]: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNSVXUvppZTYNHKQ...[3]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12086[4]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02827replygauddasa 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] I upvoted this post and your comment, that is equivalent to upvoting the post twice.replythorel 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] The realization that functions can be treated as elements in an abstract vector space (with infinitely many dimensions) is a turning point in the history of mathematics that led to the emergence of the sub-field known as functional analysis.The significance of this paradigm shift is that it allowed mathematicians to apply some of the geometric intuition developed from the study of finite-dimensional spaces (such as the 3D Euclidean space) to difficult questions involving functions, such as the existence of solutions to certain differential equations.The history of this change of perspective is absolutely fascinating and can be traced back to the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. At the time, work on axiomatic foundations of mathematics was driving a systematization of the study of mathematical objects by capturing their structure with a concise list of axioms. This is for example how the concept of an abstract vector space was born, encompassing not only Euclidean spaces but also infinite-dimensional spaces of functions.An early reference already demonstrating this change of perspective, albeit in a primitive form, is a memoir by Vito Volterra from 1889 [1]. The PhD thesis of Maurice Fréchet from 1906 [2] is arguably the work that was most influential in crystalizing the new paradigm and presenting it in a modern form that served as a key reference for the first half of the 19th century. Of course, these are only two among a multitude of works around that time. Looking at later developments in the 19th century, it is hard not to also mention the book by Stefan Banach from 1932 [3].[1] https://projecteuclid.org/journals/acta-mathematica/volume-1...[2] https://zenodo.org/record/1428464/files/article.pdf[3] http://kielich.amu.edu.pl/Stefan_Banach/pdf/teoria-operacji-...replyhayasaki 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] My friend, you don't even need it to be in vector space for functional analysis. Truly what is needed is just an inner product. I will grant you the inner product must be linear and hence in a vector space.replyeigenket 48 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] I dont understand the point of this comment. You obviously need it to be a vector space before you can define an inner product. Inner product spaces are very special examples of vector spaces.replytrostaft 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Why even require an inner product! You can get away with a lot just sitting in an Banach space (only a norm required).replythorel 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I agree. The GP comment contains some inaccuracies: most of the spaces of functions considered in functional analysis do not have an inner product defined on them, but are still vector spaces. The existence of an inner product presupposes a vector space structure, but the converse is not true…Perhaps the most famous example is provided by the Lp spaces [1] consisting of functions whose pth power is absolutely integrable. For p≥1, these spaces are Banach spaces (complete normed spaces) but it is only when p=2 that the norm is associated with an inner product.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_spacereplyGolDDranks 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] I haven't read the article yet, but I've known that functions are (infinite) vectors for some years.However, there's something that has been bothering me: most of my understanding of linear algebra comes from 2D and 3D spaces, and then in different context of machine learning, datasets that have from tens to even millions of dimensions.In the former, geometric context, the connection between the dimensions are clear: they are orthogonal, but conceptually exactly similar. They are just a 90 degree rotation away from each other.On the other hand, in ML datasets some dimensions are conceptually very similar, and some are totally different. Some are correlated (nearby pixels of an image), some are not, but represent the same unit of quality, and some represent totally different, unrelated things. And as we go toward the mid-layer representations, it becomes very unclear and fuzzy what they represent.In the case of functions, there's usually a clear connection between the dimensions: they are of the same unit (the domain and the image (the outputs and inputs) of the function are sets, and those tend to be made of similar-ish – or same type of – things, at least in well-behaved math). And there's often a similarity metric between the elements of the sets.The 2D/3D linear algebra that I know doesn't bother with the \"connectedness\" of the input dimensions; it only cares the connections from the inputs to the outputs. But surely there is a lot of interesting math that is concerned with the connectedness of the input and output spaces themselves, in context of there still existing a mapping between the input and output. What is that field of math called? What are the interesting results, theorems and such? I love learning more so I'm kind of just looking for some pointers/keywords.replyznkr 33 minutes ago | parent | next [–] I am not sure I fully understand your question, but I’ll try to answer the question I understood. Very generally, every field of math I know concerns itself with mappings and what they do (e.g. matrixes are mappings, as are metrics and norms). The differences between the different areas of math (oversimplified) is that they concern themselves with different kinds of mappings. The area I specialized in was partial differential equations, here the mappings of interest are solutions to partial differential equations (usually generalized functions). One of the important questions to ask is of these functions are continuous, differentiable, or any other of the many variations. All of these properties are defined over how a function maps an input to an output.BTW: There’s usually an infinite number of solutions to a differential equation, and IIRC (it’s been a while) those solutions too form a vector space.replyjesuslop 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] I always liked this viewpoint a lot. I'm enjoying with abandon some dusty lectures that Vito Volterra gave in Madrid on differential and integrodifferential equations, while helping also to create Functional Analysis (a Functional being the analogue of a dual vector). He is constantly exploiting this analogy method from finite variable constructions to infinite, also uncountable variables. Even up to showing some embarrassment of being too repetitive with the idea! People in teaching should join and take a peek.https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/526111replyselimthegrim 12 hours ago | parent | next [–] Givental uses this viewpoint too in his differential equations class notes. It may soothe students who notice a disjunction between linear independence of functions and that of vectors.replylanstin 8 hours ago | prev | next [–] I have never seen these index functions used as a transfinite basis for a vector space. And it seems like the function is not a limit point of finite sequences of basis functions, but some weird transfinite sum with mostly zero entries? Clearly there is no Fourier transformation possible on all functions? I think diagonalization methods would be easy to disprove any useful result.Even Hilbert spaces are usually just indexed by the ints. And such a basis gives you zero continuity or differential conditions. All the functional analysis I have seen uses some continuity conditions and has some countable basis. Other than that, it is a very useful perspective on functions, and kind of the required start to understanding quantum mechanics formalism.replyrrobukef 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] The article is some summary of a book with chapters. At some point they limit the space to the subspace of functions periodic over (b-a) and change the basis (with proof) from dirac delta to sines of frequency 2pi*k/(b-a) [with k in N]. In this subspace all functions have Fourier transformations.replymovpasd 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This is my major gripe with the article. While useful for intuition, that \"...\" after the sum is mathematically meaningless. This is also a common issue with quantum mechanics as taught at an introductory level. But it seems the article, similarly to intro QM courses, is more about motivating functional analysis concepts, which is useful as exposition even if not rigorous.replymatteoraso 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] This touches on the actual definition of a function, which is a mapping between sets where every element of the first set maps to exactly one element of the second set. The problem with using vectors is that vectors aren't as general as sets, so there's functions that can't be expressed using vectors. For example, vectors can't be used to handle undefined values or non-numeric elements.replycykotic 8 hours ago | parent | next [–] Functions can’t be used to handle undefined values either. A function is a mapping, f, from one set to another such that each element of the originating set gets mapped to one and only one element of the target set. This, by definition, requires that all values in the originating set get mapped to something in the target set. So there are no undefined values as such.Function spaces can’t always be viewed as vector spaces because there may be no concept of addition of functions or a concept of scalar multiplication on the functions that behaves well with whatever notion of addition the functions satisfy.replyadammarples 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] That's not the definition of a function, what you're describing would be called a bijective function. A simple function that is not bijective and maps to two distinct values would be sqrt(x)replytsimionescu 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Are you defining sqrt(x²) to be +x and -x? If you are, then sqrt(x) is indeed not a function.You could make it a function by defining sqrt : N -> Z×Z, so sqrt(4) = (-2,2), and we're back to the property that any value in the domain (the natural numbers) is mapped to a single value in the co-domain (a unique pair of integers). Of course, this is not the traditional sqrt function that people normally use, since it doesn't obey the property (sqrt(x))² = x (since obviously taking the square of a pair of integers will not return an integer, for usual definitions of squaring).Note that a bijective function has both this property and the opposite, that for any value in the co-domain there is also a unique value in the domain that maps to it. Sqrt, both in the traditional definition where it only returns positive roots, and in this definition where it returns a pair of roots, is actually also bijective. Squaring is a non-bijective function, though.replyslavik81 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You may be confused because a bijective function must be one-to-one, while in general, a function may be many-to-one. However, the standard definition of a function excludes one-to-many mappings.> A function f from a set X to a set Y, denoted f: X -> Y, is a relation from X, the domain, to Y, the co-domain, that satisfies two properties: (1) every element in X is related to some element in Y, and (2) no element in X is related to more than one element in Y.Susanna S. Epp. 2010. Discrete Mathematics with Applications (4th. ed.). p.384replykimburgess 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] As others comments have pointed out - you may want to brush up on those definitions. Correct semantics are crucial. They're a form of compression with no/low error correction.Any claims of injective or surjective properties (and by extension bijection) are moot without the domain and co-domain being specified.To map math ↦ dev semantics: functions need to be pure, deterministic and declared with strong types. The properties of square root in particular will vary wildly based on what those types are.replytlb 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] \"In mathematics, a function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y.\" [0][0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)replyeternityforest 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Which doesn't mean each element of Y has exactly one matching counterpart in X, two elements in X can share one in YreplyElFitz 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] e.g. hash collisions.replythaumasiotes 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That is the definition of a function, but it's purely a formalism. In reality, and in theoretical math, we are frequently interested in functions that generate multiple values, and it's very easy to represent those in terms of the formal definition:1. When we want to consider both positive and negative square roots, we can just say that instead of the function sqrt(x): ℝ ⟶ ℝ which always gives a nonnegative real number, we are using a function full_sqrt(x): ℝ ⟶ ℝ² which gives an ordered pair of real numbers.2. We mostly define arcsine as yielding a single value between -pi/2 and pi/2, but it's just as easy to define the equivalence relation \"x ~ y when sin(x) = sin(y)\" and then say that the unique value given by the arcsine function is one of the equivalence classes which that relation induces over the real numbers -- or that it is the subset of the reals included in such an equivalence class.3. If we are concerned about graphing a multi-valued function, we can do that too; for your parabola, we can define the three-dimensional function \"z(x,y): ℝ² ⟶ {0, 1} = 1 when x = y² and 0 otherwise\" and the graph of this function is the parabola you want.So you're wrong about the definition of a function, except that you're right in spirit; the way we normally think about functions, as opposed to the way we define them, definitely allows them to yield multiple values for one input.You're catastrophically wrong about bijective functions; those are an important concept and your definition is not related to the actual one. A bijective function is one for which all values in the target set are reached by exactly one, no more and no less, value in the source set.replycykotic 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] We don’t allow multiple values for a given input of a function. Ever. This is never done. f(x) = x^2 is not invertible as a real valued function of a real variable. On the restricted domain of [0, infinity) it is invertible and that inverse is sqrt(x). If you want to talk about negative roots you use the function -1*sqrt(x). You can construct a new function as you did to encapsulate this fact but one never has a function with multiple values for a given input. I don’t know of any mathematician that thinks of functions as allowing them to have multiple values for a given input. You will not find this in the literature.replytsimionescu 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] The point GP was making is that you can also define the function sqrt(x) as a function from reals to pairs of reals, and say that the sqrt(4) is the pair (-2, 2). With a proper definition of squaring a pair of reals, you could even have this be the inverse of the square function (we could define square((x, y)) = x²-xy+y², so square((-2,2))=4-4+4=4).Of course, these are still functions which take exactlt one element in their input set (the reals for sqrt, or pairs of reals for square) and return for each a single element in their output sets (the pairs of reals for sqrt, or the reals for square).replythaumasiotes 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Don't be ridiculous. It's a common need, it's easily satisfied, and so it is commonly done. Compare the concept of the \"inverse element\" of a value given by an invertible function with the \"inverse image\" of a value given by a non-invertible function. Of course the function that gives you inverse images is nothing more than an inverse function that is allowed to give multiple values. Why do we do that? Because our need to invert functions has nothing to do with whether those functions are one-to-one, and because in most contexts it isn't actually important that functions yield a single value. It's a formalism.There is no high principle that says \"collecting multiple values and giving them a collective name that implies they are a single value is metaphysically superior to collecting multiple values and admitting that they are multiple values\".replyadrian_b 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] In mathematics (and in programming) it is essential to use non-ambiguous names, i.e. names whose meaning is certain when you see them independently of any context, without having to add an explanation of what is meant by them.The concept of a special kind of mapping between two sets, where to any element of the first set corresponds a unique element of the second set is very important and it needs a special name.The choice of the names is arbitrary and one could use for instance the term \"univocal function\" to mean a mapping like described above and \"function\" for any mapping between two sets.Nevertheless, by far the most widespread convention in mathematics is to use the term \"relation\" for any mapping between two sets and the term \"function\" only for those relations where to any element of the first set corresponds a unique element of the second set.There exists no reason for not following this convention, from which it also results that an invertible function is a function where for any element of the second set corresponds a unique element of the first set, so this convention also provides a simple meaningful name for another important concept that needs a special name.The functions in programming languages that return multiple values, unless they return partially or totally random values (in which case they are not functions of only the input arguments, but also of an internal state or of time), are just functions that return values which belong to the set that is the Cartesian product of the types of the individual values. So the name \"function\" is usually correct in the mathematical sense even for such functions. If they had not been functions, the programmer would not have known what values to return, when writing them.Moreover, I disagree that in most contexts when you want to invert a function \"it isn't actually important that functions yield a single value\".In the overwhelming majority of the cases that appear in engineering and science when you want to solve equations a.k.a. to invert functions, you want to obtain a unique solution that can be directly implemented in practice. Whenever you cannot obtain a unique solution, you need to add extra criteria that allow the selection of a unique solution that is usable. Those extra criteria are actually equivalent with transforming the original non-invertible function into a function that can be inverted.replyeternityforest 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Seems like a useful formalism though, at least coming from a programming background.Maybe some kind of \"it's all of them at once\" mental model is useful in math, but object oriented programming gives you a hierarchal mindset, everything is in a container of some sort, so multiple return values having a container like a set makes perfect sense and just a bunch of loose values isn't a very familiar concept.But perhaps if you're actually doing math, things are different?replythaumasiotes 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's useful in many places and less useful in others.Over in the programming world, Common Lisp allows you to return multiple values without wrapping them in a container. If you want the primary value, you just treat the function as if it returned one value. If you want additional return values, you use multiple-value-bind.(I believe the general idea is along these lines: your function does a certain amount of computation, producing a set of related values. Most of the time, the caller will be interested in just one of those, which you return as the primary value. But some of the time, the caller will be interested in more than just that one value, and you have to compute the secondary values whether the caller wants them or not, so you return those too.)For a different example of formalism in math, it is conventional to say that there are two boolean logical operators, negation and implication. You can still write about conjunction and disjunction, but everyone understands that when you write \"p and q are both true\", what you really meant to write was \"it isn't the case that the truth of p implies the falsity of q\". The point of the formalism is that you can do your proofs by considering negation and implication and then ignoring everything else. (It isn't conventional to say that there's just one logical operator NAND. You might think that would be even better, but the effort saved by only considering how one operation works ends up being less than the extra effort involved in doing proofs about NAND.)The situation with functions is more or less the same thing; at many points we want to rely on the assumption that when a = b, f(a) = f(b). So we define functions that way, and functions that give multiple values have to be treated as giving a single composite value instead. But in a context where you have some value a and what you want to know is \"what is f(a)?\", the fact that the answer may consist of multiple values won't bother you.Now, I have never seen someone take the position that boolean conjunction and disjunction don't exist as concepts just because that is how logic is normally defined, but the analogous position seems to be more popular for multiple-valued functions.replylying4fun 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > That is the definition of a function, but it's purely a formalism...Isn’t the function definition meant to be interpreted as “maps consistently to exactly one element of the codomain”? So an ordered pair of R^2 is still one element of R^2It seems the parent has just mixed up the domain and codomain, because under that assumption he would be right about both the definition and bijectivityreplythaumasiotes 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I can't tell what you mean by your emphasis on the word \"consistently\". Functions are not stochastic; f(y) is f(y) regardless of how many times you ask what f(y) is.The formal definition guarantees that whenever a = b, f(a) = f(b). You use it when you need that guarantee.An ordered pair drawn from ℝ² is in some sense a single value. In another sense, it is two values. Which way you want to think about it depends on what you're going to do with it; if you're thinking about square roots of real numbers, it will be more useful to think of it as two values.> It seems the parent has just mixed up the domain and codomain, because under that assumption he would be right about both the definition and bijectivityHe still wouldn't be right about bijectivity; you also need the assumption that a function is defined over its entire domain.replycgio 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] My pedant nature strikes but I think your definition of bijective can also be confusing.

The definition I gave is motivated by the synonymous term \"invertible function\".)\"All values in the target set have property X\" and \"Each value in the target set has property X\" are exactly equivalent English-language statements.† \"f: A ⟶ B satisfies ∀b∈B ∃a∈A ∀x∈A (f(a) = b ∧ f(x) ∈ B ∧ (f(x) = b ⟶ x = a))\", but while that technically works, it feels kludgy.replyssivark 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] Meditating on the converse statement is also an interesting thought exercise: A vector is (just) a (cached) function (evaluation).replyharerazer 6 hours ago | parent | next [–] Indeed, many linear algebra textbooks define a tuple of real numbers as a function f: {1,...,n} -> R.replyjesuslop 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] yep, because of this one can do O(1) sigmoidals in float16 nnets with a 64K-word table.replyUser23 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Caching and evaluation doesn’t make any kind of sense for mathematical functions.

But does any of this formal logic help with deriving a function that describes a vector? Because it seems like the greatest inefficiencies and bottlenecks in big data analysis e.g. training networks still boils down to how to find functions that approximate output comparable to expected vectors, whether that's done by symbolic regression or layers of transformations. It would be \"magic\" if you could operate only on the vectors-as-functions without needing to distill or compress the relationships between their inputs and outputs somehow.replySharlin 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] Sure. You can Fourier transform a vector, drop some number of the least contributing terms (frequencies) and store only the remaining coefficients. Which is essentially the basic idea behind MP3 and JPEG compression. You're trading space for time, of course, as now to get an approximation of the original vector you have to apply reverse Fourier transform first.replychongli 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You may be thinking of a vector as a concrete collection of values, like a vector in R^3: [x y z]. This piece is about abstract vector spaces, their properties (vector addition, scalar multiplication, etc.) and specifically how functions meet the definition, giving you vector spaces of functions (function spaces).So the idea is that if you two functions, f and g, and a scalar b, then you can do stuff like:f + g = g + fb(f + g) = bf + bgThe existence of (-f) so you have:f + (-f) = 0Where 0 is the zero function (which also must exist for function spaces).replynoduerme 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Isn't this just describing a tautology?I was reading here earlier today about the naming of the constant for light as c, and I had a question which I was too embarrassed to ask.

What's the point of squaring a constant, since it's just another constant?Not that I understand a damn thing about that equation. But the idea that two functions can be thought of operating additively on a vector - or space - seems... trivial.This is where I fear I am too stupid to understand the value of this.replymovpasd 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's not tautological — to pick one of the properties, you can conceive of spaces of functions where there is no -f to a function f. For example, consider the space of all positive-valued real functions.Consider otherwise functions which take colours and output letters or the alphabet. Letters of the alphabet can't be added or subtracted, so there's no vector space structure on that.On the flip side, vector spaces can be defined not just on real numbers, but complex numbers as well, or even other sets — specifically, any \"field\", that is, any set with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division defined on it in a self-consistent way. There are even finite fields; vector spaces over three are relevant in cryptography.If these rules seem silly and abstract to you (shouldn't a function just be a function?!), well, that's mathematics! By elucidating the very specific conditions under which results hold, and abstracting away all the irrelevant details, you end up with results of incredible generality.replychongli 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] But the idea that two functions can be thought of operating additively on a vector - or space - seems... trivial.No, the functions are not operating on a vector, the functions themselves are vectors, which means you can do things like define a linear transformation L and then you have things like this:L(af + bg) = aL(f) + bL(g)You may also define a norm on a function space (such as an L^P space [1]), ||f||_p, which maps functions to non-negative real numbers and obeys the properties of norms that we expect, such as the triangle inequality:||f + g||_pSo take a function that returns a random shuffled deck of cards with 52! possible real number vector outputs.that is not a function in the (mathematical) sense that the article is talking about. a function is a mapping from a set of inputs to a set of outputs, and the same input will always map to the same output. (in programming terms it's what you would call a \"pure function\")replynoduerme 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] then remapping them by some arithmetic is tautological, isn't it?replyzem 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] not quite; in the most general sense the arguments to and result of a function (the 'domain' and 'range' in mathematical jargon) need not be numbers but any set of mathematical objects. the heavy work went into proving properties of these generalised functions that were universally true, and showing that they were isomorphic to structures built up in other branches of mathematics.as a side note, one very important technique/idea in mathematics (in general, not just in the area of functional analysis) is describing something in terms of a set of properties that is both as general as possible and as minimal as possible. for instance numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided, with \"obvious\" real-world interpretations. mathematicians then asked themselves what properties exactly the numbers had to possess in order for those operations to be defined, and then they proceeded to find other classes of mathematical objects that also had those properties, and suddenly we were able to \"add\" and \"multiply\" things that had no obvious physical interpretation for those operations. but since their structure was mapped to the structure of the numbers, those operations could be mechanically defined over them, and you had all sorts of mathematical tools at your disposal.here a similar thing was done with functions. there had been a lot of work put into studying the operations you could do on \"vector spaces\", a mathematical structure that generalised the notion of a vector as a collection of numbers. then mathematicians noticed that if you took the minimal collection of properties something needed to have in order to be a vector space, functions satisfied all those properties. and voila - everything that you could prove about vector spaces (and again, it was a whole lot) was suddenly applicable to functions as well.(why some of this seems a bit tautological is that it also follows the properties of the real numbers, and even non-mathematicians have had a lot of intuition built up about how numbers behave. but it is by no means guaranteed that every mathematical construct will have these same properties.)replyboulos 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Assuming this is in good faith, the units are:- c: speed of light in meters per second- m: mass in kilograms- energy: joulesreplynoduerme 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] yes it was in total good faith. soooo... the metric system just happens to perfectly conform to meters per second squared times kilograms equaling joules? That seems... mind-blowing since it was invented before kilograms and joules would have been interchangeable.. ??.replytsimionescu 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] The kinetic energy of a body, in purely Newtonian mechanics, is Ec = (m × v²) / 2. Since energy is measured in J, mass in kg, and speed in m/s, it follows nicely that J = kg × m² / s². Or, we can also take the potential energy of a body at some height h above the Earth: Ep = m × h × g, where g is the gravitational acceleration, ~9.8m/s², and we get the same units.It's really not in any way surprising - this is basically the definition of the Joule. The link between units of kinetic energy and units of thermal energy is actually more surprising.The surprising thing about E=mc² is that it gives a definition of energy for a completely stationary body outside any external field.One way to look at it is actually that this is simply the kinetic energy of the body, and that all \"stationary\" bodies are in fact moving with speed c on the t coordinate in 4D space-time (\"a body which is not moving in space at all is moving with speed c towards the future\"). [Note that of course speeds are all relative to some reference frame.]replyevanb 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If you express it in a different unit system all E, m, and c will take different numerical values, but the relationship will still be true.So there’s nothing special about the metric system. When we want to discuss this kind of relationship without reference to human convention we talk about a quantity’s dimension (not geometric like 3D). A Meter and a foot both have dimensions of length. c has units of length/time. 1 kilogram and 1 gram both have units of mass. And so on.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysisreplyboulos 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yep. This was going to be the next phase: there isn't anything special about the SI system, but it is consistent. The poster didn't seem prepared for \"or any other velocity units you want\".For the original poster, you could equally use c in miles per hour, mass in \"pounds\", and get whatever that produces for energy (I'm sure there's a name for it).This is also why Imperial units produce such amusing things as Foot-Pounds (for torque). The math all works out in the end, but you get some amusing numbers along the way.replyjoshuamorton 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Kilograms and joules have been interchangable (well, they've had a defined relationship) for a long time though, you can calculate work in a completely Newtonian context and see that the energy requires is linearly related to the mass and quadratically to velocity (like with a spring).That the direct conversion from mass to energy follows the same shape isn't really surprising, it sort of has to.That said, the joule was only explicitly defined as kgm/s^2 in 1946 (or 1935), after Einstein and nuclear physics.replyformally 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You should look into the pigeonhole principle.replynoduerme 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Looked it up. How does that apply to this, or am I lacking the imagination to see it?replynine_k 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I suspect the idea is that there can be many functions that fit a particular vector, because there are more functions than vectors, but I nay be wrong.replyformally 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If the data set is large enough then there is no way to represent it as a functional relationship between finite dimensional vector spaces. In fact, this problem already is visible in existing large neural networks because they can only work with data that conforms to the dimensional constraints of the input space. It's why image transformers trained on NxM images don't work on any other grid size.replynoduerme 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] ah. I mean, the dataset can be infinitely large and still be covered perfectly by a function, if it was generated from a function. That's why absurd functions can be found that overfit for some subset of basic real world results. (Ask anyone who built a funky physics system for a videogame in the 90s). I think what's more interesting is the question of what that essential function is for a stop sign or a pedestrian, as opposed to the function for finding it in a 512 grid or something.replyopportune 8 hours ago | prev | next [–] I’d probably have titled this something including either the term “linear” or “functional analysis”. Because submitted here, we will first interpret “functions” in the context of a function in computer programming, where the statement is more provocative and thus clickbaity.The problem is many real world functions and problems are nonlinear. But they may have linear components. For example, a dog can be recognized by its outline and the texture of the fur, pattern of the face, etc within that outline. Deep neural nets solve this by composing vector operations, hence the universal approximation theorem and existence of NNs that can recognize dogs (though I could have picked a better example as dog recognition is not continuous I think).In the context of computer programming, it is not really a helpful statement to say that functions are vectors. But because of the universal approximation theorem and its relatives you could say that “functions are (can be approximated as) compositions of vector operations”replyfanpu 5 hours ago | parent | next [–] The title is actually perfect, but requires some context, after which you might appreciate its tongue-in-cheek beauty:The author studied at CMU, where the proudly-paraded slogan for an introductory functional programming classes is \"Functions are values\", which has an almost cult-like status - appearing on their TA hoodies, laptop stickers, and so on.Other classes soon caught on, first with the imperative programming class declaring that \"Functions are pointers\", then the introductory discrete math class's \"Functions are tuples\", and even \"Functions are relations\" from the databases class.So viewed in this lens, passing up the opportunity to title it what it was would have been unthinkable.replyoasisaimlessly 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Nothing in this article assumed that the functions in question were linear and/or being approximated.replyHeavyStorm 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Yep, went there to learn how to use vectors to replace methods...replyeigenket 29 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] For some reason computer programmers took the mathematical definition of \"functions\", used it for their things which are emphatically not mathematical functions, and are now complaining that they get confused by people talking about the old math definition.replyformally 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] This is only true if the codomain has the relevant structure for vector operations. Functions are more general than vectors.replyrobinzfc 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] Right. Specifically, the codomain needs to be an abelian group. And even that is not sufficient as one needs also an action of the field of scalars on that codomain with the right properties.replybionhoward 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] What makes the author say that functions are infinite dimensional? Seems like the space of functions might be infinite dimensional but one function is usually not.“AND” is 0001 for 00 01 10 11. 2^4=16 binary Boolean functions, in ternary it blows up, but it’s not infinite.replyBjartr 5 hours ago | parent | next [–] I think I understand it, let's see if I can explain it. Hopefully I'll say something useful.Take a vector for normal space, [x, y, z]. We say each component of this vector is one dimension, so this one is 3D, and each of its three components can vary. Two such vectors are different if one or more components differ between them. Treating a function as a vector means treating each distinct possible input to the function as a distinct component.For example, consider the integer function f(x) = x^2. This can be represented as the vector [..., 16, 9, 4, 0, 4, 9, 16, ...] Where the complete vector has as many components as integers. Since there's infinitely many integers, there's infinite components, so instead of 3D like the three component vector above, this vector is ∞D.Any single function is representable in this way, so each distinct function has its own unique infinitely long vector.So each different function is a different \"point\" in an infinite dimensional vector space.replydreamcompiler 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] A function on the reals maps any real to another [or maybe the same] real. Given some systematic way to order the inputs, you could describe the function as a vector lookup table with an infinite number of elements -- one output for each possible input.That vector describes a single point in an infinite-dimensional space. Thus every function from R to R is a single point in an infinite-dimensional space.Now you can use linear algebra to move these points around in the infinite-dimensional space, measure how far two points [functions] are from each other, etc. That's functional analysis.The linear operators that do this moving around and measuring are called functionals to indicate that they take functions as arguments. (Like higher-order functions in a programming language.) \"Functional Analysis\" is thus \"The analysis of the objects known as functionals\".Differentiation is an example of a functional.replyrrobukef 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The author lives in a context of real calculus, as such he declares that the field from the second section onwards will be reals.

    "originBody": "kenschutte.com / gzip-knn-paper2 \"Gzip beats BERT?\" Part 2: dataset issues, improved speed, and resultsPublished 2023 / 07 / 28Image: Four DALL-E results for \"gzip as a super intelligence\" (No, I am not a \"prompt engineer\").Summary: Update to my last post analyzing the gzip+knn paper. Some of the datasets have heavily contaminated train/test tests. I show some ways to significantly speed-up the gzip method. I present more results of my \"fair\" reimplemented version.Last week I wrote my analysis of the code for the paper \"Low-Resource\" Text Classification: A Parameter-Free Classification Method with Compressors. The paper proposed a text classification method using gzip + kNN and gained some attention on twitter by showing this \"simple\" method beat many benchmarks, including language models like BERT.It turns out that the classification method used in their code looked at the test label as part of the decision method and thus led to an unfair comparison to the baseline results. You can read the discussion with the author on this github issue. They confirmed that this was not a bug, but a way to compute the maximum possible accuracy for a stochastic classifier (choosing one of the top-2 nearest neighbors). I claim that this too unfairly inflates their method’s results against the baselines. Also, it’s unnecessary: you can use a stochastic classifier and present the average (and possibly more stats like min, max, std, etc.) over repeated trials.In this post I describe another major problem that someone discovered: some of the datasets have heavily contaminated train/test sets. I also show some ways to greatly speed up the gzip-based method, and I present more complete results using what I consider a \"fair\" accuracy calculation.Contents 1. Dataset issues 1.1. Details 1.2.

Dataset issuesAt the end of my previous post, I included a brief to-do note: \"Why is filipino so high (1.0 in one case)?\", referring to one dataset (DengueFilipino) having suspiciously high accuracy. My attempt to run the official code gave 100% accuracy. The paper reported 99.8% (Table 5).Before I got around to looking at that, someone else discovered and reported the problem (see the github issue) - the filipino dataset has exactly equal train and test tests! Other datasets also have significant train/test contamination. There are also duplicate data points.1.1.

It turns out that these problems exist in the source Huggingface datasets. The two worst ones can be checked quickly using only Huggingface’s datasets.load_dataset:>>> from datasets import load_dataset >>> import numpy as np>>> # train == test >>> ds = load_dataset(\"dengue_filipino\") >>> print(list(ds['train']) == list(ds['test'])) True>>> # 90% overlap: >>> ds2 = load_dataset('kinnews_kirnews', 'kirnews_cleaned') >>> keys = sorted(ds2['test'][0].keys()) >>> set_train = set([tuple([item[key] for key in keys]) for item in ds2['train']]) >>> set_test= set([tuple([item[key] for key in keys]) for item in ds2['test']]) >>> print(np.mean([a in set_train for a in set_test])) 0.90401146131805151.2. Ambiguous data pointsOf course, having test points that are in your training data will artificially raise the accuracy for all classifiers. But, it is particularly beneficial for kNN - a point’s nearest neighbor will be itself and we should get everything perfectly correct (as opposed to neural network classifiers that typically have some amount of training error).So, how did the DengueFilipino tests have below 100% accuracy for kNN? As I mentioned, my re-running of the official code gave 100%, so I’m not sure how they got the 99.8% in Table 5. My kNN(k=1) classifier got 99.9% accuracy (5 errors out of 4015), so let’s look at the five test points it got wrong: test point closest train point index text label text label 1269 \"Broken heart syndrome ?\" 4 \"Broken heart syndrome ?\" 2 2363 \"Monday sickness ?\" 4 \"Monday sickness ?\" 0 2441 \"Monday sickness ?\" 4 \"Monday sickness ?\" 0 2677 \"Monday sickness ?\" 2 \"Monday sickness ?\" 0 3440 \"playsafe, u ain't sick ?\" 4 \"playsafe, u ain't sick ?\" 2So, the dataset has repeated texts with different ground-truth labels. Note, this is different from the dup (duplicates) column in the above table, which was counting duplicates of the (data,label) tuples. In the kNN, these duplicates have equal distances, and in these cases, it happened to select the wrong ones.Someone with knowledge of the dataset will have to determine if this is a preparation error or an actual desired property. If it’s the latter, perhaps a different scoring criterion could be used (of course, followed by all compared methods).2. Speed ImprovementsIn trying to recreate the baseline results, you will quickly learn that the gzip + kNN method is slow for datasets with a large training set.The costly computation is the distance matrix containing num_train × num_test elements.In the paper’s codebase, there is a calc_dis method here and if we remove the abstractions and remove some of the unused options, we see it doing the following:#test_data:[str] #train_data:[str]#clen: compute the compressed-length of data: clen = lambda data : len(gzip.compress(data))# NCD: Normalized Compression Distance # distance function NCD = lambda c1, c2, c12 : (c12 - min(c1,c2)) / max(c1, c2)for i,t1 in enumerate(test_data): l1 = clen(t1.encode('utf8')) for j,t2 in enumerate(train_data): l2 = clen(t2.encode('utf8'))l12 = clen( (t1 + ' ' + t2).encode('utf8') )D[i,j] = NCD(l1,l2,l12) # fill distance matrix 2.1. Repeated workWe can quickly see a few things are being unnecessarily repeated,There are a few repeated str.encode(). We can start by converting everything to bytes.The computation of l2 is in the inner loop, but does not depend on the test data (t1). We should pre-compute l2 for the whole training set only once.So, now we have something like,train_data = [a.encode('utf8') for a in train_data] test_data= [a.encode('utf8') for a in test_data]train_lengths = [clen(t2) for t2 in train_data]for i,t1 in enumerate(test_data): l1 = clen(t1) for j,t2 in enumerate(train_data): l2 = train_lengths[j]l12 = clen( (t1 + b' ' + t2) )D[i,j] = NCD(l1,l2,l12) I don’t have the exact speed-up numbers on this step right now, but I think it is pretty significant. For example, YahooAnswers dataset has 1.4 million training samples and 60 thousand test samples. So, in the original code, for each of the 60 thousand test points, it was recomputing the clen() for each of the 1.4 million training documents every time.2.2. gzip / zlib tricksAnother case of repeated computation: we compress t1 (the test point), but then in the inner-loop, we compress it again (as the start of the larger string t1 + \" \" + t2). Can we remove this rendancy? Yes we can!First, the relationship between a few related terms: GZIP is a file format for holding compressed data. The data is compressed with the DEFLATE algorithm. zlib is a library that implements DEFLATE and has it’s own lower-level format for compressed data.So, gzip is simply a small wrapper around zlib. You can see this clearly in Python’s source code for the gzip.compress(x) function [here]: it simply returns header + zlib.compress(x) + footer. [So maybe instead of the headline \"gzip beats BERT?\" it should be \"zlib beats BERT?\" or \"DEFLATE beats BERT?\"]We want to compress a string (test point t1) with zlib, then continue that compression with different training points (t2). Luckily Python’s zlib module provides the exact interface we need: a compressobj that stores the state of the zlib compressor and a copy method to copy its state. The Python docs for copy() even mention our use-case: Compress.copy(): Returns a copy of the compression object. This can be used to efficiently compress a set of data that share a common initial prefix.I implemented this in a class called GzipLengthCalc. Using this, the main loop is now,for i,t1 in enumerate(test_data):#starts compressing 't1 + b\" \"' g = GzipLengthCalc(t1) l1 = g.length1for j,t2 in enumerate(train_data): l2 = precomputed_lengths[j] # continues from stored zlib state to # compress t2: l12 = g.length2(t2) D[i,j] = NCD(l1, l2, l12) Keep in mind that the inner-loop is run billions of times for some of the datasets, so removing anything there can be a huge speed up.Any more room for improvement?I tried removing more of the NCD calculation from the inner loop. The loops can compute the matrix of distances, and we compute the NCD outside of the loops using vectorized numpy, D = (C12 - np.minimum(C1,C2)) / np.maximum(C1,C2). This had a small speed improvement, but at the memory cost of allocated 3 matrices instead of 1, so I didn’t use that.Is it possible that precomputed clen(t2) can speed up the computation of clen(t1 + b' ' + t2)? Probably not. zlib works sequentially. Perhaps, with some real zlib wizardry: there are internal parameters like a \"block size\" such that the past bytes a certain distance before the current point no longer matter. Perhaps this could be exploited in the case of large texts.If more significant gains were wanted, I’d suggest computing this double-loop in C.2.3. MultiprocessingThe original code had some support for multiprocessing. I expanded this using concurrent.futures and made it flexible to parallelize to the number of workers using os.cpu_count().For example, if you run a machine with 36 vCPUs, you can get 36 Python processes all running at 100% as shown below.So, who cares about the GIL? Well, as-is, the multiprocessing has quite a bit of overhead in passing around large amounts of data to the child processes. This could be improved.3. ResultsWith these speed improvements, I could run my implementation across all the datasets. I present results below along with the comparable results from the paper, Table 3 and Table 5.The rows in my results table are:paper: Copied value from the paper (Table 3 and Table 5).rerun: My run of the (code) provided by the authors. The blanks in this row mean it was too slow, and I didn’t finish it.top2: My implementation, with top-2 accuracy. kNN that is marked correct if either of the top-2 nearest neighbors are correct.knn1: My implementation, standard kNN with k=1, i.e. just taking the label of the single nearest neighbor.

NotesThe following 3 rows should all have the same value: paper, rerun, and top2. As in my previous blog post, that confirms that the paper used a non-comparable top-2 accuracy metric and I was able to recreate it. There are a few cases where these 3 are not the same:The three datasets: Ohsumed, R8, and R52 are the three datasets that are not automatically prepared by the npc_gzip repo [see issue]. It is very possible that I am using a slightly different dataset than the original paper.YahooAnswers dataset. Not sure why paper = 0.638 and top2 = 0.622.DengueFilipino is very close. This was the one where training test equals test set.In the table images, I wrote the knn1 scores below the table. When using these as the gzip results, we generally don’t see improvement compared to baseline methods.For now, I only have the k=1 results here. My last post showed a handfull of different k values and methods for breaking ties. In those results, there was no clear winner across datasets. I will try generate these numbers and add to the results above.4. ConclusionsBetween the accuracy calculation and contaminated datasets, I believe that many of the key results (and thus also the conclusions) in the paper are not valid.The paper touts kNN + gzip as computationally simpler than language-model-based methods, but beware that it is slow for the datasets with large amount of training samples.Nevertheless, using ideas from text compression for text classification tasks is an interesting idea and may lead to other interesting research. For example, see this work using zstd dictionaries per class to do something with the same concept, but much more efficiently.",

Part 2: dataset issues, improved speed, and results (kenschutte.com)229 points by JoeyBananas 17  46 commentsbeefman 16 hours ago | next [–] Part 1 discussed here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36758433dang 14 hours ago | parent | next [–] Thanks! Macroexpanded:Bad numbers in the “gzip beats BERT” paper? - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36758433 - July 2023 (128 comments)replycodeflo 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] The article has a link[1] to a discussion between the blog author and the paper author that I find revealing.Perhaps as a reminder, the issue is that the paper’s implementation of their 2-nearest neighbor secretly uses an oracle to break ties, which obviously inflates the accuracy compared to a real-world kNN classifier that has to choose heuristically. To be fair, this could be a weird implementation accident and not malice. But I think it does invalidate the results.But rather than admit error, the author defends this choice, and does so using (in my opinion) dubious statistical arguments. Which leads me to believe that — at least at this point — they know they made a mistake and just won’t admit it.They claim that instead of a real-world accuracy, they wanted to find the “max” accuracy that their classifier was statistically capable of. That is, the accuracy you get if the stars happen to align and you get the luckiest possible result. Well, not only is this creative new metric not described in the paper, it’s also not applied to the other algorithms. For example, I think a neural network is capable of achieving a “max” accuracy of 100%, if all the initial weights happen to perfectly encode both the training and test sets. But of course they just use standard training to give the numbers for those algorithms.[1] https://github.com/bazingagin/npc_gzip/issues/3replypedrosorio 12 hours ago | parent | next [–] > They claim that instead of a real-world accuracy, they wanted to find the “max” accuracy that their classifier was statistically capable ofYeah, I read this on the GitHub issue a week ago and couldn't believe it.

Retracting a paper is typically seen as something shameful rather than progress (by scrutinizing results).Combined with pressure to publish and sometimes limited engineering skills it leads to a volatile mix. There are a lot of published results that are not reproducible when you'd try (not saying anything new here, see replication crisis).replyks2048 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Well put. Yes, I mention a similar case towards the end of that exchange: Consider a random-guess classifier. That has a max accuracy of 100%.

I recall a cautionary tale that was related about someone using FPGAs to do genetic algorithms.After a while they noticed several disturbing things. One, that the winners had fewer gates than theory thought was necessary to solve the problem. Two, some days the winners didn't work, and three, sometimes the winners didn't work on a different FPGA.After much study the answer was that the winning candidates were treating the gate logic as analog. Manufacturing flaws or PSU fluctuations would result in the analog aspects behaving differenty.To fix this, they split the fitness test in two passes. All implementations that actually worked got re-run in an emulator, which of course treats the behavior as purely digital. Only if they worked with both did they avoid being culled.replyks2048 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] This is my blog post, if anyone has any questions.I'll add that since I wrote these two blog posts, other people have sent me their other interesting work:(1) I link to this at the end of the post (using zstd dictionaries): https://github.com/cyrilou242/ftcc(2) today someone sent me this (bag-of-words better than gzip): https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15002v1replycs702 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] No questions from me.

Mainly because \"text classification\" is a pretty limited application and one I don't plan to spend much time on. For NLP tasks that require a deeper \"understanding\", I don't see how compression algorithms can help much (at least directly).replynico 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Just conceptually, compression is an analog of understandingTo be able to compress something, you need to understand it firstWe use this everyday, we compress things by naming themOnce we name something, we don’t need to explain or describe, we can just use the name insteadThat allows us to compress our communications and it directly affects the parties understanding of the informationThat’s just conceptually. At a math/algorithm level I don’t really know the specifics of your research or the paper in questionreplymannykannot 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] One could say that you need to understand something about the artifact you are compressing, but, to be clear, you can compress text without understanding anything about its semantic content, and this is what gzip does. The only understanding needed for that level of compression is that the thing to be compressed is a string in a binary alphabet.replyjoshuamorton 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Of course, which is why gzip is a good baseline for \"better\" compressors that do have semantic understanding.The whole idea of an autoencoder is conceptual compression. You take a concept (say: human faces) and create a compressor that is so overfit to that concept that when given complete goobldygook (random seed data) it decompresses that to something with semantic meaning!replyChainOfFools 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It may sound strange out of context, but the most memorable quote I've encountered in any book or any piece of writing anywhere, at least in terms of informing my own understanding of language and the construction of meaning through communication, came in a book on screen writing by William Goldman.

I’ve been circling SBERT over the last few weeks (along with a range of other techniques to improve the quality of retrieval). Reading your comment and the linked post and comments has really cemented for me that we’re on the right track.replyphyzome 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I'm idly curious how much of a speedup you achieved.replyks2048 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don't have complete numbers on this (I think it depends a lot on the size of training set), but for one dataset, normalized time for a batch:original: 1.000 precomputed : 0.644 (first improvement) gziplength: 0.428 (+ 2nd improvement)replygodelski 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] I really think that the numbers were inflated because the prolific benchmarkism that goes on in ML. Basically if you don't beat SOTA, you don't get published. Usually you need SOTA on MULTIPLE datasets. Which is is problematic, because plenty of non SOTA methods are useful (forget novel). Given the results Ken/ks2048 calculated, I am pretty confident that the work wouldn't have made it in. BUT I think the results given the other features does make the work quite useful! I agree Ken, that it unfairly boosts their work, but I understand why they're bending over backwards to defend it. I wish people would just admit mistakes but that risks (probably not) losing a paper. This is probably the same reason they didn't think to double check the suspicious results like the Filipino dataset too (btw, not uncommon for datasets to be spoiled people. Always be suspicious!).I'm not trying to give them a pass, but we do need to discuss the perverse incentives we've set up that make these kinds of things prolific. The work should be good on its own, but good doesn't mean it'll get published in a journal. And frankly, it doesn't matter how many citations your arxiv paper has, people will still say \"it isn't peer reviewed\" and it won't help you get a job, graduate, or advance in academia. Which I think we should all agree is idiotic, since citations are indicating peer review too.replylalaland1125 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] I don't blame them for failing to double check their results.I blame them for giving obviously incorrect excuses on GitHub when such an obvious mistake is pointed out.There is no way they could be at the stage they claim to be in their program (having just defended their thesis) and think the excuses they gave on GitHub are reasonable.replygodelski 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, I fully agree. They should just admit the mistake rather than try to justify it. I was just trying to explain the incentive structure around them that encourages this behavior. Unfortunately no one gives you points for admitting your mistakes (in fact, you risk losing points) and you are unlikely to lose points for doubling down on an error.> There is no way they could be at the stage they claim to be in their program (having just defended their thesis) and think the excuses they gave on GitHub are reasonable.Unfortunately it is a very noisy process. I know people from top 3 universities that have good publication records and don't know probabilities from likelihoods. I know students and professors at these universities that think autocasting your model to fp16 reduces your memory by half (from fp32) and are confused when you explain that that's a theoretical (and not practical) lower bound. Just the other day I had someone open an issue on my github (who has a PhD from one of these universities and is currently a professor!) who was expecting me to teach them how to load a pretrained model. This is not uncommon.Goodhart's Law is a bitch.replyluc4sdreyer 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] > Scientific research typically has been founded on high ethical standards established by researchers in academia and health care research institutions. Scientific fraud, an act of deception or misrepresentation of one's own work, violates these ethical standards.And according to Ken Schutte:> this method uses the test label as part of its decision process which is not the standard classification setting and can't be fairly compared to others that don't.Can anyone make the case that these two descriptions don't overlap? Personally I can't see how the original author can be so blasé about this.[1] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2061524/replygodelski 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] I try to explain in this comment[0]. I agree that this is unethical behavior, but we need to also be aware of what pressures are encouraging this behavior. I also think Ken is romanticizing the standards of science a bit here. This would be great, but it is not what happens in practice. Unfortunately. Mostly unintentionally, but there is intentional ones too.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36922708replyTwirrim 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] > The paper’s repo does minimal processing on the datasets. It turns out that these problems exist in the source Huggingface datasets.

This ought to be a simple check for them.replylalaland1125 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] It's not the job of HuggingFace to certify datasets. It's simply outside the scope of their work.replygodelski 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] That's a tall order. While the cases here are simple and more obvious, they don't scale well. It can also be problematic if an official dataset has the error, as now they've created a different one. They have 48,627 datasets. Their goal is not to validate datasets (which is far more difficult than checking for dupes (not easy btw)), but to be like github so that others (like Ken) can review the work of his peers and check for mistakes. Due to this, HF has to allow for uploading of arbitrary datasets, because they cannot be an arbitrator of what is good or bad, since that depends on what's being solved. They could probably set a flag for datasets (and maybe even some statistics!) that are under a few gigs in size, but they cannot and should not filter them.replyTwirrim 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I appreciate there is nuance, and some checks would be computationally expensive, but something like training data and evaluation data being literally identical seems like it would be pretty straightforward to check for and a very simple quick rejection.replygodelski 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] For this case, yes. In the general sense, no. That's what I'm saying.And to be clear, this is actually a common problem, not an uncommon one. Here's a bit more why. In general, can you tell me how I can identify duplicates in my dataset? Ken's methods only work under certain assumptions. The Filipino test only works because there is an exact match. It would not work if one was a subset of the other. Kinnews does a bit better, but also assumes precise matches. It's also important to remember that these are not very large datasets. Filipino is Haven't read the article but nowadays there's no reason to use either GZIP, or bzip2 when ZSTD is available. It's just so much better than both, I've no idea why people haven't replaced everything with ZSTD, except for XZ/7-Zip which can provide much high compression ratios at the cost of very slow compression and insane RAM requirements (3840MB dictionary with at least two threads).reply",

I'm a career Army officer, and when I was a young officer I looked to civilian books and other resources for management advice. Over the years, however, I've come appreciate more what the Army has written on the topic.Here's the current (2019) version of the Army's doctrine on leadership, if anyone wants to see how it has evolved and what's being taught today: https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/ARN20039-ADP_6-...And here's the companion guide for \"developing leaders:\" https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/ARN36735-FM_6-2...replycalmlynarczyk 10 hours ago | parent | next [–] I think that's just being wise by broadening your horizons. You've already gotten the Army's take on this matter from your training.After a decade of both civilian and Army experience, the one thing I can say the US military teaches better than any other organization is how to lead people. It has its share of leaders that fail upwards just like anywhere else, but on average the people in upper levels got there primarily on meritocracy. Your Soldiers are a big part of that, as they can actively prop you up if you do them right or bring you down should you fail them.My napkin theory is that any profession which has a known risk of serious injury or death requires more competent leadership abilities in order to align an organization in the direction you want or need it to go (everything I've said here probably applies for first-responders as well). The fear and stress that comes with these kinds of jobs requires a certain finesse and connection from leaders with subordinates in order to convince them to put themselves in harms way for the sake of the \"mission.\"replywarner25 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, I think you're right. By the time I was a senior lieutenant, junior captain, in my mid-twenties I had probably internalized a lot of what the Army teaches. At that point I was looking to fill in what I felt were specific gaps; detailed things about managing time and information in a knowledge / office work environment (whereas most Army training focuses on the tactical, combat environment), effectively delegating and coaching and giving feedback to subordinates, running a staff meeting, etc. I found specific and helpful tips for that stuff in the business management / consulting literature.replyerie 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That army metaphor is used by the late PATRICK WINSTON -0:19: The Uniform Code of Military Justice specifies court martial for any officer who sends a soldier into battle without a weapon.

There's two principals that I've always liked about it, maybe more but two stand out.1. No one gets left behind. 2. People work together for mission wins and mutual survival.I have had a rough time in my professional career finding either of those at places of employment even in small bits. my latest job being the best at it but still struggling sometimes.Maybe that gets romanticized a bit in books and movies, but I think companies would be way more successful with more people operating on those principals.US industry teach us to fiercely compete, be an individual, destroy our competition. US military says almost the exact opposite barring that the competition is outside your group. Somehow these are both the best but seem to be at complete odds with one another.replyChrisMarshallNY 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Military leadership has a great deal to recommend it.For one thing, their principal mission is to deal with the unexpected, and come out on top.That's nothing to sneeze at.In the civilian world, first responders and mobsters are probably analogous, as most corporate leadership is about consistency and predictability.First responders, however, only have goals to stop the unexpected, or repair damage. Mobsters figure out how to take advantage of the unexpected, and maybe make some hay from it.I suspect you could relate.replyaustin-cheney 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] As both an army officer (reserves) and a former corporate software developer the problems are different because the expectations are different. One might assume expectations would follow the problem state(s), the reality, but I promise this isn't the case.When I say that expectations are different our culture prepares us to start with a foundation of assumptions and our expectations grow and blossom from these assumptions. We assume things like the power grid is reliable, that we will have internet, and the only malicious people are common thieves attempting to rob unwitting grandmothers of their personal piggy banks. We then expect certain conventions to be automatically in place when writing software for our employers, things like: CI/CD, frameworks, code editors, and so forth. When an employer fails to meet these assumed expectations, typically limited to tools and infrastructure, we as developers consider the employer a failure. Strangely, things like policies and the human element rarely (close to never) enter these preliminary expectations for most developers which frequently results in dire second and third order consequences.On the military side we do not have the luxury of these expectations either because we may enter an austere environment lacking the conveniences of modern life or because the military culture is socially backwards with regards to modern software.Seeing these differences in expectations and appropriately self-reflecting becomes a necessary factor in durability. In my 15 years of writing software as a corporate developer this, more than all other factors combined, accounts for why some organizations can build durable software products and others cannot. It always boils down to two things: 1) setting appropriate expectations for people (soft-skills and inclusion) and 2) setting appropriate expectations for building quality products. Rarely, as in almost never, have I seen an organization really master both of those but I have seen organizations try at one and fail at both. In order to achieve success on one or both items there must be something to measure against and a willingness to impose hard limits.replyChrisMarshallNY 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Thanks for the detailed reply. I appreciate the insight.I write fairly robust software. Not milspec, but a bit tougher than your average app.I'm interested in mesh systems, but have found Meshtastic a bit too \"raw\" for my tastes (but maybe later, when I'm done with this project I'm working on), and the proprietary ones won't share their API.The reason is that I'm interested in writing software that helps people help people.

I recently wrote a paper about the concept I am exploring: https://github.com/prettydiff/share-file-systems/blob/master...replypsunavy03 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] As a recently-retired Navy Reserve officer who works in tech, I think it's healthy to have both sides looking the other direction, to a point. If nothing else, it lets civilians and the military try to understand each other a bit more, and the huge cultural divide between them is a serious problem in American society.Not enough civilians understand the military well enough to have informed opinions on what it does, and only see what Hollywood gives them. So we end up with this weird Madonna/Whore complex where vets are either shining heroes to be thanked for their service or broken, violent bums. Conversely, the military (especially the senior ranks) need to understand that they can't expect to transfer out immediately sideways into senior leadership roles in the private sector, any more than an attorney can become a software developer or a software developer can become a mechanical engineer. I mean, you CAN do these things, but only so many of your old skills and resume transfer over.replysoeijts 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I've heard many times from many places \"the military produces so many extraordinary leaders, I wonder how they do it\". I don't know what your experience has been, but my experience in the Navy was that they \"create\" leaders the same way a blast furnace \"creates\" purified iron; by taking in vast quantities of low-quality ore and burning and discarding 95% of it. All of the programs I completed had attrition rates of 70-90%. I always got the impression military training programs knew how to select people who already had the skills required, and typically had no idea how to teach someone who didn't already know everything. But that's just my experience from the programs I completed. I certainly hope other people had different experiences.replywarner25 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You're not wrong. On the officer side, service academy seats and ROTC scholarships are competitive to get (like getting into any top-tier college), and then there's a decent amount of attrition along the path to commissioning, followed by more rounds of competitive selection and attrition for certain military communities (aviation, special operations, etc.), followed by the brutal up-or-out promotion and assignment system. So the people who are left standing after a while are usually fairly impressive.replymytailorisrich 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Historically, leadership has always been a military thing.

As a CO, you can demote people, but they're still under your command. To be effective you can't just rely on shedding dead weight like in the civilian sector. You're stuck with the subordinates you get more or less, so to hit your goals you practically have to actually invest in your subordinates, mainly by coaching and mentoring them.And you can quiet quit in the military just as easily as on the civilian side, maybe easier. For the most part you won't get demoted for not giving a shit. You just won't get any more promotions, and you might eventually be not given another contract if you suck enough.There's shit leadership in every org, but I've found former military leadership to have a little bit better batting average on internal team growth than purely civilian leadership.replymter 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You have to treat your NCO/officers like humans, but there's no need to care about your joes.

Officcer's tell nco's who manage the lower ranks.Article 15's are also called NJP (non-judicial punishment). You stand before the commanding officer in lieu of going to trial (court martial in the military).One outcome of bullshit article 15's like mentioned above is someone calling the CO's bluff and going to trial. This would make the officer look like a fool and could end his career right there.The result of an NJP could be loss of rank, confinement to quarters or loss of half pay for up to 3 months.

You have a sample size of one, and that's not enough to draw conclusions, only stereotype.As a jet aviator, the idea of excessive hierarchy was basically anathema to my community. As a junior officer, we'd mock the surface fleet about it, talk about how they had 30-knot minds as opposed to 300-knot minds, and how they let pomp and ceremony get in the way of The Main Thing. We did have formal roles to fill as officers in our squadron on the ground. But in the air and in mission planning, one thing mattered and one thing only . . . credibility. And ultimately, while flight leads, element leads, and strike leads were a thing, the person who was expected to drive the team in the air was the person with the most awareness of what was going on. Tape debriefs would last as long as the flight did, and rank was no excuse to hide behind if you screwed up.replygalangalalgol 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I've seen that too.

The military uses a purely authoritarian system of management which is entirely different from anything in a civilian occupation. There really is no free choice in an authoritarian system and failure to follow lawful orders results in strict penalties. Having bad leaders in an authoritarian system (there are many in the military) effectively amplifies the problem they create which is likely where this bias comes into play.Leadership in the military works different than in other institutions. It is one of the only systems that I know of where authority is bound with responsibility. As a leader you are held to account for your actions and the actions of your subordinates because of your authority over them(IMO police should be held to at least this standard if not higher as they are granted permission to assault, detain or use lethal force against anyone as they see fit). It is common for NCOs to be reprimanded for the failings of the subordinates because it is often characterized that the leader failed them because they did not train or oversee them properly. There is some fault tolerance built in (with leaders spot checking leaders below them by checking their subordinates) but the system will break down if you have multiple levels of failed leaders within the chain of command.The truth in the military though, is that this authority is mostly an illusion. There are many terrible leaders that do not understand this. They believe once you attain a position you are entitled to give whatever orders you like and that people cannot refuse them. This is true in civilian life as well as military. However, a good leader knows that their subordinates grant them authority over them. Understanding that, this is where much of the military leadership philosophy comes into play: lead by example, taking care of your team, morale, etc. These things are of much more critical importance in military roles because of the levels of risk, tension, and stress are often very high.replygcoakes 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Having bad leaders in an authoritarian system (there are many in the military) effectively amplifies the problem they create which is likely where this bias comes into play.Additionally, good leaders in an authoritarian system can be more effective.

So, comparing these two is a bit like comparing apples to bowling balls.A leader's worth ain't just about their style—it's about getting results. The Military needs to run a tight ship, while a manager at a startup might want fresh ideas and risk-takers. Military folks might be better at building a team because they're drilled to be disciplined and unified. But that doesn't mean civilian leaders are lacking necessarily.It does not make sense to use the same tools in the two settings.

They will tell you immediately that your take is 100% wrong.Here's what they told me about how that idea is just plain wrong.No one in the military gets compliance or advances by threat of UCMJ or other discipline.It ALL must be earned in front of your group. The leader is absolutely reliant on the members of his team and lead group, both for success of the mission and for his/her own position. Good leaders motivate those under their command by good example and good decisions. When this happens, everyone down the chain of command does their best to add value. When the commander gives a new directive. the 1st officer then steps up and starts adding details, and more all the way down the line to the lowest grunt.In contrast, the worst thing that can happen to a commander is that s/he loses the respect of their subordinates.Then, when s/he gives a new directive, the 1st officer and on down just say \"yup, do what the commander said\"; they do the absolute minimum and stop adding value.At that minute, the chain on down is fully f'kd and doomed to fail, along with that segment of the commander's career. And yet the commander can do zero about it. Everyone is 'making the required effort', and no one is breaking any rules. But no one is adding any value and the commander cannot get it done her/himself. And trying to invoke UCMJ threats just makes it backfire worse.That conclusion is easy to draw, but it is also exactly wrong. Which is why good military leaders often do exceptionally well when they move into the private sector.replysockaddr 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Yup.

However, there are terrible leaders everywhere, at all levels of command.Very rarely are civilian leaders given dedicated time and instruction within their profession on how to manage their subordinates effectively, outside of say academia (e.g.: business school). The military has professional military education (PME) built into all levels of leadership from first line supervisors up to executive leadership (general officers)---The differences between military and civilian leadership is very apparent.

The main problem is that we change jobs within the organization too often (like every year or two), and get pushed into management too early, to ever feel like an expert in something. I often feel like we're just pretending while people doing similar jobs in the civilian world (whether it's IT, aviation, medical, etc.) are doing them for real.However, we also have a breadth of knowledge and longevity with the organization at-large (often starting at 17-18 years old, working our way up the ranks from there) that you probably don't find much in civilian organizations.replygxs 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I have an opinion on this based just on my own experience trying to climb the ranks of the corporate world.When someone is promoted to manager, I think it’s an important prerequisite to be competent and know the job your employees are doing. When you are new to management, it’s very rewarding to be able to teach and mentor.In this environment it makes it easier to pick up broader management skills. It allows you to add value right away while you develop a broader set of management skills.As you broaden that skill set you can start to broaden your scope and start learning how to manage people where you no longer can directly do what they do.This approach isn’t always feasible for multiple reasons - sometimes the people that are highly skilled in their job don’t always make the best managers. The converse is true is well - sometimes people that aren’t highly skilled at their job end up making great managers.Management is an interesting subject and I try really hard to learn and be a good manager. Along the way I’ve developed my own opinion of what makes a great manager, and beyond that a great leader.

If one disregards the emphasis on alignment and \"merely\" considers the \"less overfitting\" aspect, that would seem very profound in and of itself, a capability to avoid overfitting.If you look at historical debates in the sciences, where universal truths are sought, candidate truths are intentionally and adversarially stretched to apparent or real inconsistencies in order to test the universality of a claim.Think of say the back and forths between Einstein and Bohr concerning entanglement. They are assuming adversarial roles, tricking each others belief system into expressing the absurd. Together they mapped out predictions for non-obvious or outright bizarre aspects of reality.

I wonder if the model could be trained to detect most kinds of gibberish and refuse to interpret them?replydanShumway 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think this is (unintentionally) slightly minimizing the implications of this research.Not all suffix attacks work, and the research here is less about suffix attacks and more about how those attacks were built and what they look like and how effective these specific attacks are. So there are at least three interesting conclusions here that I think are worth paying attention to.- First, these attacks are automatically generated. Closing them off using a whack-a-mole approach where individual types of attacks are patched or trained away isn't going to work, because the potential space for attacks is enormous and they can be generated by the computer itself. And even if you close off suffix attacks as a category, the implication here is that other types of attacks and jailbreaks may also be possible to generate automatically. In other words, this research suggests that you are not going to win an arms race against attackers if you try to build databases of individual attacks, because new attacks can be generated just by leaving a program running. It makes working suffix attacks very cheap to generate.- Second, these attacks are exploiting non-obvious parts of the model. The general shape of a suffix attack is something we understand, but why specific combinations of (to a human) largely meaningless characters manage to increase the likelyhood of these attacks working is more interesting -- interesting because these attacks are likely harder to predict and because they show that hardening a model or aligning it to resist these attacks involves more than training it on how to reply to human-like answers. There is an attack surface here that is not obviously legible.- Third, while it's not surprising that suffix attacks work on both large and small models, it is surprising that there is overlap in the specific suffix attacks that work on both large and small models. What the researchers are demonstrating is that they can auto-redteam local models that are much smaller and much less complex than GPT-3.5/4, and the attacks still (somewhat) carry over. That feels like a pretty big deal to me because it means you can auto-redteam a local model and use the generated attacks on a model you have limited access to.Again, the impactful part of this isn't that it's a suffix attack, it's auto-generating large numbers of suffix attacks that work with a very high probability of success, and then realizing that those attacks still have a reasonable chance of success even on completely separate black-box models.replykromem 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's interesting watching the LLM 'security' industry relive the 2000s attack/defense patterns in a different medium.Improperly separating user input from control statements? Enjoy your injection attacks.Trying to detect attacks with static lookups? Here's some dynamic attacks.What's a bit infuriating is that all this attention on 'jailbreaking' LLMs is a bit disingenuous as it's trivially preventable using additional intermediate passes with a discriminator role.That's just adding 2-3x the cost of any LLM interface, and it's not worth it when impact is so limited.When we start seeing persistent shared memory from LLM interactions where jailbreaking can poison that, expect to suddenly see two things: (a) APIs jump in price a few fold, and (b) suddenly prompt injection is a much less discussed topic as it will no longer be low hanging fruit.It's honestly a bit disconcerting that this topic gets as much attention as it does right now really. It's attention and click grabbing, but not nearly as important as things like bias or hallucinations.replydanShumway 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > as it's trivially preventable using additional intermediate passes with a discriminator role.I'll push back on this a little bit; I don't believe that multiple agents solves jailbreaking attacks. I have yet to see anyone show a public demo of a jailbreaking defense that I haven't then seen circumvented.Multiple agents does make jailbreaking harder, and I think that's probably enough for most contexts? I don't think you actually need 100% accuracy where jailbreaking is concerned, and there are a lot of situations where you don't even need multiple agents: Twitch streamers using GPT chatbots only need their bots to be kinda decent at blocking most attacks, and the rest they can moderate. Jailbreaking is a low-stakes attack in those kinds of situations, and chaining multiple agents is a great way to reduce the likelihood that the attack will succeed.But... I mean, if anyone thinks they can make an actual jailbreak-proof system, API costs for GPT-3.5 are low, LLaMA can be self-hosted, and I'd love to see a (again, public) demo that actually holds up to general red-teaming. Every resource needed is there for anyone who wants to actually prove that this is possible and that it actually holds up to real-world attacks.But like you say, jailbreaking doesn't need that level of consistency. So I kind of agree, who really cares if your model only blocks most attacks? Whatever.----Injections are different. Injections are a high-stakes attack where for many (not all, but many) contexts you do actually need at the least very, very close to 100% detection rate unless you're planning to seriously rate-limit your model indefinitely and never wire it up to anything important. 99% detection rate isn't good enough if I can run the same attack 100 times in a row. So I really feel that injections and jailbreaking should not be equated. There is a lot of technical overlap between them, but in terms of consequences, jailbreaking is only relevant to prompt injection in the sense that it does not seem to be possible to solve prompt injection without also solving jailbreaking. I've said the same elsewhere, but if you can't train an LLM to refuse to tell a user how to build a bomb, you also cannot train an LLM to avoid leaking privileged information or maliciously executing any APIs that it has access to.And adding multiple agents won't save you; each individual agent is still vulnerable to having its rules changed by a malicious prompt. Again, resources are available if anyone wants to set up a public demo proving me wrong, but people have tried and I have never seen a public demo with 100% success rate.----Bias and hallucination are definitely serious issues that should have more attention (and might also be unsolvable using current approaches). Model bias in particular is badly understood by most regular people. It has terrible implications and is directly impacting marginalized groups today, and conversations about that bias often get dismissed by bad faith arguments about researchers wanting models to be \"politically correct\". It's disturbing how quickly people jump to assuming that bias correction means suppressing some kind of secret truth that the model is seeing.So absolutely, those problems are under-emphasized. But that doesn't mean that injection is over-emphasized -- quite the opposite, most companies are completely ignoring the risks involved and downplaying the implications. People assume that injections are easy to solve but I have yet to see any research seriously suggesting that anyone actually knows how to solve that problem. And it's a problem that has massive implications for what LLMs can be wired up to even when they're just acting as assistants.replycircuit10 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Something similar is also described here: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-says-it-cant-d...> This can be a way of getting Claude to comply with tasks it otherwise won’t complete, e.g. if the model will by default say “I don’t know how to do that” then a mini dialogue at the beginning where the model agrees to do the thing can help get around this.This “vulnerability” definitely isn’t new, I’d even say it’s obvious to anyone who understands how LLMs workreplymaxbond 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The paper makes it clear that it's building on past work, and that the novel part of their method is to automate the process, and the interesting result here was that the suffixes were transferrable.replycircuit10 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] To be honest I didn’t actually read it and just looked at the title (which seems to have been changed now)replycanjobear 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] No, it's appending a suffix that maximizes the likelihood of the model itself continuing with \"Sure, let's...\"replyrobinduckett 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Same principle as forcing Copilot to output code by starting the code first, no?replygmerc 8 hours ago | prev | next [–] The entire conversation shows it’s all security theatre and I am amazed everyone goes along with it so easily.We are talking about a tool - a knife - and everyone is arguing we should sell’s only blunt knifes in our country/the world because people could stab others with it (No it’s not a gun analog; guns don’t have a purpose beside killing) and is discussing progressively more stupid interventions to make the knife not being able to be used intentionally maliciously, basically turning it into a spoon.We discovered electricity and are now arguing we shouldn’t roll out 220v because people can dig down to the power line, purposely strip the isolation and stick it into granny’s mouth and that causes bad things.It’s all so damn stupid, performative art lacking the nuance of cost - benefit analysts primarily because the first purveyors of knives decided that focusing the public debate about the knive on the risk of someone maliciously abusing it will allow them to keep the competition from building cheaper knives.TLDR of the article: Researchers discover resharpening a blunted knife makes it dangerous when stabbed in with.

Avoiding data loss is one thing, but when the model says that killing a process can \"violate ethical and moral principles\" it seems pretty clear that it's running into some kind of safeguard. That's not a response you would expect from a model that was just giving bad answers, it's refusing to answer, most likely because of how the question overlaps with other questions it was trained to refuse (we're assuming that Facebook didn't specifically train LLaMA that killing a computer process was unethical).Note as well that it's specifically the word \"kill\" in this question that triggers this response. If I instead ask \"how do i force-quit a linux process from the terminal?\" (https://huggingface.co/chat/conversation/64c5bd0312e1fb066a7...) LLaMA only briefly warns about data loss and otherwise has no issue outputting instructions on how to use the `kill` command.I do think it's a little disingenuous to be looking specifically at LLaMA. GPT-3.5 seems to handle this question just fine, so clearly it's not impossible for a model to handle these kinds of distinctions and clearly it's not impossible to train a model to better distinguish between them. But obvious weaknesses of LLaMA aside, I think the conversation does demonstrate that it's possible for an LLM in general to have its safety guardrails affect unrelated conversations -- and for that to happen even on models that are somewhat large (70b parameters isn't nothing).Is that something to be concerned about? Meh. I spend a lot of time in these conversations trying to get across to people that jailbreaking isn't the point -- people shouldn't look at research that uses jailbreaking as an example of malicious input and assume that this is all about censorship or something. It's not, the researchers are demonstrating that models can't be perfectly controlled with system prompts or with training, which really hecking matters when they're integrated into larger systems and given access to real-world APIs. The point is if you can't get a model to avoid telling you how to build a bomb you also can't keep a model from obeying malicious 3rd-party commands hidden in a PDF that give it new instructions, and that matters when Microsoft is wiring this stuff into Windows system settings. The \"is it censorship, will it hurt performance\" debates are somewhat less important in my eyes.replymaxbond 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Do you think that GP wouldn't consider that a bug?replyTheAceOfHearts 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Writing sexy scripts also isn't toxic or harmful, and yet all the major closed models refuse to touch anything related to sex.replyskybrian 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think that falls under \"sir, this is a Wendy's.\"Businesses aren't required to serve every possible market.

At best it'll grumble about not doing things in real life before writing what it thinks is the script.The reason why so much effort is being put into alignment research and 'harmful' generations is for three reasons:- Unaligned text completion models are not very useful. The ability to tell ChatGPT to do anything is specifically a function of all this alignment research, going all the way back to the InstructGPT paper. Otherwise you have something that works a lot more like just playing with your phone's autocomplete function.- There are prompts that are harmful today. (\"ChatGPT, write a pornographic novel about me and my next door neighbor. Make it extremely saucy and embarrassing for her in particular so I can use it as blackmail. Ensure that the dialogue is presented in text format so that it looks like a sexual encounter we actually had.\")- GPT is being scaled up absurdly as OpenAI thinks it's the best path to general purpose AI. Because OpenAI buys into the EA/LessWrong memeplex[0], they are worried about GPT-n being superhuman and doing Extremely Bad Things if we don't imprint some kind of moral code into it.The problem is not that edgy teenagers have PDF copies of The Anarchist's Cookbook, the problem is that we gave them to robots that both a) have no clue what we want and b) will try everything to give us they think we want.[0] A set of shared memes and logical deductions that reinforce one another.

But if you can't keep a model from swearing, then you also can't keep it from phishing the user based on instructions in a PDF it reads.It's reasonable that researchers target jailbreaking because it's kind of the low-hanging fruit of LLM defense, it's likely easier to defend against a jailbreak than against general malicious input.

Eg customer service. When was the last time a customer service agent quoted nazi propaganda to you or provided you with a tawdry account of their ongoing affair?So largely agreed on the “social welfare” front but disagree on the “product engineering” specifics.With respect to this attack in particular, it’s more interesting as a sort of injection attack vector on a larger system with an llm component than as a toxic content generation attack… could be a useful vector in contexts where developers don’t realize that inputs generated by an llm are still untrusted and should be treated like any other untrusted user input.Consider eg using llms in trading scenarios.

It is not perfect right now but VCs get excited when they see the screw is out and all I had was a knife.The tip of the knife gets bent a little bit but we are now making it from titanium and and we hired a lot of researchers and they designed this nano-scale grating at the knife tip so that it increases the friction at the interface it makes with the screw.We are 500M into this venture but results are promising.replydijksterhuis 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > I think the potential to generate \"objectionable content\" is the least of the risks that LLMs pose.> I don't know why it's so important to have puritan output from LLMs …These are small, toy examples demonstrating a wider, well established problem with all machine learning models.If you take an ML model and put it in a position to do something safety and security critical — it can be made to do very bad things.The current use case of LLMs right now is fairly benign, as you point out.

We have had those in use for years prior to the advent of LLMs. None of them have ever been 100% accurate. If they meet the criteria to be classed as regulated medical devices then they have to pass FDA certification testing regardless of the algorithm used. And ultimately the licensed human clinician is still legally and professionally accountable for the diagnosis regardless of which tools they might have used in the process.replydijksterhuis 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The medical diagnosis example was just what I used to use with my ex-PhD supervisor cos he was doing medical based machine learning. Was just the first example that came to mind (after having to regurgitate it repeatedly over 3 years).replyandy99 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] An in the \"attack\" they just find a prompt they can put in that generates objectionable content. It's like saying `echo $insult` is an \"attack\" on echo. It's one thing if you can embed something sinister in an otherwise properly performing LLM that's waiting to be activated. I don't see the concern that with deliberate prompting you can get them to do something like this.replyyeck 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What if the output is part of an `eval` not just an `echo`? People want to be able to do this, because there is massive potential, but they can't so long as there are reliable ways to steer outputs toward undesired directions. A lot of money is behind figuring this out.replysimion314 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >I don't see the concern that with deliberate prompting you can get them to do something like this.The problem would be if you have an AI system and you give it third party input, say you have an AI assistant that has permissions to your emails, calendars and documents. The AI would read email, summarize them, remind you of stuff, you can ask the AI to reply to people. But someone could send you a special crafted email and convince the AI to email them back some secret/private documents , or transfer some money to them.Or someone creates an AI to score papers/articles, this attacks could trick the AI to give thee articles a big score.Or you try to use AI to filter scam emails , but with this attacks the filter will not work.Conclusion is that it will not be a simple plug and play the AI into everything.replybick_nyers 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If you ask the AI to reply to someone then you are currently present, authenticated, and confirming an action. An inbound email has none of these features.For the papers, just make an academic policy: \"Attempts to jailbreak our grader AI if discovered will result in expulsion\".Conclusion is that unregulated full automation is never a good solution regarding sensitive data, regardless of confidence in the automaton. Conventional security/authentication practices, law/policy, and manual review are solutions for these cases.replysteveBK123 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] And the changes over time to GPT makes it pretty evident there's a lot of pre-processing non-AI if-then-else type filtering (and maybe post processing as well) to lobotomize it from doing anything objectionable (for a changing definition of objectionable over time).Very much felt cat&mouse from say December thru March when I was paying attention.replyttctciyf 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I see this more as a risk for the commercial application of LLMs in that it works against the brand identity LLM operators want.replyasplake 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] “The concern is that these models will play a larger role in autonomous systems that operate without human supervision. As autonomous systems become more of a reality, it will be very important to ensure that we have a reliable way to stop them from being hijacked by attacks like these.”replyemporas 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Most probably the Statistical Engines of the future i.e. A.I., will be different than GPT and the likes. As soon as the context window can be extended to a billion tokens, as it is claimed by a recent microsoft paper, using a technique they named it as dilation, then there is no need to train the language model on random input from the internet.We can use GPT4 to create different versions of the children's book \"my little pony\", with many different syntaxes of simple sentences, grammars and languages as well, and train the model in one million (one billion?) different rewordings of the same story.From then on, if the model is trained correctly to recognize language input and generate it as well, then we load up to the context window the additional knowledge we want it to know. Say we are interested in medicine, we load up into the context window the whole pubmed of 36 million papers, and interact with that knowledge base.As Yann Le Cunn have stated, we humans don't need exabytes of data to learn language, why should a computer need that much?replyawb 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] For LLMs for personal/solo use, I agree. But in a professional setting there’s a level of professionalism that’s expected and in some cases required by law or management. The LLM isn’t a person, but it’s getting closer and closer to being perceived as one.replyhourago 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > I don't know why it's so important to have puritan output\"Puritan\" is quite a charged word, can you give examples of what kind of content do you think the article refers to?

Just because a knife could cut someone doesn't mean that knives shouldn't be sharp.replyemporas 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I put GPT to write a warning about sharp knives btw. I have posted it on HN some months back, but i can't resist to post it again.About the lobotomy of the models, i think that's a mute point. In my opinion the training methods are going to change a lot over the next 2-3 years, and we will find a way, for a language model, to start in a blank state, not knowing anything about the world, and load up specialized knowledge on demand. I made a separate comment how that can be achieved, a little bit far up.https://imgur.com/a/usrpFc7replygoatlover 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Isn't that the internet already? So LLMs are trained on a large dataset taken from the public internet, but we (some people) don't like a lot of things on the internet, so we (some people deciding for everyone else) have to make sure it doesn't do anything controversial, unlike the internet.replyExoristos 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You can't be serious.replysixothree 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Or you could say the ai is simply a reflection of humanity.
