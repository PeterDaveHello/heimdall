Graffin Professor, an associate professor of Dermatology and a Northwestern Medicine dermatologist. Northwestern Medicine and Brigham and Women’s Hospital scientists have discovered a molecular defect that promotes the pathologic immune response in systemic lupus erythematosus (known as lupus) and in a study published in Nature, show that reversing this defect may potentially reverse the disease. Lupus affects more than 1.5 million people in the U.S. Until this new study, the causes of this disease were unclear. Lupus can result in life-threatening damage to multiple organs including the kidneys, brain and heart. Existing treatments often fail to control the disease, the study authors said, and have unintended side effects of reducing the immune system’s ability to fight infections. “Up until this point, all therapy for lupus is a blunt instrument. It’s broad immunosuppression,” said co-corresponding author Jaehyuk Choi, MD, PhD, the Jack W. Graffin Professor, an associate professor of Dermatology and a Northwestern Medicine dermatologist. “By identifying a cause for this disease, we have found a potential cure that will not have the side effects of current therapies.” “We’ve identified a fundamental imbalance in the immune responses that patients with lupus make, and we’ve defined specific mediators that can correct this imbalance to dampen the pathologic autoimmune response,” said co-corresponding author Deepak Rao, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a rheumatologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and co-director of its Center for Cellular Profiling. In the study, the scientists reported a new pathway that drives disease in lupus. There are disease-associated changes in multiple molecules in the blood of patients with lupus. Ultimately, these changes lead to insufficient activation of a pathway controlled by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which regulates cells’ response to environmental pollutants, bacteria or metabolites. Insufficient activation of AHR results in too many disease-promoting immune cells, called the T peripheral helper cells, that promote the production of disease-causing autoantibodies. To show this discovery can be leveraged for treatments, the investigators returned the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-activating molecules to blood samples from lupus patients. This seemed to reprogram these lupus-causing cells into a cell called a Th22 cell that may promote wound healing from the damage caused by this autoimmune disease. “We found that if we either activate the AHR pathway with small molecule activators or limit the pathologically excessive interferon in the blood, we can reduce the number of these disease-causing cells,” said Choi, who is also a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center. “If these effects are durable, this may be a potential cure.” Choi, Rao and colleagues next want to expand their efforts into developing novel treatments for lupus patients. They are now working to find ways to deliver these molecules safely and effectively to people.

    "commentBody": "Scientists discover a cause of lupus, possible way to reverse it (northwestern.edu)693 points by adamredwoods 21 hours agohidepastfavorite149 comments aroopchandra 4 hours agoI was diagnosed with lupus a few years ago. My mom also had it and passed away after 10 years due to complications. My initial symptoms were severe joint pains, which made daily activities difficult. This happened during the COVID lockdown, which helped me maintain my job. I did a lot of research and tried various treatments. Functional medicines and expensive vitamins didn’t help. I read about long-term fasting and tried different routines at home. I did several 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day fasts. During the 7-day fasts, my pain disappeared, but it returned once I resumed eating. This led me to believe that food was causing inflammation. Previously, I ate a lot of lean meat and occasional red meat. I then cut down to eating meat once a week and ate mostly raw leafy vegetables the rest of the time. My pain would come back after eating meat and decrease over the week. I eventually stopped eating meat entirely and consumed a ton on greens, and within six weeks, I was pain-free. I also tried Benlysta for months, but it didn’t help much. Vegetables seemed to reduce my inflammation more effectively. I stopped taking Benlysta but continued regular blood tests. After a year, my doctor agreed I could stop the medication. I’ve been in remission for the last two years with no pain or inflammation. I hope this helps, though it’s just my personal experience. reply wholinator2 3 hours agoparentI have crohn's disease which is also autoimmune and directly related to ingesting certain things. I think a lot of autoimmunity has to do with intestinal bacteria and their relationship to our innate immune system. And to a lesser extent it seems that almost every aspect of life is effected by what we eat, how we feel, how we act, how we grow and die. Maybe in 100 years we'll have fecal tests and bacteria pills to catch and prevent a paradigm shifting amount of ailments. I know I've tried tons of different diets and exclusions and things. I've got a pretty good list in my head of what i can and can't eat but it seems to change q bit every couple years. I used to not tolerate bread but eat sugar and it seems to have switched some time in the last decade. Anyways, i wish you luck with your journey and I'm glad you've found something that works for you reply nanomonkey 2 hours agorootparentQuite a few of my friend's that were diagnosed with chron's disease found out that the main culprit seemed to be flour and other foodstuff that had been treated with glyphosate (Roundup). After switching to sourdough bread made from organic flours, and similar choices for masa harina (nixtamilated corn) their issues went away. This was after years of not eating anything with fiber, gluten, or nightshades. Their theory was that the herbicides would kill off their gut's natural biome and cause an inability process carbohydrates, fiber and maintain a intestinal mucus layer. YMMV...but just passing along what has worked for a few of my friends. reply datavirtue 7 minutes agorootparentHmmm...I recently had my gut biome die off but could not identify any suspects. I bake a lot. The most noteable thing about the whole experience was how amazing my bowel functions are after having to restore the gut biome. They are functioning far better than the many years before I experienced the die off. I used pills from Amazon that had good reviews (Physicians Choice) with a strict raw vegetable diet, and they definitely worked. I noticed another uptick in bowel function after taking some pills my wife purchased that had more strains. You can't just eat yogurt and dust off your hands. reply novok 55 minutes agorootparentprevThere is also other things like brominated flour which is illegal in brazil, the eu, india and canada but not the USA reply skrebbel 1 hour agorootparentprev> after years of not eating anything with fiber, You mean they avoided vegetables entirely? reply blix 11 minutes agorootparentMy doctor told me after an intestinal surgery that I would never be able to eat vegetables again. reply aroopchandra 3 hours agorootparentprevI got fecal tests and used expensive supplements and vitamins as recommended by a functional doctor, but they didn't help. I looked into how immune suppression medicines like Benlysta work and tried to mimic their effects naturally to get relief and hopefully stop using medicine. I think food can help manage many side effects of immune-related diseases, even if it can't cure them. reply xdrone 33 minutes agoparentprevIn the vegan community there is lost of discussion of animal products causing auto immune issues. A compromised gut lining will let intact animal proteins into the body. The immune sees the animal foreigners but also attacks our body; us being animals too. Type 1 diabetes, aka childhood diabetes, is thought to be from casein in A1 milk; where the immune system attacks the beta cells of the pancreas. Seems plausible to me; rates of dairy consumption seem to correlate with type 1. (see Finland). reply COGlory 3 hours agoparentprevI'm curious if you've looked into N-Glycolylneuraminic acid and whether that could be the issue? Does chicken cause an issue for you? I'm sorry to hear about your Lupus diagnosis, and glad it's in remission. My doctor wanted to diagnose me with Lupus due to the facial rash and arthritis/joint pain, but I came back negative in all the bloodwork, which I think means about 98% sure don't have it. I found that I can treat the joint pain effectively with SSRIs (Fluoxetine, 20 mg is enough to wipe it out after a few weeks). My mother has MCAS and my sister and aunt have UC, so I feel like I'm tripping through a minefield trying to navigate whatever autoimmune issue this is....and I have a PhD in biochemistry. reply aroopchandra 3 hours agorootparentI haven't looked into N-Glycolylneuraminic acid specifically. For me, all types of meats, including eggs, chicken, and lamb, increased my inflammation levels. From what I understand, correctly diagnosing immune diseases can be quite challenging. My doctor once said it’s more of an art than a science. Because my mother had lupus it was easy in my case. While I’m not against medications, they often come with side effects. For example, immunosuppressants are necessary for high inflammation but can increase the risk of cancer. Even SSRIs have side effects. When I had pain, I tried both medications and dietary changes, using an engineering mindset to isolate variables. Although I listened to my doctor, I also took matters into my own hands and did my research. My doctor initially doubted that changing my diet would help but did recommend the Mediterranean diet. He still doesn’t believe that food helped since there’s no clinical research backing it, and it’s not something commonly taught in medical schools. The best part about experimenting with food is that it's easy and inexpensive to test on oneself. In my case, I was fortunate that my joint pains allowed me to observe the effects of my dietary changes within a week or less. Initially, I expected results in a day or two, but I soon realized that I needed to experiment for at least a few weeks to see the full effects. These days, I consume small quantities of eggs every few weeks and haven't noticed any significant increase in inflammation. reply maayank 1 hour agoparentprevWhat do you eat for protein in the current diet? What was your experience with fish? reply aroopchandra 1 hour agorootparentI eat a lot of legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and peas. I also include tofu made from soy, and nuts like almonds, peanuts, as well as seeds like chia, flaxseeds, and hemp. I use plant-based protein powders too specifically (https://lovecomplement.com/products/complement-organic-vegan...) when I drink green smoothies (3 to 4 meals a week). Green leafy vegetables also has a lot protein (Kale, Broccoli and Brussels). I use supplements for B12 which is missing from vegetable foods. I used to eat fish but when I stopped all animal products I gave up fish as well. I guess if I have fish once in a while it won't hurt me but I have a tendency to overdo it. The main thing for me was to reduce the inflammation when I had the imbalance. This meant stopping everything I thought might cause inflammation until it went away. My diet was also free of all salts, sugars and oils for few months though I do use them now. reply bumby 45 minutes agorootparent>I use supplements for B12 which is missing from vegetable foods. Just in case you're looking for an inexpensive vegan whole food source, seaweed sheets (like those used in sushi) have a relatively high amount of B12. I took a look at the brand in my pantry and it has 60% RDA per sheet. reply schlick 37 minutes agorootparentprevMaybe a crazy take here but it sounds like the Lupus actually made you healthier? Either way congrats on finding a way towards living a happy and healthy life, props to you. reply zeagle 14 hours agoprevThis group presented an abstract at ACR in the fall prior so it's nice to see it published now. https://acrabstracts.org/abstract/cxcl13-t-cell-differentiat... if you don't have journal access to the Nature article. Kudos to them for landing a nature publication but I really would temper this level of excitement (??a top link on HN??) at a basic science research publication discussed in a press release from a university highlighting it's researchers. My read is it is down to decreased CXCL13 expression and type I interferon expression in blood of a small number of patients, controls, and cell culture which gives direction for further study. CXCL13 was published as a possible RA biomarker half a decade ago and crickets since then clinically. Is it causal or a consequence of chronic inflammation? Type I interferon signature has been looked at heavily for over a decade and is clearly relevant in SLE but still only just over about half of lupus patients have it and the signature is by definition broad expression of hundreds of genes that affect innate and adaptive immune system components. We DO need better treatments for lupus patients but it's a very variable disease in severity, clinically, and in terms of biomarkers making it difficult. I mean the best drug that everyone with lupus should be on barring a good reason is an old antimalarial (that doesn't treat COVID) and then we add to it. If you are interested in other new-ish therapies for lupus take a look at anifrolumab, belimumab, voclosporin, and even newer CAR T stuff. Important to consider the manifestations being treated with those in the studies e.g. belimumab with skin, joint, kidney but nothing for hematologic/cardiac/neurologic manifestations. reply fasa99 5 hours agoparentExactly. When our car doesn't run well, a car with perhaps 20,000 parts, we take it to the mechanic who says \"yup, issue was your spark plug, fixed\". And even then, of course, the car issue may have been multifactorial. Maybe the spark plug failed because the fuel/air mix was off, for example, the spark plug was the symptom. But then we leap from the car with 20,000 parts to a body with a trillion cells each cell with a trillion molecules. The calculus of the fuel/air mix and the spark plug has now been blown out of proportion, as challenging as conceiving a 20 dimensional manifold or the size of the universe. And so my reservation with a paper like this, and in general, is people say, \"yup, sure was the spark plug\" and then get accolades and a Nature paper, when the core issue was the air fuel mix, the air fuel mix that is, times a trillion cells, times a trillion molecules. And I can't blame the authors. No shame in shooting for Nature and succeeding. No shame in these simplistic models, each one takes us a step further. But somewhere along the lines we're going to have think about the R&D of the big picture in non-hand-wavey ways. reply the_sleaze_ 3 hours agorootparentThe thing about a car is when the bumper gets detached you can't just strap it down to the front of the car and wait until it reattaches itself. It may be (surely is) that something like lupus is multifactorial and impossibly complex, but knocking out the largest cause of something can be a reliably cure. Look at antibitoics - a truly \"replace the sparkplug\" fix for let's say treating a MRSA infection. Doesn't treat cell damage, doesn't treat inflammation, doesn't treat pain, doesn't treat hormonal imbalance through the body. It doesn't even target the specific infection it kills indiscriminately. Yet \"give them antibiotics until the MRSA goes away, or if it doesn't give them more antibiotics until it does\" it super hand-wavy. reply _Adam 5 hours agorootparentprev> But somewhere along the lines we're going to have think about the R&D of the big picture in non-hand-wavey ways. How? reply nanomonkey 2 hours agorootparentLikely nanotechnology. Sensors that can reside in your body and give up to the moment details, and chemical factories that we can programmatically make adjustments to the body's existing pathways (reprogramming the immune system, etc.). In other words, better integration and faster feedback loops. reply pixl97 1 hour agorootparentJust wait till some small percentage people have random immune responses to the nanotechnology just creating another feedback loop in the system. reply aftbit 3 hours agorootparentprevSuperintelligence reply pixl97 1 hour agorootparentProbably not a great solution....

The potential treatment is that the protein JUN can block IFN's increasing CXCL13 pathologically. It's testable in that JUN itself can be produced and delivered during acute phases to reduce flares, and could itself be a therapy. More lasting gene diagnostics and therapies may come from checking for dysregulated genes in the pathway and injecting genes to produce JUN. It's not promising, though, to the extent JUN wouldn't address an underlying IFN dysregulation. reply Kalanos 7 hours agoparentprevI don't have much context, but the identification of the AHR receptor for the CXCL seems like the exciting part. From what I understand, it is easy enough to design an antibody once you know the right receptor to target reply dpeckett 10 hours agoprevFascinating stuff, it's interesting to read that the main ligands of the AhR (Aryl hydrocarbon receptor) are PAHs (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and that activation of the AhR receptor improves the markers of Lupus. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are nasty, carcinogenic, molecules that are commonly found in smoke, tar, and char. Basically burnt organic matter. On the other side of the coin AhR is also activated by a bunch of Polyphenols, which are found in a variety of plant derived foods. Does this mean, it is possible that Lupus (and Psoriasis) are diseases of affluence caused by processed food (low in Polyphenols), and a reduced exposure to smoke byproducts in the environment? reply caddemon 5 hours agoparentThere's definitely a genetic component but it would be interesting if those environmental factors impacted prevalence or severity. Autoimmune disorders in general might be worse/more common in countries where kids grow up in clean environments. There's already some discussion on this with regard to allergies that I think has some credibility. reply ta988 5 hours agoparentprevSmoking is supposed to be a risk factor so who knows. reply dpeckett 4 hours agorootparentMan biology is weird, yeh it looks like for Lupus and Psoriasis it pretty much doubles the risk of developing it. reply NetOpWibby 6 hours agoparentprevThat’s wild, if true. reply spdustin 2 hours agoprevHLA-B27 is directly related to a number of autoimmune disorders, including lupus. I hope this research can expand to other conditions associated with HLA-B27, like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, etc. reply rpaddock 6 hours agoprevThe Nightshade family of plants, which are very common in our diets, can mimic the symptoms of Lupus. That food sensitivity needs ruled out when diagnosing the cause of Lupus. reply ta988 5 hours agoparentDo you have research that shows that? What I've read is that there was no real evidence of that. reply weberer 4 hours agorootparentHe's likely referring to solanine poisoning. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanine reply rpaddock 2 hours agorootparentYes. Also \"inflammation and pain in the joints\" can be mistaken for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). We discovered the hard-way that my late wife had issues with this. Multiple doctors diagnosed her with both RA and Lupus. When we got the Nightshades out of her diet and switched to more natural based cleaning products, such as Hemp based soap, shampoo and vinegar for cleaning, her symptoms of RA and Lupus went away. An good allergist finds things like this. reply BenFranklin100 20 hours agoprevAutoimmune diseases, of which lupus is but one of many, are essentially black boxes. It’s proven extraordinarily difficult to develop therapies in this area. As such, this is great news. Hopefully this research will encourage pharmaceutical and biotech companies to invest more resources into translating research findings into effective therapies. I haven’t read the paper yet, so I can’t comment on how this discovery might generalize to other autoimmune diseases, but one interesting bit about autoimmune diseases is that they tend to run in packs. This is suggestive there may be underlying mechanisms that are shared across autoimmune diseases. reply atombender 20 hours agoparentThe aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is key to this discovery, appears to be super relevant to psoriasis, another autoimmune disease. AhR has been known for a long time, but it seems it's been somewhat mysterious until a series of recent breakthroughs. In 2022, an AhR inhibitor called tapinarof, sold as VTAMA, was launched, and has shown itself to be one of the most effective treatments for psoriasis to date. It's also unique in that it appears to have the ability to bring lasting remission. In the main clinical trial, patients who used VTAMA for one year and then stopped had a mean remission duration of 4 months until their psoriasis returned. That is unheard of for any topical medication used on psoriasis. Blocking AhR has also shown promise in treating MS [1]. I haven't read the lupus paper, but often with papers like these, the \"cause\" turns out not to be the actual origin, but some cytokine or other protein that is more disease-specific than current drug targets. This lupus discovery appears to identify an imbalance that may be compensated for, but we still don't know what triggers the imbalance in the first place. In some cases diseases turn out to be a genetic fault, but my money is on pathogens acting as the initial triggering event, which then spins the immune system into a vicious cycle of autoimmunity. In psoriasis we see this with strep bacteria, for example, but the exact mechanisms are not well understood. However, the mechanism that makes psoriasis chronic has been identified, a type of T-cell called a tissue-resident memory (TRM) T-cell. This type of cell acts as a kind of biological memory for infections. [1] https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2023/02/15/multiple-sclerosis... reply A_D_E_P_T 17 hours agorootparentGood post. One small correction: Tapinarof isn't an AhR inhibitor, it's an AhR activator, an agonist. Interestingly, tapinarof is a natural product -- a sort of bacterially-modified stilbene, a chemical cousin of resveratrol and pterostilbene -- and several other natural products also activate AhR. (Though perhaps not exactly in the same way.) The most potent and readily available of these is probably 3,3'-diindolylmethane. reply atombender 9 hours agorootparentAh, thanks. I assumed tapinarof was an inhibitor, as the papers on its mechanism describe it as downregulating cytokines. It appears the exact mechanism isn't quite clear. Bissonette et al 2021 [1]: Tapinarof was found to bind directly to AhR, resulting in downregulation of inflammatory cytokines, regulation of skin barrier protein expression, and antioxidant activity ... In a T-cell polarization assay, tapinarof markedly inhibited T-cell expansion and Th17-cell differentiation and reduced the production of IL-17, while also reducing IL-17A and IL17F levels in a CD4 T-cell assay. It looks like tapinarof modulates the signaling behaviour of AhR, but so far the precise mechanisms are educated guesses. The story of tapinarof's discovery is fascinating. It's produced by a bioluminescent (!) bacillus P. luminescens that (quoting from the paper) \"lives symbiotically within parasitic, soil-living entomopathogenic nematodes.\" It was observed in the 1950s that \"the nematode did not putrefy once dead, in contrast to the rapid decay seen in the absence of the nematode,\" leading to the idea that the bacillus' metabolites had antimicrobial activity — which turned out to include what is now synthesized as tapinarof. Coal tar is another semi-natural substance that is thought to act on AhR. [1] https://www.jaad.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0190-9622%2820%2932... reply A_D_E_P_T 8 hours agorootparentThis open-access paper is pretty interesting with respect to mechanisms of action and how tapinarof differs from other stilbenes and AhR agonists: https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(17)31543-9/full... And, yeah, good point re coal tar. AhR was once thought to be a toxin or junk receptor that activated liver enzymes for clearance of environmental waste and other chemical byproducts. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) were, at one time, thought to be very similar. That might still be the case with respect to PXR and CAR, but I'm thinking that the way to bet is that there's more to them than was once thought... reply Modified3019 6 hours agorootparentprevI don’t have any particular point to this post, just tossing out that resveratrol itself seems to be an antagonist of AhR, as it seems to compete with and block agonists. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2019/5847040 Also of note for those curious since I haven’t seen it mentioned yet, Dioxins are potent agonists of AhR. My own interest in AhR is that it seems to play a role in metabolism. Lower levels of exposure to AhR activators seems to kick off a complicated series of effects that seem to ultimately lower metabolism, potentially being a factor in obesity. Higher levels of exposure to dioxins however results in wasting. AhR is poster child for hideously complicated biochemical relationships, so do be careful of simple summaries of exposure/response relationships. I would be cautious of AhR agonists though, I recall coming across a number of potential negative associations in regards to cardiovascular health. reply dg08 11 hours agorootparentprevThanks for posting this.

Autoimmune issues I'm feeling much less confident about. It seems like so many of the therapies are \"turn down the immune system\".

Maybe I'm totally wrong on this (and I'm very OK to be proven wrong) but maybe there's something to find here. reply MR_Bulldops 16 hours agorootparentI am here to restore your confidence about autoimmune issues. Recently (and still in many cases) \"turn down the immune system\" was the treatment for most cancers. Of course, the purpose of anti-cancer drugs isn't to turn down the immune system. It just happens that the side effect of drugs that target cancer cells also target other rapidly-dividing cells like hair, endothelial, and immune cells. In fact, chemotherapy drugs like Methotrexate are prescribed - at lower doses than for cancer patients - to people with Lupus and other autoimmune diseases. There are similar challenges with cancer and autoimmune diseases, so progress in one might help progress in the other. From the article: \"They are now working to find ways to deliver these molecules safely and effectively to people.\" This is a challenge for many potentially effective cancer treatments as well. reply idunnoman1222 2 hours agorootparentKilling quickly dividing cells as a way of modulating immune system is ‘turn down the immune system’ Just as antivirals are actually ‘stop cell division’ Neither of which inspire any confidence reply MR_Bulldops 2 hours agorootparentIt should inspire confidence that we have moved beyond that for many types of cancer.

In one seminal study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Miller and his colleagues conducted a double-blind study of 40 cancer patients undergoing treatment with interferon-alpha, an inflammatory cytokine. > Though none of the patients had depression to begin with, the inflammatory agent had a striking effect: Many became depressed, a finding that has been consistently replicated. reply funnym0nk3y 7 hours agorootparentHowever the causality is not clear. Inflammatory agents cause depression. And most depressed people have higher pro-inflammatory markers.

Vitamin C is an antioxidant, not an anti-inflammatory agent. There is evidence that things that reduce systemic inflammation help with depression. Fish oil, or more generally a balanced omega-3/omega-6 intake is one example. Curcumin is another. However the effects are modest, which is probably to be expected with a condition as diverse as depression. reply theGnuMe 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat the mechanism? reply sharpshadow 7 hours agorootparent„Vitamin C supplementation attenuates the oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation) and inflammatory response (IL-6) to a single bout of exercise.“[1] Vitamin C is essential and gets consumed by the body and needs to be replenished.

It seems like so many of the therapies are \"turn down the immune system\". The immune system has many branches, and you can effectively deplete one branch of the immune system while preserving the other branches to fight infection. For example with MS a very effective treatment is CD20+ B cell suppression, as rituximab does. For many people diagnosed with MS this has been effectively a \"cure,\" in the sense that while they need to continually deplete their CD20+ B cells, their disease doesn't progress in any meaningful way, and their immune systems remain largely able to fight infection. So we don't need to wholesale \"turn down\" the entire immune system for many autoimmune diseases. Rather, we need to surgically target specific parts of it and either suppress those parts or modify their behavior. Given the success we've seen with ritixumab and MS I'm more optimistic about our prospects for finding effective treatments for autoimmune conditions. reply hanniabu 14 hours agorootparentAnd all of this is controlled by your microbiome which is always ignored. I really wish more money was put towards researching that. It's literally our body's bioreactor. reply meindnoch 10 hours agorootparentAh yes, the \"gut\" meme. No, the immune system is not controlled by our microbiome. The microbiome interacts with, and modulates the immune system in various ways, but it's hardly \"controlling\" it. There are germ-free animal models with sterile guts, which demonstrate that you can live without a microbiome - of course not 100% healthy, but they can still live and reproduce. The immune system is modulated by a lot of things: circadian rhythm, environmental stress, nutrients, etc. Yes, the gut microbiome is one of them. But let's be a bit more nuanced than Joe Rogan or The Liver King. reply phito 12 hours agorootparentprevIs it really controlled by the microbiome or is it just a factor among many others? reply _glass 7 hours agoparentprevYes, for Hashimoto's thyroiditis there seem to be some approaches: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38621508/ Let's see how this plays out. reply fnord77 15 hours agoparentprev> Autoimmune diseases, of which lupus is but one of many, are essentially black boxes. Hardly. Treatments are down to the kinase level these days, which is just one step away from the gene transcription factors.

Insufficient activation of AHR results in too many disease-promoting immune cells, called the T peripheral helper cells, that promote the production of disease-causing autoantibodies. To show this discovery can be leveraged for treatments, the investigators returned the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-activating molecules to blood samples from lupus patients. This seemed to reprogram these lupus-causing cells into a cell called a Th22 cell that may promote wound healing from the damage caused by this autoimmune disease. “We found that if we either activate the AHR pathway with small molecule activators or limit the pathologically excessive interferon in the blood, we can reduce the number of these disease-causing cells,” On the other side quick search on AHR activation brings for example cancer related stuff like this : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10570930/ \"AHR activation to promote tumor cell intrinsic malignant properties and to suppress anti-tumor immune responses [14], [17], [18]. Specifically, the AHR drives cancer cell migration, invasion, and survival, regulates cell cycle progression and promotes cancer stem cell characteristics [14], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Simultaneously, it inhibits anti-tumor immunity \" Human body by its complexity and our lack of understanding of it sometimes reminds the codebases i've worked on :) In that rabbit hole of articles on AHR there is also : https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00585-5 \"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor and the gut–brain axis\" which in particular discusses what looks to me (i'm not a doctor) like a connection/correlation : gut microbes -> AHR -> glioblastoma. reply elcritch 20 hours agoparentBoth reactions make sense to me. Too much AHR activation suppresses immune response leading to cancer proliferation due immune cells not culling cancerous cells, but too little leads to auto-immune conditions.

Turns out his small nerve fibers were fried by an antibiotic. His skin punch biopsy showed reduced fibers. This may not be the case in everyone, but SFN is extremely under diagnosed. He was a chemist, and he ended up healing all his symptoms with pirenzepine. If I recall correctly they did the skin punch biopsy again and his physician was stunned when they saw regrowth of the fibers. Today, WinSanTor is in stage 3 trials with their drug. They designed a cream with main ingredient being pirenzepine. They are targeting diabetes but the med appears to work for small nerve fibers as well. Small nerve fibers control so much that any time people have weird unexplained symptoms it should be explored. reply carynh 10 hours agorootparent> He was a chemist, and he ended up healing all his symptoms with pirenzepine.

We're entering the golden age of immune cell science. You figure out what immune cells are causing disease and how to restore them. Here the T cells are imbalanced and a specific protein is found to regulate the imbalance but the interferon is countering the protein's effects. Now you can target that in many ways and run all sorts of clinical trials. reply eszed 4 hours agorootparentIt seems to me that as we've gone layers deeper into organic processes we've repeatedly recapitulated Galenic theory: \"rebalancing\" more and more precisely-targeted \"humours\".

It might help reduce symptoms that are caused by the imbalance so it would certainly be worth a trial when they work out the details. reply trhway 19 hours agorootparent>stuck in \"there is infection near by\" operation mode There are bunch of articles on successful treatment of CFS with methotrexate (which causes B-cells depletion whereis original CFS was associated in particular with B-cells over-presence after say viral infections/etc.) reply treprinum 19 hours agoparentprevIsn't thiamine tissue deficiency at the bottom of dysautonomia? Potentially leading to Alzheimer, MS, ALS over long periods of time if untreated depending on one's genetics and the way their body tries to adapt to it? I understand nobody tracks this over 30 years though. I think it's low-risk to try to address long-term tissue B1/B2/B3 deficiencies first and see if it helps. \"The initial symptoms of thiamine deficiency beriberi are those of dysautonomia [1], a broad term that describes any disease or malfunction of the autonomic nervous system. This includes postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST), vasovagal syncope, mitral valve prolapse dysautonomia, pure autonomic failure, neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), autonomic instability and a number of lesser-known disorders such as cerebral salt-wasting syndrome. Dysautonomia is associated with Lyme disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, multiple system atrophy (Shy–Drager syndrome) Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome for reasons that are not fully understood [2]. It has been hypothesized that the association of dysautonomia with so many different diagnoses is because a common form of dysautonomia originates from high calorie malnutrition. This leads to loss of oxidative efficiency (pseudo hypoxia) and subsequent disorganization of ANS controls that are mediated through the limbic system and brainstem.\" reply heartrending 17 hours agorootparentYes for some cases and any doctor who knows anything about dysautonomia tests and treats for it. It’s not root cause for many though because dysautonomia is a syndrome with potentially hundreds of reasons with the biggest being post-viral (autoimmune hypothesis) and EDS (vein elasticity hypotheis). reply galangalalgol 20 hours agoparentprevIt has been my hope that the number of me/cfs cases would finally drive enough research into autoimmune disorders in general, that we might finally figure it out.

And that's basically it. I should also note that even when I was only taking mesalamine (a drug that works in your GI tract and basically nowhere else), my arthritis pain improved drastically, so it wasn't just the result of steroids having a general anti-inflammatory effect.

    "originBody": "Posted on December 4, 2018December 6, 2018 by Dave Addey From a trash-filled Earth to the futuristic Axiom and back again, WALL·E is a finely crafted balance between consumerist dystopia and sixties space-race optimism. Please join me, then, for a detailed dive into the uniquely robotic future of a remarkably human film, as seen through the eyes of its eponymous hero, WALL·E. [This article is from the Typeset in the Future book, which is really very good and you’re probably going to want to buy a copy of. If you’d rather read the article first, don’t worry—I’ll remind you again later on.] Before we get started, there is an important detail we must clear up. Our hero’s name is not, as you might think, WALL-E. Moreover, it definitely isn’t WALL•E. His name is WALL·E, and that dot is an interpunct, not a hyphen or a bullet. WALL·E’s front plate, clearly showing his interpunct. An interpunct is, of course, a vertically centered dot originally used to separate words in Latin and ancient Greek. (Spaces weren’t invented until several centuries later.) The interpunct is still in use today—it’s the official decimal point in British currency (£9·99), and is used to represent the dot product of two vectors in mathematics (x · y). Most relevantly, it’s used in Japanese to separate titles, names, and positions, as in “課長補佐 · 鈴木” (Assistant Section Head · Suzuki). It is therefore entirely appropriate as the separator in WALL·E, which is short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter · Earth Class. The bold extended typeface seen on WALL·E’s front plate is Gunship, designed by Dan Zadorozny, one of the unsung heroes of modern sci-fi type design. Dan is an amateur type designer from Texas whose Iconian Fonts website features more than six hundred free hand-crafted typefaces, many of which have been used by sci-fi movies, TV shows, and book designers. In addition to WALL·E’s front plate, Gunship is seen on Earth and aboard the Axiom, the flagship spacecraft of megacorporation Buy n Large (BnL, for short), most notably for robot-facing wall and door typography. Its upper- and lowercase variants include different combinations of cutouts and curve orientations, giving designers flexibility when crafting robot signage. (Strictly speaking, this means that our hero’s name, correctly capitalized, is “waLL·e,” with the interpunct as a further customization—Gunship’s own interpunct is rectangular.) Gunship (lowercase characters). Gunship (uppercase characters). The movie begins with an insight into WALL·E’s typical workday, which is spent building gigantic piles of trash by compacting waste into neat, stackable cubes. After a hard day’s crushing, we follow him on his journey home, learning some useful exposition along the way. This includes a bank of electronic ads for BnL, promoting everything from liquid air to quadruple-patty burgers. Common throughout these ads is an insistence on immediate consumption—“DRINK NOW,” “HUNGRY NOW,” “RUN NOW,” “CONSUME.” And if consuming a product once isn’t enough, you can repeat the experience a second time—the signage seen below includes ads for both “100% Reused Food” and “Regurgi-Shake: Twice the Flavor.” We’ve seen how corporate mergers, such as Alien’s Weylan Yutani and Blade Runner’s Shimata-Dominguez, are an inevitability in sci-fi futures. WALL·E’s Buy n Large is similar, except that this company was formed by a merger between a frozen yogurt manufacturer (Buy Yogurt) and a maker of suits for the larger gentleman (Large Industries). Clearly a marriage made in heaven, this corporate combination led to a rapid expansion, culminating with Buy n Large owning every company and government in the world. The Buy n Large logo is an over-italicized customization of Futura Extra Bold Oblique, as demonstrated by a super-distinctive capital G in the BUY N LARGE BANK logotype that WALL·E passes early in the movie. Futura Pro Extra Bold Oblique, released by Berthold. Original Futura design by Paul Renner. “BUY N LARGE BANK” signage, set in Futura Extra Bold Oblique, showing its distinctive capital G. If the red-and-blue logo feels familiar, it shouldn’t be a surprise—it’s because BnL uses the exact same typeface and color scheme as real-world retail giant Costco Wholesale Corporation. The Costco Wholesale Corporation logo, in Futura Extra Bold Oblique. There’s another curious BnL subsidiary to be found among the city’s electronic ads, on a beaten-up billboard advertising “Eggman Movers (Creating More Space).” This company is an Easter-egg reference to WALL·E production designer Ralph “Eggman” Eggleston, and it shares the name of the moving company from 1995’s Toy Story, for which Ralph was art director. Eggman Movers, from 2008’s WALL·E. Eggman Movers, from 1995’s Toy Story. The presence of a Buy n Large–branded bank means Buy n Large–branded banknotes, which are unusual for being strewn across the floor of the deserted city. If you look closely at the notes, you’ll see that some of them have “106” in the corner, and are marked “ten million dollars.” Others look to be marked “996,” suggesting that Buy n Large stores continued the classic $9.99 pricing trick even after adding six zeroes to the end of everything. (Indeed, it says much about the Buy n Large approach to consumerism that it prints notes with the 99s already included, to avoid customers having to receive any change.) $10 million and $99 million bills lie abandoned on the ground near a Buy n Large Bank. We discover later in the movie that the Axiom left Earth in the year 2105. This suggests that in the preceding years of overconsumption there was a period of severe hyperinflation, making a $10 million note a necessity. This is not without historical precedent—Earth’s most extreme example of hyperinflation occurred in Zimbabwe in November 2008, just a few months after WALL·E’s release, when the inflation rate for the Zimbabwe dollar reached a staggering 79,600,000,000 percent per month. At this point, a single US dollar was equivalent to 2,621,984,228 Zimbabwe dollars. The largest-denomination note printed during this time was the $100 trillion note, which makes Buy n Large’s $10 million bill seem like small change by comparison. A $100 trillion bill from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, showing some impressively pointy Futura. WALL·E leaves the bank behind and continues his journey via the disused tracks of the BnL Transit monorail system. In the absence of working trains, these concrete tracks provide a convenient route through the middle of the deserted city. WALL·E climbs an escalator to a BnL Transit monorail station. Despite their association with aspirational futures, monorails have been failing to become a global mass-transit system for almost two hundred years. The first passenger monorail opened in 1825 in Cheshunt, England, primarily to transport bricks, though it was also utilized for transporting people, mostly for novelty purposes. Unlike the top-of-rail system seen in WALL·E, Cheshunt’s monorail consisted of carriages suspended beneath an overhead track, and was powered by a single horse. The Cheshunt style of monorail—with suspended carriages hanging beneath a single rail—was also adopted by the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, which began operation along the Wupper River in Wuppertal, Germany, in 1901. The Wuppertal’s suspended system is still in operation today, carrying more than sixty-five thousand passengers on an average weekday. A Wuppertal Schwebebahn monorail train arrives at the Werther Brücke station in Wuppertal, 1913. The monorail seen in WALL·E is of the style popularized by Swedish entrepreneur Axel Wenner-Gren, whose prototype ALWEG (Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren) monorail system came to the attention of Walt Disney after a family visit to Wuppertal gave him monorail fever. Disney saw the potential for a monorail attraction at his new Disneyland theme park in California, and the Disneyland-ALWEG Monorail System opened in June 1959. The system remains in operation today (under the name Disneyland Monorail), and there are similar attractions at Disneyland Tokyo and Walt Disney World in Florida. In total, Disney monorails have transported more than one billion passengers into an aspirational transportational future. The Disneyland-ALWEG Monorail System at Tomorrowland station, 1963.

It’s not entirely clear what US city WALL·E lives in, but the presence of a monorail network certainly positions it as a location that was once optimistic about the future. This mid-century futurism is borne out by other architectural features of the city, most notably a curved building seen among the billboards encountered earlier. This building is strongly reminiscent of the Space Needle observation tower in Seattle, Washington, which was built for the city’s 1962 World’s Fair, together with an ALWEG monorail system that is still in operation today.

A remarkably space-needle-like building seen close to the monorail in WALL·E’s home city. Near the monorail, WALL·E passes a promotional poster for himself, with the caption “Working to dig you out!” This poster has definite communist propaganda undertones, showing a stylized army of WALL·Es working together to build a brighter future. The implication of this design choice—that communist values are the solution to decades of rampant consumerism—is a pretty bold political statement for what is only the fourth minute of the movie. Buy n Large poster for WALL·E robots, with the caption “Working to dig you out!” The future to which these WALL·Es aspire is apparently just above and behind the viewer—a common trope for communist propaganda, where the aspirational group gaze is almost always in this direction. Chinese communist propaganda poster with the caption “To go on a thousand ‘li’ march to temper a red heart.” A “li” is about 500 meters, so a thousand-li march is about 310 miles. Soviet communist propaganda poster, with the caption “Let’s raise a generation utterly devoted to the cause of communism!” Designed by Victor Ivanov, 1947. North Korean propaganda poster, with the caption “The party calls! To important construction!” Indeed, this gaze is such a common trope that it became the primary styling of the promotional poster for 2014’s banned comedy movie The Interview, in which two Americans travel to North Korea to interview the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un. (The WALL·E poster’s bottom-edge caption, punctuated by an exclamation mark, is a recurring design feature in North Korean propaganda posters.) Promotional poster for The Interview, with the Korean-language caption “Don’t believe these American bastards!” This aspirational style is an example of socialist realist design, the officially sanctioned visual aesthetic of the Soviet Union, which positioned broad-shouldered, purposeful workers as the true heroes of the age. As a robot who is literally a rectangle, there is surely no worker more broad-shouldered and purposeful than our movie’s eponymous hero, WALL·E. WALL·E’s self-promotional poster is also a fine example of Handel Gothic, one of the movie’s supporting typefaces. Originally designed in 1965 by Donald J. Handel, the font has become a mainstay of design futurism. (Indeed, it is quite possibly the originator of one of our rules for futuristic type: Make straight things curved.) Handel Gothic Com Bold, from Linotype. Handel Gothic was originally designed in 1965 by Donald J. Handel for FotoStar. My favorite use of the typeface in WALL·E occurs later in the movie, when we see the distinctly curved E of some Handel Gothic… on a handle. (I refuse to believe this is anything but a deliberate typographic joke.) “Handle” Gothic. Handel Gothic enjoyed a particular resurgence when the type family was expanded in the 1980s, and will be immediately familiar to anyone who visited EPCOT Center at Walt Disney World in Florida, which opened in 1982. (Later in this article, we’ll look in detail at the theme park, which is now named simply Epcot.) The original EPCOT Center logo was Handel Gothic all the way, making particularly good use of a lowercase n in “Center” to bring some extra curviness, and choosing a font variant with a curved leg in its R for consistency. (It also added letter joining and slicing for good futuristic measure.) Original logo for the EPCOT Center theme park at Walt Disney World, Florida. Handel Gothic will also be familiar to Star Trek fans, from its appearance in the credits for both Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993–99) and Star Trek: Voyager (1995–2001). Opening credits from the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode “Emissary,” showing some shiny metallic Handel Gothic (in this case, with a straight-legged R). Opening credits from the Star Trek: Voyager episode “Unimatrix Zero: Part II,” showing Handel Gothic with a similarly straight-legged R. The movie that made Handel Gothic synonymous with sci-fi, however, was almost certainly Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind, released in 1977. Close Encounters used the typeface for its theatrical poster and for its opening credits, with the very words “Close Encounters” offering not one but three opportunities to recognize Handel Gothic’s trademark E. Opening credits to 1977’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind. But back to WALL·E’s journey. Toward the end of his trek home, he passes many more WALL·E units, all of them rusted and dead. The sole remaining WALL·E happily cannibalizes a Caterpillar track from a nearby broken unit to replace his own damaged part, and motors onward with the new track in place. It’s an easy detail to miss, but WALL·E’s home is a broken-down “BnL WALL·E Transport” vehicle, which may once have housed all the dead units he just passed. When he reverses himself into a WALL·E-size bin in a rotatable storage rack a few minutes later and rocks himself to sleep, his loneliness as the last robot on Earth is made all the more acute by the uninhabited bins around him, now filled with ordered trash. Defunct WALL·E units litter the landscape, becoming part of the trash they once existed to clear. A hulking WALL·E TRANSPORT, ironically rendered immobile by the piles of trash surrounding it. WALL·E tucks himself into a transportation bin, as the last remaining unit still able to do so. Where there once would have been many more WALL·E’s, there is now simply ordered trash. Before he climbs into bed, WALL·E retrieves his favorite VHS cassette from a nearby toaster, and pops it into a VCR. It turns out this is a beaten-up copy of Hello, Dolly!—1969’s awkwardly punctuated Jerry Herman musical. Delightfully, the typography of this cassette is taken directly from the movie’s 1991 VHS release, though the identity of its non-futuristic title font—half Century Schoolbook, half Benguiat Caslon—has sadly eluded my detective skills. WALL-E’s much-watched copy of Hello, Dolly! The front cover of 1991’s US VHS release of Hello, Dolly! WALL·E watches his Hello, Dolly! cassette via a small, portable device that looks almost exactly like an Apple iPod Video. I say “almost,” because the real-world iPod Video had a smaller click wheel than the one seen in WALL·E, had white labels on its buttons, and did not support external playback from a VHS cassette player. Nonetheless, this iPod is just one example of many in WALL·E’s home that evoke nostalgia for gadgets past, reinforcing that WALL·E himself is the discarded, unwanted technology that humanity left behind. WALL·E’s iPod, showing Hello, Dolly! on its LCD color screen. To work around the tiny scale of his iPod’s screen, WALL·E uses a plastic Fresnel lens as a magnifying device to enlarge the image to several times its original size. In doing so, he follows a trend started in Terry Gilliam’s similarly dystopian Brazil, in which employees at the Ministry of Information Retrieval huddle around tiny CRT screens to watch westerns through Fresnel lenses when their boss isn’t looking. WALL·E watches a movie on his iPod’s small screen through a rectangular Fresnel lens. In 1985’s Brazil, Ministry of Information employees watch movies on a small CRT screen through a rectangular Fresnel lens. WALL·E awakes from robotic sleep on day two of the movie, low on power and dynamism. The fact that his head is a big pair of binoculars gives a great opportunity for a visual gag, as we see him literally bleary-eyed before activating the zoom lock on first his left eye, then his right, to reveal an eye-test chart in the opposing rack. From his bleary beginnings… …WALL·E focuses first his left eye… …and then his right, locking in on an eye test chart in the distance. WALL·E’s binocular form is mimicked in the shape of his heads-up display (or HUD), which has the classic “two circles” shape used in many movies to indicate that we are looking from a character’s viewpoint through a pair of binoculars. This HUD raises an interesting question, however. Why does WALL·E have a heads-up display, with information overlaid on a video stream? A heads-up display really makes sense only if you are a human who has eyes; for a robot, any video input is combined with additional metadata from environmental sensors (such as direction, zoom, and power), and fed directly into the robot’s processor. Overlaying environmental information on a video stream implies that the robot has cameras that look at the world, and then more cameras that look at the augmented output of those cameras, which doesn’t make sense at all. The answer, of course, is that WALL·E has a HUD because movie robots have HUDs, and movie robots have HUDs because they enable the viewer to visualize what the robots are thinking, even if it makes zero sense in technical reality. This trope began in 1973’s Westworld, whose final act shows us the world from the vantage point of Yul Brynner’s gun-slinging robot. Although Brynner’s HUD is not augmented with data, it is nonetheless the first use of computer-generated imagery in a feature film. Director Michael Crichton cuts several times from a real-world scene to the robot’s pixelated version of the same, including a thermal image when Brynner chases his prey in the movie’s final act. A canyon in Westworld… …and Yul Brynner’s pixellated view of the same. Yul Brynner’s gunslinging robot tracks its prey with a thermal imaging interpretation of its video input. Westworld’s “robot viewpoint” trope was codified by 1984’s The Terminator and 1987’s RoboCop, both of which augmented their HUDs with additional data and text. Following these two movies, a heads-up display pretty much became the de facto expectation for any on-screen robot whose motives need to be understood. A HUD screen from the T-800 Terminator, in 1984’s The Terminator. Here, the T-800 is determining an appropriate auditory response to a question from its apartment’s superintendent. A HUD screen from the OCP Crime Prevention Unit 001, in 1987’s RoboCop. Here, RoboCop’s visual tracking system is being put through its paces by detecting the location of a pen. (Note that RoboCop’s HUD has highly visible scan lines, to make sure we know we are watching a live video stream in a movie.) Pixar’s robot HUDs tend to include the shape of the robot’s eye(s) within the heads-up display, to help us associate the HUD with the character it represents. The Incredibles’ Omnidroid predates WALL·E’s binoculars in this regard. Other WALL·E robots—M-O, SECUR-T, and EVE—also follow suit. The Incredibles’ Omnidroid has a HUD that makes the droid’s desire for self-preservation clear via some on-screen Eurostile Oblique. It also demonstrates the Pixar trend (continued in WALL·E) for HUDs to match the shapes of their robots’ eye(s). The SECUR-T sentry robot’s eye in WALL·E is explicitly a camera, as reinforced by a SLR (single-lens-reflex)-camera-like HUD when taking a CAUTION photo of WALL·E’s rogue robots. EVE’s curved, lined HUD mirrors the curved, lined styling of her eyes and face. M-O’s wide, flat eye-panel shape is mirrored in his wide, flat on-screen HUD display. This shape, of course, requires his HUD to use a certain wide, flat typeface for its informative text. Pixar’s neatest variation on the robot HUD trope occurs all the way back in 1999’s Toy Story 2, where a plastic toy’s marketing gimmick (plus some clever camera framing) enables us to literally see through the eyes of the movie’s robotic bad guy. Evil Emperor Zurg, arch-enemy of Buzz Lightyear, in 1999’s Toy Story 2. As Buzz runs away from Zurg, a camera move brilliantly subverts the robot HUD trope… …turning a plastic toy’s “LOOK HERE” scope… …into the bad guy’s evil robot HUD… …complete with ZURG VISION logo in Eurostile Bold Oblique. There is one further question raised by WALL·E’s binocular HUD. How does his directional compass—seen at the top center of his HUD—continue to work when he is aboard the Axiom? Lots of planets may have a north, but the same is not true of spacecraft—north, south, east, and west make sense only when you’re on the surface of a sphere. A detail from WALL·E’s binoculars when onboard the Axiom. This compass direction indicator, from the top of the viewport, updates as he rotates, despite the notable absence of a planet. Day two (and act two) of WALL·E see a Buy n Large scout ship arrive on Earth, disrupting WALL·E’s routine. Most importantly, it introduces us to EVE, who is everything WALL·E is not. EVE’s shiny white design is technologically advanced; she’s the curvy iMac G4 to WALL·E’s boxy Mac 128K. Her design evokes sleek Apple products of the 2000s, with her head, in particular, highly reminiscent of a 2002 iMac G4’s base. Even her reboot sound is a futuristic take on Apple’s famous startup chime, whereas WALL·E’s post-charge chime is the version Apple introduced in 1998 and removed altogether in 2016. WALL·E sees EVE for the first time, as she is released from her transporter pod to begin scanning Earth. Side view of an iMac G4, released in 2002, with an EVE-head-like base. An Apple Macintosh 128k, released in 1984, with a WALL·E-like beige body. Photograph by Ian Muttoo, CC BY-SA 2.0. EVE’s evocation of Apple product design is not entirely coincidental. In a 2008 interview with Fortune magazine, director Andrew Stanton stated: “I wanted EVE to be high-end technology—no expense spared—and I wanted it to be seamless and for the technology to be sort of hidden and subcutaneous. The more I started describing it, the more I realized I was pretty much describing the Apple playbook for design.” This led to a 2005 call to Steve Jobs—at that time, both owner of Pixar and CEO of Apple—which in turn led to Apple design head Jony Ive spending a day at the Pixar headquarters in Emeryville, consulting on the EVE prototype. (It is surely entirely coincidental that EVE’s wireless arms and hands are reminiscent of Apple’s wireless Magic Mouse, released the year after WALL·E.) Eve’s wirelessly-connected fingers and hands, as seen in 2008’s WALL·E. Apple’s wireless Magic Mouse, released in 2009. Photograph by Yutaka Tsutano, CC BY 2.0. During a dust storm, WALL·E takes EVE back to the safety of his home, where he presents her with a small multicolored cube. In the three seconds the camera pans away for WALL·E to retrieve Hello, Dolly!, EVE solves the Rubik’s Cube and returns it to her astonished host. WALL·E presents EVE with a Rubik’s Cube from his trash collection. EVE’s cube-solving time would be impressive for a human; the current world record is 4.22 seconds, set by Feliks Zemdegs in May 2018. Sadly, because of the camera pan, we’ll never know if EVE broke the world record for a robot, which currently stands at a mind-boggling 0.637 seconds. This record was set in November 2016 by Sub1 Reloaded, a cube-solving robot built by German engineer Albert Beer. Six high-performance stepper motors turned the cube twenty-one times to complete the task, averaging just 0.03 seconds per rotation. Sub1 Reloaded, the world-record-holding Rubik’s Cube robot, in November 2016. Spare a thought, then, for poor WALL·E. His surprise at EVE’s accomplishment is understandable—he lacks color vision and has only three digits on each hand, which means that Rubik’s Cubes are really not his specialty. (There’s a reason Guinness doesn’t have a “fastest dog” Rubik’s Cube category.) One other point of note: This scene is the only time the color green appears in WALL·E in a scene unrelated to a plant. While this breaks the movie’s careful color scripting, it’s worth it for a good gag. All seems to be going well with WALL·E and EVE’s introductions, until they are rudely interrupted by EVE’s spotting a plant that WALL·E has excavated from the trash. She subsumes the plant, as per her “directive,” and enters hibernation mode. WALL·E’s attempts to wake her invariably end in comedic pain, though one of them does reveal EVE’s serial number, 051682, set in Handel Gothic. (I can’t help but wonder whether someone in Pixar’s art department was born on May 16, 1982.) EVE’s serial number, seen on the inside of the door above, is 051682. WALL·E gives up on reviving EVE and disconsolately returns to his trash-crushing routine. Shortly afterward, the Axiom’s scout ship returns to Earth and collects EVE to take her home. Desperate not to lose his new friend, WALL·E hitches a ride on the outside of the scout, causing him grief when the ship blasts through Earth’s surrounding satellite trash. As the satellites fall away, we see that WALL·E has a Soviet-era Sputnik 1 satellite on his head. This is impressive, especially given that Sputnik 1—the first man-made object to orbit Earth—burned up on reentry to Earth’s atmosphere in 1958. As the Axiom scout ship breaks through Earth’s satellites… …WALL·E is briefly left with Sputnik 1 on his head. A replica of the Sputnik 1 satellite, showing its 58cm-diameter aluminum sphere and four spindly antennas We see Sputnik 1 again later in the movie, as a model in Captain McCrea’s display cabinet. This model is accompanied by a NASA space shuttle launch/entry helmet, as worn by space shuttle astronauts between 1982 and 1986 during launch and return from space.

Payload specialist Sharon Christa McAuliffe is briefed on the space shuttle’s launch/entry helmet during training for the January 1986 launch of flight STS-51L. This “retro space tech” theme can also be seen on Earth during EVE’s scan for plant life. After scanning a Toy Story Pizza Planet truck and a portable lavatory, EVE checks a rusting Apollo command module before slamming the door shut in disgust at its absence of plant-based life.

Photograph by gordonplant, CC BY 2.0. Showing recent space technology as trash or as museum pieces positions our personal experiences of space as archaic and quaint in comparison to the Axiom’s futuristic styling. This further reinforces WALL·E’s own obsolescence as a discarded piece of technology, and sets us up neatly for a transition to the shiny futurism of the Axiom. The Axiom paints a vision of the future where every menial task, no matter how small, has a dedicated robot created expressly for the purpose. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey’s HAL and Alien’s MU/TH/UR, all these robots have cute acronyms to make them human-friendly. SAUT-A (chefbot). Microbe Obliterator, or M·O. VAQ-M (vacuumbot), BUF-4 (bufferbot), and SPR-A (spraybot). HAN-S (massagebot), and PR-T (beauticianbot). SR-V (tennisbot). BIRD-E (golfbot). SECUR-T (stewardbot). BURN-E (maintenancebot), shortly after being locked out of the Axiom by WALL·E and EVE. GO-4 (gopherbot). Waste Allocation Load Lifter · Axiom Class, or WALL·A. NAN-E (nannybot). Of particular note is VN-GO, the painterbot, whose acronym perpetuates a common yet incorrect pronunciation of Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh’s surname. (According to the BBC Pronunciation Unit, it is “van Gokh,” with the kh pronounced like the ch in the Scottish word loch.) VN-GO (paintbot). EVE’s acronym, sadly, is even worse. Her denomination as Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator could not be more inaccurate, given that her entire reason for existing is to evaluate vegetation on the planet Terra (as Earth is known in Latin). Presumably, her moniker was chosen for cuteness rather than linguistic accuracy—after all, this movie is about WALL·E and EVE, not WALL·E and TVE. Also of note is TYP-E, a typingbot who is designed solely to press keys when someone approaches the elevator shaft to the captain’s quarters. TYP-E provides an excuse for one of the movie’s best visual gags—as a robot, he has a keyboard made entirely, of course, from ones and zeroes. TYP-E (typingbot). In a brief over-the-shoulder shot, we see that TYP-E’s keyboard is made entirely from keys labeled 1 and 0. M-O’s cleaning colleagues (VAQ-M, SPR-A, and BUF-4) may bring back memories for fans of 1997’s The Fifth Element. In Luc Besson’s over-the-top vision of the future, evil industrialist Zorg demonstrates his own array of task-specific robots by dropping a glass tumbler on the floor to trigger their “lovely ballet.” As two sentrybots stand guard, a sweeperbot, a spraybot, and a bufferbot clean up his mess before returning to a nearby storage station. The Fifth Element pre-empts WALL·E’s cleaning robots with its own sweeperbot… …spraybot… …and bufferbot. The Axiom’s robots travel around the ship via their own dedicated corridors, separate from the craft’s passenger areas. These passenger areas are split into three classes—economy, coach, and elite—each of which has a distinct architectural style. The classes themselves do not play a functional role in the movie’s plot, but one has to wonder what they mean for the Axiom’s society. Are children born into the classes their ancestors originally purchased, as if into some kind of futuristic caste system? Would the Axiom have its own Titanic moment if a passenger from economy bumped hover chairs with someone from elite? One thing’s certain: The styling of each class is extremely useful for helping viewers orient themselves within the ship’s overall structure as the action moves back and forth along its length. Our introduction to the passenger area starts with the economy deck, which is compact, angular, and concrete in texture and color. Its palette is deliberately sparse, rarely moving outside the Buy n Large blue, red, and white, and making extensive use of the corporation’s Futura Extra Bold Oblique. The economy deck, as seen by WALL·E shortly after his arrival on the Axiom. Apart from a few hints of yellow, it follows the BnL corporate color scheme exclusively, with plenty of Futura Extra Bold Oblique. The economy deck, as seen when Captain McCrea announces the Axiom’s 700-year anniversary. The deck’s design is highly reminiscent of the interior of the Contemporary Tower at Walt Disney World Contemporary Resort, whose A-frame concrete-and-steel structure was so futuristic when it opened in 1971 that it even had a monorail running through the middle. (As anyone who has stayed at the Contemporary can attest, however, its rates can hardly be considered “economy.”) Interior of the Contemporary Tower at Walt Disney World Contemporary Resort, as it looked in 2011.

The coach deck, unlike the economy deck, is curved, eclectic, and spacious, with brightly colored holo-ads scattered everywhere. It mimics Las Vegas’s Strip in gaudiness and style, with artificial neon colors used extensively and every sign encouraging Axiom passengers to spend more money. (How the ship’s financial economy continues to function after a seven-hundred-year flight continues to remain a mystery.)

A section of the Las Vegas Strip at night, showing a similar palette of over-saturated cyan, purple, pink, and yellow hues, combined with omnipresent ads encouraging consumption. Photograph by rabbit75_ist. The ceiling of the coach deck is a gigantic animated screen that can switch between day and night, complete with a BnL-branded sun or moon. The ceiling’s relationship to actual time is somewhat tenuous, as we see when Captain McCrea winds the sky back from 12:30 p.m. to 9:30 a.m. in order to make his morning announcements. In this regard, the ceiling is essentially an amalgam of two Las Vegas landmarks: the painted cloud ceilings of the Forum indoor arcade at Caesars Palace, whose lighting ebbs and changes without ever making it nighttime enough for you to want to stop buying things, and the four-block-long overhead screen of the Fremont Street Experience—the world’s largest video screen—whose 12.5 million LEDs illuminate Vegas partygoers every night. The result is an entirely fake sky for the Axiom’s population, allowing finely tuned control over their artificial environment.

The coach deck leads to the elite deck, whose styling resembles that of a high-class lido or spa. Despite their very different palettes, the coach and elite decks share a curved, futuristic environmental styling that unifies their overall architecture. According to production designer Ralph Eggleston, the architecture of this shared area is inspired by the work of architect Santiago Calatrava, whose signature curved supports and arches can be seen throughout both decks’ central concourse.

The other main influence for the Axiom’s architecture is the design of the Tomorrowland area of Disneyland, in California. According to production designer Ralph Eggleston, during the movie’s production WALL·E’s design team visited an exhibition of Tomorrowland concept art and took inspiration from the designs therein. Perhaps the most obvious of these influences is the presence of a PeopleMover transportation system running through the middle of the club and elite decks, in a style very similar to the PeopleMover at Tomorrowland. (Do check out DaveLandWeb’s fantastic PeopleMover photo page for some great examples of the original in action.) The club deck’s circular PeopleMover loading area. Raised PeopleMover tracks running along the length of the club deck. The evolution of Disney’s PeopleMover concept began with the 1964–65 New York World’s Fair, for which the Ford Motor Company asked Disney to design an attraction to compete with General Motors’ Futurama II exhibit. The resulting Magic Skyway gave fairgoers an opportunity to ride in a driverless Ford convertible—including the just-launched Ford Mustang—through a diorama that transported them from prehistoric times to a futuristic space city. Following its success at the World’s Fair, the traction system behind Magic Skyway was adapted into a new feature for Tomorrowland’s 1967 relaunch. The new attraction, known as the WEDway PeopleMover, enabled Walter Elias Disney to follow Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren (of ALWEG monorail fame) in naming a futuristic transportation mechanism with his initials. It also provided an ideal inspiration for the Axiom’s central transport system. The Axiom’s PeopleMover has much in common with its WEDway counterpart. Both are focused on a main circular loading area in the heart of a central plaza, with a long, straight stretch of track extending away from the loading deck. Both give passengers a tantalizing view of surrounding attractions as they are transported from one area to another. Indeed, I am sure Walt Disney would have been delighted to see his dream of future transportation integrated into the Axiom’s space-age environment, especially given that Disneyland’s PeopleMover was a prototype for Walt’s grander vision of futuristic living. Walt planned to build a larger PeopleMover installation as part of his Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, or EPCOT—a new and futuristic city to be created from scratch at his planned Disney World Resort in Florida. In October 1966, Walt recorded a short film pitching his “Florida Project” to industrialists and legislators, including a detailed description of EPCOT’s transportation system. In this new city, cars and trucks were to be pushed underground, with the community’s twenty thousand residents instead traveling by WEDway and monorail to work, play, and socialize. The concept images below from Walt’s EPCOT film give an idea of just how much imagination the creative brains at WED Enterprises applied, under Walt’s careful guidance, to everyday living challenges. EPCOT’s transportation was planned on a radial system, as this schematic from Walt’s EPCOT film demonstrates. City residents use a series of PeopleMover systems (shown here as light blue spokes) to travel from their homes on the outskirts of the city to the central transport hub. Should they need to travel to other parts of Disney World, they then transfer to a high-speed monorail system (shown here in red). Concept art showing one half of EPCOT’s main transportation lobby. The longer-distance monorail service (right) runs through the center of the lobby, with shorter-distance WEDway PeopleMover services departing from the edges of the lobby (left). Cars and trucks are pushed underground into lower levels of the city’s transportation network (bottom). Concept art from the EPCOT film, showing a PeopleMover and Monorail passing through the city’s central shopping district. In Walt’s EPCOT proposal, the city’s WEDway PeopleMovers (shown here as light blue spokes) transport residents through the city’s greenbelt, past sports facilities and schools… …to residential areas in the city’s suburban districts, complete with footpaths and children’s play areas. Tragically, Walt Disney died less than two months after his EPCOT introduction was filmed, passing away before the pitch was screened and before New Tomorrowland opened to the public. His ambitious vision of a prototype community did not become a reality, but its name lives on in the Epcot theme park (formerly “EPCOT Center”) at Walt Disney World in Florida—although the eventual EPCOT park became more of a permanent World’s Fair than a real-life city of the future. The WEDway PeopleMover did not realize its potential, either: The Disneyland attraction closed in 1995, to be replaced by the faster (but short-lived) Rocket Rods ride, which itself closed in 2001. Disneyland park-goers can still see the PeopleMover’s abandoned tracks snaking through Tomorrowland, displaying curved, arched supports that Santiago Calatrava would surely approve of. (Thankfully, a PeopleMover can still be experienced at the Magic Kingdom park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, where the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover continues to provide a leisurely tour of nearby attractions.)

Of course, the PeopleMover also lives on via the Axiom, whose reimagining of the concept is almost a microcosm of Walt’s vision for EPCOT. Aboard the Axiom, it’s a PeopleMover (not a monorail) that fulfills the role of high-speed arterial transport, with individual BnL hover chairs completing the “final mile” of the journey via preset illuminated paths (blue for humans, white for robots, red for stewardbots). It may not match the scale of Disney’s EPCOT dream, but it’s nonetheless fitting that Walt’s vision of a transportational future made the trip into space. Illuminated paths provide hover-chair routes throughout the Axiom… …defining a “final mile” pathway to each passenger’s room. Here, the normally blue “human” pathways have turned bright green to indicate that plant life has been found and the Axiom is preparing to return to Earth. During WALL·E’s tour of the passenger decks, we discover that the Axiom’s computer is voiced by none other than Alien’s Ellen Ripley. Casting Sigourney Weaver as the disembodied voice of a space-based computer is clearly ironic, especially given her experience with such voices in Alien and Aliens. WALL·E ups the irony by having Weaver narrate not one but two scenes that would feel all too familiar to her xenomorph-hunting counterpart, triggering bonus space-peril associations for Alien fans. (Weaver also plays a disembodied voice in Andrew Stanton’s Finding Dory, aping her narration of nature documentaries.) “Twenty seconds to self-destruct,” says Ripley, as WALL·E tries in vain to stop his LifePod’s self-destruct sequence. Ripley knows what she’s talking about—she was counted down to self-destruction herself in Alien. “Activating airlock disposal,” says Ripley, as EVE and WALL·E try to avoid being sucked out of an industrial-sized airlock… …with spinning red lights around the sides. Ripley knows what she’s talking about—she narrowly avoided airlock doom herself in Aliens. Alien and Aliens are not the only sci-fi movies to get a nod from WALL·E. On the Axiom bridge, we meet AUTO, the ship’s autopilot robot. It might be hard to believe just by looking at him, but AUTO is actually an Evil Space-Based Computer. His design is clearly influenced by a certain other ESBC—that central red eye is a direct reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey’s HAL, giving an immediate signal that this robot is not to be trusted. AUTO, the Axiom autopilot. Aspects of his design may be familiar to those of you who have read the 2001 article. HAL, the Discovery One autopilot. Aspects of his design may be familiar to those of you who are reading this WALL·E article. AUTO’s physical similarity to HAL gives him a practical similarity, too. On the rare occasions we see the world from AUTO’s vantage point, we get an extreme fish-eye view of the surrounding area, just as we did for HAL in 2001. WALL·E combines HAL’s fish-eye view with The Terminator’s red HUD hue, making AUTO’s evil intent doubly clear to any discerning fan of sci-fi. AUTO’s fish-eye view, from WALL·E. HAL’s fish-eye view, from 2001: A Space Odyssey. AUTO and HAL belong to a long-standing tradition of sci-fi automata whose glowing red eye(s) give away their evil nature. They really are everywhere in sci-fi movies—from the Model 101 in The Terminator, via the replicants in Blade Runner, to the evil wriggly thing inserted into Neo’s belly button in The Matrix. After having all of its skin burnt off in a fire, The Terminator’s T-800 displays some impressive evil red eyes. The evil wriggly thing that works its way into Neo’s belly in The Matrix has a trademark evil red eye. The sentinels in The Matrix take evil red eyes to a whole new level. That red glow has its benefits, however. You can always tell when an evil robot has been finally defeated from the fact that its red eye(s) slowly fade to black. The Terminator’s T-800, The Matrix’s wriggly thing, and WALL·E’s AUTO all follow this trope when deactivated. As The Terminator’s T-800 is squished beneath the sheets of an industrial steel press, its evil red eye fades slowly to black. After removing the wriggly thing from Neo’s belly, Trinity discards it in the rain, where its evil red eye fades slowly to black. After switching the Axiom from autopilot to manual control, AUTO’s evil red eye fades slowly to black. AUTO may look like the movie’s bad guy, but his actions are simply an example of artificial intelligence following its programming too literally. To understand his motives, we must remember that BnL’s original plan was for its star liners to return to Earth as soon as an EVE probe found proof that life was once more sustainable. Five years after their departure, however, BnL autopilots were sent a directive by CEO Shelby Forthright telling them to keep their craft in space indefinitely, because the cleanup process on Earth was not going to succeed. Six hundred and ninety-five years later, with no subsequent instructions to the contrary, AUTO is simply following this command to the letter, blocking any and all attempts to return to Earth. In this regard, AUTO is eerily similar to 2001’s HAL, whose murderous tendencies aboard the Discovery were similarly driven by an inability to reconcile a contradiction in his programming. In the movie’s sequel, 2010: The Year We Make Contact, we learn that the basic purpose of HAL’s design was “the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment.” We also discover that HAL was instructed (via Directive NSD 342/23) to lie to Dave and Frank about the real reason for the Discovery’s mission. After lip-reading that they planned to disconnect him, HAL determined that the only logical way for him to both keep processing and avoid lying was for Dave and Frank to die. AUTO’s own instruction is Directive A113, whose numbering may sound familiar to Pixar fans. “A113” appears in every Pixar film, from a family license plate in Toy Story to an underwater camera model in Finding Nemo. (Indeed, it’s even in Brave, where the roman numerals ACXIII appear carved just above the front door of a witch’s hut.) The reason for its repeated inclusion is that room A1-13 was the classroom for the Character Animation Program at the California Institute of the Arts, where Pixar alumni John Lasseter, Pete Docter, and Andrew Stanton studied. (This explains why it’s also the number on the door of Riley’s classroom in Inside Out, and on the Scaring 101 classroom door in Monsters University.) WALL·E may be its highest-profile outing, but it’s there in every Pixar movie if you keep your eyes peeled. AUTO triggers Directive A113. The majority of WALL·E’s robots are voiced by Ben Burtt, the Academy Award-winning sound designer and creator of R2D2’s bleeps. AUTO’s voice, however, is provided by MacInTalk, a speech synthesis technology first used to announce the Apple Macintosh computer in January 1984. (You may also recognize MacInTalk as the lead vocalist on Radiohead’s “Fitter Happier,” from 1997’s OK Computer album.) MacInTalk’s inclusion in WALL·E makes it one of only two Apple voice synthesis technologies to star in a feature film; the other is Siri, who provides the voice for ’Puter, Batman’s high-tech assistant in The LEGO Batman Movie. “‘Puter”, Batman’s Siri-based computer assistant, from The LEGO Batman Movie. (The Batmobile’s interfaces are, perhaps inevitably, set in Eurostile Bold.) Despite the technology’s age, I’m happy to report that MacInTalk voices still ship with macOS today. If you’d like to turn your Mac into an Evil Space-Based Computer, simply open the System Preferences application, select Accessibility and then Speech, and enable the “Ralph” system voice. In addition to AUTO, there are two more nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey in WALL·E, both of which take advantage of preexisting associations for dramatic or comedic effect. The first is WALL·E’s brief escapade in a LifePod, the design of which seems clearly inspired by 2001’s EVA pods. That iconic ball-like shape immediately triggers an association with interstellar peril, which WALL·E soon discovers is entirely justified. One of the Discovery’s EVA pods is activated in 2001: A Space Odyssey. One of the Axiom’s LifePods is activated in WALL·E. The pod design in 2001 has many similarities with its WALL·E counterpart… …though it does not (as far as we know) include an optional satellite dish, parachute, flare set, or inflatable life raft. The second 2001 reference is a knowing usage of Richard Strauss’s Also sprach Zarathustra, when Captain McCrea becomes the first human to stand up and walk in possibly hundreds of years. It’s an appropriate enough use of the music—2001’s monoliths oversee (and supposedly trigger) several leaps in mankind’s evolution, so it’s entirely valid to hear those famous chords when the captain makes his first steps (even though this is technically a regression, not an evolution). Determined to tackle the mutinous AUTO, Captain McCrea steadies himself… …and drags himself to his feet, to the tune of Also sprach Zarathustra. Of course, WALL·E is not alone in riffing on Strauss’s classic melody. It is similarly parodied in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (as a 2001 monolith turns into a bar of chocolate) and Zoolander (as Hansel considers smashing Mugatu’s iMac with a nearby bone). If that’s not enough, it’s also in Pixar’s Toy Story 2 and Cars 3, plus other animated movies including Kung Fu Panda 3, The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!, and The Simpsons Movie. On the live-action front, it’s in Man on the Moon, Catch-22, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, Clueless, Turner & Hooch, and Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, to mention just a few. In 2005’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Willy Wonka transports a bar of chocolate via television to the tune of Also sprach Zarathustra… …transforming 2001’s famous monolith into a bar of Wonka Nutty Crunch Surprise. In 2001’s Zoolander, non-evolved male models Derek Zoolander and Hansel smack an iMac chimpanzee-style to the tune of Also sprach Zarathustra… …before Hansel grabs a handy bone to use as a tool. Despite AUTO’s best efforts, McCrea manages to switch him to MANUAL and sets the Axiom on a hyperjump trajectory back to Earth. The hyperjump looks exactly like you’d expect, which is exactly like the USS Enterprise engaging warp drive in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. The Axiom makes a hyperjump toward Earth in WALL·E. The Enterprise engages warp drive toward “thataway” in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Once again, WALL·E is sneakily using prior sci-fi art as a shortcut, re-creating familiar effects so that the Axiom’s quick journey home can be explained without exposition. (It might also account for why everyone aboard the Axiom experiences a brief stint of The Motion Picture’s wormhole effect during the jump.) The Enterprise bridge goes all “wormhole effect” when it engages warp speed while still within the solar system. EVE and WALL·E go all “wormhole effect” when the Axiom hyperjumps back to Earth. As these homages show, WALL·E is not afraid to borrow from its predecessors to gain some free sci-fi association. Indeed, such references are celebrated and elevated, drawing on the production team’s clear fondness for vintage sci-fi to create a movie that is both a love letter to the classics and a worthy addition to the list. WALL·E capitalizes on our existing associations with the future to communicate complex plot points and motives with minimal dialogue and text. It is, to my mind, Pixar’s most realistic vision of an internally consistent world, despite the polar opposites of its Earth- and space-based environments. It’s political and satirical, representing utopia and dystopia with enough humor to poke fun at the downsides of both. In short, WALL·E envisages a future that could so easily be bleak and pessimistic—but is instead inspired by the naïveté of its inhuman heroes to re-create the optimism that took man into space in the first place. Wow! That was good, wasn’t it? What an amazing article! So amazing, in fact, that you probably want to impulse-buy the Typeset in the Future book it comes from, right this very second. Here are some convenient links to buy it from Amazon or Barnes and Noble, or you can head down to your local bookstore (which it is much harder for me to link to) when the book is released on December 11 2018. The book also includes an interview with Pixar designers Ralph Eggleston and Craig Foster about the making of WALL·E, plus six more equally amazing movie studies, alongside interviews with Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall) and Mike Okuda (Star Trek).

I think this is a neat portrayal of how differently designers and engineers reason about design topics. I was surprised to see an article about type that didn't involve code editors so heavily upvoted on HN, but as soon as I read the first few paragraphs, I realized why-- it was clearly written by an engineer that has learned a lot about design, and not a designer. There's nothing wrong with that! It's a cool and very well-researched design history deep dive that explores the network of references and roots of the type used, how it was used as a storytelling element, and that sort of thing. If this was written by a type designer, they'd have been discussing very different things-- why the letterform shapes hit like they do, what design problems they solve, the conceptual and emotional references these shapes make rather than which concrete symbols they relate to, the general rounded square shapes, their negative space, how the lack of stroke contrast makes it hit differently than similar less uniform characters, kerning concerns, etc. For example, here's Matthew Carter-- one of the more famous type designers-- digging into some of the more unusual type design he's done: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RojKQ-w9zn8&t=745s The person that wrote this article knows a lot more about how this type is used from a modern art perspective, but there's a difference between knowing art history and being able to wield the underlying principles to work with these things as an artist or designer. I think a good example of this is film fans that spend a lot of time on TV Tropes an the like, which are rather like informal film critics. That knowledge is a base requirement for great critical analysis, but if I needed to hire someone to create a film, I'd favor an undergrad film student that was in diapers when the film fan started digging into TV Tropes. Why? It's just a fundamentally different way of reasoning about the same thing. The fan is more concerned with the \"whats\" and \"whens\", and the student is more concerned with the \"hows\", and that gives each of them have a totally different perspective on the \"whys\". I think creators need to watch out with this. Especially in the nerdier genres, if they're so focused on the film itself that they disregard factors like context and overall story continuity, watching that film is a meaningfully worse experience because they're often more invested in the universe/characters/etc. than they are with the making any give story arc or character pop for a given movie. On the other hand, if we hand too much control to the people primarily interested in the context and story continuity at the expense of any individual film's story and artistic value... well... have you seen the Star Wars prequels? Back to the article, I could see someone without education in type design reading this article getting the impression that they understand the typographical elements in this film. They definitely understand how the typography was used, but that's a lot different than being able to reason about these things like designers do. A more concrete example would be an in-depth article about the cars in the fast and furious movies, complete with the cultural references of each modification and the purposes they serve. It would be cool and informative, but it wouldn't bring the reader any closer to being an auto designer. A lot of developers, in particular, get annoyed when I push back against their misconceptions about design. It's not an insult-- it's just not their area of expertise. Usually, they don't know enough about it to realize how little they know about it-- like anybody else with any deep topic they don't know. I've heard designers that have cargo-culted tutorial code into some wordpress plugin spew absolute nonsense about everything from data structures to network architecture with the confidence of someone that just got accepted to a prestigious CS doctoral program. That said, it's easier for non-technical people to see that they don't understand software development because it's easy to see they don't understand the terse error messages, stack traces, code syntax, terminology, etc. It's more difficult in the other direction. Visual design, broadly, is visual communication; for a design to be good, at a bare minimum, it must present cohesive messages or ideas to its intended audience. Many things that look the simplest while still solving all of their goals were the most difficult to make-- you can tell when non-designers copy it because it might look simple, but it probably doesn't effectively communicate everything it needs to-- and that's every bit as true for UI design as it is branding and identity design, and poster design. The complexity in that process is only apparent if you've tried to solve difficult, specific communication problems with a bunch of real-world constraints, grappled with the semiotics, tried to make it stand out, etc. etc. etc. and then had it torn apart by people who've done it a lot longer than you. I can see why someone that doesn't understand what's happening under the hood thinks a designer's main job is making things attractive, like an amateur interior decorator. In reality, that's not even always a requirement-- it often is a natural result of properly communicating your message. What we do is more akin to interior architecture: the functionality comes first. So the next time you see someone suggesting something like allowing custom color themes to your app to \"improve UX,\" maybe consider consulting an experienced UI or UX designer to see what they think. If their suggestions revolve around making it prettier or hiding everything behind menus because functionality is ugly, I conceptually owe you a beer. reply ben_ 8 hours agoprevCool article but this first bit threw me off > The interpunct is still in use today—it’s the official decimal point in British currency (£9·99) When the linked wiki specifically points out that it isn't: > In British typography, the space dot was once used as the formal decimal point. reply jonathanlydall 6 hours agoparentFun fact, Windows 8 changed the decimal separator for the South African locale from a period to a comma. My theory is that some academic or idiot government official told Microsoft they're not using the official separator who duly fixed it. But in practice every \"normal\" person in the country used a period as a separator. By default, Excel now uses a comma separator for decimals. Which unless I change it, makes it especially fun when I want to paste values into my banking website which (like most of the country) uses a period as a separator. Really, it would have been way more pragmatic if South Africa just changed its official decimal separator. It also caused some annoying issues on our .NET with SQL Server software project. For example SQL seed scripts inserting decimal values would break depending on if they were being run on Windows 7 or 8.

As a rough comparison, if a food item contains 160 calories, we know that's 160 kilocalories - and calorie isn't an SI unit.

Some times I wonder if there's any way to trade away accuracy for speed? Like, often I don't care _exactly_ how many bytes is the biggest user of space, but I just want to see some orders of magnitude. Maybe there could be an iterative breadth-first approach, where first you quickly identify and discard the small unimportant items, passing over anything that can't be counted quickly. Then with what's left you identify the smallest of those and discard, and then with what's left the smallest of those, and repeat and repeat. Each pass through, you get a higher resolution picture of which directories and files are using the most space, and you just wait until you have the level of detail you need, but you get to see the tally as it happens across the board. Does this exist? reply mos_basik 14 hours agoparentSomething like that exists for btrfs; it's called bdtu. It has the accuracy/time trade-off you're interested in, but the implementation is quite different. It samples random points on the disk and finds out what file path they belong to. The longer it runs the more accurate it gets. The readme is good at explaining why this approach makes sense for btrfs and what its limitations are. https://github.com/CyberShadow/btdu reply oehpr 28 minutes agorootparentThat is so cool!!! I have always wanted something like this! Arg I wish other filesystems supported a strategy like this! reply renewiltord 14 hours agorootparentprevDamn, `ext4` is organized differently entirely. You can't get anything useful from: sudo debugfs -R \"icheck $RANDOM\" /dev/nvme1 sudo debugfs -R \"ncheck $res\" /dev/nvme1 and recursing. That's a clever technique given btrfs structs. reply jszymborski 14 hours agorootparentprevThat's so cool. reply 201984 16 hours agoparentprevThanks! What you described is a neat idea, but it's not possible with any degree of accuracy AFAIK. To give you a picture of the problem, calculating the disk usage of a directory requires calling statx(2) on every file in that directory, summing up the reported sizes, and then recursing into every subdirectory and starting over. The problem with doing a partial search is that all the data is at the leaves of the tree, so you'll miss some potentially very large files. Picture if your program only traversed the first, say, three levels of subdirectories to get a rough estimate. If there was a 1TB file down another level, your program would miss it completely and get a very innaccurate estimate of the disk usage, so it wouldn't be useful at all for finding the biggest culprits. You have the same problem if you decide to stop counting after seeing N files, since file N+1 could be gigantic and you'd never know. reply montroser 15 hours agorootparentYeah, maybe approximation is not really possible. But it still seems like if you could do say, up to 1000 stats per directory per pass, then running totals could be accumulated incrementally and reported along the way. So after just a second or two, you might be able to know with certainty that a bunch of small directories are small, and then that a handful of others are at least however big has been counted so far. And that could be all you need, or else you could wait longer to see how the bigger directories play out. reply geertj 15 hours agorootparentYou would still have to getdents() everything but this way you may indeed save on stat() operations, which access information that is stored separately on disk and eliminating these would likely help uncached runs. You could sample files in a directory or across directories to get an average file size and use the total number of files from getdents to estimate a total size. This does require you to know if a directory entry is a file or directory, which the d_type field gives you depending on the OS, file system and other factors. An average file size could also be obtained from statvfs(). Another trick is based on the fact that the link count of a directory is 2 + the number of subdirectories. Once you have seen the corresponding number of subdirectories, you know that there are no more subdirectories you need to descend into. This could allow you to abort a getdents for a very large directory, using eg the directory size to estimate the total entries. reply olddustytrail 7 hours agorootparent> Another trick is based on the fact that the link count of a directory is 2 + the number of subdirectories. For anyone who doesn't know why this is, it's because when you create a directory it has 2 hard links to it which are dirname dirname/. When you add a new subdirectory it adds one more link which is dirname/subdir/.. So each subdirectory adds one more to the original 2. reply BeeOnRope 16 hours agoparentprevThis seems difficult since I'm not aware of any way to get approximate file sizes, at least with the usual FS-agnostic system calls: to get any size info you are pretty much calling something in the `stat` family and at that point you have the exact size. reply fsckboy 16 hours agorootparenti thought files can be sparse and have holes in the middle where nothing is allocated, so the file size is not what is used to calculate usage, it's the sum of the extents or some such. reply BeeOnRope 16 hours agorootparentYes, files can be sparse but the actual disk usage information is also returned by these stat-family calls, so there is no special cost to handling sparse files. reply lenkite 14 hours agoparentprevWish modern filesystems maintained usage per dir as a directory file attribute instead of mandating tools to do this basic job. reply nh2 13 hours agorootparentCephFS does that. You can use getfattr to ask it for the recursive number of entries or bytes in a given directory. Querying it is constant time, updates update it with a few seconds delay. Extremely useful when you have billions of files on spinning disks, where running du/ncdu would take a month just for the stat()s. reply hsbauauvhabzb 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is an excellent point and I wholeheartedly agree! reply masklinn 13 hours agorootparentIs it? That would require any update to any file to cascade into a bunch of directory updates amplifying the write and for what? Do you “du” in your shell prompt? Not to mention it would likely be unable to handle the hardlink problem so it would consistently be wrong. reply IsTom 9 hours agorootparent> That would require any update to any file to cascade into a bunch of directory updates amplifying the write and for what?

I have the suspicion that some file systems store stat info next to the getdents entries. Thus cache locality would kick in if you stat a file after receiving it via getdents (and counterintuitively, smaller getdents buffers make it faster then). Also in such cases it would be important to not sort combined getdents outputs before starting (which would destroy the locality again). I found such a situation with CephFS but don't know what the layout is for common local file systems. reply IAmLiterallyAB 15 hours agoprevI'm surprised statx was that much faster than fstatat. fstatat looks like a very thin wrapper around statx, it just calls vfs_statx and copies out the result to user space. reply 201984 15 hours agoparentOut of curiosity, I switched it back to fstatat and compared, and found no significant difference.

I don't use hard links much, so I wouldn't expect this to be because of shared data. - The tree rendering is very confusing. Some directories are several levels deep, but in this output they're all jumbled, so it's not clear where they exist on disk. Showing the full path with the `-p` option, and removing indentation with `-i 0` somewhat helps, but I would almost remove tree rendering entirely. reply 201984 6 hours agoparentIt is being sorted by the first column, but it also keeps subdirectories with each other. Look at the order of your top-level directories. 3.2G 0B |- .pyenv 3.4G 0B |- .rustup 9.2G 0B |- Work 16G 4.0K |- Downloads 17G 183M |- src 28G 0B |- Music 34G 183M /- .local If you don't want the tree output and only want the top directories, you can use `-d 1` to limit to depth=1. reply imiric 6 hours agorootparentAh, I see, that makes sense. But still, the second `Videos` directory of 3.7G is a subdirectory of `Music`, so it should appear below it, no?

One small surprise I found came when I have a symlink to a directory and refer to that with a trailing \"/\". dut doesn't follow the link in order to scan the real directory.

Despite this, there is a lot of confusion around the right way of building software for financial systems. In this post, I’ll share lessons from my years working on financial systems at big tech companies. Our focus will be building an accounting system, but the principles apply to more general financial systems as well. This post will go over the following Basic financial definitions relevant to the post High level goals of an accounting system Engineering principles to achieve those goals Best Practices Definitions General Ledger (GL): The primary accounting record of the company, summarizing all financial transactions over a specific time period. You can think of this as an aggregation of it's corresponding sub-ledgers. Sub-ledger: Contains detailed information about all individual transactions related to a specific GL. Records in the sub ledger will have much more granular data then the general ledger, like who the specific customer is, specific line items in an order, etc. The difference in data between the sub-ledger and GL will depend on the type of business and volume of data you are working with. Some small businesses can get away with not having any sub-ledgers at all, but it is doubtful that they would ever need custom software to manage something that is so low in scale. Financial Record: This refers to the general ledger and sub-ledgers. Material: Materiality refers to whether misstatement of information in your financial statements would impact a reasonable stakeholder’s decision making statements. Note that this definition is somewhat ambiguous by design, as different businesses have different materiality thresholds. For example what might be material for a business making $250,000 of revenue per year, will not be material for a business making $1 billion in revenue. From an design perspective, the main value of this concept is to classify different categories of financial data. High Level Data Flow Goals The three main goals of your accounting system are to be (1) Accurate, (2) Auditable and (3) Timely. Accurate The financial record needs to reflect the known state of the business. This statement is a little broad and up to some interpretation so I will give some real examples. If we sell a 10 units of a product that costs $9.99, the corresponding financial records must add up to $99.90. This seems obvious but when you are aggregating thousands (in a lot of cases millions) of transactions, simple summation or rounding errors between systems can cause material inaccuracies. Wasteman’s Note: People say naming is the hardest problem in computer science, I would say a close second is addition. After working on large scale financial systems for the past few years, I can’t remember how many times the smallest bugs caused large discrepancies in our data. Also don’t get me started on summations over floats. I learned the hard way why you should always use integers. The financial record also needs to be complete. More specifically, both the sub-ledger and the general ledger are a complete representation of all business activities that occurred at a specific time. If there is an event that occurred but is not in the financial record, than the system is not complete. Note, that this doesn’t imply eventual consistency not acceptable. You just need to know when your data will become complete, to notify stakeholders that data has settled. Wasteman’s Note: Another surprisingly really hard problem is guaranteeing completeness. As your system scales, data hops between many systems and at each hop data can easily be mutated or dropped by accident. Auditable Very related to accuracy, your financial record must be easily auditable so that stakeholders can detect errors and accurately measure performance of your business. And even if you don’t care, the IRS definitely does. Timely This one depends entirely on your business and it's specific needs. Small businesses can get away with just dumping all numbers near the end of the month, just in time to close the books. Larger businesses generally want to avoid this, and have a near real time system. This allows them to monitor financials within the month, make decisions based on financial data faster, and reduce the rush to close the month/quarter in the first few days of the month. But whatever that need is, our accounting system should meet the needs of your business, and whatever timely means to them. Wasteman’s note: People tend to get lost in conversations about batch vs streaming systems with respect to timeliness a lot. My take is that this isn’t an important distinction to make for most systems. If you care about super low latency cases within seconds to minutes, then this matters. But you would be surprised at how often I hear people arguing about which to do, when the consumer doesn’t need to see updates more than a couple times a day. Just because they asked for it doesn’t mean they need it. Enjoying this post? Consider subscribing to my newsletter for free Subscribe Engineering Principles The three main engineering principles your accounting system should abide by are Immutability and Durability of data Data should be represented at the smallest grain Code should be Idempotent Immutable and Durable This allows for auditability, which helps debugging and in turn accuracy. When data is immutable, you have a record of what the state of the system was at any given time. This makes it really easy to recompute the world from previous states, because no state is every lost. Building on, once data is stated in the financial record it cannot be deleted. Any corrections to the system must be represented as a new financial transaction. For example let’s say your system had a bug and accidentally reported that a service was sold for $1000, when it should have been $900. To correct this mistake, you should first reverse the accounting entries corresponding to the mistake, and restate the accounting entry for the correct amount. It will look something like this: So you can see that in the financial record, there is evidence that the balance of Accounts Receivable (AR) and Revenue was $1000 at some point, but was corrected later. Even though that balance was incorrect, we want an audit trail of what the balance was at any given moment. Data recorded at the smallest grain Similar to the above principle, this is also critical for enabling a clear audit trail. Even though financial reports and the general ledger are aggregated, they are computed from more granular events. When the data doesn't make sense, you need the most granular data to debug what might have been the issue. Saving data at the lowest granularity also makes it really easy to correct data that is derived from that dataset. If a single immutable dataset is the core source of truth for all views of that data, to correct the view all you need to do is rerun the pipeline that creates that view after fixing your data. Similarly when accountants are preparing to close the books, they reconcile account balances with all the transactions that occurred to validate that the books are accurate. When a discrepancy is discovered, you can dig into the exact transaction that might be causing the issue. Idempotency Every financial event can only be processed once, duplicates in the financial record will cause obvious inaccuracies. For that reason, all code that produces financial records should be idempotent. Best Practices Over the years, I have run into quite a few gotchas that have caused me a lot of pain. Below are best practices I recommend, to avoid the many pitfalls I have personally faced. Prefer integers to represent financial amounts. Makes arithmetic much easier. Certain decimal representations are okay, avoid floats at all cost. Granularity of your financial amounts should support currency conversions with minimal loss of precision. If you are only working with dollars, representing values in cents might be sufficient. If you are a global business, prefer micros or a decimal like DECIMAL(19, 4). The decimal choice is quite popular among financial systems, but micros has been the standard for ads financial systems. This limits loss of precision when converting between currencies. Wasteman’s note: Micros of a currency = smallest unit * 1,000,000. E.g $1.23 = 1,230,000 micros. I first came across this when working with Google’s metrics API. Use consistent rounding methodologies. At scale the way you round can create material differences between expected amounts. For example one rounding methodology is to round all values 5 and up to the next significant digit, and 4 and below rounds down. Another valid way is to always round up. All that matters is you are consistent across the board. When you are dealing with millions of transactions, being off by 1 cent per transaction can lead to material differences. (10 million transactions off by 1 cent, leads to a difference of $100k). This may not be material to your business at this scale, but it’s material enough for the government to come after you for underpaying taxes. Wasteman’s note: If you are a global business there can be a lot of gotchas with rounding and currency conversions. I would go as far as saying you should make a centralized library/service to handle both rounding and currency conversions. Different governments respect different rounding rules when calculating taxes, so having all these nuances abstracted into a single service will reduce complexity. Delay currency conversion as long as you can. Preemptively converting currencies can cause loss of precision. Delay currency conversions until after aggregations occur in their local currency. Use integer representations of time. This one is a little controversial but I stand by it. There are so many libraries in different technologies that parse timestamps into objects, and they all do them differently. Avoid this headache and just use integers. Unix timestamp, or even integer based UTC datetimes work perfectly fine. The less data conversions that occur between systems, the better. (Read about Etsy’s own problems with timestamp types here) Wasteman’s note: I haven’t even talked about daylight savings related bugs. Using an incrementing integer can help you avoid this altogether. If you really insist on using datetimestamps, please at least use UTC. You would be surprised at how many very large businesses use non UTC timestamps.

Avoid this headache and just use integers. Unix timestamp, or even integer based UTC datetimes work perfectly fine. Warning: This only works for times that are either firmly in the past or which represent a future delay-offset which is totally under your own exclusive control. For example, suppose your company has a 48 hour cancellation policy. You can probably compute a future timestamp and use that, it won't depend on whether a customer is about to hit a DST transition or leap-seconds or whatever. nsition.

This means your underlying source-of-truth needs to be the matching conditions, and that often means storing the time-zone. reply amluto 9 hours agoparent> Unix timestamp, or even integer based UTC datetimes work perfectly fine. For serious work, it’s worth noting that leap seconds are not representable in this format. Many financial applications can get away without representing leap seconds, but this is fundamentally a kludge. If you actually need to represent any point in time (according to UTC or any particular timezone), use a representation that actually represents what you want. This is especially true for future times. If you mean “10 AM, August 1, 2025, New York time”, then represent that! Do not kludge it as an integer, do not use a different time zone as a proxy, do not use UTC, and don’t use a representation that contains the terms “standard” or “daylight”. If you do this wrong, you will eventually regret it. Bonus points for also being able to represent future leap seconds, I suppose, but I’ve never encountered any need to do that. Keep in mind that those properly represented future times are not guaranteed to ever happen. Time zone definitions can and do change. (And, since this is finance, you also get to deal with bank holidays, past, present, and future. Your legal department may have opinions about what should happen when a future date, that you thought wouldn’t be a bank holiday, turns out to be a bank holiday after all.) (Also, since this is finance, sometimes people will want to translate a time into a date. This can be a nontrivial operation. The date associated with a timestamp may or may not matter for actual business purposes, and various parties may or may not agree about what date a certain time belongs to and may or may not implement their opinion correctly.) reply throwaway2037 5 hours agorootparentIs there any financial system, regime, or product that depends upon leap seconds? I have never heard of any. If so, it is safe to ignore them. When storing date/time stamps, I prefer to persist into two separate fields: (a) date/time using UTC time zone and (b) original time zone offset, e.g., UTC+8. When debugging, it is useful to know the original time zone offset. And when querying and processing data, it is easier to use UTC time zone. reply gradschool 2 hours agorootparent> If so, it is safe to ignore them. if you say so, but don't whinge if someone pulls off a major heist during a leap second by counting on you to ignore it https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137494/ reply HWR_14 3 hours agorootparentprev> Is there any financial system, regime, or product that depends upon leap seconds?

I have never heard of any. They’re certainly unusual. > If so, it is safe to ignore them. Really? Leap seconds have happened, and they could plausibly happen again. If so, during those leap seconds, events will occur. Do you need to record the time of those events? > When storing date/time stamps, I prefer to persist into two separate fields: (a) date/time using UTC time zone and (b) original time zone offset, e.g., UTC+8. That covers most bases for past events. It is inappropriate for many future events. Hmm, maybe a good system library would have separate types for timestamps that were actually observed (or interpolated or otherwise computed after the fact, etc) and for times of events that may not have occurred at the time of computation. reply throwaway2037 4 hours agoparentprevIn Java, the original date/times were awful in the base library. Eventually, a very good replacement appeared called Joda-Time. Eventually, a \"fix-all-the-design-flaws\" 2.0 version was officially added to the base library as part of JSR-310. Excluding leap seconds (for which I have no practical need), I have never once found something that it cannot handle -- no matter how complex my conversion and calculation needs. A few other languages have basically ported Joda-Time or JSR-310 into their own. In 2024, date/time math feels like a hard, but solved problem with the correct libraries. And last: I really like your example about Ruritania and the 48 cancellation policy. Sure, the country name is intended as a joke, but in the Real World all kinds of crazy things like this. Even Islamic calendars can be quite complex in 2024 -- knowing what days will be holidays in the future is a non-trivial task. reply szundi 11 hours agoparentprevI like this answer as usually the world changes that cannot be easily ported to code makes software shit at the end. reply Terr_ 11 hours agorootparentI like to quip that many hard technical-problems are actually three business-problems in a trenchcoat. In this case, the technical outgrowth might be heroic over-weekend crunch: Write some code that finds every affected timestamp in the DB, reconstructs the various code-chains that created them, divines an \"original meaning\", calculates the difference, and somehow apply changes in a way that doesn't make auditors angry or lock a key table for and hour or leads to data-corruption from race conditions... reply bigiain 11 hours agoparentprevAlso: > Granularity of your financial amounts should ... ... comply with relevant regulations. I worked on a gambling webapp a long time back - we were bound by government regulations on gambling licences to perform all calculations at a precision of one ten thousandth of a cent, and were only permitted to round to cents once at the very end just before displaying a dollar amount to a person. (This suited me down to the ground because I pointed out to everybody that Javascript couldn't be guaranteed to treat numbers and calculations in a way that would keep the regulators auditors happy, and managed to push _every_ calculation involving dollar amounts off to the Java backend team.) We also used integer UTC milliseconds for time, so we'd have good enough for the auditors timestamps showing who placed a valid bet at (say) 12:34:59.9997 and who else place an invalid bet at 12:35:00.0003 for a wager with a cut off time of 12:35. (We asked for and got a ruling from the regulators that the time that mattered was the time the API call was processed by the backend, since network latencies between the webapp and the backend platform were impossible to predict. I have no idea if the backend had millisecond accurate time, that wasn't my problem and I _so_ didn't want to have them make it my problem by asking the question.) reply HWR_14 3 hours agorootparent> This suited me down to the ground because I pointed out to everybody that Javascript couldn't be guaranteed to treat numbers and calculations in a way that would keep the regulators auditors happy, Javascript can represent dollar values up to $2.25 billion at a resolution of ten-thousandths of a cent without any loss of precision. I would want all money calculations done by the backend team as a matter of policy. But it's not a technical limitation. reply Sammi 5 hours agorootparentprevLuckily javascript has bigint now, so you can do this stuff safely in js now (just don't do it in the frontend ever, because you cannot trust the frontend). reply throwaway2037 4 hours agorootparentprevYou wrote \"a long time back\", so maybe my point can be ignored. Did you not consider to use decimal math? According to MDN, the largest int in Javascript is 2^53 – 1. If you steal four digits for your fraction, that still leaves a huge number. I will assume that no one was gambling more than one billion currency units, so you had plenty of space. Do all your calcs with ints, then divide by 10,000 for a final result.

Use a good relational database. 1. ACID, so you don't have to invent it. 2. Arbitrary precision numeric data types with vetted operations and rounding modes. 3. It does time as well as anyone can 4. Your computations and reporting can be done entirely in SQL. 5. When you get good at SQL or hire someone who is, the reporting is elegant. 6. It's as fast as it needs to be, and a good database architect can make it extremely fast. 7. It has all of the tooling to do disaster prevention and recovery. I've built so many financial systems for the biggest multinationals in the world, and I have never regretted doing the bulk of the work in the database. Coca-Cola, GE, UPS, AIG, every iteration of the Tycos, basically every pharma with their crazy transfer pricing schemes... Whenever I experienced a performance problem, there have been way to address it that were far easier than what would have been to reinvent all of the hard tech that underlies consistent, accurate financial systems. reply throwaway2037 4 hours agoparentThe best systems that I have ever seen have two parts: (a) a read/write relational database (w/SQL) to persist data and (b) a read-only OLAP cube. With enough time, your powerusers will create the most insane reports imaginable using the OLAP cube view. reply tumetab1 7 hours agoparentprev> 2. Arbitrary precision numeric data types with vetted operations and rounding modes. Be aware that a good rationale for choosing the database but you should enforce a specific precision per table otherwise you can get nasty accounting bugs because you're adding a 3.0095 amount with an 9.99 amount. reply ibejoeb 7 hours agorootparentYes. The data type itself supports arbitrary precision. I'm not suggesting that you chose the precision arbitrarily. reply throwaway2037 4 hours agoparentprevWhat is the meaning of \"high finance\"? reply ibejoeb 4 hours agorootparentSpecialty stuff like high frequency trading, risk models, bespoke instruments, and other non-retail products. Like if you're doing HFT, you're probably rolling your own loops. But the broader point is that this piece is about accounting-related systems that don't typically deal with hard volume, speed, or latency constraints. The term \"finance\" can mean the corporate \"finance & accounting department\" but you want to differentiate that from \"finance\" the industry. The headline does really tell you what actual material is. reply seanhunter 3 hours agorootparentFor HFT, risk models, exotic products etc you still are almost certainly better off doing your bookkeeping using a normal database. In my experience[1] you want to make sure the financial records are consistent and accurate and able at all times to be reconciled to third parties no matter what lifecycle events happen on your trades and you want that record to be out of band with your actual decisionmaking stuff which is the bit that needs to be fast and/or complex. For exotics specifically, the contracts often specify exactly how things like rounding etc should be handled so you need to be able to implement custom logic to do that accurately or you'll get constant annoying price breaks of a few cents and your ops people will hate you because they'll keep having to reconcile things with counterparties. [1] Fast equities trading and slow complex exotics and bonds trading/pricing/risk. Strictly speaking the fast thing was algo trading[2] rather than actual HFT but we were counting microseconds etc so it's similar in the time constraint. [2] The distinction I would draw is algo trading is algorithmic execution of client orders in a brokerage setting vs HFT is proprietary trading like you would do in a hedge fund. In algo trading a lot of thought goes into how you can ensure your clients are not able to be ripped off by HFTs in the market, so they are sort of the adversary even though a lot of what you're doing is similar from an execution pov. reply nostrademons 1 hour agorootparentYou should do your bookkeeping in a normal database, but the models themselves usually need something specialized. Ideally keep them in cache/RAM, because if you have to hit the disk you'll probably get beaten to execution by another HFT. If the data set is too large to keep in RAM (and you can't afford to just buy more computers), then page out portions to flash and mmap them back in when you need to. (Ironically, this is sort of how programs were constructed in the 1970s before the days of virtual memory, filesystem abstractions, and file formats.) reply seanhunter 1 hour agorootparentAbsolutely. Our models didn't look anything like most programs I have worked on elsewhere in terms of architecture etc. But the execution/bookkeeping records just went into a conventional sql db out of band from the main routing/strategy logic. reply dmoy 4 hours agorootparentprevYea this article really should have used \"accounting\" instead of \"finance\" (or more specifically, operational accounting). Right, like, if you're a programmer going into a project-for-finance/accounting-team at your large megacorp, and don't know if this article is the right subject area, just ask the finance/accounting person about \"year end close\" and see if they get a thousand yard stare or not. If yes, this is the right article lol. reply Galanwe 12 hours agoprevI wouldn't endorse many of the things stated there. A lot of the points are inaccurate or straight up misleading. > The three main goals of your accounting system are to be (1) Accurate, (2) Auditable and (3) Timely. You forgot \"consistent\", which is very different from \"accurate\". Most financial transactions have multiple time dimensions: a trade is requested, booked, filled, matched, reconciliated, paid, settled at different times. These times often don't even follow a perfectly logical order (you can request and fill a trade and book it an hour later). These time dimensions are often why there are multiple, layered, ledgers to store transactions. An accounting system needs to provide consistent views that depend on the dimension you want to look at (e.g. a trade that is filled but not settled counts for front office accounting, not for back office accounting). > If there is an event that occurred but is not in the financial record, than the system is not complete. The base assumption of every (working) accounting system I have worked with is the reverse. There WILL be transactions that flow through the system in an untimely manner, your system needs to handle that, thus the need for multiple layers of ledgers, and the necessity to batch reconciliation processes between these layers. You will book trades after they are filled. You will pay materials before inputing the bill. Etc. > If you are only working with dollars, representing values in cents might be sufficient. If you are a global business, prefer micros or a DECIMAL(19, 4). If you are a global business only working with euro and dollar maybe. Otherwise most FX markets quote to 8 decimals, and that's not counting swaps. I would recommend using at least 8 decimal places for storage. > Delay currency conversion as long as you can. Preemptively converting currencies can cause loss of precision. No! Delay currency conversion _until conversion occurs_! An accounting system does not convert currencies at will. There is no dollar equivalent to euro, you either have dollars or euro. And it's not a matter of rounding errors, cash management is part of legal and accounting duties. reply amluto 8 hours agoparent> Most financial transactions have multiple time dimensions: a trade is requested, booked, filled, matched, reconciliated, paid, settled at different times. These times often don't even follow a perfectly logical order (you can request and fill a trade and book it an hour later). Similar issues exist with transaction identifiers. Every party involved with any aspect of a transaction may assign that aspect of the transaction zero or more identifiers, those identifiers may or may not be unique over any particular set of transactions and/or events related to transactions, and the sources of those identifiers may or may not even correctly document what, exactly, those identifiers identify. (And their representatives may think they know, and they may be wrong.) Your own code may need to generate identifiers for events associated with transactions, and you may or may not want to leak information in your choice of identifiers. For new designs, my suggestion would be to treat these as one-to-many relations. Have a table along the lines of (transaction id, event, identifier issuer, identifier name, identifier). You might also need a timestamp in there, and you may need to throw in a row id of some sort as well. You might want to make an allowance for identifiers having variable type — are they bytes? Unicode? something else? You could plausibly get away with making these be JSON keys in an event object instead, but this gets awkward when someone tells you an identifier after the fact. reply simpaticoder 4 hours agorootparentThere is an interesting tension in software between measurement and validation. The two concerns are often conflated, resulting in software systems that cannot measure the world as-it-is. The world (more precisely, measurements of the world) may be in (and often is in) an 'invalid' or 'inconsistent' state. Software can only help you detect and resolve such states if it is capable of representing them. reply Galanwe 5 hours agorootparentprevSpot on. Worst, these identifiers can even be point-in-time. I usually store them as you do, with an additional start/end date. reply blowski 10 hours agoparentprevSeems to be like you're in violent agreement with the OP on all those points, just phrasing the same truth differently. reply eru 12 hours agoparentprevIf you are only doing accounting (and not like high frequency trading), you can even consider using arbitrary precision rational numbers internally. They are most likely fast enough. However, similar to what you suggested about currency conversion, your business logic might already dictate to you exactly what kind of precision and rounding rules you should be using; and deviating from that might cause havoc. reply tomnipotent 10 hours agoparentprev> You forgot \"consistent\" I once had an auditor tell me that the books are allowed to be wrong, but should be wrong consistently. I've even run into the timestamp issue, which generally turned out to be a non-issue unless the wrong date was used (like order date vs. shipping date for revenue recognition) or a considerable number of errors caused dates to end up in a different reporting period. If you're dates are consistently a few hours off, then they'll be consistently off across reporting period boundaries and that can easily be explained to an auditor. > the necessity to batch reconciliation processes between these layers I've never seen a reporting period closed without accountants making journal entries for manual adjustments. These can often be material changes. > An accounting system does not convert currencies at will This is correct, but for internal reporting you might need to. An accountant and cash flow will capture the important conversion rate when the funds are expatriated, but your finance dashboard showing sales in euros will have an executive that wants to see it in US dollars. It's impractical to use the conversion rate from the transfer that could happen weeks or months after the reporting period, so you come to a compromise of using a X-day FX moving average that's \"close enough\" and everyone's happy. What goes in your 10-K/Q will be a different story. reply Galanwe 5 hours agorootparent> I've never seen a reporting period closed without accountants making journal entries for manual adjustments. These can often be material changes. The fiscal view is just one of the layers your accounting system takes into considerations. You typically perform fiscal reconciliation when the fiscal year ends, your bookings are often reconciliated end of day, your settlements usually between 1 or 2 days (depending on the currency), your FX hedge often quarterly to enter IMM interest rate swaps, your front office is often optimistic realtime accounting (i.e. you consider what has been promised just now to already be out of the stock), etc. > This is correct, but for internal reporting you might need to. Right but this is more some form of Bi on top of the accounting system than part of it. For the accounting system itself, you will often want to know precisely the cash per currency so that you can actually hedge it. e.g. if you're ultimately getting paid in dollar and have exposure to some salaries you pay in euro. reply DarkContinent 4 hours agoprev> Batch is just a special case of streaming No. Designing a system that is always up and running and can process small amounts of data constantly is a completely different problem from designing a system that runs occasionally with a lot of data. For one thing, your output formats are usually different in the latter case (maybe you're creating a PDF for example). Also the high availability requirement just makes things different at the design level. Finally, the author claims it's not hard to switch between batch and streaming. With a large volume of preexisting data, this is just not true. For example, if you make a REST API call for each document in a DB, it can take days or months to load that. If batching together documents isn't a possibility, how do you move data between stores easily? (This data movement is often required when switching between batch and streaming.) reply lkdfjlkdfjlg 2 hours agoparentI'm seconding this, and I have first hand experience in exactly this problem, in finance. My first boss also had the view that \"batching is a special case of streaming where you stream N and streaming is also a special case of batching where the batch size is 1 and so it doesn't matter which one you implement\".

In our discovery/delving into their logic, the most fascinating thing was interest rate. Some of their systems stored - and therefore the APIs - presented interest rate as a simple number (5% was 5) where other used a decimal (5% was 0.05) and still others used basis points (5% was 500). One of their VPs told me they once saw an unexpected uptick in loan applications and dug in to find out the quoted rate was 0.05% Consistency is key. reply MrDresden 27 minutes agoparentI have a jucy story about an European bank, an European currency, a broken API that caused said bank to have the wrong currency exchange rate for said currency, of how the bank dismissed the issue when it was pointed out to them, and how a group of people used the situation to make huge sums of money from a perfectly legal arbitrage operation (in the end it went before a judge, who judged it legal due to the bank's dismissal of the issue).

In this field of accountancy, I think the UI is an engineering problem at least as important as anything else mentioned in the article. As someone who works in accountancy (as a bookkeeper/accountant) I have to be brutally honest and say that I've been very disappointed in the UI of all the accounting software packages I've used. None of them give me the immediacy or simplicity of a well organised filing cabinet, they really don't.

But I guess, this is what you get when the user is not also the customer. reply cvdub 2 hours agoprevManaging rounding and ensuring each set of entries balance can be tricky, especially if you have to share data with a system that can only handle currencies with two decimal places. There are scenarios where it’s actually not possible to have every set of entries balance, and have the total sum of all entries equal the correct balance. For example, if you had three monthly payments of $5, $10, and $10, you might book something like: Cash (5) Expense 8.33 Deferred (3.33) Cash (10) Expense 8.33 Deferred 1.67 Cash (10) Expense 8.33 Deferred 1.67 All three of those blocks of entries balance, but the sum of expenses is 24.99 instead of 25. I’m not sure there’s a way around this issue if you’re forced to use two decimal places. Luckily the discrepancy is immaterial. I’d love to know if anyone else has encountered this problem. reply rwieruch 11 hours agoprevRelated [0], but one week ago I have written about my experiences using TypeScript for an invoicing system, if anyone is interested.

Something I've found valuable is on is managing euler units/ratios (e.g. proportions 10^1, percentages 10^-2, basis points 10^-4) .

Conventions are good, but (real) type systems are better because they check everything every time. reply eru 9 hours agoparentYes. And in this context, it doesn't even matter (too much) whether your type system is statically checked or done at runtime. The main difference is whether the compiler will yell at you, or whether it'll be a runtime error. But the important point is that your mixing up won't go through and silently do the wrong thing. reply willtemperley 8 hours agoprev> Use integers to represent financial amounts I followed this mantra when building a trading system. This was the worst engineering decision I ever made - it added complexity and runtime overhead, plus readability was reduced when debugging. If your language has a proper decimal type like BigDecimal in Java or Decimal in Swift, I'd suggest using it. They offer perfect precision for financial applications, are battle tested and are a natural way to represent financial amounts. Yes, Java BigDecimal is unweildy, but it works. If you're using JavaScript however, definitely use integers to represent financial amounts. reply gushogg-blake 8 hours agoprevRegarding the types, I think it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking you have to try and force the domain concept into one of the commonly available data structures at the point of creation, i.e. the price \"£3.99\" has to become (int) 399 or (float) 3.99000000001. Actually, as another commentor mentioned, you can and should just choose something that represents what you want. In many cases it will be an object with various domain-specific fields. If you need to be sure that \"3.99\" always comes back as \"3.99\", you can use a string, which doesn't have any issues with precision in the storage format, and will usually map exactly to how humans deal with the concept. (Not necessarily recommending this, but it's worth considering.) Similarly with JavaScript precision issues, to take another example that's been mentioned here - if you need numbers to be precise and the performance cost is acceptable, JavaScript can compute to arbitrary precision just as well as any other language. Just don't assume you're forced to convert your concept of a number to use the built-in numeric types and operations. reply ibejoeb 7 hours agoparentThe string \"3.99\" always comes back as a string, but when you need do anything at all to it, it resolves down to the same problem. reply langcss 7 hours agorootparentIdeally, one should make illegal state unrepresentable.

Security researchers from the CCC recently had live access to over 200 million such SMS messages from more than 200 affected companies. WhatsApp code: 2342 You can also tap on this link to verify your phone: v.whatsapp.com/2342 Do not share this code. Transfer to DE63 4306 0967 1239 7690 03 Amount: 1,312.00 EUR TAN: 161161 Please enter this TAN to complete the transaction. This TAN is valid for 5 minutes. Why SMS? Two-factor authentication via SMS (2FA-SMS) is a method to increase the security of authentications. Alongside the static password, a dynamic code sent via SMS is required. The user must enter this code during login to prove they know the password (1st factor: knowledge) and have access to the phone number (2nd factor: possession). Thus, a stolen password alone is not enough to take over the user's account. Well-Known Attack Vectors This method has been under attack for some time. Through techniques like SIM swapping or exploiting SS7 vulnerabilities in mobile networks, attackers can intercept SMS messages. Alternatively, users can be tricked through phishing attacks into revealing their one-time passwords. The CCC advised against using SMS as a second factor as early as 2013. Nonetheless, 2FA-SMS is widespread. It offers more security than simple password authentication. Now Also Viewable Online! The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) now demonstrates a previously neglected attack on 2FA-SMS: Service providers are commonly used to send these messages. These providers send large volumes of SMS for various companies and services and have access to the SMS content. Thus, the security of the authentication process also depends on the security of these providers. IdentifyMobile, a provider of 2FA-SMS, shared the sent one-time passwords in real-time on the internet. The CCC happened to be in the right place at the right time and accessed the data. It was sufficient to guess the subdomain \"idmdatastore\". Besides SMS content, recipients' phone numbers, sender names, and sometimes other account information were visible. Nearly 200 Million SMS from Over 200 Companies Over 200 companies that entrusted this provider directly or indirectly through other service providers with the security of their authentication were affected. This included companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, as well as Telegram, Airbnb, FedEx, and DHL. Over 198 million SMS leaked in total. By simply viewing the live feed, it would have been possible to: Take over WhatsApp numbers Conduct financial transactions or log in to various services without access to the phone, provided the password was known (Not Yet) a Catastrophe To truly misuse the SMS codes, attackers would typically still need the password. However, \"1-click login\" links were also included in the data. For some large affected companies, only individual services were protected by IdentifyMobile. Nevertheless, IdentifyMobile's negligence exposed companies and their customers to significant risk. This is evident from the numerous similar inquiries from data protection departments worldwide now reaching us through all channels. We are happy to confirm that we did not keep the data. However, we cannot rule out that others may have accessed it. 2FA-SMS is Better Than Nothing, But Other Methods Don’t rely on IdentifyMobile One-time passwords generated in an app or using hardware tokens are more secure and independent of the mobile network. If this option is available, we recommend using it. And any second factor remains better than just one, the password. Tags update pressemitteilung Featured Cancel",

The site was an immaculate knock off, with a replay attack in the background. She entered her 2fa code from the app on her phone but the interface rejected the code and asked her for another one. In the background, this 2nd code was actually to authorise the addition of a new \"pay anyone\" payee, and with that her money was gone[0]. I have accounts with 2 banks, one uses SMS 2fa and the other uses an app which generates a token. I had thought that the app was by default a better choice because of the inherent lack of security in SMS as a protcol BUT in the above attack the bank that sends the SMS would have been better because they send a different message when you're doing a transfer to a new payee than when you're logging in. So really the ideal is not just having an app that generates a token but one that generates a specific type of token depending on what type of transaction you're performing and won't accept, for example, a login token when adding a new payee.

Many online payments are rendered either on the shop's pages or on a third party payment provider, including 3DSecure implementations. These don't redirect to any sensible bank URLs. Both of my banks use a payment flow which uses a hardware authenticator. But only one bank seems secure: it prompts for an amount and a reference and generates an OTP based on that. This is distinct from any other signing operations with the same authenticator. The other bank tells me to enter a 6 digit number (which is allegedly made up out of a part of the amount and a reference), but it is impossible to tell this apart from any other signing operation.

So any DNS request passes through the local DNS resolver (the firewall ensures that too). My firewall also takes care of rejecting any DNS attempt to an internationalized domain names (by inspecting packets on port 53 and dropping any that contains \"xn--\"). I don't care a yota about the legit (for some definition of legit): \"pile of poo heart\" websites. My local DNS resolver has 600 000 entries blocked I think, something like that.

My understanding of EU regulation is that it effectively requires this by requiring the 2FA to validate not just the identity but also the transaction (such as an amount, or destination account). Unfortunately it means that all banks use SMS. We did have card reader 2FA that also did this but it's falling out of use because users don't like having to carry a card reader around. reply bux93 5 hours agorootparentYes, the Payment Services Directive requires \"dynamic linking\" to a specific amount and a specific payee in article 97, and the RTS in article 5 go on to say that the payer should be \"made aware of the amount of the payment transaction and of the payee\". The most elegant implementation I saw of this were card readers with a 2D (colored) barcode scan ; the 2D barcode contained transaction details that the card reader would display on its screen. This was an effective control against MITM. But even I myself always misplaced the card reader. So now, most confirmations are done using the banking app. Even if I use a credit card by filling in its details on a US website, I get a push notification on my phone to confirm the tx on my app. The app asks for a password or uses biometrics, so thats 1FA, and the app is enrolled at some point, so the token on your phone (I presume in some secure storage) counts as the 'thing you have' for 2FA. Enrolling the app nowadays usually entails scanning your ID card and a 'live selfie' (blink your eyes). And of course you get notified (via e-mail) that you just installed the app on some device. reply wiredfool 5 hours agorootparentprevMy EU bank uses an app for consumer accounts.

It's well known that many Android apps bundle near-malware that slurps all data possible, and will ask for root privileges if that is detected. The fact is that mobile phones tend to contain more sensitive data than desktop computers (and are thus significantly more secure by default than Linux/Windows computers).

So they came up with the concept of app curation (monitoring large appstores for lookalikes and viruses), and by rooting/sideloading you are violating that model. * Repackaging a legit app into a malicious lookalike is relatively easy on Android, but harder to distribute if you combat rooting/sideloading. * if your phone is rooted the bank may be concerned that you could be more susceptible to installing dangerous things, including apps that intercept your 2fa.

For a business, they know that a significant number of their users don't do this. These users are exposed to credential stuffing attacks. SMS-based 2FA means you need to phish somebody (or otherwise obtain the code). That's an improvement for these users.

We only know about it because they were big enough to sue, I'm sure every crappy site that gets the number sells it. As a bonus, it also allows them to dump a lot of the infrastructure and support problems onto some one other than themselves.

Ultimately, the phone company uses its information to work out where to send an SMS, and that information is an entry in a database - SMS to number X is routed to SIM card ID Y.

In Italy RSA token (small key chain with an LCD display) was fairly common as another option and some banks have solved the PSD/DSP2 article five with a captcha post-OTP for transactions (i.e. Unicredit), few have chosen more complex OTP with a cam to read a Qr but they are simply too expensive to became spread. In France curiously most banks still do not use a second factor allowing login with just ridiculous \"random sorted\" virtual keyboards to makes keylogging not work.

Your desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone can all share a password manager. They work offline and online. Passwords generated are unique, breaking password reuse attacks. Password managers support auto-filled TOTP codes per-login. They support passkeys. There's password managers built into browsers in addition to the 3rd party ones. There are personal, family, and enterprise options. They could be installed as a system service to isolate them from userland attacks. They support advanced functionality like SSH keys, git signing and biometrics. If you're a stickler about having a completely independent factor from your desktop/phone/etc, password managers could be used with different profiles on different devices, and allow several easy ways to pass an auth token between devices (via sound, picture, bluetooth, network, etc), ensuring an independent device authenticates the login to avoid malware attacking the password manager. We already have the tools to do something way more secure than SMS, and it's already on most of our devices/browsers. We just have to make it the preferred factor. reply UncleMeat 4 hours agoparentThe tools aren't the hard part. The hard parts are adoption and recovery. SMS has an extraordinary advantage in that the vast majority of people transparently have access to it. No need to download another app. No need to install anything. No need to buy a special usb device. It also has a recovery mechanism built in, as the carriers will all let you move your phone number to a new device. This, of course, comes with the high cost of sim-swapping attacks. But few companies will be happy with \"customers just lose their accounts when they drop their phones in the toilet.\" We'll see if the google/apple security key system takes off.

    "originBody": "Palestinians say Microsoft unfairly closing their accounts 5 hours ago By Mohamed Shalaby and Joe Tidy, BBC World Service Share Getty Images The Israeli military campaign has badly affected internet and mobile connectivity in Gaza Palestinians living abroad have accused Microsoft of closing their email accounts without warning - cutting them off from crucial online services. They say it has left them unable to access bank accounts and job offers - and stopped them using Skype, which Microsoft owns, to contact relatives in war-torn Gaza. Microsoft says they violated its terms of service - a claim they dispute. \"They killed my life online,\" said Eiad Hametto, who lives in Saudi Arabia. \"They’ve suspended my email account that I’ve had for nearly 20 years - It was connected to all my work,\" he told the BBC. He also said being cut off from Skype was a huge blow for his family. The internet is frequently disrupted or switched off there because of the Israeli military campaign - and standard international calls are very expensive. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas attack on 7 October, which killed about 1,200 people. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 38,000 people have been killed in the war. With a paid Skype subscription, it is possible to call mobiles in Gaza cheaply - and while the internet is down - so it has become a lifeline to many Palestinians. Some of the people the BBC spoke to said they suspected they were wrongly thought to have ties to Hamas, which Israel is fighting, and is designated a terrorist organisation by many countries. But Mr Hametto denied he had any such links. “We are civilians with no political background who just wanted to check on our families,\" he said. Microsoft did not respond directly when asked if suspected ties to Hamas were the reason for the accounts being shut. But a spokesperson said it did not block calls or ban users based on calling region or destination. \"Blocking in Skype can occur in response to suspected fraudulent activity,\" they said, without elaborating. Salah Elsadi says he has been locked out of life online Salah Elsadi, who lives in the US, also told the BBC that in April, he was kicked out of his account - and all services linked to his Microsoft Hotmail account. \"I've had this Hotmail for 15 years,\" Mr Elsadi told the BBC. \"They banned me for no reason, saying I have violated their terms - what terms? Tell me. \"I've filled out about 50 forms and called them many many times.\" Another Palestinian the BBC spoke to, Khalid Obaied, said he now no longer trusted Microsoft. \"I paid for a package to make phone calls - then, after 10 days, they ban me for no reason,\" he said. \"That means it's only because I’m a Palestinian calling Gaza.” Israel-Gaza war Human rights Palestinian territories Gaza Microsoft",

Three conditions must exist to determine there is famine: - At least 20 percent of the population in the area faces extreme levels of hunger; - 30 percent of the children in the area are too thin for their height; and - The death rate has doubled from the average, surpassing two deaths per 10,000 daily for adults and four deaths per 10,000 daily for children. reply cmilton 2 hours agorootparentDid the 10 independent experts provide any evidence for these new claims?

You're repeating a false narrative of picking a side in a problematic situation where two zero sum players are trying to engage and escalate. I'm a liberal Israeli. I have friends in Gaza too. I don't want them hurt and I'm sure they don't want to hurt me. Unfortunately, we're both stuck in a situation where people frame this as a Palestinian vs. Israeli conflict. That's wrong. It's a conflict between two zero sum players who have been pumping each other up for 30 years and sabotaging repeated attempts for peace. Al Jazeera is run by Qatar who also host Hamas. They are a very bad actor in many cases and in line with a zero sum player in this narrative. reply casenmgreen 5 hours agoprevEvery time I read a story like this, about MS or Google or Twitter or which-ever big corporate it is, I'm so glad that I exited these platforms and years ago. I left LinkedIn before MS bought it, because it was clear it was being copied by all and sundry. I left GitHub once MS bought it (and I thank God for that, ever time I see another story about MS being awful). I never used Google - they were obviously evil and from quite early on. I may be completely wrong, but I think large companies are completely amoral. Not in a malicious way, but in a can't-be-anything-else kind of way; that is is an emergent property. All large organization have absolutely no moral sense, which is to say, doing things because they are ethical, regardless of costs or benefits, or possessing a capability to assess or modify their own actions on moral criteria. Complaining MS do these things is like complaining a cat jumps on a mouse. I'm not a fan of brutal mouse death, so I don't own a cat. What's critical of course is knowing this, and before deciding to buy into what these companies offer, rather than discovering it after buying into what these companies offer. And these companies will only tell you how wonderful their services are, and nothing about what they're up - nothing about how much and what data they collect, and what they do with it (give it to the State, sell it to all and sundry, with real-time updates included), or what's done with it (mandatory State mass interception). reply npteljes 2 hours agoparent>I may be completely wrong, but I think large companies are completely amoral For one, you are right, and two, they are actively incentivized to be immoral. Doing something in a moral way is to take something extra into account - morality. Taking into account, as an action, costs extra resources, which translates to money or risk, but then, risk also translates into money. So, what we end up with is that being moral is being handicapped. Money can be made by avoiding it. The situation is especially worse when the other participants, the competitors, are also not moral. They can simply out-price a moral participants - people are less likely to buy the thing for its ethical \"real price\", if they can get a similar one for much cheaper. This can clearly be seen even in markets where being moral is a bonus, like, I'd say, how the current market is. \"Morally superior\" is a product differentiator, with labels like \"bio\", \"organic\", \"fair\", \"ethical\", \"free from\", \"vegan\" - even the ol' PU leather being rebranded as \"vegan leather\". So even in a context like this, non-morally-superior products sell way more than moral ones. So the incentives for companies are not really there, not just from an operational, but from a market standpoint as well. >that is is an emergent property. I agree, and I think it's part of the general human experience, especially with taking responsibility for anything that has impact. Attention and possibility of action is limited, so even if the perfectly moral course of action would be known, it might not be possible to enact it. And then, the arguments are endless as to what's moral and what not, and what part of that should people be engaged in. This is all too much to handle for an individual, so, even if morality is desired, sub-optimal decisions will be made on a daily, as part of life. Which is, in many ways, no different to when a company makes them - with respect to the size and impact though, of course. reply wincy 5 hours agoparentprevCurious, what sort of phone do you use? reply casenmgreen 2 hours agorootparentI tried running Debian (Mobian) on a Fairphone, but Mobian on FP isn't useable yet, so I had to switch to /e/OS (de-Googled Android) No SIM, don't want my location tracked.

The problem is that they are punished for true negatives (in the press and potentially by the gov) but not for false positives (except for articles like this). The end result is overzealous bullshit that ends up hurting innocent people. For another example, the US gov told Paypal that they need to prevent transactions related to a weapon smuggling shell company \"Tarigrade Limited\" (which as I've said before, is good actually) but they implemented it to just block transactions and freeze accounts if \"Tarigrade\" is in the notes. Similarly, I know of a small store that sells patches that got their account frozen for some time because they released a patch with a firearm in it and had the gall to put the name of the firearm in the name of the product. https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7wg3w/paypal-tardigrade-err... reply Nifty3929 4 hours agoparentYou get to an important issue: Type 1 vs Type 2 errors - precision vs recall. Any system is going to have errors, so what do you prioritize? The company has only limited control over this choice, as you also point out that the gov't will punish them for false negatives but not false positives. So the company prioritizes recall over precision. But you also imply that the gov't should punish BOTH types of errors, but I'm not sure that's fair. By extension it implies that the company should have a perfect system, with no errors of either type. That's not realistic, and a company should be punished for meeting an impossible goal. Better is for the government to just be explicit about it: we're requiring companies to employ broad sanctions, and even if some innocents get swept up, we think it's worth it to stop the bad guys.

Therefore they should be regulated like a public utility reply rlpb 5 hours agoparentIndeed. I think that if a person cannot participate in modern society without being a customer with only a few competitors to choose from, then such businesses should have a \"universal service obligation\" and not be allowed to refuse service without a good reason. Such a reason should be mediated by the legal system. For example a major chain convenience store with few similar competitors could ban someone for shoplifting, but someone innocent caught by this should be able to sue and win if the store cannot convince a court that such an event actually occurred. A mom-and-pop store wouldn't be within scope of this. And the same for online businesses. reply hedora 5 hours agorootparentSuing isn't as useful as you'd expect. It costs $10,000's and months to even get to court. Criminal liability for improper bans, and allowing citizens to directly charge the company with the crime (some states do this) would probably be more practical. Alternatively, some variant of streamlined court (similar to small-claims court) could be established, where you could automatically use the court if the defendant had already been sued more than 10 times in the last decade for the last thing. The court would provide some sort of legal or financial resources to allow the customers to quickly sue without paying out of pocket, or spending much of their own time. reply judge2020 5 hours agorootparentThis could be solved with something like CFPB, but with the Chevron Deference repealed, courts are pretty much the only remedy now for anything until congress decides to write much more specific and in-depth laws. reply Y-bar 5 hours agoparentprevThe Digital Markets Act and/or Digital Services Act ought to have something to say about this, especially the \"this secret decision is final and we refuse to say anything else\" part of the story. reply bhouston 5 hours agorootparentThat wording sounds like the decision was made in Israel and not the US.

Yes, you can choose not to engage with meta or its products, or (less easily) Microsoft or Google - but we're close to the point where refusing to use the products of (and thus be defacto-governed by) one of the tech giants will have implications beyond self-imposed inconvenience.

Through making several Extremely Reasonable Assumptions (namely, that parents are myopic, perfectly knowledgeable agents who pick a name based solely on its uniquness), we create a model which is not only tractable and clean, but also perfectly captures the real world. We then extend our investigation with numerical experiments, as well as analysis of large language model tools. We conclude by discussing avenues for future research.

Context usually supplies whatever information is needed for personal names so less disambiguation is required, and they are used much more so some simplicity is useful/natural consequence of human nature.

So in these California data we had we could see the education level of the parents. And even the names that eventually become the, quote, “trashiest” kinds of names, so the Tiffanys and the Brittanys, and I’ll probably get myself in trouble, and the Caitlyns and things like that start at the top of the income distribution, and over the course of 20 or 30 or 40 years they migrate their way down, becoming more and more popular among the less-educated set. What you see with Mabel in the paper is a fad name coming back. Hipsters bring it back, then upper class parents with hipster pretentions popularize it, then it spreads to the general population. The trick is to pick a name that sounds outdated or obscure but will come into popularity within the child's lifetime. If you wanted to do that now, you would pick something like Linda or Iris.

I do think the best names are ones with the most meaning. You name a kid Isaac, you could be naming him after Isaac Newton. It puts something on to him. If you name a kid William, maybe you hope he will be the next Shakespeare. Simply by naming someone something, you imprint something on to them. The history and power of a culture. Yet for this very reason, especially when people see the culture as dark, they choose unique names, names that say you can be who you want to be. Though I think I still prefer old names, looking at names of people who have done something, and then hoping to do something similar. I think this is kind of why a convert to an orthodox Christianity, from some heterodoxy, or atheism, or from the religion of the “infadels” takes a new name in baptism.

My wife and I legitimately sat down and came up with a list of 50 names we each liked, and from the 98 we had totaled up, we applied a series of different filters to get to an answer over the span of several weeks. First we each went through the list, and force removed half of them, each of us taking turns eliminating one at a time. From the remaining 50 we rated them, and removed anything that scored under a 6 from either of us, or under 15 points total. Then we had 20 left, that we talked through each fairly extensively. We covered etymology, popularity, age association, popular cultural associations, you name it. After that we each removed 5 more. Once we were down to the top ten, armed with frankly far too much knowledge about these names at this point, we reranked them individually and tallied up the scores. Two names stood head and shoulders above the rest, one scoring around a 19 total and the other scoring around a 17.

Rollerblades do not handle holes in pavement nearly as well as bicycles or shoes. - Bicycles have actual utility like getting to work/places. For Covid a ton of people bought skates [1] but honestly I never saw that many more people skating then compared to before/after. - They're pretty bulky.

    "originBody": "News ICPEN Sweep finds majority of websites and mobile apps use dark patterns in the marketing of subscription services GlobalTuesday, July 9, 2024 A global internet sweep that examined the websites and mobile apps of 642 traders has found that 75,7% of them employed at least one dark pattern, and 66,8% of them employed two or more dark patterns. Dark patterns are defined as practices commonly found in online user interfaces and that steer, deceive, coerce, or manipulate consumers into making choices that often are not in their best interests. This year’s annual International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN) Sweep took place between January 29 and February 2, 2024. It involved participants, or “sweepers,” from 27 consumer protection enforcement authorities in 26 countries around the world. For the first time, the ICPEN sweep was coordinated with the Global Privacy Enforcement Network (GPEN). GPEN is a network of over 80 privacy enforcement authorities, which aims to foster cross-border cooperation across privacy regulators and strengthen personal privacy protections in an increasingly global market. The collaboration recognizes the growing intersection between consumer protection and other regulatory spheres. In the case of deceptive design patterns, it was clear to both privacy and consumer protection sweepers that many websites and apps employ techniques that interfere with individuals’ ability to make choices that best protect their consumer or privacy rights. Sweepers evaluated the sites and apps based on six indicators identified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as being characteristic of dark commercial patterns [1]. The ICPEN report found that potential sneaking practices, such as the inability of the consumer to turn off auto-renewal of subscription service, and interface interference, for example making a subscription that is advantageous to the trader more prominent, were encountered especially frequent during the sweep. Both ICPEN and GPEN, who are working together to improve consumer and privacy protection for individuals around the world, published reports outlining their findings today. The ICPEN report can be found here and GPEN report can be found on their website.

Yes it's convenient, but there are so many potential problems - what if you loose access to your account and basically won't be able to cancel the subscription? what if company will continue to charge you even after closing your account? what if they accidently charge you for who knows what? what if you simply forget you even had a subscription? I've had enough bad experiences with subscriptions that I avoid them at all cost, just to give an example - I subscribed to a popular streaming service because I wanted to watch a movie that was only available on their platform. I immediately canceled my subscription so it would end with current billing month, but to my surprise when I checked my credit card history several months later I've noticed an additional charge that was around 10x what I paid for the one month of subscription! I emailed them and they answered me that \"it was some kind of mistake\" and refunded me, but it made me realize how dangerous subscriptions are. Subscriptions should be able to be paid by invoices - you receive an invoice before next billing period and if you don't pay, account is locked, but of course that would give user too much control over their spendings and companies clearly don't want that. reply lolinder 7 hours agoparentSome counterexamples, subscriptions that I and others are happy to pay and which tend to provide a worse experience when funded any other way: * Email provider. * Online Newspapers. * Heavily online collaborative SaaS. * MMO games. The common thread is that the alternative funding model can't usually be a one-time purchase because the product is delivered over indefinite time, which leaves some combination of ads and microtransactions as the remaining viable funding models. Given a choice between the three, subscriptions have reliably produced the best experience for me as a user. Obviously, I'll heartily agree that subscriptions are overused and abused (I'm looking at you, car manufacturers), but I tend to take a more measured approach than avoiding all subscriptions of any kind. And I would absolutely hate to receive and manage invoices for these things. reply silverquiet 7 hours agorootparentYes, I'm highly skeptical of subscriptions, but there are obviously cases where they make sense (and I work for a SaaS company so it'd be pretty hypocritical if I said the never do). I subscribe to a gym and actually go regularly as an example.

Pratically speaking, what does it mean to \"sometimes subscribe\"? reply olex 6 hours agorootparentThe way I handle any streaming video subscriptions is: - Have a list of stuff I want to watch. - Once the list has enough on it from any one streaming provider (Netflix, Apple TV+, HBO, etc), I activate my subscription on that service, pay for a month, and immediately cancel. - Use the month of access I just bought to watch the stuff. - Continue with whichever service \"fills up\" next at some point in the future. This method results in me typically buying a month of access on the usual suspect services once per year or so, and I never pay when I'm not actively using the services. reply silverquiet 6 hours agorootparentprevIf I don't use it for awhile, then I unsubscribe. If I find myself in a situation where I'll potentially be listening to a lot of music (recently it was a road trip), then I'll re-up it. If they send me a good deal and I notice it, then maybe I'll re-up then. Given the cost, it probably doesn't matter, but as I said I'm very skeptical of subscriptions. reply blantonl 5 hours agoparentprevSubscriptions should be able to be paid by invoices - you receive an invoice before next billing period and if you don't pay, account is locked This is exactly what I do with my business (RadioReference/Broadcastify). If you have a premium subscription, you can pay with a credit card, but we do not auto-renew subscriptions. We'll simply send you an email 7 days before your subscription is about to expire, and if you want to renew it, you go ahead and submit a new payment. I've been told by a number of PE firms and others that I'm missing out on significant revenue, and I KNOW that is probably the case, but I just cannot gather enough energy to climb that summit and commit my users to such dark patterns. Even in the face of clear and concise evidence that my revenue would probably increase >20%, I'm more afraid of the loss of customer goodwill, and chargebacks that would occur. I can simply look at my own rage when I see dark patterns that extract money from my pocket. Sadly, it's one of those things were if your business is in a crowded space of players, the ones that do participate in the dark patterns will earn more money, which leads to more funding, which often leads to winning. So most companies don't have a choice but to foist dark patterns like auto-renewals on their customers. reply ryandrake 4 hours agoparentprev> what if you simply forget you even had a subscription? Others have addressed your other points, but this one is where I roar. As a very frugal and paranoid guy, I watch my credit card activity like a hawk - like twice daily. There is no way in hell I'd simply \"forget\" that I'm paying for something. This idea evokes one of those \"how do people live like this\" reactions from me. If there is a transaction against my credit card I don't recognize, an outgoing check i didn't write, a charge that doesn't match what was on the receipt, an interest deposit that doesn't match what it should be, and so on, I know within the day, not within a few months, and can take action. And the best part is: It's not a lot of work. Get something like Quicken or one of its alternatives, which can connect to all of your bank accounts and credit card accounts at once, and simply hit refresh once a day while you're drinking your morning coffee.

The only question is what is in the fine print of the subscription contract, if the company is willing to pursue it, and if the contract will hold up in court.

Not to mention that the \"what if you simply forget you even had a subscription?\" is probably the most common, I doubt most people periodically check their credit cards history and given how many subscriptions an average person have, it's way too easy to forget you've subscribed to something - maybe in a heat of a moment or for \"free trial\" that required your CC and started charging you once the free trial expired. reply trinix912 6 hours agorootparentprevYes, in theory, you write an email.

No one implied that they have to provide you a service first before you pay. OP said \"invoice before next billing period\". I.e. if you don't pay before the next period starts, you don't get access to the service. I don't see why this is that hard. This purely serves the provider offering the service which somehow wants to put you in some sort of contractual month to month contract as opposed to \"pay before you get access\" model. 2. You could turn it around: \"Why should the payer hope for the service that's already been paid for?\" There are contracts and norms for starters. The \"subscription arrangement\" makes it entirely the payer's problem to cancel the service, or to keep track of it's lack of usage (the Gym membership model). One can definitely argue that it's predatory, and certainly so if it's combined with how difficult it sometimes is to cancel subscriptions. >\"What do you mean by \"basically\"? You write a mail.\" This is never that simple, your hypothetical \"they're reasonable and respond to reasonable email requests\" is not how it works in practice.

For the most part, I definitely don't want a subscription since I want to keep the product indefinitely, don't want to deal with recurring fees, and don't want to see stuff that I am interested in disappear (whether it is the rotating licensing agreement for IP on streaming services, or a feature vanishing/moving to a new tier in a software update). Then there are issues with automatic billing, sometimes due to the mistakes you mentioned and sometimes due to hostile terms in the EULA. That being said, one has to be careful with credit card purchase even if they aren't recurring. Yet there are also products that I don't want to purchase outright. Streaming services are appealing since they offer access to a large library. Few people would be able to afford purchasing everything they use. Even if they could afford it, they may not want to manage an accumulating pile of stuff that they will use only once or twice. While I am thinking of streaming services, I would imagine that the same would apply to software for some people. Someone mentioned that your suggestion would offer too much friction. I don't really see that being the case. If you're subscription ends on the 15th of the month and you log in on the 20th, they can simple present one-click dialog box offering a renewal. If you don't want stored credit card information (either as a business or as a customer), it looks like the major browsers handle storing credit card information on the client's side.

There is a race to the bottom on exploiting these deficiencies on careless/unknowing/impulsive customers. But there’s a growing number of opposite people like you and me who are avoiding subscribing because we anticipate the dark patterns, and that’s lost business. By the time the marketing departments will wake up to the reality that people avoid subscriptions even if they want the product, they’ll be faced with an insurmountable reputational barrier for entire cohorts of users they will be desperate to convert. Tangentially, this is related to a beef I have with Apple. Their IAP system as middleman for purchases (but especially subscriptions) is worth a lot and cheap to maintain. I already trust them much more than a random SaaS (might even sign up for NYT if I’m confident I can cancel with a click later). In other words, they’re providing huge value, BUT they refuse to compete on fair terms. Their obsession with the 30% tax have pushed the market to do business outside of their App Store (which reduces their market share and fragments the UX), and even created massive badwill to the point of upsetting toothful regulators. They could have avoided all the tantrums and fighting, made a shitton of money in the long run, increased their market share, if only they hadn’t been stuck in the last decade first-mover monopolistic mindset. EDIT: The more I think about, the more I realize how good Apple's (and maybe Google/Android to a lesser extend) position is.

Originally invented as a convenience feature to free up card users from having to update payment details every time when the card expires, gets lost etc, it has also been abused with nefarious intentions by subscription providers as the only way to stop recurring charges is to contact the service provider which is disinclined from letting a customer go. Banks are bound by card payment networks terms and conditions to honour the recurring charge flag and are not empowered to remove it at the customer's behest. reply toddmorey 6 hours agoparentprevIt should really be federally mandated that card issuers maintain a webpage with all your recurring subscriptions and give you one-click access to cancel. reply andsoitis 6 hours agorootparentYour contract, and hence obligation to pay, is with the service provide not your bank.

Or maybe they'd get away with it since technically they're only providing the means for the customer to violate their contract at the click of a button.

The one attached to the debit card I use for subscriptions has usually very little money in it. Enough so I can forget a month or two about the payments but unless I explicitly transfer money in it, they don't have what to charge. In the end I still have too many subscriptions that I lost track of but worst case, I just nuke the account and I'm free of leeches. reply inkyoto 6 hours agorootparentA debit card linked to an account with insufficient funds in it is not a sustainable solution with many banks as many of them will honour the transaction (usually within a small limit, e.g. ⩽ $50-100 but can be more), AND will apply the overdraft fee, plus the interest on the overdraft until it is paid off. Banks love shady charges, and it is a source of substantial revenue for them. You are simply lucky if your bank bounces a transaction instead of slapping you with the overdraft fee. reply nottorp 5 hours agorootparent> many of them will honour the transaction What country? I'm not aware of any banks that will honour transactions on a debit card with zero funds in my country. reply inkyoto 2 hours agorootparentIt has nothing to do with the country, and it has everything to do with: 1) the transaction type, and 2) personal wealth. Transaction types. There are two: a) customer present, b) customer not present. Instant electronic funds transfers fall into (a) and are almost always declined, with the caveat. The caveat: you are overseas, the payment terminal has captured the card details, dispatched them the local/nearest payment processing centre, then something has fallen apart and the acquiring bank (i.e. your bank) could not be contacted. It is a rare situation nowadays, but it can happen nevertheless, and the transaction may be honoured. Most merchants don't bother with it, though, and they will simply produce a «payment declined» receipt instead. But if not, such a payment can send a card account into overdraft irrespective of whether your local bank advertises it or not. Customer not present. This has i) online transactions (e.g. purchases over the internet) and ii) completely offline transactions. The handling of the customer-not-present-online-internet transactions is done solely at the discretion of your bank. Typically, a random purchase will be declined, but a recurring payment may be honoured. Completely offline transactions are very rare nowadays, but they still can take place, e.g. on a flight when the plane has lost the internet connection – the flight attendant will promptly return, produce a mechanical contraption and take a slip of your debit card, provided the card details are embossed on it. If they take a slip, the payment networks do mandate such a payment to be honoured, and a cheque account that is linked to such a debit card will go into overdraft. It is non-negotiable, independent of the country and is mandated by the payment netowrks. Personal wealth. Your bank continuously monitors the in-flow of money into accounts you hold with them as well as the expenditure and the class of merchants you spend your money with. Depending on which one occurs first, e.g. you reach a certain income threshold (undisclosed and defined internally – by your bank), you may get the overdraft automagically allowed on the account your debit card is linked to. There are no specific rules as to when it is going to happen and what is the selection criteria for such a thing to happen – it is solely at the bank's discretion. All this stuff is somewhat obscure, yet it is real and is entirely independent of country borders and the local legislation. reply astura 5 hours agorootparentprevhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdraft reply MichaelRo 4 hours agorootparentAt least where I live, I have to specifically request enabling of overdraft (of course they would love me to do so), but I ain't doing that.

What you replied to had nothing to do with ‘not paying,’ or ‘getting things for free,’ it only discussed their dislike for the subscription model. reply cletus 5 hours agoprevI was so hopeful when subscriptions became a thing because it could technically solve one of the big problems with desktop software: updates. Selling a version of software that you \"own\" creates a perverse incentive: charge as much as you can and as often as you can for \"upgrades\". Back when Photoshop was sold this way, support for the raw formats of new cameras that came out was gated for absolutely no reason behind buying a newer version of Photoshop. Even bugfixes would eventually only be applied to the latest version or two. And what constitutes a major version requiring a paid upgrade anyway? Well that's completely arbitrary but the company is incentivized to make that happen as often as possible. Subscriptions technically mean the company can just keep updating the software. There's only one version to support, really. There's no incentive to gate features behind another paid update. The gold standard for subscriptions is Jetbrains. Cancel anytime. When you do cancel, whatever version you had you got to keep, basically. You got warnings in your email that you would be charged in a few weeks if you didn't cancel. The prices were reasonable. Jetbrains quite literally did everything right. Then there's Adobe. The subscription prices are pretty outrageous. No warning. Hard to cancel. Easy to get a recurring charge. Adobe, like many companies, seems to have decided that whatever the sticker price was for the standalone software, charge that every year in a subscription. But before you start waxing lyrical about the halcyon days of software you \"own\", you've either forgotten or never experienced the shady things software compnaies did to maximize revenue then as well. reply redslazer 5 hours agoparentJetbrains only “did it right” because there was huge community outcry about their move to pure subscription so they moved to the “if you subscribe for X amount of time you get to keep the last version you had when you stop subscribing”.

I don't think software developers not giving me new features and support options for free after purchase was ever shady. Bugfixes maybe is a grey area. Neither of these things are anything close to the level the outright scam dark patterns subscriptions now utilize almost as standard. At the end of the day it is about leverage. With the old model the companies didn't have much leverage after the sale so there was only so many abuse angles available. With subscriptions there are tons because the customer has much less leverage. reply squigz 5 hours agoparentprev> But before you start waxing lyrical about the halcyon days of software you \"own\", you've either forgotten or never experienced the shady things software compnaies did to maximize revenue then as well.

Just because there is shady shit that doesn't mean it's not a better system? Adobe gating new camera RAW formats behind paying for an upgrade was a real problem. You buy the latest Nikon DSLR and Adobe makes you buy PS CS5 for literally no reason other than that. But bugfixes was a real problem. So a colleague of mine had an old iPhone or iPod Touch. I forget which. He used it for testing. He kept it on iOS 7 (this was years ago) because later upgrades just slowed the phone down. This ultimately became a problem when heartbleed [1] came out. Of course, Apple pushed a fix but that fix required upgrading iOS. If you didn't want to upgrade iOS or couldn't because your device wasn't supported, well you were SOL. So this isn't exactly the same as paid software but you can in some ways view the phone as buying hardware and the software. And there defeinitely have been cases where bugfixes (including serious vulnerabilities) were only fixed on later versions. When upgrades are paid, people stick to old versions. This can be bad for everyone. There's an awful lot of botnets, for example, that rely on old versions of Windows and other software that's never upgraded. I suspect this is why Microsoft abandoned paid Windows upgrades because it ultimately hurt them and it was untenable to fix every bug in every version of Windows.

Adobe, like many companies, seems to have decided that whatever the sticker price was for the standalone software, charge that every year in a subscription.

I think there is one thing you are hand waving a bit though. When you bought version X, you could use that forever if that was sufficient and your cost basis and value proposition to upgrade was known and you could personally amortize it. The problem now is that the subscription can jump from a reasonable $5/month to $40/month for literally no reason. You have sunk time adapting to their tooling and have no ability to just do the one thing you started out doing. Sure, you can switch to another tool but that has a different cost and lots of them have moved to similar models. These kinds of subscriptions can really feel like a bait and switch.

Occasionally they will also print a \"case number\" which I assume is just some random numbers and letters.

At that point, I just took down my mailbox and changed my address on all my bills and such to my work address. This lead to the USPS reporting to HUD that my house was abandoned. That got forwarded to the bank that holds my mortgage, who freaked out. I got them calmed down, but then went through a period of having to explain to quite a few people why I don't have a mailbox.

Go to any online store and see how the listed price jumps up during checkout due to \"taxes an fees\". Even though I specify that I'm shipping to Finland, they're incapable of calculating taxes until the last stage of the checkout process. Airlines do those things here too. Air Baltic charges you something like 15 euros to print a boarding pass. Ryan Air is notorious for these various hidden fees. reply systemtest 5 hours agorootparentIt's possible that the foreign website shows the price including VAT at their local percentage. Finland has 24% VAT (25.5% in 2025) on most products so at checkout you get the price with Finnish VAT. It is also possible that Finland has various consumption fees that are only applied after the website verifies that you are indeed Finnish. VAT is a complicated tax. I prefer to get petrol in The Netherlands because despite higher gas prices than Germany and Belgium, it is much easier to get the VAT back at the Dutch tax office than it is with the German or Belgian tax offices. Every country is its own silo. reply jampekka 4 hours agorootparentprevFor a European like me, most commercial transactions in USA feel more or less like fraud. It's really hard to figure out price of almost anything beforehand. E.g. in restaurant your meal will cost someting like 50% more than the sticker price. Even vending machines ask for tips, with dark patterns of course. reply systemtest 6 hours agorootparentprevI'm a European. When I travel to another country (which I can do in about 30 minutes) and use my bank card the machine asks me if I want to pay in local currency or foreign currency. If I use local currency the local bank does the conversion, if I use foreign currency then my own bank will do the conversion (typically at a favourable rate). On machines with larger displays you get a long text with the usual fear mongering about not knowing the exchange rate of your own bank and having security of knowing exactly how much will be withdrawn if you pick the exchange rate of the local bank. I have similar annoyances at holidays, train tickets and flight tickets being advertised at very low prices, but when you want to book that price is only available on February 28th 2025. Any other date is at least 30% extra. And don't get me started on the costs that are added at the checkout for my local super market. Suddenly I get plastic tax, bottle deposit, bag tax etc. The prices that are used on the shelf are only for club members so I get to pay a little bit extra if I don't have my member card with me. This is for The Netherlands. It can be difficult to know exactly what you have to pay at checkout while shopping. reply lotsofpulp 7 hours agoparentprevCalifornia legislators just worked overtime to pass a law allowing restaurants to not include all fees in their menu prices. reply hn_acker 3 hours agorootparentNot a Californian, but which bill number is it? SB 1524 seems to do the opposite: service fees are allowed (terrible, but a separate issue), and non-tax fees have to be rolled into menu prices [1].

There is no reason that a restaurant menu should have a mandatory charge on everything shown separately from the prices for the food, other than for restaurants to be able to make prices seem lower than they are. reply lynx23 8 hours agoparentprevGenuinely interested, is this perhaps a result of the practice of writing prices without VAT? As a european, I always felt this has a fraudulent touch. reply jaza 6 hours agorootparentDitto as an Australian. To be fair, we have a valid historical reason for prices down here always including tax - GST (our name for VAT / sales tax) was only introduced in 2000, and before that there was never any tax involved at point of sale - so it would have been too big a cultural change for \"the marked price\" to suddenly not be \"the exact price that you pay\". (Tipping is also rare here, same as in most of Europe.) So, yeah, the American way of \"marked price plus tax plus tips\" seems like egregious fraud to us too. Although, over the past decade or so, \"credit / debit card surcharge\" fees (generally of 1-2%, but sometimes much more) - which aren't included in the marked price - have become pervasive here. And they're often charged (both online and in-store) when there is no alternative form of payment available (either a really lousy alternative - e.g. \"pay by bank transfer, but we won't give you the product until the transfer has cleared, which may take up to 3 business days\" - or literally no alternative at all, which is supposed to be illegal, but plenty of businesses seem to get away with it). But I guess it's a good sign, that quite a lot of people here complain loudly about such fees - maybe in the USA, the vast majority just resign themselves to it being yet one more gotcha creeping into everyday payments. reply bcye 8 hours agoprevWhy exactly does an international organisation have the US FTC as part of its logo and advertise a US .gov side? reply laserlight 8 hours agoparentProbably because [0]: > The Network operates under an anually [sic] rotating presidency.

This paper examines this most frequently deployed of software architectures: the BIG BALL OF MUD. A BIG BALL OF MUD is a casually, even haphazardly, structured system. Its organization, if one can call it that, is dictated more by expediency than design. Yet, its enduring popularity cannot merely be indicative of a general disregard for architecture. These patterns explore the forces that encourage the emergence of a BIG BALL OF MUD, and the undeniable effectiveness of this approach to software architecture. What are the people who build them doing right? If more high-minded architectural approaches are to compete, we must understand what the forces that lead to a BIG BALL OF MUD are, and examine alternative ways to resolve them. A number of additional patterns emerge out of the BIG BALL OF MUD. We discuss them in turn. Two principal questions underlie these patterns: Why are so many existing systems architecturally undistinguished, and what can we do to improve them? Introduction Over the last several years, a number of authors [Garlan & Shaw 1993] [Shaw 1996] [Buschmann et. al. 1996] [Meszaros 1997] have presented patterns that characterize high-level software architectures, such as PIPELINE and LAYERED ARCHITECTURE. In an ideal world, every system would be an exemplar of one or more such high-level patterns. Yet, this is not so. The architecture that actually predominates in practice has yet to be discussed: the BIG BALL OF MUD. A BIG BALL OF MUD is haphazardly structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape and bailing wire, spaghetti code jungle. We’ve all seen them. These systems show unmistakable signs of unregulated growth, and repeated, expedient repair. Information is shared promiscuously among distant elements of the system, often to the point where nearly all the important information becomes global or duplicated. The overall structure of the system may never have been well defined. If it was, it may have eroded beyond recognition. Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility shun these quagmires. Only those who are unconcerned about architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are content to work on such systems. Still, this approach endures and thrives. Why is this architecture so popular? Is it as bad as it seems, or might it serve as a way-station on the road to more enduring, elegant artifacts? What forces drive good programmers to build ugly systems? Can we avoid this? Should we? How can we make such systems better? We present the following seven patterns: BIG BALL OF MUD THROWAWAY CODE PIECEMEAL GROWTH KEEP IT WORKING SHEARING LAYERS SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG RECONSTRUCTION Why does a system become a BIG BALL OF MUD? Sometimes, big, ugly systems emerge from THROWAWAY CODE. THROWAWAY CODE is quick-and-dirty code that was intended to be used only once and then discarded. However, such code often takes on a life of its own, despite casual structure and poor or non-existent documentation. It works, so why fix it? When a related problem arises, the quickest way to address it might be to expediently modify this working code, rather than design a proper, general program from the ground up. Over time, a simple throwaway program begets a BIG BALL OF MUD. Even systems with well-defined architectures are prone to structural erosion. The relentless onslaught of changing requirements that any successful system attracts can gradually undermine its structure. Systems that were once tidy become overgrown as PIECEMEAL GROWTH gradually allows elements of the system to sprawl in an uncontrolled fashion. If such sprawl continues unabated, the structure of the system can become so badly compromised that it must be abandoned. As with a decaying neighborhood, a downward spiral ensues. Since the system becomes harder and harder to understand, maintenance becomes more expensive, and more difficult. Good programmers refuse to work there. Investors withdraw their capital. And yet, as with neighborhoods, there are ways to avoid, and even reverse, this sort of decline. As with anything else in the universe, counteracting entropic forces requires an investment of energy. Software gentrification is no exception. The way to arrest entropy in software is to refactor it. A sustained commitment to refactoring can keep a system from subsiding into a BIG BALL OF MUD. A major flood, fire, or war may require that a city be evacuated and rebuilt from the ground up. More often, change takes place a building or block at a time, while the city as a whole continues to function. Once established, a strategy of KEEPING IT WORKING preserves a municipality’s vitality as it grows. Systems and their constituent elements evolve at different rates. As they do, things that change quickly tend to become distinct from things that change more slowly. The SHEARING LAYERS that develop between them are like fault lines or facets that help foster the emergence of enduring abstractions. A simple way to begin to control decline is to cordon off the blighted areas, and put an attractive façade around them. We call this strategy SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG. In more advanced cases, there may be no alternative but to tear everything down and start over. When total RECONSTRUCTION becomes necessary, all that is left to salvage is the patterns that underlie the experience. Some of these patterns might appear at first to be antipatterns [Brown et al. 1998] or straw men, but they are not, at least in the customary sense. Instead, they seek to examine the gap between what we preach and what we practice. Still, some of them may strike some readers as having a schizoid quality about them. So, for the record, let us put our cards on the table. We are in favor of good architecture. Our ultimate agenda is to help drain these swamps. Where possible, architectural decline should be prevented, arrested, or reversed. We discuss ways of doing this. In severe cases, architectural abominations may even need to be demolished. At the same time, we seek not to cast blame upon those who must wallow in these mires. In part, our attitude is to \"hate the sin, but love the sinner\". But, it goes beyond this. Not every backyard storage shack needs marble columns. There are significant forces that can conspire to compel architecture to take a back seat to functionality, particularly early in the evolution of a software artifact. Opportunities and insights that can allow for architectural progress often are present later rather than earlier in the lifecycle. A certain amount of controlled chaos is natural during construction, and can be tolerated, as long as you clean up after yourself eventually. Even beyond this though, a complex system may be an accurate reflection of our immature understanding of a complex problem. The class of systems that we can build at all may be larger than the class of systems we can build elegantly, at least at first. A somewhat ramshackle rat's nest might be a state-of-the-art architecture for a poorly understood domain. This should not be the end of the story, though. As we gain more experience in such domains, we should increasingly direct our energies to gleaning more enduring architectural abstractions from them. The patterns described herein are not intended to stand alone. They are instead set in a context that includes a number of other patterns that we and others have described. In particular, they are set in contrast to the lifecycle patterns, PROTOTYPE PHASE, EXPANSIONARY PHASE, and CONSOLIDATION PHASE, presented in [Foote & Opdyke 1995] and [Coplien 1995], the SOFTWARE TECTONICS pattern in [Foote & Yoder 1996], and the framework development patterns in [Roberts & Johnson 1998]. Indeed, to a substantial extent, much of this chapter describes the disease, while the patterns above describe what we believe can be the cure: a flexible, adaptive, feedback-driven development process in which design and refactoring pervade the lifecycle of each artifact, component, and framework, within and beyond the applications that incubate them. Forces A number of forces can conspire to drive even the most architecturally conscientious organizations to produce BIG BALLS OF MUD. These pervasive, \"global\" forces are at work in all the patterns presented. Among these forces: Time: There may not be enough time to consider the long-term architectural implications of one’s design and implementation decisions. Even when systems have been well designed, architectural concerns often must yield to more pragmatic ones as a deadline starts to loom. One reason that software architectures are so often mediocre is that architecture frequently takes a back seat to more mundane concerns such as cost, time-to-market, and programmer skill. Architecture is often seen as a luxury or a frill, or the indulgent pursuit of lily-gilding compulsives who have no concern for the bottom line. Architecture is often treated with neglect, and even disdain. While such attitudes are unfortunate, they are not hard to understand. Architecture is a long-term concern. The concerns above have to be addressed if a product is not to be stillborn in the marketplace, while the benefits of good architecture are realized later in the lifecycle, as frameworks mature, and reusable black-box components emerge [Foote & Opdyke 1995]. Architecture can be looked upon as a Risk, that will consume resources better directed at meeting a fleeting market window, or as an Opportunity to lay the groundwork for a commanding advantage down the road. Indeed, an immature architecture can be an advantage in a growing system because data and functionality can migrate to their natural places in the system unencumbered by artificial architectural constraints. Premature architecture can be more dangerous than none at all, as unproved architectural hypotheses turn into straightjackets that discourage evolution and experimentation. Cost: Architecture is expensive, especially when a new domain is being explored. Getting the system right seems like a pointless luxury once the system is limping well enough to ship. An investment in architecture usually does not pay off immediately. Indeed, if architectural concerns delay a product’s market entry for too long, then long-term concerns may be moot. Who benefits from an investment in architecture, and when is a return on this investment seen? Money spent on a quick-and-dirty project that allows an immediate entry into the market may be better spent than money spent on elaborate, speculative architectural fishing expedition. It’s hard to recover the value of your architectural assets if you’ve long since gone bankrupt. Programmers with the ability to discern and design quality architectures are reputed to command a premium. These expenses must be weighed against those of allowing an expensive system to slip into premature decline and obsolescence. If you think good architecture is expensive, try bad architecture. Experience: Even when one has the time and inclination to take architectural concerns into account, one’s experience, or lack thereof, with the domain can limit the degree of architectural sophistication that can be brought to a system, particularly early in its evolution. Some programmers flourish in environments where they can discover and develop new abstractions, while others are more comfortable in more constrained environments (for instance, Smalltalk vs. Visual Basic programmers.) Often, initial versions of a system are vehicles whereby programmers learn what pieces must be brought into play to solve a particular problem. Only after these are identified do the architectural boundaries among parts of the system start to emerge. Inexperience can take a number of guises. There is absolute, fresh out of school inexperience. A good architect may lack domain experience, or a domain expert who knows the code cold may not have architectural experience. Employee turnover can wreak havoc on an organization’s institutional memory, with the perhaps dubious consolation of bringing fresh blood aboard. Skill: Programmers differ in their levels of skill, as well as in expertise, predisposition and temperament. Some programmers have a passion for finding good abstractions, while some are skilled at navigating the swamps of complex code left to them by others. Programmers differ tremendously in their degrees of experience with particular domains, and their capacities for adapting to new ones. Programmers differ in their language and tool preferences and experience as well. Visibility: Buildings are tangible, physical structures. You can look at a building. You can watch it being built. You can walk inside it, and admire and critique its design. A program’s user interface presents the public face of a program, much as a building’s exterior manifests its architecture. However, unlike buildings, only the people who build a program see how it looks inside. Programs are made of bits. The manner in which we present these bits greatly affects our sense of how they are put together. Some designers prefer to see systems depicted using modeling languages or PowerPoint pictures. Others prefer prose descriptions. Still others prefer to see code. The fashion in which we present our architectures affects our perceptions of whether they are good or bad, clear or muddled, and elegant or muddy. Indeed, one of the reasons that architecture is neglected is that much of it is \"under the hood\", where nobody can see it. If the system works, and it can be shipped, who cares what it looks like on the inside? Complexity: One reason for a muddled architecture is that software often reflects the inherent complexity of the application domain. This is what Brooks called \"essential complexity\" [Brooks 1995]. In other words, the software is ugly because the problem is ugly, or at least not well understood. Frequently, the organization of the system reflects the sprawl and history of the organization that built it (as per CONWAY’S LAW [Coplien 1995]) and the compromises that were made along the way. Renegotiating these relationships is often difficult once the basic boundaries among system elements are drawn. These relationships can take on the immutable character of \"site\" boundaries that Brand [Brand 1994] observed in real cities. Big problems can arises when the needs of the applications force unrestrained communication across these boundaries. The system becomes a tangled mess, and what little structure is there can erode further. Change: Architecture is a hypothesis about the future that holds that subsequent change will be confined to that part of the design space encompassed by that architecture. Of course, the world has a way of mocking our attempts to make such predictions by tossing us the totally unexpected. A problem we might have been told was definitely ruled out of consideration for all time may turn out to be dear to the heart of a new client we never thought we’d have. Such changes may cut directly across the grain of fundamental architectural decisions made in the light of the certainty that these new contingencies could never arise. The \"right\" thing to do might be to redesign the system. The more likely result is that the architecture of the system will be expediently perturbed to address the new requirements, with only passing regard for the effect of these radical changes on the structure of the system. Scale: Managing a large project is a qualitatively different problem from managing a small one, just as leading a division of infantry into battle is different from commanding a small special forces team. Obviously, \"divide and conquer\" is, in general, an insufficient answer to the problems posed by scale. Alan Kay, during an invited talk at OOPSLA '86 observed that \"good ideas don't always scale.\" That observation prompted Henry Lieberman to inquire \"so what do we do, just scale the bad ones?\" BIG BALL OF MUD alias SHANTYTOWN SPAGHETTI CODE Shantytowns are squalid, sprawling slums. Everyone seems to agree they are a bad idea, but forces conspire to promote their emergence anyway. What is it that they are doing right? Shantytowns are usually built from common, inexpensive materials and simple tools. Shantytowns can be built using relatively unskilled labor. Even though the labor force is \"unskilled\" in the customary sense, the construction and maintenance of this sort of housing can be quite labor intensive. There is little specialization. Each housing unit is constructed and maintained primarily by its inhabitants, and each inhabitant must be a jack of all the necessary trades. There is little concern for infrastructure, since infrastructure requires coordination and capital, and specialized resources, equipment, and skills. There is little overall planning or regulation of growth. Shantytowns emerge where there is a need for housing, a surplus of unskilled labor, and a dearth of capital investment. Shantytowns fulfill an immediate, local need for housing by bringing available resources to bear on the problem. Loftier architectural goals are a luxury that has to wait. Maintaining a shantytown is labor-intensive and requires a broad range of skills. One must be able to improvise repairs with the materials on-hand, and master tasks from roof repair to ad hoc sanitation. However, there is little of the sort of skilled specialization that one sees in a mature economy. All too many of our software systems are, architecturally, little more than shantytowns. Investment in tools and infrastructure is too often inadequate. Tools are usually primitive, and infrastructure such as libraries and frameworks, is undercapitalized. Individual portions of the system grow unchecked, and the lack of infrastructure and architecture allows problems in one part of the system to erode and pollute adjacent portions. Deadlines loom like monsoons, and architectural elegance seems unattainable. v v v As a system nears completion, its actual users may begin to work with it for the first time. This experience may inspire changes to data formats and the user interface that undermine architectural decisions that had been thought to be settled. Also, as Brooks [Brooks 1995] has noted, because software is so flexible, it is often asked to bear the burden of architectural compromises late in the development cycle of hardware/software deliverables precisely because of its flexibility. This phenomenon is not unique to software. Stewart Brand [Brand 1994] has observed that the period just prior to a building’s initial occupancy can be a stressful period for both architects and their clients. The money is running out, and the finishing touches are being put on just those parts of the space that will interact the most with its occupants. During this period, it can become evident that certain wish-list items are not going to make it, and that exotic experiments are not going to work. Compromise becomes the \"order of the day\". The time and money to chase perfection are seldom available, nor should they be. To survive, we must do what it takes to get our software working and out the door on time. Indeed, if a team completes a project with time to spare, today’s managers are likely to take that as a sign to provide less time and money or fewer people the next time around. You need to deliver quality software on time, and under budget. Cost: Architecture is a long-term investment. It is easy for the people who are paying the bills to dismiss it, unless there is some tangible immediate benefit, such a tax write-off, or unless surplus money and time happens to be available. Such is seldom the case. More often, the customer needs something working by tomorrow. Often, the people who control and manage the development process simply do not regard architecture as a pressing concern. If programmers know that workmanship is invisible, and managers don't want to pay for it anyway, a vicious circle is born. Skill: Ralph Johnson is fond of observing that is inevitable that \"on average, average organizations will have average people\". One reason for the popularity and success of BIG BALL OF MUD approaches might be that this appoach doesn't require a hyperproductive virtuoso architect at every keyboard. Organization: With larger projects, cultural, process, organizational and resource allocation issues can overwhelm technical concerns such as tools, languages, and architecture. It may seem to a programmer that whether to don hip boots and wade into a swamp is a major quality-of-life matter, but programmer comfort is but one concern to a manager, which can conflict with many others. Architecture and code quality may strike management as frills that have only an indirect impact on their bottom lines. Therefore, focus first on features and functionality, then focus on architecture and performance. The case made here resembles Gabriel’s \"Worse is Better\" arguments [Gabriel 1991] in a number of respects. Why does so much software, despite the best intentions and efforts of developers, turn into BIG BALLS OF MUD? Why do slash-and-burn tactics drive out elegance? Does bad architecture drive out good architecture? What does this muddy code look like to the programmers in the trenches who must confront it? Data structures may be haphazardly constructed, or even next to non-existent. Everything talks to everything else. Every shred of important state data may be global. There are those who might construe this as a sort of blackboard approach [Buschmann 1996], but it more closely resembles a grab bag of undifferentiated state. Where state information is compartmentalized, it may be passed promiscuously about though Byzantine back channels that circumvent the system's original structure. Variable and function names might be uninformative, or even misleading. Functions themselves may make extensive use of global variables, as well as long lists of poorly defined parameters. The function themselves are lengthy and convoluted, and perform several unrelated tasks. Code is duplicated. The flow of control is hard to understand, and difficult to follow. The programmer’s intent is next to impossible to discern. The code is simply unreadable, and borders on indecipherable. The code exhibits the unmistakable signs of patch after patch at the hands of multiple maintainers, each of whom barely understood the consequences of what he or she was doing. Did we mention documentation? What documentation? BIG BALL OF MUD might be thought of as an anti-pattern, since our intention is to show how passivity in the face of forces that undermine architecture can lead to a quagmire. However, its undeniable popularity leads to the inexorable conclusion that it is a pattern in its own right. It is certainly a pervasive, recurring solution to the problem of producing a working system in the context of software development. It would seem to be the path of least resistance when one confronts the sorts of forces discussed above. Only by understanding the logic of its appeal can we channel or counteract the forces that lead to a BIG BALL OF MUD. One thing that isn’t the answer is rigid, totalitarian, top-down design. Some analysts, designers, and architects have an exaggerated sense of their ability to get things right up-front, before moving into implementation. This approach leads to inefficient resources utilization, analysis paralysis, and design straightjackets and cul-de-sacs. Kent Beck has observed that the way to build software is to: Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast [Beck 1997]. \"Make it work\" means that we should focus on functionality up-front, and get something running. \"Make it right\" means that we should concern ourselves with how to structure the system only after we’ve figured out the pieces we need to solve the problem in the first place. \"Make it fast\" means that we should be concerned about optimizing performance only after we’ve learned how to solve the problem, and after we’ve discerned an architecture to elegantly encompass this functionality. Once all this has been done, one can consider how to make it cheap. When it comes to software architecture, form follows function. Here we mean \"follows\" not in the traditional sense of dictating function. Instead, we mean that the distinct identities of the system’s architectural elements often don’t start to emerge until after the code is working. Domain experience is an essential ingredient in any framework design effort. It is hard to try to follow a front-loaded, top-down design process under the best of circumstances. Without knowing the architectural demands of the domain, such an attempt is premature, if not foolhardy. Often, the only way to get domain experience early in the lifecycle is to hire someone who has worked in a domain before from someone else. The quality of one’s tools can influence a system’s architecture. If a system’s architectural goals are inadequately communicated among members of a team, they will be harder to take into account as the system is designed and constructed. Finally, engineers will differ in their levels of skill and commitment to architecture. Sadly, architecture has been undervalued for so long that many engineers regard life with a BIG BALL OF MUD as normal. Indeed some engineers are particularly skilled at learning to navigate these quagmires, and guiding others through them. Over time, this symbiosis between architecture and skills can change the character of the organization itself, as swamp guides become more valuable than architects. As per CONWAY’S LAW [Coplien 1995], architects depart in futility, while engineers who have mastered the muddy details of the system they have built in their images prevail. [Foote & Yoder 1998a] went so far as to observe that inscrutable code might, in fact, have a survival advantage over good code, by virtue of being difficult to comprehend and change. This advantage can extend to those programmers who can find their ways around such code. In a land devoid of landmarks, such guides may become indispensable. The incentives that drive the evolution of such systems can, at times, operate perversely. Just as it is easier to be verbose than concise, it is easier to build complex systems than it is to build simple ones. Skilled programmers may be able to create complexity more quickly than their peers, and more quickly than they can document and explain it. Like an army outrunning its logistics train, complexity increases until it reaches the point where such programmers can no longer reliably cope with it. This is akin to a phenonmenon dubbed the PeterPrinciple of Programming by authors on the Wiki-Wiki web [Cunninghan 1999a]. Complexity increases rapidly until the it reaches a level of complexity just beyond that with which programmers can comfortably cope. At this point, complexity and our abilities to contain it reach an uneasy equilibrium. The blitzkrieg bogs down into a siege. We built the most complicated system that can possible work [Cunningham 1999b]. Such code can become a personal fiefdom, since the author care barely understand it anymore, and no one else can come close. Once simple repairs become all day affairs, as the code turns to mud. It becomes increasingly difficult for management to tell how long such repairs ought to take. Simple objectives turn into trench warfare. Everyone becomes resigned to a turgid pace. Some even come to prefer it, hiding in their cozy foxholes, and making their two line-per-day repairs. It is interesting to ask whether some of the differences in productivity seen between hyper-productive organizations and typical shops are due not to differences in talent, but differences in terrain. Mud is hard to march through. The hacker in the trenches must engage complexity in hand-to-hand combat every day. Sometimes, complexity wins. Status in the programmer's primate pecking order is often earned through ritual displays of cleverness, rather than through workman-like displays of simplicity and clarity. That which a culture glorifies will flourish. Yet, a case can be made that the casual, undifferentiated structure of a BIG BALL OF MUD is one of its secret advantages, since forces acting between two parts of the system can be directly addressed without having to worry about undermining the system’s grander architectural aspirations. These aspirations are modest ones at best in the typical BIG BALL OF MUD. Indeed, a casual approach to architecture is emblematic of the early phases of a system’s evolution, as programmers, architects and users learn their way around the domain [Foote & Opdyke 1995]. During the PROTOTYPE and EXPANSIONARY PHASES of a systems evolution, expedient, white-box inheritance-based code borrowing, and a relaxed approach to encapsulation are common. Later, as experience with the system accrues, the grain of the architectural domain becomes discernable, and more durable black-box components begin to emerge. In other words, it’s okay if the system looks at first like a BIG BALL OF MUD, at least until you know better. v v v Brian Marick first suggested the name \"BIG BALL OF MUD\" as a name for these sort of architectures, and the observation that this was, perhaps, the dominant architecture currently deployed, during a meeting of the University of Illinois Software Architecture Group several years ago. We have been using the term ever since. The term itself, in turn, appears to have arisen during the '70s as a characterization of Lisp. BIG BALL OF MUD architectures often emerge from throw-away prototypes, or THROWAWAY CODE, because the prototype is kept, or the disposable code is never disposed of. (One might call these \"little balls of mud\".) They also can emerge as gradual maintenance and PIECEMEAL GROWTH impinges upon the structure of a mature system. Once a system is working, a good way to encourage its growth is to KEEP IT WORKING. When the SHEARING LAYERS that emerge as change drives the system's evolution run against the existing grain of the system, its structure can be undermined, and the result can be a BIG BALL OF MUD. The PROTOTYPE PHASE and EXPANSION PHASE patterns in [Foote & Opdyke 1995] both emphasize that a period of exploration and experimentation is often beneficial before making enduring architectural commitments. However, these activities, which can undermine a system's structure should be interspersed with CONSOLIDATION PHASES [Foote & Opdyke 1995], during which opportunities to refactor the system to enhance its structure are exploited. Proponents of Extreme Programming [Beck 2000] also emphasize continuous coding and refactoring. [Brand 1994] observes that buildings with large spaces punctuated with regular columns had the paradoxical effect of encouraging the innovative reuse of space precisely because they constrained the design space. Grandiose flights of architectural fancy weren’t possible, which reduced the number of design alternatives that could be put on the table. Sometimes FREEDOM FROM CHOICE [Foote 1988] is what we really want. One of mud's most effective enemies is sunshine. Subjecting convoluted code to scrutiny can set the stage for its refactoring, repair, and rehabilitation. Code reviews are one mechanism one can use to expose code to daylight. Another is the Extreme Programming practice of pair programming [Beck 2000]. A pure pair programming approach requires that every line of code written be added to the system with two programmers present. One types, or \"drives\", while the other \"rides shotgun\" and looks on. In contrast to traditional solitary software production practices, pair programming subjects code to immediate scrutiny, and provides a means by which knowledge about the system is rapidly disseminated. Indeed, reviews and pair programming provide programmers with something their work would not otherwise have: an audience. Sunlight, it is said is a powerful disinfectant. Pair-practices add an element of performance to programming. An immediate audience of one's peers provides immediate incentives to programmers to keep their code clear and comprehensible, as well as functional. An additional benefit of pairing is that accumulated wisdom and best practices can be rapidly disseminated throughout an organization through successive pairings. This is, incidentally, the same benefit that sexual reproduction brought to the genome. By contrast, if no one ever looks at code, everyone is free to think they are better than average at producing it. Programmers will, instead, respond to those relatively perverse incentives that do exist. Line of code metrics, design documents, and other indirect measurements of progress and quality can become central concerns. There are three ways to deal with BIG BALLS OF MUD. The first is to keep the system healthy. Conscientiously alternating periods of EXPANSION with periods of CONSOLIDATION, refactoring and repair can maintain, and even enhance a system's structure as it evolves. The second is to throw the system away and start over. The RECONSTRUCTION pattern explores this drastic, but frequently necessary alternative. The third is to simply surrender to entropy, and wallow in the mire. Since the time of Roman architect Marcus Vitruvius, [Vitruvius 20 B.C.] architects have focused on his trinity of desirables: Firmitas (strength), Utilitas (utility), and Venustas (beauty). A BIG BALL OF MUD usually represents a triumph of utility over aesthetics, because workmanship is sacrificed for functionality. Structure and durability can be sacrificed as well, because an incomprehensible program defies attempts at maintenance. The frenzied, feature-driven \"bloatware\" phenomenon seen in many large consumer software products can be seen as evidence of designers having allowed purely utilitarian concerns to dominate software design. THROWAWAY CODE alias QUICK HACK KLEENEX CODE DISPOSABLE CODE SCRIPTING KILLER DEMO PERMANENT PROTOTYPE BOOMTOWN v v v A homeowner might erect a temporary storage shed or car port, with every intention of quickly tearing it down and replacing it with something more permanent. Such structures have a way of enduring indefinitely. The money expected to replace them might not become available. Or, once the new structure is constructed, the temptation to continue to use the old one for \"a while\" might be hard to resist. Likewise, when you are prototyping a system, you are not usually concerned with how elegant or efficient your code is. You know that you will only use it to prove a concept. Once the prototype is done, the code will be thrown away and written properly. As the time nears to demonstrate the prototype, the temptation to load it with impressive but utterly inefficient realizations of the system’s expected eventual functionality can be hard to resist. Sometimes, this strategy can be a bit too successful. The client, rather than funding the next phase of the project, may slate the prototype itself for release. You need an immediate fix for a small problem, or a quick prototype or proof of concept. Time, or a lack thereof, is frequently the decisive force that drives programmers to write THROWAWAY CODE. Taking the time to write a proper, well thought out, well documented program might take more time that is available to solve a problem, or more time that the problem merits. Often, the programmer will make a frantic dash to construct a minimally functional program, while all the while promising him or herself that a better factored, more elegant version will follow thereafter. They may know full well that building a reusable system will make it easier to solve similar problems in the future, and that a more polished architecture would result in a system that was easier to maintain and extend. Quick-and-dirty coding is often rationalized as being a stopgap measure. All too often, time is never found for this follow up work. The code languishes, while the program flourishes. Therefore, produce, by any means available, simple, expedient, disposable code that adequately addresses just the problem at-hand. THROWAWAY CODE is often written as an alternative to reusing someone else’s more complex code. When the deadline looms, the certainty that you can produce a sloppy program that works yourself can outweigh the unknown cost of learning and mastering someone else’s library or framework. Programmers are usually not domain experts, especially at first. Use cases or CRC cards [Beck & Cunningham 1989] can help them to discover domain objects. However, nothing beats building a prototype to help a team learn its way around a domain. When you build a prototype, there is always the risk that someone will say \"that's good enough, ship it\". One way to minimize the risk of a prototype being put into production is to write the prototype in using a language or tool that you couldn't possibly use for a production version of your product. Proponents of Extreme Programming [Beck 2000] often construct quick, disposable prototypes called \"spike solutions\". Prototypes help us learn our way around the problem space, but should never be mistaken for good designs [Johnson & Foote 1988]. Not every program need be a palace. A simple throwaway program is like a tent city or a mining boomtown, and often has no need for fifty year solutions to its problems, given that it will give way to a ghost town in five. The real problem with THROWAWAY CODE comes when it isn't thrown away. v v v The production of THROWAWAY CODE is a nearly universal practice. Any software developer, at any skill or experience level, can be expected to have had at least occasional first-hand experience with this approach to software development. For example, in the patterns community, two examples of quick-and-dirty code that have endured are the PLoP online registration code, and the Wiki-Wiki Web pages. The EuroPLoP/PLoP/UP online registration code was, in effect, a distributed web-based application that ran on four different machines on two continents. Conference information was maintained on a machine in St. Louis, while registration records were kept on machines in Illinois and Germany. The system could generate web-based reports of registration activity, and now even instantaneously maintaineed an online attendees list. It began life in 1995 as a quick-and-dirty collection of HTML, scavenged C demonstration code, and csh scripts. It was undertaken largely as an experiment in web-based form processing prior to PLoP ‘95, and, like so many things on the Web, succeeded considerably beyond the expectations of its authors. Today, it is still essentially the same collection of HTML, scavenged C demonstration code, and csh scripts. As such, it showcases how quick-and-dirty code can, when successful, take on a life of its own. The original C code and scripts probably contained fewer than three dozen original lines of code. Many lines were cut-and-paste jobs that differed only in the specific text they generate, or fields that they check. Here’s an example of one of the scripts that generates the attendance report: echo \"Registrations: \" `lswc -l` \"\" echo \"\" echo \"Authors: \" `grep 'Author = Yes' *wc -l` \"\" echo \"\" echo \"Non-Authors: \" `grep 'Author = No' *wc -l` \"\" echo \"\" This script is slow and inefficient, particularly as the number of registrations increases, but not least among its virtues is the fact that it works. Were the number of attendees to exceed more than around one hundred, this script would start to perform so badly as to be unusable. However, since hundreds of attendees would exceed the physical capacity of the conference site, we knew the number of registrations would have been limited long before the performance of this script became a significant problem. So while this approach is, in general, a lousy way to address this problem, it is perfectly satisfactory within the confines of the particular purpose for which the script has ever actually been used. Such practical constraints are typical of THROWAWAY CODE, and are more often than not undocumented. For that matter, everything about THROWAWAY CODE is more often than not undocumented. When documentation exists, it is frequently not current, and often not accurate. The Wiki-Web code at www.c2.com also started as a CGI experiment undertaken by Ward Cunningham also succeeded beyond the author’s expectations. The name \"wiki\" is one of Ward’s personal jokes, having been taken from a Hawaiian word for \"quick\" that the author had seen on an airport van on a vacation in Hawaii. Ward has subsequently used the name for a number of quick-and-dirty projects. The Wiki Web is unusual in that any visitor may change anything that anyone else has written indiscriminately. This would seem like a recipe for vandalism, but in practice, it has worked out well. In light of the system’s success, the author has subsequently undertaken additional work to polish it up, but the same quick-and-dirty Perl CGI core remains at the heart of the system. Both systems might be thought of as being on the verge of graduating from little balls of mud to BIG BALLS OF MUD. The registration system’s C code metastasized from one of the NCSA HTTPD server demos, and still contains zombie code that testifies to this heritage. At each step, KEEPING IT WORKING is a premiere consideration in deciding whether to extend or enhance the system. Both systems might be good candidates for RECONSTRUCTION, were the resources, interest, and audience present to justify such an undertaking. In the mean time, these systems, which are still sufficiently well suited to the particular tasks for which they were built, remain in service. Keeping them on the air takes far less energy than rewriting them. They continue to evolve, in a PIECEMEAL fashion, a little at a time. You can ameloriate the architectural erosion that can be caused by quick-and-dirty code by isolating it from other parts of your system, in its own objects, packages, or modules. To the extent that such code can be quarantined, its ability to affect the integrity of healthy parts of a system is reduced. Once it becomes evident that a purportedly disposable artifact is going to be around for a while, one can turn one's attention to improving its structure, either through an iterative process of PIECEMEAL GROWTH, or via a fresh draft, as discussed in the RECONSTRUCTION pattern. From boomtown to ghost town: The mining town of Rhyolite, in Death Valley, was briefly the third largest city in Nevada. Then the ore ran out. PIECEMEAL GROWTH alias URBAN SPRAWL ITERATIVE-INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT The Russian Mir (\"Peace\") Space Station Complex was designed for reconfiguration and modular growth. The Core module was launched in 1986, and the Kvant (\"Quantum\") and Kvant-2 modules joined the complex in 1987 and 1989. The Kristall (\"Crystal\") module was added in 1990. The Spektr (\"Spectrum\") and shuttle Docking modules were added in 1995, the latter surely a development not anticipated in 1986. The station’s final module, Priroda (\"Nature\"), was launched in 1996. The common core and independent maneuvering capabilities of several of the modules have allowed the complex to be rearranged several times as it has grown. Urban planning has an uneven history of success. For instance, Washington D.C. was laid out according to a master plan designed by the French architect L’Enfant. The capitals of Brazil (Brasilia) and Nigeria (Abuja) started as paper cities as well. Other cities, such as Houston, have grown without any overarching plan to guide them. Each approach has its problems. For instance, the radial street plans in L’Enftant’s master plan become awkward past a certain distance from the center. The lack of any plan at all, on the other hand, leads to a patchwork of residential, commercial, and industrial areas that is dictated by the capricious interaction of local forces such as land ownership, capital, and zoning. Since concerns such as recreation, shopping close to homes, and noise and pollution away from homes are not brought directly into the mix, they are not adequately addressed. Most cities are more like Houston than Abuja. They may begin as settlements, subdivisions, docks, or railway stops. Maybe people were drawn by gold, or lumber, access to transportation, or empty land. As time goes on, certain settlements achieve a critical mass, and a positive feedback cycle ensues. The city’s success draws tradesmen, merchants, doctors, and clergymen. The growing population is able to support infrastructure, governmental institutions, and police protection. These, in turn, draw more people. Different sections of town develop distinct identities. With few exceptions, (Salt Lake City comes to mind) the founders of these settlements never stopped to think that they were founding major cities. Their ambitions were usually more modest, and immediate. v v v It has become fashionable over the last several years to take pot shots at the \"traditional\" waterfall process model. It may seem to the reader that attacking it is tantamount to flogging a dead horse. However, if it be a dead horse, it is a tenacious one. While the approach itself is seen by many as having been long since discredited, it has spawned a legacy of rigid, top-down, front-loaded processes and methodologies that endure, in various guises, to this day. We can do worse that examine the forces that led to its original development. In the days before waterfall development, programming pioneers employed a simple, casual, relatively undisciplined \"code-and-fix\" approach to software development. Given the primitive nature of the problems of the day, this approach was frequently effective. However, the result of this lack of discipline was, all too often, a BIG BALL OF MUD. The waterfall approach arose in response to this muddy morass. While the code-and-fix approach might have been suitable for small jobs, it did not scale well. As software became more complex, it would not do to simply gather a room full of programmers together and tell them to go forth and code. Larger projects demanded better planning and coordination. Why, it was asked, can't software be engineered like cars and bridges, with a careful analysis of the problem, and a detailed up-front design prior to implementation? Indeed, an examination of software development costs showed that problems were many times more expensive to fix during maintenance than during design. Surely it was best to mobilize resources and talent up-front, so as to avoid maintenance expenses down the road. It's surely wiser to route the plumbing correctly now, before the walls are up, than to tear holes in them later. Measure twice, cut once. One of the reasons that the waterfall approach was able to flourish a generation ago was that computers and business requirements changed at a more leisurely pace. Hardware was very expensive, often dwarfing the salaries of the programmers hired to tend it. User interfaces were primitive by today's standards. You could have any user interface you wanted, as long as it was an alphanumeric \"green screen\". Another reason for the popularity of the waterfall approach was that it exhibited a comfortable similarity to practices in more mature engineering and manufacturing disciplines. Today's designers are confronted with a broad onslaught of changing requirements. It arises in part from the rapid growth of technology itself, and partially from rapid changes in the business climate (some of which is driven by technology). Customers are used to more sophisticated software these days, and demand more choice and flexibility. Products that were once built from the ground up by in-house programmers must now be integrated with third-party code and applications. User interfaces are complex, both externally and internally. Indeed, we often dedicate an entire tier of our system to their care and feeding. Change threatens to outpace our ability to cope with it. Master plans are often rigid, misguided and out of date. Users’ needs change with time. Change: The fundamental problem with top-down design is that real world requirement are inevitably moving targets. You can't simply aspire to solve the problem at hand once and for all, because, by the time you're done, the problem will have changed out from underneath you. You can't simply do what the customer wants, for quite often, they don't know what they want. You can't simply plan, you have to plan to be able to adapt. If you can't fully anticipate what is going to happen, you must be prepared to be nimble. Aesthetics: The goal of up-front design is to be able to discern and specify the significant architectural elements of a system before ground is broken for it. A superior design, given this mindset, is one that elegantly and completely specifies the system's structure before a single line of code has been written. Mismatches between these blueprints and reality are considered aberrations, and are treated as mistakes on the part of the designer. A better design would have anticipated these oversights. In the presence of volatile requirements, aspirations towards such design perfection are as vain as the desire for a hole-in-one on every hole. To avoid such embarrassment, the designer may attempt to cover him or herself by specifying a more complicated, and more general solution to certain problems, secure in the knowledge that others will bear the burden of constructing these artifacts. When such predictions about where complexity is needed are correct, they can indeed be a source of power and satisfaction. This is part of their allure of Venustas. However, sometime the anticipated contingencies never arise, and the designer and implementers wind up having wasted effort solving a problem that no one has ever actually had. Other times, not only is the anticipated problem never encountered, its solution introduces complexity in a part of the system that turns out to need to evolve in another direction. In such cases, speculative complexity can be an unnecessary obstacle to subsequent adaptation. It is ironic that the impulse towards elegance can be an unintended source of complexity and clutter instead. In its most virulent form, the desire to anticipate and head off change can lead to \"analysis paralysis\", as the thickening web of imagined contingencies grows to the point where the design space seems irreconcilably constrained. Therefore, incrementally address forces that encourage change and growth. Allow opportunities for growth to be exploited locally, as they occur. Refactor unrelentingly. Successful software attracts a wider audience, which can, in turn, place a broader range of requirements on it. These new requirements can run against the grain of the original design. Nonetheless, they can frequently be addressed, but at the cost of cutting across the grain of existing architectural assumptions. [Foote 1988] called this architectural erosion midlife generality loss. When designers are faced with a choice between building something elegant from the ground up, or undermining the architecture of the existing system to quickly address a problem, architecture usually loses. Indeed, this is a natural phase in a system’s evolution [Foote & Opdyke 1995]. This might be thought of as messy kitchen phase, during which pieces of the system are scattered across the counter, awaiting an eventual cleanup. The danger is that the clean up is never done. With real kitchens, the board of health will eventually intervene. With software, alas, there is seldom any corresponding agency to police such squalor. Uncontrolled growth can ultimately be a malignant force. The result of neglecting to contain it can be a BIG BALL OF MUD. In How Buildings Learn, Brand [Brand 1994] observed that what he called High Road architecture often resulted in buildings that were expensive and difficult to change, while vernacular, Low Road buildings like bungalows and warehouses were, paradoxically, much more adaptable. Brand noted that Function melts form, and low road buildings are more amenable to such change. Similarly, with software, you may be reluctant to desecrate another programmer’s cathedral. Expedient changes to a low road system that exhibits no discernable architectural pretensions to begin with are easier to rationalize. In the Oregon Experiment [Brand 1994][Alexander 1988] Alexander noted: Large-lump development is based on the idea of replacement. Piecemeal Growth is based on the idea of repair. … Large-lump development is based on the fallacy that it is possible to build perfect buildings. Piecemeal growth is based on the healthier and more realistic view that mistakes are inevitable. … Unless money is available for repairing these mistakes, every building, once built, is condemned to be, to some extent unworkable. … Piecemeal growth is based on the assumption that adaptation between buildings and their users is necessarily a slow and continuous business which cannot, under any circumstances, be achieve in a single leap. Alexander has noted that our mortgage and capital expenditure policies make large sums of money available up front, but do nothing to provide resources for maintenance, improvement, and evolution [Brand 1994][Alexander 1988]. In the software world, we deploy our most skilled, experienced people early in the lifecycle. Later on, maintenance is relegated to junior staff, when resources can be scarce. The so-called maintenance phase is the part of the lifecycle in which the price of the fiction of master planning is really paid. It is maintenance programmers who are called upon to bear the burden of coping with the ever widening divergence between fixed designs and a continuously changing world. If the hypothesis that architectural insight emerges late in the lifecycle is correct, then this practice should be reconsidered. Brand went on to observe Maintenance is learning. He distinguishes three levels of learning in the context of systems. This first is habit, where a system dutifully serves its function within the parameters for which it was designed. The second level comes into play when the system must adapt to change. Here, it usually must be modified, and its capacity to sustain such modification determines it’s degree of adaptability. The third level is the most interesting: learning to learn. With buildings, adding a raised floor is an example. Having had to sustain a major upheaval, the system adapts so that subsequent adaptations will be much less painful. PIECEMEAL GROWTH can be undertaken in an opportunistic fashion, starting with the existing, living, breathing system, and working outward, a step at a time, in such a way as to not undermine the system’s viability. You enhance the program as you use it. Broad advances on all fronts are avoided. Instead, change is broken down into small, manageable chunks. One of the most striking things about PIECEMEAL GROWTH is the role played by Feedback. Herbert Simon [Simon 1969] has observed that few of the adaptive systems that have been forged by evolution or shaped by man depend on prediction as their main means of coping with the future. He notes that two complementary mechanisms, homeostasis, and retrospective feedback, are often far more effective. Homeostasis insulates the system from short-range fluctuations in its environment, while feedback mechanisms respond to long-term discrepancies between a system's actual and desired behavior, and adjust it accordingly. Alexander [Alexander 1964] has written extensively of the roles that homeostasis and feedback play in adaptation as well. If you can adapt quickly to change, predicting it becomes far less crucial. Hindsight, as Brand observes [Brand 1994] is better than foresight. Such rapid adaptation is the basis of one of the mantras of Extreme Programming [Beck 2000]: You're not going to need it. Proponents of XP (as it is called) say to pretend you are not a smart as you think you are, and wait until this clever idea of yours is actually required before you take the time to bring it into being. In the cases where you were right, hey, you saw it coming, and you know what to do. In the cases where you were wrong, you won't have wasted any effort solving a problem you've never had when the design heads in an unanticipated direction instead. Extreme Programming relies heavily on feedback to keep requirements in sync with code, by emphasizing short (three week) iterations, and extensive, continuous consultation with users regarding design and development priorities throughout the development process. Extreme Programmers do not engage in extensive up-front planning. Instead, they produce working code as quickly as possible, and steer these prototypes towards what the users are looking for based on feedback. Feedback also plays a role in determining coding assignments. Coders who miss a deadline are assigned a different task during the next iteration, regardless of how close they may have been to completing the task. This form of feedback resembles the stern justice meted out by the jungle to the fruit of uncompetitive pairings. Extreme Programming also emphasizes testing as an integral part of the development process. Tests are developed, ideally, before the code itself. Code is continuously tested as it is developed. There is a \"back-to-the-future\" quality to Extreme Programming. In many respects, it resembles the blind Code and Fix approach. The thing that distinguishes it is the central role played by feedback in driving the system's evolution. This evolution is abetted, in turn, by modern object-oriented languages and powerful refactoring tools. Proponents of extreme programming portray it as placing minimal emphasis on planning and up-front design. They rely instead on feedback and continuous integration. We believe that a certain amount of up-front planning and design is not only important, but inevitable. No one really goes into any project blindly. The groundwork must be laid, the infrastructure must be decided upon, tools must be selected, and a general direction must be set. A focus on a shared architectural vision and strategy should be established early. Unbridled, change can undermine structure. Orderly change can enhance it. Change can engender malignant sprawl, or healthy, orderly growth. v v v A broad consensus that objects emerge from an iterative incremental evolutionary process has formed in the object-oriented community over the last decade. See for instance [Booch 1994]. The SOFTWARE TECTONICS pattern [Foote & Yoder 1996] examines how systems can incrementally cope with change. The biggest risk associated with PIECEMEAL GROWTH is that it will gradually erode the overall structure of the system, and inexorably turn it into a BIG BALL OF MUD. A strategy of KEEPING IT WORKING goes hand in hand with PIECEMEAL GROWTH. Both patterns emphasize acute, local concerns at the expense of chronic, architectural ones. To counteract these forces, a permanent commitment to CONSOLIDATION and refactoring must be made. It is through such a process that local and global forces are reconciled over time. This lifecyle perspective has been dubbed the fractal model [Foote & Opdyke 1995]. To quote Alexander [Brand 1994][Alexander 1988]: An organic process of growth and repair must create a gradual sequence of changes, and these changes must be distributed evenly across all levels of scale. [In developing a college campus] there must be as much attention to the repair of details—rooms, wings of buildings, windows, paths—as to the creation of brand new buildings. Only then can the environment be balanced both as a whole, and in its parts, at every moment in its history. KEEP IT WORKING alias VITALITY BABY STEPS DAILY BUILD FIRST, DO NO HARM Probably the greatest factor that keeps us moving forward is that we use the system all the time, and we keep trying to do new things with it. It is this \"living-with\" which drives us to root out failures, to clean up inconsistencies, and which inspires our occasional innovation. Daniel H. H. Ingalls [Ingalls 1983] Once a city establishes its infrastructure, it is imperative that it be kept working. For example, if the sewers break, and aren’t quickly repaired, the consequences can escalate from merely unpleasant to genuinely life threatening. People come to expect that they can rely on their public utilities being available 24 hours per day. They (rightfully) expect to be able to demand that an outage be treated as an emergency. v v v Software can be like this. Often a business becomes dependent upon the data driving it. Businesses have become critically dependent on their software and computing infrastructures. There are numerous mission critical systems that must be on-the-air twenty-four hours a day/seven days per week. If these systems go down, inventories can not be checked, employees can not be paid, aircraft cannot be routed, and so on. There may be times where taking a system down for a major overhaul can be justified, but usually, doing so is fraught with peril. However, once the system is brought back up, it is difficult to tell which from among a large collection of modifications might have caused a new problem. Every change is suspect. This is why deferring such integration is a recipe for misery. Capers Jones [Jones 1999] reported that the chance that a significant change might contain a new error--a phenomenon he ominously referred to as a Bad Fix Injection-- was about 7% in the United States. This may strike some readers as a low figure. Still, it's easy to see that compounding this possibility can lead to a situation where multiple upgrades are increasing likely to break a system. Maintenance needs have accumulated, but an overhaul is unwise, since you might break the system. Workmanship: Architects who live in the house they are building have an obvious incentive to insure that things are done properly, since they will directly reap the consequences when they do not. The idea of the architect-builder is a central theme of Alexander's work. Who better to resolve the forces impinging upon each design issue as it arises as the person who is going to have to live with these decisions? The architect-builder will be the direct beneficiary of his or her own workmanship and care. Mistakes and shortcuts will merely foul his or her own nest. Dependability: These days, people rely on our software artifacts for their very livelihoods, and even, at time, for their very safety. It is imperative that ill-advise changes to elements of a system do not drag the entire system down. Modern software systems are intricate, elaborate webs of interdependent elements. When an essential element is broken, everyone who depends on it will be affected. Deadlines can be missed, and tempers can flare. This problem is particularly acute in BIG BALLS OF MUD, since a single failure can bring the entire system down like a house of cards. Therefore, do what it takes to maintain the software and keep it going. Keep it working. When you are living in the system you’re building, you have an acute incentive not to break anything. A plumbing outage will be a direct inconvenience, and hence you have a powerful reason to keep it brief. You are, at times, working with live wires, and must exhibit particular care. A major benefit of working with a live system is that feedback is direct, and nearly immediate. One of the strengths of this strategy is that modifications that break the system are rejected immediately. There are always a large number of paths forward from any point in a system’s evolution, and most of them lead nowhere. By immediately selecting only those that do not undermine the system’s viability, obvious dead-ends are avoided. Of course, this sort of reactive approach, that of kicking the nearest, meanest woolf from your door, is not necessarily globally optimal. Yet, by eliminating obvious wrong turns, only more insidiously incorrect paths remain. While these are always harder to identify and correct, they are, fortunately less numerous than those cases where the best immediate choice is also the best overall choice as well. It may seem that this approach only accommodates minor modifications. This is not necessarily so. Large new subsystems might be constructed off to the side, perhaps by separate teams, and integrated with the running system in such a way as to minimize distruption. Design space might be thought of as a vast, dark, largely unexplored forest. Useful potential paths through it might be thought of as encompassing working programs. The space off to the sides of these paths is much larger realm of non-working programs. From any given point, a few small steps in most directions take you from a working to a non-working program. From time to time, there are forks in the path, indicating a choice among working alternatives. In unexplored territory, the prudent strategy is never to stray too far from the path. Now, if one has a map, a shortcut through the trekless thicket that might save miles may be evident. Of course, pioneers, by definition, don’t have maps. By taking small steps in any direction, they know that it is never more than a few steps back to a working system. Some years ago, Harlan Mills proposed that any software system should be grown by incremental development. That is, the system first be made to run, even though it does nothing useful except call the proper set of dummy subprograms. Then, bit by bit, it is fleshed out, with the subprograms in turn being developed into actions or calls to empty stubs in the level below. … Nothing in the past decade has so radically changed my own practice, and its effectiveness. … One always has, at every stage, in the process, a working system. I find that teams can grow much more complex entities in four months than they can build. -- From \"No Silver Bullet\" [Brooks 1995] Microsoft mandates that a DAILY BUILD of each product be performed at the end of each working day. Nortel adheres to the slightly less demanding requirement that a working build be generated at the end of each week [Brooks 1995][Cusumano & Shelby 1995]. Indeed, this approach, and keeping the last working version around, are nearly universal practices among successful maintenance programmers. Another vital factor in ensuring a system's continued vitality is a commitment to rigorous testing [Marick 1995][Bach 1994]. It's hard to keep a system working if you don't have a way of making sure it works. Testing is one of pillars of Extreme Programming. XP practices call for the development of unit tests before a single line of code is written. v v v Always beginning with a working system helps to encourage PIECEMEAL GROWTH. Refactoring is the primary means by which programmers maintain order from inside the systems in which they are working. The goal of refactoring is to leave a system working as well after a refactoring as it was before the refactoring. Aggressive unit and integration testing can help to guarantee that this goal is met. SHEARING LAYERS Hummingbirds and flowers are quick, redwood trees are slow, and whole redwood forests are even slower. Most interaction is within the same pace level--hummingbirds and flowers pay attention to each other, oblivious to redwoods, who are oblivious to them. R. V. O'Neill , A Hierarchical Concept of Ecosystems The notion of SHEARING LAYERS is one of the centerpieces of Brand's How Buildings Learn [Brand 1994]. Brand, in turn synthesized his ideas from a variety of sources, including British designer Frank Duffy, and ecologist R. V. O'Neill. Brand quotes Duffy as saying: \"Our basic argument is that there isn't any such thing as a building. A building properly conceived is several layers of longevity of built components\". Brand distilled Duffy's proposed layers into these six: Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff. Site is geographical setting. Structure is the load bearing elements, such as the foundation and skeleton. Skin is the exterior surface, such as siding and windows. Services are the circulatory and nervous systems of a building, such as its heating plant, wiring, and plumbing. The Space Plan includes walls, flooring, and ceilings. Stuff includes lamps, chairs, appliances, bulletin boards, and paintings. These layers change at different rates. Site, they say, is eternal. Structure may last from 30 to 300 years. Skin lasts for around 20 years, as it responds to the elements, and to the whims of fashion. Services succumb to wear and technical obsolescence more quickly, in 7 to 15 years. Commercial Space Plans may turn over every 3 years. Stuff, is, of course, subject to unrelenting flux [Brand 1994]. v v v Software systems cannot stand still. Software is often called upon to bear the brunt of changing requirements, because, being as that it is made of bits, it can change. Different artifacts change at different rates. Adaptability: A system that can cope readily with a wide range of requirements, will, all other things being equal, have an advantage over one that cannot. Such a system can allow unexpected requirements to be met with little or no reengineering, and allow its more skilled customers to rapidly address novel challenges. Stability: Systems succeed by doing what they were designed to do as well as they can do it. They earn their niches, by bettering their competition along one or more dimensions such as cost, quality, features, and performance. See [Foote & Roberts 1998] for a discussion of the occasionally fickle nature of such completion. Once they have found their niche, for whatever reason, it is essential that short term concerns not be allowed to wash away the elements of the system that account for their mastery of their niche. Such victories are inevitably hard won, and fruits of such victories should not be squandered. Those parts of the system that do what the system does well must be protected from fads, whims, and other such spasms of poor judgement. Adaptability and Stability are forces that are in constant tension. On one hand, systems must be able to confront novelty without blinking. On the other, they should not squander their patrimony on spur of the moment misadventures. Therefore, factor your system so that artifacts that change at similar rates are together. Most interactions in a system tend to be within layers, or between adjacent layers. Individual layers tend to be about things that change at similar rates. Things that change at different rates diverge. Differential rates of change encourage layers to emerge. Brand notes as well that occupational specialties emerge along with these layers. The rate at which things change shapes our organizations as well. For instance, decorators and painters concern themselves with interiors, while architects dwell on site and skin. We expect to see things that evolve at different rates emerge as distinct concerns. This is \"separate that which changes from that which doesn't\" [Roberts & Johnson 1998] writ large. Can we identify such layers in software? Well, at the bottom, there are data. Things that change most quickly migrate into the data, since this is the aspect of software that is most amenable to change. Data, in turn, interact with users themselves, who produce and consume them. Code changes more slowly than data, and is the realm of programmers, analysts and designers. In object-oriented languages, things that will change quickly are cast as black-box polymorphic components. Elements that will change less often may employ white-box inheritance. The abstract classes and components that constitute an object-oriented framework change more slowly than the applications that are built from them. Indeed, their role is to distill what is common, and enduring, from among the applications that seeded the framework. As frameworks evolve, certain abstractions make their ways from individual applications into the frameworks and libraries that constitute the system's infrastructure [Foote 1988]. Not all elements will make this journey. Not all should. Those that do are among the most valuable legacies of the projects that spawn them. Objects help shearing layers to emerge, because they provide places where more fine-grained chunks of code and behavior that belong together can coalesce. The Smalltalk programming language is built from a set of objects that have proven themselves to be of particular value to programmers. Languages change more slowly than frameworks. They are the purview of scholars and standards committees. One of the traditional functions of such bodies is to ensure that languages evolve at a suitably deliberate pace. Artifacts that evolve quickly provide a system with dynamism and flexibility. They allow a system to be fast on its feet in the face of change. Slowly evolving objects are bulwarks against change. They embody the wisdom that the system has accrued in its prior interactions with its environment. Like tenure, tradition, big corporations, and conservative politics, they maintain what has worked. They worked once, so they are kept around. They had a good idea once, so maybe they are a better than even bet to have another one. Wide acceptance and deployment causes resistance to change. If changing something will break a lot of code, there is considerable incentive not to change it. For example, schema reorganization in large enterprise databases can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Database designers and administrators learn to resist change for this reason. Separate job descriptions, and separate hardware, together with distinct tiers, help to make these tiers distinct. The phenomenon whereby distinct concerns emerge as distinct layers and tiers can be seen as well with graphical user interfaces. Part of the impetus behind using METADATA [Foote & Yoder 1998b] is the observation that pushing complexity and power into the data pushes that same power (and complexity) out of the realm of the programmer and into the realm of users themselves. Metadata are often used to model static facilities such as classes and schemas, in order to allow them to change dynamically. The effect is analogous to that seen with modular office furniture, which allows office workers to easily, quickly, and cheaply move partitions without having to enlist architects and contractors in the effort. Over time, our frameworks, abstract classes, and components come to embody what we've learned about the structure of the domains for which they are built. More enduring insights gravitate towards the primary structural elements of these systems. Things which find themselves in flux are spun out into the data, where users can interact with them. Software evolution becomes like a centrifuge spun by change. The layers that result, over time, can come to a much truer accommodation with the forces that shaped them than any top-down agenda could have devised. Things that are good have a certain kind of structure. You can’t get that structure except dynamically. Period. In nature you’ve got continuous very-small-feedback-loop adaptation going on, which is why things get to be harmonious. That’s why they have the qualities we value. If it wasn’t for the time dimension, it wouldn’t happen. Yet here we are playing the major role creating the world, and we haven’t figured this out. That is a very serious matter. Christopher Alexander -- [Brand 1994] v v v This pattern has much in common with the HOT SPOTS pattern discussed in [Roberts & Johnson 1998]. Indeed, separating things that change from those that do not is what drives the emergence of SHEARING LAYERS. These layers are the result of such differential rates of change, while HOT SPOTS might be thought of as the rupture zones in the fault lines along which slippage between layers occurs. This tectonic slippage is suggestive as well of the SOFTWARE TECTONICS pattern [Foote & Yoder 1996], which recommends fine-grained iteration as a means of avoiding catastrophic upheaval. METADATA and ACTIVE OBJECT-MODELS [Foote & Yoder 1998b] allow systems to adapt more quickly to changing requirements by pushing power into the data, and out onto users. SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG alias POTEMKIN VILLAGE HOUSECLEANING PRETTY FACE QUARANTINE HIDING IT UNDER THE BED REHABILITATION One of the most spectacular examples of sweeping a problem under the rug is the concrete sarcophagus that Soviet engineers constructed to put a 10,000 year lid on the infamous reactor number four at Chernobyl, in what is now Ukraine. If you can’t make a mess go away, at least you can hide it. Urban renewal can begin by painting murals over graffiti and putting fences around abandoned property. Children often learn that a single heap in the closet is better than a scattered mess in the middle of the floor. v v v There are reasons, other than aesthetic concerns, professional pride, and guilt for trying to clean up messy code. A deadline may be nearing, and a colleague may want to call a chunk of your code, if you could only come up with an interface through which it could be called. If you don’t come up with an easy to understand interface, they’ll just use someone else’s (perhaps inferior) code. You might be cowering during a code-review, as your peers trudge through a particularly undistinguished example of your work. You know that there are good ideas buried in there, but that if you don’t start to make them more evident, they may be lost. There is a limit to how much chaos an individual can tolerate before being overwhelmed. At first glance, a BIG BALL OF MUD can inspire terror and despair in the hearts of those who would try to tame it. The first step on the road to architectural integrity can be to identify the disordered parts of the system, and isolate them from the rest of it. Once the problem areas are identified and hemmed in, they can be gentrified using a divide and conquer strategy. Overgrown, tangled, haphazard spaghetti code is hard to comprehend, repair, or extend, and tends to grow even worse if it is not somehow brought under control. Comprehensibility: It should go without saying that comprehensible, attractive, well-engineered code will be easier to maintain and extend than complicated, convoluted code. However, it takes Time and money to overhaul sloppy code. Still, the Cost of allowing it to fester and continue to decline should not be underestimated. Morale: Indeed, the price of life with a BIG BALL OF MUD goes beyond the bottom line. Life in the muddy trenches can be a dispiriting fate. Making even minor modifications can lead to maintenance marathons. Programmers become timid, afraid that tugging at a loose thread may have unpredictable consequences. After a while, the myriad threads that couple every part of the system to every other come to tie the programmer down as surely as Gulliver among the Lilliputians [Swift 1726]. Talent may desert the project in the face of such bondage. It should go without saying that comprehensible, attractive, well-engineered code will be easier to maintain and extend than complicated, convoluted code. However, it takes time and money to overhaul sloppy code. Still, the cost of allowing it to fester and continue to decline should not be underestimated. Therefore, if you can’t easily make a mess go away, at least cordon it off. This restricts the disorder to a fixed area, keeps it out of sight, and can set the stage for additional refactoring. By getting the dirt into a single pile beneath the carpet, you at least know where it is, and can move it around. You’ve still got a pile of dirt on your hands, but it is localized, and your guests can’t see it. As the engineers who entombed reactor number four at Chernobly demonstrated, sometimes you've got to get a lid on a problem before you can get serious about cleaning things up. Once the problem area is contained, you can decontaminate at a more leisurely pace. To begin to get a handle on spaghetti code, find those sections of it that seem less tightly coupled, and start to draw architectural boundaries there. Separate the global information into distinct data structures, and enforce communication between these enclaves using well-defined interfaces. Such steps can be the first ones on the road to re-establishing the system’s conceptual integrity, and discerning nascent architectural landmarks. Putting a fresh interface around a run down region of the system can be the first step on the way architectural rehabilitation. This is a long row to hoe, however. Distilling meaningful abstractions from a BIG BALL OF MUD is a difficult and demand task. It requires skill, insight, and persistence. At times, RECONSTRUCTION may seem like the less painful course. Still, it is not like unscrambling an egg. As with rehabilitation in the real world, restoring a system to architectural health requires resources, as well as a sustained commitment on the part of the people who live there. The UIMX user interface builder for Unix and Motif, and the various Smalltalk GUI builders both provide a means for programmers to cordon off complexity in this fashion. v v v One frequently constructs a FAÇADE [Gamma et. al. 1995] to put a congenial \"pretty face\" on the unpleasantness that is SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. Once these messy chunks of code have been quarantined, you can expose their functionality using INTENTION REVEALING SELECTORS [Beck 1997]. This can be the first step on the road to CONSOLIDATION too, since one can begin to hem in unregulated growth than may have occurred during PROTOTYPING or EXPANSION [Foote & Opdyke 1995]. [Foote & Yoder 1998a] explores how, ironically, inscrutable code can persist because it is difficult to comprehend. This paper also examines how complexity can be hidden using suitable defaults (WORKS OUT OF THE BOX and PROGRAMMING-BY-DIFFERRENCE), and interfaces that gradually reveal additional capabilities as the client grows more sophisticated. RECONSTRUCTION alias TOTAL REWRITE DEMOLITION THROWAWAY THE FIRST ONE START OVER Atlanta’s Fulton County Stadium was built in 1966 to serve as the home of baseball’s Atlanta Braves, and football’s Atlanta Falcons. In August of 1997, the stadium was demolished. Two factors contributed to its relatively rapid obsolescence. One was that the architecture of the original stadium was incapable of accommodating the addition of the \"sky-box\" suites that the spreadsheets of ‘90s sporting economics demanded. No conceivable retrofit could accommodate this requirement. Addressing it meant starting over, from the ground up. The second was that the stadium’s attempt to provide a cheap, general solution to the problem of providing a forum for both baseball and football audiences compromised the needs of both. In only thirty-one years, the balance among these forces had shifted decidedly. The facility is being replaced by two new single-purpose stadia. Might there be lessons for us about unexpected requirements and designing general components here? v v v Plan to Throw One Away (You Will Anyway) -- Brooks Extreme Programming [Beck 2000] had its genesis in the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation project (C3). It began with a cry for help from a foundering project, and a decision to discard a year and a half's worth of work. The process they put in place after they started anew laid the foundation for XP, and the author's credit these approaches for the subsequent success of the C3 effort. However, less emphasis is given to value of the experience the team might have salvaged from their initial, unsuccessful draft. Could this first draft have been the unsung hero of this tale? Your code has declined to the point where it is beyond repair, or even comprehension. Obsolescence: Of course, one reason to abandon a system is that it is in fact technically or economically obsolete. These are distinct situations. A system that is no longer state-of-the-art may still sell well, while a technically superior system may be overwhelmed by a more popular competitor for non-technical reasons. In the realm of concrete and steel, blight is the symptom, and a withdrawal of capital is the cause. Of course, once this process begins, it can feed on itself. On the other hand, given a steady infusion of resources, buildings can last indefinitely. It's not merely entropy, but an unwillingness to counteract it, that allows buildings to decline. In Europe, neighborhoods have flourished for hundreds of years. They have avoided the boom/bust cycles that characterize some New World cities. Change: Even though software is a highly malleable medium, like Fulton County Stadium, new demands can, at times, cut across a system’s architectural assumptions in such a ways as to make accommodating them next to impossible. In such cases, a total rewrite might be the only answer. Cost: Writing-off a system can be traumatic, both to those who have worked on it, and to those who have paid for it. Software is often treated as an asset by accountants, and can be an expensive asset at that. Rewriting a system, of course, does not discard its conceptual design, or its staff’s experience. If it is truly the case that the value of these assets is in the design experience they embody, then accounting practices must recognize this. Organization: Rebuilding a system from scratch is a high-profile undertaking, that will demand considerable time and resources, which, in turn, will make high-level management support essential. Therefore, throw it away and start over. Sometimes it’s just easier to throw a system away, and start over. Examples abound. Our shelves are littered with the discarded carcasses of obsolete software and its documentation. Starting over can be seen as a defeat at the hands of the old code, or a victory over it. One reason to start over might be that the previous system was written by people who are long gone. Doing a rewrite provides new personnel with a way to reestablish contact between the architecture and the implementation. Sometimes the only way to understand a system it is to write it yourself. Doing a fresh draft is a way to overcome neglect. Issues are revisited. A fresh draft adds vigor. You draw back to leap. The quagmire vanishes. The swamp is drained. Another motivation for building a new system might be that you feel that you've got the experience you need to do the job properly. One way to have gotten this experience is to have participated at some level in the unsuccessful development of a previous version of the system. Of course, the new system is not designed in a vacuum. Brook’s famous tar pit is excavated, and the fossils are examined, to see what they can tell the living. It is essential that a thorough post-mortem review be done of the old system, to see what it did well, and why it failed. Bad code can bog down a good design. A good design can isolate and contain bad code. When a system becomes a BIG BALL OF MUD, its relative incomprehensibility may hasten its demise, by making it difficult for it to adapt. It can persist, since it resists change, but cannot evolve, for the same reason. Instead, its inscrutability, even when it is to its s hort-term benefit, sows the seeds of its ultimate demise. If this makes muddiness a frequently terminal condition, is this really a bad thing? Or is it a blessing that these sclerotic systems yield the stage to more agile successors? Certainly, the departure of these ramshackle relics can be a cause for celebration as well as sadness. Discarding a system dispenses with its implementation, and leaves only its conceptual design behind. Only the patterns that underlie the system remain, grinning like a Cheshire cat. It is their spirits that help to shape the next implementation. With luck, these architectural insights will be reincarnated as genuine reusable artifacts in the new system, such as abstract classes and frameworks. It is by finding these architectural nuggets that the promise of objects and reuse can finally be fulfilled. There are alternatives to throwning your system away and starting over. One is to embark on a regimen of incremental refactoring, to glean architectural elements and discernable abstractions from the mire. Indeed, you can begin by looking for coarse fissures along which to separate parts of the system, as was suggested in SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG. Of course, refactoring is more effective as a prophylactic measure that as a last-restort therapy. As with any edifice, it is a judgement call, whether to rehab or restort for the wrecking ball. Another alternative is to reassess whether new components and frameworks have come along that can replace all or part of the system. When you can reuse and retrofit other existing components, you can spare yourself the time and expense involved in rebuilding, repairing, and maintaining the one you have. The United States Commerce Department defines durable goods as those that are designed to last for three years or more. This category traditionally applied to goods such as furniture, appliances, automobiles, and business machines. Ironically, as computer equipment is depreciating ever more quickly, it is increasingly our software artifacts, and not our hardware, that fulfill this criterion. Firmitas has come to the realm of bits and bytes. Apple's Lisa Toolkit, and its successor, the Macintosh Toolbox, constitute one of the more intriguing examples of RECONSTRUCTION in the history of personal computing. An architect's most useful tools are an eraser at the drafting board, and a wrecking bar at the site -- Frank Lloyd Wright v v v The SOFTWARE TECTONICS pattern discussed in [Foote & Yoder 1996] observes that if incremental change is deferred indefinitely, major upheaval may be the only alternative. [Foote & Yoder 1998a] explores the WINNING TEAM phenomenon, whereby otherwise superior technical solutions are overwhelmed by non-technical exigencies. Brooks has eloquently observed that the most dangerous system an architect will ever design is his or her second system [Brooks 1995]. This is the notorious second-system effect. RECONSTRUCTION provides an opportunity for this misplaced hubris to exercise itself, so one must keep a wary eye open for it. Still, there are times when the best and only way to make a system better is to throw it away and start over. Indeed, one can do worse than to heed Brook's classic admonition that you should \"plan to throw one away, you will anyway\". Mir reenters the atmosphere over Fiji on 22 March, 2001 Conclusion In the end, software architecture is about how we distill experience into wisdom, and disseminate it. We think the patterns herein stand alongside other work regarding software architecture and evolution that we cited as we went along. Still, we do not consider these patterns to be anti-patterns. There are good reasons that good programmers build BIG BALLS OF MUD. It may well be that the economics of the software world are such that the market moves so fast that long term architectural ambitions are foolhardy, and that expedient, slash-and-burn, disposable programming is, in fact, a state-of-the-art strategy. The success of these approaches, in any case, is undeniable, and seals their pattern-hood. People build BIG BALLS OF MUD because they work. In many domains, they are the only things that have been shown to work. Indeed, they work where loftier approaches have yet to demonstrate that they can compete. It is not our purpose to condemn BIG BALLS OF MUD. Casual architecture is natural during the early stages of a system’s evolution. The reader must surely suspect, however, that our hope is that we can aspire to do better. By recognizing the forces and pressures that lead to architectural malaise, and how and when they might be confronted, we hope to set the stage for the emergence of truly durable artifacts that can put architects in dominant positions for years to come. The key is to ensure that the system, its programmers, and, indeed the entire organization, learn about the domain, and the architectural opportunities looming within it, as the system grows and matures. Periods of moderate disorder are a part of the ebb and flow of software evolution. As a master chef tolerates a messy kitchen, developers must not be afraid to get a little mud on their shoes as they explore new territory for the first time. Architectural insight is not the product of master plans, but of hard won experience. The software architects of yesteryear had little choice other than to apply the lessons they learned in successive drafts of their systems, since RECONSTRUCTION was often the only practical means they had of supplanting a mediocre system with a better one. Objects, frameworks, components, and refactoring tools provide us with another alternative. Objects present a medium for expressing our architectural ideas at a level between coarse-grained applications and components and low level code. Refactoring tools and techniques finally give us the means to cultivate these artifacts as they evolve, and capture these insights. The onion-domed Church of the Intercession of the Virgin on the Moat in Moscow is one of Russia's most famous landmarks. It was built by Tsar Ivan IV just outside of the Kremlin walls in 1552 to commemorate Russia's victory over the Tatars at Kazan. The church is better known by it's nickname, St. Basil's. Ivan too is better known by his nickname \"Ivan the Terrible\". Legend has it that once the cathedral was completed, Ivan, ever true to his reputation, had the architects blinded, so that they could never build anything more beautiful. Alas, the state of software architecture today is such that few of us need fear for our eyesight.

    "commentBody": "Big Ball of Mud (1999) (laputan.org)151 points by thesuperbigfrog 23 hours agohidepastfavorite128 comments sillysaurusx 22 hours agoSometimes a big ball of mud is exactly what’s needed. Undertale has a single giant switch statement thousands of cases long for every line of dialog in the game. There are other stories of how infamously bad the code is. And none of that mattered one bit. Banks are another example. The software is horrible. Everyone knows it. Yet all that’s required is minimally working software that fails rarely enough that the bank can maintain their lock in. Believe it or not, being hired to work on a big ball of mud can be pretty chill. The key is for you to be in a stage in your life where you don’t really care about your work beyond meeting professional responsibilities. Big ball of mud codebases are the best for that, because everyone’s there for the same reasons, and the assignments are always easy drudgery. Neither Scottrade nor Thomson Reuters cared too much what I was up to as long as I was there at 9am. It’s soul crushing for people who want to create nice things, or seek meaning in their work, which is partly why I left. But when you just need the money, there’s no substitute. reply cogman10 22 hours agoparentA nice aspect of big balls of mud is you can plow over small sections to make gardens. Once you accept that completely dumping the ball of mud is impossible, you can just \"do a good turn daily\". Clean up a little code here, there, everywhere. Most people working on balls of mud don't care that you do this (provided you aren't completely rewriting 90% of the system). You'll still have to regularly get dirty, but the petunias you grew over the years form nice memories. reply kreyenborgi 7 hours agorootparentI had this field of mudballs where I kept getting bug reports related to this particularly muddy ball, and I kept slapping on more mud (always in a rush) and it never quite fixed it. Eventually I had read that code so much I almost knew it by heart, I had spent so much time there. And one night the new design appeared in my head. I suspected it would take only a few hours to implement. And, sure enough, five days and a few evenings later I had turned it into a beautiful garden. It passed all tests, it hummed like a well-oiled bee, it was awesome to behold. And then, because it generated no bug reports, I never looked at it again; and I spent the rest of my days there slapping dirt and water on the other mudballs. reply DowagerDave 1 hour agorootparentthat's an awesome analogy, built very similarly to the system it describes :) reply mbostleman 21 hours agorootparentprevThe Boy Scout rule. reply pphysch 3 hours agorootparentprev> Clean up a little code here, there, everywhere. What does \"clean up\" mean? If you mean run a safe code formatter on some 20 year old PHP code that was written in vi, sure. But if you mean refactor, this sounds rather idealistic. IMO, you are already outside of BBOM territory if your BBOM comes with a robust development environment where you can safely implement such changes without breaking prod in some insane and unforeseeable way. reply mvdtnz 21 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that all of this time \"plowing fields\" and \"doing a good turn daily\" could have been avoided, and when a big ball of mud gets really hairy this can easily turn into the bulk of your work day and dominate projects. It can cause a company to deliver slowly and miss opportunities. reply cogman10 20 hours agorootparent> could have been avoided Hard to know if that's true or not. Some code goes on for literally decades before being touched by another person. Often times, the parts of the code that are high touch end up justifying more gardening to make future touches less painful/faster. Knowing when code will be cumbersome is really difficult when writing fresh. reply lll-o-lll 10 hours agorootparent> Knowing when code will be cumbersome is really difficult when writing fresh. I think a large part of what goes wrong is that code starts out too simple. When you look back at the history of the code, the original check-ins almost always look good. Good, but very “direct”. Here was the problem, and here we have solved it as bluntly as possible. As the changes come, they often break concepts that were introduced in those first few check-ins. It’s understandable, the person coming after is just trying to add “that one thing” with as small a change as possible. These accumulate, and soon any semblance of a logical “model” has been lost. A bit of “build an example for others to follow” at the beginning, might have saved things down the track. However, do too much “over-engineering”, and no one is checking in your code, and you might be wasting tons of effort. Hence, experience is required to know the basic pitfalls that develop, and where you need to put in the extra for that initial check-in. Many code-bases, of course, are started by people without that experience, and balls of mud inevitably develop. You can refactor them! It’s carve out chunks, partition them off, keep the two in parallel until the new is as stable as the old. Banks have actually done this; not all of them. The reality is that if you don’t, new features simply cost too much to be worth developing. You can eventually be completely paralysed by technical debt. reply throwaway2037 13 hours agorootparentprev> could have been avoided I complete agree with your sentiment. Too many of these commenters are unrealistic: In most cases you cannot avoid the BBoM. Usually, it is written by someone before you... or above you... so you have little power to change it, but you can make meaningful changes step by step. reply wesselbindt 11 hours agorootparentIn all fairness, they didn't say \"could've been avoided by you specifically\" rather \"could have been avoided\". And this I'm inclined to agree with reply watwut 11 hours agorootparentOne issue is that the hardest to maintain code I have seen was written by well meaning people who have really put themselves into it. They just made a wrong decision somewhere, because they were not gods. reply DowagerDave 1 hour agorootparentprevfor every big ball of mud there's 10 premature optimizations reply nyrikki 22 hours agoparentprevTechnically a huge switch statement isn't a ball of mud. It is mutually exclusive and completely exhaustive. It may have other issues, but is actually better than what this article is describing. reply sillysaurusx 22 hours agorootparentI happen to agree, but only in this special case. Normally a giant switch statement is a pain to work through if there's even a tiny amount of logic involved. One hilarious case was at Scottrade. I was poking around their C++ codebase one day and to my amazed horror saw a file hundreds of lines long, and a big chunk of it was devoted to handling leap years. Like, every leap year, one at a time. There are few enough leap years that it should in theory be difficult to write hundreds of lines of code to handle each of them, but some contractor managed to. And so the ball of mud continued. What can you do but laugh and embrace the horror? reply tuveson 14 hours agorootparentI think any time you're dealing with data in the form of an enum, a switch usually the natural way to handle cases. Many compilers will warn you when you've missed a case, which is a nice check to have. Similarly, in languages that support ADTs, pattern matching tends to be the sensible thing to do. But I agree that in the case you described, that the programmer was being stupid. However they could have written it as a giant if-elseif block and that would also have been stupid, or a loop over a giant list of years, and that also would have been stupid. I think the problem was the programmer not thinking about the problem carefully, not with the control-flow construct they used to write the bad code. reply Piraty 8 hours agorootparentprev> What can you do but laugh and embrace the horror? laugh. embrace and share the fun with others: submit to https://thedailywtf.com reply worstspotgain 21 hours agorootparentprevMaybe the author wanted to squeeze as many hours out of the task as they could? Plenty of non-top-quartile people love this sort of thing as a day at the beach. For the diametrical opposite, here's one time on an embedded system where I really didn't want to bring in a library dependency, so I wrote an inconspicuous-looking good-enough version: y = (d - (d + 366 + (d >= 47847)) / 1461 + (d >= 47847)) / 365; d = d - (d + 365 + (d >= 47848)) / 1461 + (d >= 47848) - y * 365; y += 1970; reply shawndumas 21 hours agorootparent#includeint main() { long long d; std::cout > d; if (d = JULIAN_TO_GREGORIAN_THRESHOLD) { d += 10; // Account for dropped days } int a = d + 32044; int b = (4 * a + 3) / DAYS_PER_LEAP_CYCLE; int c = (4 * a + 3) % DAYS_PER_LEAP_CYCLE; int y = (b / 1460) + 1970; d = (c / 4) - 365; if (dMaybe re-prompting LLMs is the new ball of mud? Recently, my company acquired some engineers, and while I cannot evaluate their \"percentile\", I have been low-key flabbergasted at some of their suggestions for using LLMs in place of scripts. (For example, to modify or move nested data in a non-public JSON representation of a program.) reply bjt 13 hours agorootparentprev> As a rule of thumb, leap days come around every four years. But there are exceptions to this rule. For example, at the turn of every century we miss a leap year. Even though the year is divisible by four, we don't add a leap day in the years that end in 00. But there's an exception to this rule too. If the year is a multiple of 400 then we do add in an extra leap day again. At the turn of the millennium, despite being divisible by 100, the year 2000 did, in fact, have a 29 February because it was also divisible by 400. https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240228-leap-year-the-im... reply bjt 13 hours agorootparentprevToo simple. https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240228-leap-year-the-im... reply worstspotgain 13 hours agorootparentNot for the task at hand. The initial d was divided down from an unsigned 32-bit timestamp in seconds from the Unix epoch (hence the 1970.) It accounts for 2000 (leap) and 2100 (not leap), after which the u32 overflows. reply daemin 9 hours agorootparentprevWas it then case that there was special logic attached to special leap years like all of the exceptions we hear about in other software products like Excel etc? Or was it just \"return true\" and \"return false\" ? reply nyrikki 21 hours agorootparentprevI am not talking about ease of programming, and c being imperative, and the explicit break are edge cases. But for case value value can only be char or int, and must be unique Really it is just sugar for if-else-if, but if you enforce explicit break in your code it is as close to a provable total function as you get in C. Total functions are the ideal in any code. As determining whether or not a function F is total is undecidable, switch is more reliable than if-else-if ladders. reply throwway120385 22 hours agorootparentprevAt least you can be sure that it worked, whereas if he'd actually written the succinct version there was a risk of a subtle bug. reply skybrian 22 hours agorootparentYou can only be sure if you verified every year and didn't miss a typo. Having a test that straightforwardly checks every year individually would be more useful, since then you know if you changed anything, and can double-check just the changes. Although, I suppose it doesn't matter all that much which is which, as long as they're not both written the same way. reply throwway120385 19 hours agorootparentHow do you ensure that you don't put a typo in the unit test? reply skybrian 19 hours agorootparentHopefully, it wouldn't match the algorithm. It's implementing it two different ways and comparing the results. It's not a guarantee, since you could have implemented the wrong spec, but there's only so much you can do with internal consistency checks. But it would be better to compare to a known good function. It might be easier to add a dependency to do that in a test than in production code. reply lmm 18 hours agorootparentprevIf you used the list of years in the test and the mathematical expression in the impl (or vice versa), then you know you didn't make the same mistake in both. reply wewtyflakes 22 hours agorootparentprevWhy would such a system assure someone that it worked? Conversely, why would only the succinct version lend itself to a subtle bug? reply throwway120385 19 hours agorootparentSuppose that someone tried to naively derive the leap year by dividing the current year by 4. There are some years that are divisible by 4 but that are nonetheless not leap years. If you fail to account for this in your succinct implementation then you might introduce a leap day that doesn't exist at some point. I know the table implementation seems really dumb, and it's not that hard to look up a correct algorithm for this, but it's a good example. If you build a table from some correct source then you can simply use that table instead of running a calculation. There are fewer than 30 leap years in the next 100 years, by which time something cataclysmic will happen that will completely erase the need for your code anyway. At least, you will be dead before you need to revise the code again. So it's reasonable to build a function with a table given the time-limited nature of the code and the desire to be visibly and explicitly correct. Sure you could add a unit test with the table and test the calculation, but that actually adds more code to maintain than just jamming the table directly into the function. reply wewtyflakes 19 hours agorootparentI don't think they were stating that a simple table based solution was used, if it were, it would probably meet the bar for \"succinct\" because you could just write that as something like `if X in Y`. Rather, I got the impression that a lookup based approach was intended, but it was enterprise-ified (like https://github.com/Hello-World-EE/Java-Hello-World-Enterpris...). reply throwway120385 3 hours agorootparentOh, gross. reply HideousKojima 19 hours agorootparentprevDoing modulo 4, 100, and 400 isn't really that complicated to implement. I know there are even simpler ways to calculate this but come on, this is stupidly easy stuff. Then again we live in a dimension where there are Node packages for IsEven() and IsOdd() with tons of downloads. reply throwway120385 3 hours agorootparentSure, in Node.JS, and with a specific calibur of programmer in a specific business context this is easy. Technical problems are easy to solve, but people and organizational problems are where the real challenges of engineering come. Sometimes you have to grit your teeth and implement something for the company you work for rather than for your own personal sense of correct. reply codetrotter 20 hours agorootparentprevMine is as succinct as they come, but a little bit buggy int is_leap_year(int year) { return 0; } reply wewtyflakes 20 hours agorootparentI don't think that qualifies as a \"subtle\" bug. :) reply pixl97 22 hours agorootparentprevOoof, I have dealt with some fun balls of mud. Had a customers app break when they used zips that contained over 65k separate files. Sent it to dev and they said \"Oh use this other API we have\". And yes, the file 'worked' but the api didn't do what the customer needed. Got back with the developer and saw We had two api's that did almost but not quite the same thing. Ok, it happens, maybe there was a reason for it. We also had two different zip libraries built in. At some point a dev ran into issues with legacy zip support not working on large files and added a new library. They converted about 10% of the API, enough to cover what they were working on and stopped. reply daemin 9 hours agorootparentThe part with having multiple libraries that do the same thing is always an interesting engineering case. Usually it's the case that different libraries support different features, so trying to settle on only one library is folly. Same thing when converting all of the existing zip code to handle a new library, who knows what will break, and even though it may be required production/management rarely want to take the time to make the switch. Case in point I've been at multiple places that have had multiple JSON and XML libraries in the same product at the same time. reply osigurdson 22 hours agorootparentprev>> \"Oh use this other API we have\" This is an interesting problem. If you insist on maximizing consistency on a large code base, then nothing can ever change. If you allow too many small deviations / good ideas that are only ever partially completed, it results in chaos. I think it is a little like entropy: some (not too much) is needed for things to progress. reply pixl97 21 hours agorootparentSo this was a few years back and they've wrangled a lot of the mess in. They've went with API versioning where you can set a flag in the request of something like ver=5 and you get a static version of the api that doesn't change. If you don't set an api version you get the latest version, which may break on updates. I think for most users it's made feature observability much better. reply eitally 6 hours agorootparentprevI used to run supply chain tooling for a big manufacturing firm and, at one point, some dev got into a fight with a security-focused sysadmin somewhere who refused to allow the use of sftp for file transfer with trading partners (things like forecasts and order documents from suppliers)... so instead of either escalating or creating an alternative architecture, the dev unilaterally decided to leverage the fact that ports 20-21 were inadvertently open externally and use standard FTP for this. Nobody was fired and nobody really knew because it was an app supported by one person and as long as the business process didn't fail everything was \"ok\". reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentOh, I have written plenty of blatantly bad code to evade security-focused sysadmins, and yes, many of those have made security worse. But they did solve problems. reply Quekid5 22 hours agorootparentprevTuring Machines have that property. There the Tarpit lies. reply ChrisMarshallNY 22 hours agoparentprevOne of my first programming gigs was working on a 1970s-vintage, 100KLoC+ FORTRAN IV codebase. All one file. No subroutines.

If it’s too much to apply some discernment and modularity to the underlying codebase then you can instead do this with the test suite and reflect those discoveries back into the codebase with the benefit that you can now prove your changes don’t break the documented, expected behaviour. It’s like rewriting the code but by passing the ball from production code to test code and back to figure out who the individual players are. reply antfarm 3 hours agoparentprev> Sometimes a big ball of mud is exactly what’s needed. And if you wait a little while, what you need is new developers. reply harrison_clarke 3 hours agoparentprevbig ball of mud is a great pattern for games (non live-service ones, at least) once you ship, you don't really need to maintain it the same way as other software. tech debt is free money if you ship before having to pay it back and players often like complexity and interaction between systems, so there's less benefit to isolating them in code reply YurgenJurgensen 53 minutes agorootparentLooking at some high-profile games that never shipped, that’s a very risky gamble if you don’t know when the bailiff will come to collect. reply MathMonkeyMan 18 hours agoparentprevA big ball of mud is never what's needed. It's just what happens when too many people have cared too little for too long. I suspect that the perspective of \"It sucks but it works for us; I'm not idealistic anymore\" is really a rationalization of despair, but that's just me. reply forgetfreeman 17 hours agorootparentI couldn't disagree more. Given time and budget constraints and the tendency for code/services/entire business models to deprecate in less than a decade heavy architecture should be the last thing that anyone reaches for and only after a need has been comprehensively proven for it. Over the decades I've lost count of how many project budgets have been blown to hell by well-intentioned, well-educated, experienced, and competent developers attempting to apply whatever architectural best practices du jour (the churn in this space is telling). End of the day it's still just code. There will still be bugs and it'll still be a pain in someone's ass to deal with. KISS uber alles. reply PaulStatezny 3 hours agorootparentSounds like you're saying either: 1. Engineers don't care about the health of the codebase and it becomes/stays a ball of mud, OR... 2. They do care, and end up refactoring/rewriting it in a way that just creates even MORE complexity. But I think this is a false dichotomy. It just happens to be very difficult, and as much of an art as a science to keep huge codebases moving in the right direction. I haven't worked at Google, but from what I've heard they have huge codebases, but they're not typically falling apart at the seams. reply resonious 16 hours agoparentprevI honestly don't get why things like giant switch statements are even considered bad or smelly. You have to put the dialog somewhere. What's the material difference between putting it in a switch statement vs separate functions vs named text files? The dialog isn't going away. You still have tons of dialog. Even for regular code organization. 100 small functions is ok but 100 switch cases is bad? It's the same amount of code, and switch cases aren't that \"hard to read\". reply YurgenJurgensen 32 minutes agorootparent100 small functions that only get called in one place is also bad. It implies that most of them are slight permutations of each other and can be cut with the right parameterisaton. Unless your logic genuinely has 100 qualitatively unique special cases, and in that case, you’re probably screwed, as there are no elegant solutions. reply butlike 4 hours agorootparentprevSwitch statements are O(n), but reading dialog config is O(1). It matters when trying to get the game loop to run at 60fps Edit: Evidently you can get O(1) from a Switch if the compiler converts it to jump statements. Just adding this for posterity, and to correct myself. reply yyhhsj0521 13 hours agorootparentprevFor one, changing a typo shouldn't require any code to be recompiled. reply resonious 4 hours agorootparentWhy not? Because your compile times are long? Changing a translation yaml triggers a webpack build in a lot of web setups but nobody seems to complain about that. reply daemin 9 hours agorootparentprevHaving all the dialog logic in a single switch statement doesn't mean that all the text is right in there. It can still be referring to IDs which are then looked up in a table for the right translation. reply YurgenJurgensen 38 minutes agorootparentThat would still be a step above the Undertale case, where the dialog was in the code. The big problem there is that your localisers now need your source code and (potentially expensive commercial) build system to test that their script doesn’t break anything. Or you end up in an expensive back-and-forth with a contractor compiling it for them. Just taking localisation strings out of the switch statement doesn’t fully fix this. You can swap out individual lines, but characters are still bound to say the same number of lines in the same order in every language, with player choice happening at the same point. This may work for simple conversations, but it will result in clunky localisations when languages differ in verbosity or sentence structure. reply eweise 4 hours agoparentprev\"Banks are another example.

I actually even started enjoying it at some point - it felt like a mixture between a crossword puzzle and archaeology. There was also something nice about being good at something other people hated that was nonetheless very critical. Somewhat ironically though, the better I got at it, the class of job I got the better the quality of the code I ended up working with. Now my mud wrestling skills have atrophied a fair bit. reply eitally 6 hours agoparentGenerally speaking, mud wrestling jobs exist in traditional IT departments, not tech product companies, and the jobs pay far less than those where the code is the product. For better or for worse, but the existence of \"big balls of mud\" is largely a result of \"you get what you pay for\" mentalities in non-technical CIOs & CTOs... or industries where IT spend is below some low threshold (e.g. 1% revenue). reply seabrookmx 16 hours agoparentprevI really think that archaeology you speak of is great for building skills, and as a result when giving the opportunity you start building much more elegant solutions.

Maybe it is inevitable that successful systems turn into big balls of mud eventually once the \"inflection\" point has been reached and (slow) deterioration begins. It is somewhat of a clichè but I think that (interactive) documentation and tooling can make a difference, but it is very difficult to design the process and the tooling to be as frictionless as possible. Tudor Girba and his team at feenk have been doing a lot of interesting work in that area that's worth a look [1, 2]. The software in question might be an entangled mess, a large part of it might be even inherent due to its requirements or technical constraints, but if that messy web can be readily augmented with background information and sign-posts I think the situation could be significantly improved. On a related note, there has been a project at Xerox PARC called PIE (Personal Information Environment) [3] which has put forward the idea of organizing software and its artifacts (source code, various kinds of documentation) as a network. Although that particular concept has never been adopted in any major programming system as far as I know, I think that it has huge potential, especially if the software, as a network, can be collaboratively navigated and extended with additional information, where and when needed -- online. Now that all does not change the fact that we are still dealing with a ball (or a web) of mud, but at least it is accessible and we might have a better chance to understand its evolution and the reasons that made it complicated in the first place.

The line was essentially a collection of: restart instance_N &; restart instance_N+1&; etc I always assumed that the way you got to 70+ was: - write the first restart for instance N=1 - add another restart - keep doing this till you get to about 5-8 restart commands - AT THIS POINT someone should say \"Hey, we should make this a script or something else\" BUT CRUCIALLY that didn't happen - you keep adding restarts till you get to 20+ - Now, doing anything to that giant line other than adding a new restart feels too dangerous so you decide to just keep adding restarts.

It’s the day you can’t sell your product without a UI that works on a phone and you have to change every single method to make the change, or you fail to implement the new tax rules correctly even after 18 months of all hands on deck, it matters.

Oracle DB has a reportedly pretty bad codebase but a captive market that keeps them from needing to address the problems (as rapidly as their customers might like). If low quality lets you be first to market, that may be worth the later maintenance costs by gaining an outsized portion of the market and earlier revenue than your competitors. On the other hand, if you've got an old system with poor quality code and can't make changes, your customer(s) are willing to drop you, and you have competitors who can get out the desired features, you're screwed. reply marcosdumay 2 hours agoparentprevI doubt you can correlate to a line.

For example (this is a real, recent scenario, left intentionally vague): a new government regulation gives you 12 months to expose certain data conforming to a provided API schema. The system under development is a big ball of mud. Re-shaping the data to conform to this schema turns out to be extremely difficult but failing to produce the APIs on time will result in company-endangering penalties from a government regulator with no sense of humour. So you put a team on the APIs and issues keep cropping up again and again because every time one thing is changed it has knock-on effects causing other company-endangering incidents because you're making changes to to way billing and invoicing data is presented, or to how incoming metering data is stored. So you put some additional teams on the project and work everyone to the bone. Some senior developers burn out and leave the organisation. Likewise some project managers. Your best QA staff have their morale drop to rock bottom. The project delivers on time but how do you measure these costs? How are you going to put a dollar figure on the burnout and lost staff? How much of the senior developers' decisions to leave can be attributed to the project and the big ball of mud? How do you measure the impact of your best tester losing his will to work and going dark? Many of us have worked in organisations where things have gone down like this. We all know that impact is huge. But yeah you're right, I can't put together a business case that says it in clear numbers. On paper we had a one-year project, it probably went a bit over budget but it ultimately delivered so what's the big deal about the big ball of mud?

    "originBody": "July 10, 2024 About a week ago, my home Internet (AT&T Fiber) went from the ~1 Gbps I pay for down to about 100 Mbps (see how I monitor my home Internet with a Pi). It wasn't too inconvenient, and I considered waiting it out to see if the speed recovered at some point, because latency was fine. But as you can see around 7/7 on that graph, the 100 Mbps went down to about eight, and that's the point where my wife starts noticing how slow the Internet is. Action level. So I fired up AT&T's support chat. I'm a programmer, I can usually find ways around the wily ways of chatbots. Except AT&T's AI-powered chatbot seems to have a fiendish tendency to equate 'WiFi' with 'Internet', no doubt due to so many people thinking they are one and the same. We were stuck in that loop for about 5 minutes. It looks like you're having trouble with your WiFi. No. After working a few different angles, I finally 'spammed 0'1 by entering some variation of 'connect me to a support rep'. I'll cut to the chase—after repeating some variation of that about 8 times, eventually I got queued up in the 20 minute line to a human support rep. Unfortunately for me, the human support rep, like so many in the industry, promptly ignored the data I provided in my first chat message to him2, and told me switching WiFi channels on the device (on which WiFi is currently disabled completely) would solve my issue. At no cost. Maybe I should welcome our AI overlords? In the old days of phone support, if you got stuck in the automated menus, you could resort to spamming '0', and in most systems that weren't set up by nefarious managerial overlords, that would get you to a human. Eventually. ↩︎ The entire contents of my message, prior to his turned-off-WiFi channel twiddling: \"Hello! I just received and installed the new AT&T router/fiber modem, and ... the Internet speed is just as slow as before. I pay for 1 Gbps symmetric, and I'm getting 8 Mbps down and 6 Mbps up. On 6/28, the average connection speed went from 1 Gbps down to 100 Mbps. On 7/8 the average speed went from 100 Mbps to 8 Mbps. This is all measured both on the device at the fiber, and through a separate monitor I have wired into the 1 Gbps network.\" ↩︎ Further reading Self-hosting with AT&T Fiber Internet My own magic-wormhole relay, for zippier transfers Monitor your Internet with a Raspberry Pi att chatbot ai artificial intelligence support internet Add new comment Comments Alex – 9 hours ago My guess is this will become even worse in the future.

It was bad enough outsourcing customer support to overseas agents who have their hands tied to only read from a script and generally do nothing, and now we're just talking to computers that can generally do nothing. The message is the same: we don't actually care about our customers. I own a small business and I would rather shut my doors than force my paying customers through AI cattle gates to struggle for help.

And you need to look at the profit, not the revenue they get from you. Many of the companies you are asking to provide service are making a buck or two a month from you, even if you are nominally paying hundreds of dollars. So if you call up a real human, you can be draining away months, years, even the entire profit margin you will ever be worth, pretty quickly. Especially if you want to be talking to someone making more than the US minimum wage. You don't need the principle that \"the only purpose of a company is to earn capital\". All you need to explain the current situation is \"a company can not survive if expenses exceed income\". You can't have customers costing you more than they pay you and make it up in volume. So consumers are basically just boned; they will not and even can not pay enough to get good support for most of the things they buy. Not in theory, not in fact. I know places that provide very good support. But they are places where the profit margin on a customer is well sufficient to pay for a support person's amortized time, and losing the customer still hurts the bottom line, even after a support call or three, because even three extended support calls that resulted in consults straight to engineering still weren't anywhere near enough to cancel the profit margin. reply sabbaticaldev 4 hours agorootparent> Look at the profit margin for some given company.

Even non-profits and charities have customer support systems. A customer who cannot or will not help themselves costs that organisation more to service than one who will. This is pretty universal.

Companies or organizations in general, won't survive if their costs are too high. There is nothing prescriptive about it. It is a merely a description of market dynamics. You can have whatever value system you wants and you can burn money doing whatever you want, but a value system doesn't change the reality of market dynamics. And no amount of blaming all problems on nebulous ideas like \"capitalism\" changes that either. You can either recognize reality or enjoy bankruptcy. Your choice! reply Workaccount2 5 hours agorootparentprevImagine something like a credit score but for technological adeptness. A high score and you can reliably get an on prem human and even sometimes an engineer. A low score and you just get endless bots. Average and you get the current system. reply oliwarner 5 hours agorootparentIndeed. A good service system will ask that. I've had that for technical equipment (\"Are you a buyer, installer, operator, etc?\"). And hey, it'd be nice if that translated into a lower price but I won't pretend that us geeks don't cause as many problems as we eventually fix. reply JohnFen 4 hours agorootparentprevIf the first contact I can have with support is an LLM, that's the same as not providing support. Even talking to non-technical staff following scripts first, as obnoxious as that is, is preferable. The only reason that I'm calling support in the first place is because web searching and their automated systems have failed me. I may not be the standard customer, but that's not my problem. If that matters, all that's saying is that the company doesn't want me as a customer. reply mike_hearn 4 hours agorootparentNo it actually can be done competently, believe it or not. The best example of this I've seen is Swisscom. Swisscom has a customer support bot, they call it \"Sam\". Sam is amazing and a lesson to all other companies in how to automate customer support. 1. Sam tells you it's a bot. They don't hide what they're doing. 2. Sam is optional. You can choose to call human support at any time. 3. If you agree to always try chatting to Sam first they cut you in on the savings, and reduce your monthly bill. The reduction is big enough to be definitely worth it, it's not 10 cents a month or anything like that. 4. Sam escalates quickly and voluntarily if it can't work out how to answer your question. It doesn't try and block you from talking with a person. 5. Sam is astonishingly good at actually answering questions. I don't know what tech they're using for this; it seems like some sort of really souped up LLM with great RAG, maybe. Whatever it is, it works. Several times I've contacted Swisscom support and gone through Sam, and it did in fact solve my problem. 6. All the above is true even though I'm interacting with Sam in English, which is not a Swiss national language. Truly, this is what a good bot-supported contact experience should be like. Of course in most cases institutions don't do such a good job, and just become frustrating. Bots that pretend to be human, bots that don't seem to know the answers to anything, bots that make it as hard as possible to escalate and of course in the end ... nothing in it for the customer to put up with that. But if Swisscom can do it then other companies can too, there's nothing magical about this use case. My assumption is that after a while we're going to find that most people actually prefer bot driven support experiences, same as how they came to prefer self checkout at supermarkets, ATMs at banks etc. reply ryandrake 4 hours agorootparentprev> Your desire to handle that all in-house by organic, corn-fed, English-as-their-first-language meat-bags is lovely but you'd be bankrupt in a week.

The financial reality that I've experienced is that customer service is a very expensive, and it doesn't take long for a call to use up your profit margin.

Or giving them at 1AM (hey, it's 10:30AM in Mumbai where the off-hours call center is!). Waiting for a callback is unquestionably way better than waiting on hold, but I would still need to make sure I'm in a position to be taking that call and actually handling whatever it requires at any given time during the waiting period, so things like going shopping or being in a place with poor cell signal (like my office!) aren't good options—and what happens if I'm not available the moment they call?

If you don't pay enough money for a product that would sustain good customer service, you won't get it. Especially if you pay nothing and the product business model is ad-based. If you pay enough money, you usually can get good customer service, but you might pay a lot. reply michaelt 5 hours agorootparentIn my experience, paying a high price is no guarantee you'll get particularly good customer service. Obviously, it is often the case that you can pay more and get better service. But at the same time, the $300 seats at the theatre and the $40 seats get exactly the same treatment from the ushers. The premium airlines lose bags just as often as the economy airlines - maybe moreso, with their large highly automated hub airports. The business class bags get lost just as often as the economy class bags. The low-volume, high end luxury car will be in the shop more often than the mass produced car.

As I mentioned, it is often the case that you can pay more and get better service in that sense. But when something goes wrong - like they lose your bag - you'll find the customer service is pretty much the same. Possibly there's an ultra-ultra-premium tier where things are different?

I have worked at a dozen startups, good customer service is an early market requirement, you hire good support staff, give them direct connections to the dev, you make their manager on equal footing.

If you are selling ANY product, customer experience is part of what you are selling. Apple gets this better than practically anyone else. BUT, as a small business owner you are forced to make decisions about where to allocate your limited resources.

I guarantee you that there are many businesses where folks somehow think customer service is merely a cost center to be eliminated.

If I need it it's usually because of a flaw with the service. Surely it's very hard to be aware of their flaws if they don't have customer service but if they have other ways to reliable gather that data isn't it better for the customer if the service provider spends that effort fixing the flaws? reply zamadatix 6 hours agorootparentPeople on HN likely lean towards \"If I need it it's usually a flaw with the service\" more often (particularly regarding technical services) but the vast majority of customer support for the typical company is either \"people who think it's a flaw with the service due to a misunderstanding or 3rd party problem\" or \"people that couldn't figure out how to pay the bill online because they don't use computers much\" type things, not necessarily things that can be resolved for everyone in the next push to prod. The difficulty in well focused support is it's two different sets of problems and the people finding honest to god flaws in your product or service are usually the extreme minority and so not the focus of customer support workflows. reply marcosdumay 4 hours agorootparentprevWell, the way it usually goes is that the service provider has no reason at all to fix their flaws if they can just send to the complains into cheap \"customer service\" instead. reply gjtorikian 4 hours agoparentprevI completely agree that the prioritization of support is woefully lacking, but I think this is a consequence of the shoddy state of support tooling.

Good customer support can directly and visibility impact their bottom line by reducing hours on debugging and any costs from downtime. Average people wouldn't be willing to pay enough to provide such level of service. reply mewpmewp2 6 hours agorootparentprevAverage people would switch to a $10/month service instead of $12/month. For internet, mobile plans, people in all sorts of circles brag about what a deal they were able to get with a service provider by haggling. Even when it's a $2 monthly difference. They are proud about their negotiation skills and how they pitted the service providers against each other to make the lowest bid. Maybe once after they have received unsatisfactory customer support, they would consider switching, but passionate, skilled, caring and creative customer support would cost far, far more than that. Even if you employ enough customer support to provide a human out of the gate for everyone, you would only get people following the same script as the basic chatbot would.

Nothing. No connection to the fiber. Go outside, see the literally severed fiber strand outside my home where it ran into the living room. Took over an hour of support calls to schedule the technician out. Had me step through all the \"turn it off and on again steps\". Then they called me 5x the day before to try and \"trouble shoot\" the issue with a call center agent. Each time I had to tell them, its physically broken, there will not be a fix over the phone. It seemed as if the fact I was a first time setup made them completely forget that something could actually be wrong. All their automation said it was my fault. reply Workaccount2 5 hours agorootparentYou'd be surprised (or maybe not) at how many people will go outside their home, see whatever random cable/wire within eyesight that looks \"weird\" and become convinced to the core of their being that that cable is the reason netflix is blurry. reply weinzierl 6 hours agoprevI hate AI chatbots too and I have yet to encounter one that is remotely helpful, let alone an enjoyable experience. On the other hand I can very well image how such a positive exchange could look like. I am not convinced that it is not possible to create a chatbot that provides a satisfactory or even satisfying interaction, but I believe the incentives to do so are not there. Most of the time chatbots are just an additional obstacle in a funnel that is designed to repel the vast majority of people that try to get through. So, the sad state of chatbots says more about the attitude of companies towards their customers than about the abilities of AI, in my opinion. reply crngefest 6 hours agoparentThe issue is IMO that they have very bad / little / no internal documentation.

Exactly. We all have some level of knowledge and experience with things we consider obvious and basic like password managers, self-service (apps, online logins), etc. Bank of America has 69 million customers. I'd love to see the internal stats on what their customer service interfaces handle but I'd venture to guess they have some unbelievable amount of interactions on a daily basis for things like balances, paying bills (really), password resets, etc. Then consider services even more within our wheelhouse like ISPs - I'm sure we've all had that Tier 1 rep experience of laying on the couch while a rep goes through their script asking questions/diagnosing with things that anyone here would have gone well above and beyond before even calling. I know that whenever I have issues with anything I will do whatever I can within my own control and capability to AVOID the hoop-jumping, phone trees, queues, etc. All we're ever trying to do is navigate their script to get to Tier 2 or beyond. Then, finally, when I get them to do a truck roll because it's some outside cable plant issue or whatever the tech sees I have 10 gbit ethernet everywhere they look at me wide-eyed and ask \"So... What do you do?\". However, to your point from the perspective of the business it makes sense... Take Comcast as another example - they have over 32 million customers from all walks of life with an extremely wide range of ages, experience, capabilities, etc. Ideally you could call/chat/whatever and get a capable human right away but that's just not possible at the scale many of these entities operate. My mother (73 years old) just fell victim to the classic \"get an email, click a link, get a popup, call \"Microsoft\", install remote access software, and login to your bank account\" scam. She was completely convinced she was talking to Microsoft and the Federal Trade Commission (what?!?), her phones were tapped, and people were following/watching her. Next thing she knew she was at her bank taking out every cent she could get access to and driving around feeding hundred dollar bills into Bitcoin ATM machines. Really. Watching her interact with customer service interfaces was eye opening (as was falling victim to this ridiculous scam in the first place).

What would be useful is if its had the transcript of the course on hand, and could summarize, or answer questions about what that term was used in the last lecture and did Steve Martin mention it connected to this or something. But instead it was no knowledge of the course besides its description and can offer general information that may in fact be in opposition to the things covered in the lesson. There would actually be a way to make this useful. Especially if the course were meatier then most masterclasses are. Just summaries and term definitions and such can sometimes be very useful.

And the sole reason they get away with it is because they have very effectively lobbied in many state, town jurisdictions such that any alternative providers have no chance of making a competitive offer (either because there are no other competitors offering fiber or because getting connected would be very costly)? In that case customer service is a pure cost factor where companies are incentivized to provide the bare minimum that just retains the customer.

I needed to resolve a highly complicated title problem I was battling two separate state DMVs over (plus a defunct lender). It was starting to seem I needed to retain a lawyer. So I was just compiling information at the time. I asked an esoteric question about one of the private LLC names Carvana have as their lending arm in a specific state.

Plus information about the LLC. And then emailed me supporting documentation automatically. My jaw dropped. reply bcx 6 hours agoprevI think support is going to get worse before it gets better. From a quick glance the chatbot described in this post it is clearly moving through a dialog tree and not LLM based. The outsourced support agent is likely also just moving through some sort of script. I don't think the chatbot necessarily made the experience much worse than typical AT&T support. I think the big challenge with promise of AI chatbots (not in this example though), is that somehow you can just replace your entire support team with a bunch of bots, and free up your reactive support team to do other things. We (Olark: https://www.olark.com) have definitely seen this in our customer base and try really hard to walk people back from this perspective, but even then we are going to see more and more unstaffed chat solutions (e.g. every drift bot ever, and most intercoms) before things swing back to some hybrid of AI and humans. That said, a very simplified version of the way I think about how AI chatbots and what the future of support looks like might help you: 1) Big enterprises (or regional monopolies) who are mostly monopolies selling to consumers, where they have to just be good enough that regulators don't come after them (or sometimes compete on price (AT&T, Comcast/Xfinity, Verizon, power company)), these folks will always offer the cheapest support they can get away with. 2) Companies that still win business with human relationships. These folks will likely over index on AI and provide worse service if they BELIEVE that they are winning business based on some sort of non-relationship based factors. 3) Small businesses with small teams wearing multiple hats all the time, where providing AI support lets them offer a better service than they'd be able to provide (e.g. we now can answer 50% of questions 24/7 instantly). They will over index on AI until it hurts the bottom line. I still believe human relationships matter, and figuring out how to create hybrid bot / human customer service to enable humans to do their best work is still huge unsolved opportunity. reply jillesvangurp 5 hours agoprevChatbots are the past. The future is an llm/ai that knows you, your history & account after you identify and is able to ask the right questions and tap into the full range of tools (documentation, human operators, etc.) at its disposal to resolve your issue. It will remember past conversations. It will understand you and speak your native language. It wont get angry or frustrated with you and it will try to save the company it works for money by doing the right thing, which is generally resolving your issue. The current 'state of the art' is spending 40 minutes on hold after navigating some silly voice menu to get to talk to a person that barely has any training who serves as first line support and probably can't resolve your issue. They are likely to hang up on you and you'll face ground hog day until you accidentally say the right words that unlock access to someone with a clue. That's the past few decades. It's not that great either. reply thorin 6 hours agoprevCustomer service is seen as an overhead by most large businesses (and likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon are the worst at dealing with anything non standard). In my work with utilities businesses even though they've had great feedback previously for customer service it's still seen as something to cut to the max. Companies who have previously had local call centres with 1000s (or more) staff were gradually being moved to cheaper locations, not just to save cost, but also to save massive pension and benefits liabilities. Once all these people have gone service drops off dramatically, but then even the offshore people are being phased out. This is just not seen as a priority. The only time I go to customer services is to get support for a non standard problem, I'm happy to go to online information to get the answer that I need so when I do need to contact someone it's usually something complicated to resolve.

After mounting frustration, I finally found the password: \"I can hear other people on my phone line!\" That solved it. Click. Real tech person \"Oh, so you have crosstalk on your line?

My response to his mentioning of switching WiFi channels was more or less \"I am not using the WiFi on the router, but rather the wired Ethernet port, so is there any way you can check on the bandwidth through the device itself?\" (knowing that another part of the script is to run the bandwidth test on the device remotely—the previous support rep did that as well, confirming the 8 Mbps result). reply hcfman 6 hours agoprevDid you solve the problem?

This is all measured both on the device at the fiber, and through a separate monitor I have wired into the 1 Gbps network. I would recommend \"slow internet\".

I also thoroughly believe in a) human support chats and b) believing the people answering them to be decent human beings who deserve my clarity, preparedness, politeness and empathy, and I think more should be done on chat interfaces to make them slightly less amenable to stupid unstructured queries. You help people ask the question right. reply mewpmewp2 5 hours agorootparentBut what Jeff was facing wasn't an LLM. As far as I saw it was pattern matching with hardcoded responses. Hence it had a hardcoded response about WiFi, after saying \"Not WiFi\". ChatGPT etc wouldn't make such a mistake. And the final human also didn't understand the request correctly. ChatGPT wouldn't respond with \"I see you have a question about your Wi-Fi\" after \"Slow Internet, not slow WiFi\". I think this pattern matching was more like \"automated questionnaire filtering\" that you were suggesting. It's just it's very hard to do this filtering, to account for differences between \"not WiFi\" vs \"WiFi\", while it's easy with LLMs. reply geerlingguy 5 hours agoparentprevThat was the message I sent to the support agent after the chatbot finally got out of the way. reply spywaregorilla 3 hours agorootparentCan you elaborate on why you refer to this as an AI chatbot? reply martin293 6 hours agoprevSoooo what was the problem with your internet? reply geerlingguy 5 hours agoparentStill waiting to find out.

Of course the average HN commenter would (claim to) have a nuanced situation that can only be handled by a human representative, but the majority of customer service interactions can be handled much more routinely. Bits About Money [2] has a thoughtful take on customer support tiers from the perspective of banking: > Think of the person from your grade school classes who had the most difficulty at everything. The U.S. expects banks to service people much, much less intelligent than them. Some customers do not understand why a $45 charge and a $32 charge would overdraw an account with $70 in it. The bank will not be more effective at educating them on this than the public school system was given a budget of $100,000 and 12 years to try. This customer calls the bank much more frequently than you do. You can understand why, right? From their perspective, they were just going about their life, doing nothing wrong, and then for some bullshit reason the bank charged them $35. It's frustrating to be put through a gauntlet of chatbots and phone menus when you absolutely know you need a human to help, but that's the economics of chatbots and tier 1/2 support versus specialists: > The reason you have to “jump through hoops” to “simply talk to someone” (a professional, with meaningful decisionmaking authority) is because the system is set up to a) try to dissuade that guy from speaking to someone whose time is expensive and b) believes, on the basis of voluminous evidence, that you are likely that guy until proven otherwise. Yes, I agree that when I absolutely need to speak to a human, it's infuriating to no end. But everyone's collective \"absolutely need to speak to a human\" bar is higher than it may need to be.

    "originBody": "release engineering How Binance built a 100PB log service with Quickwit François Massot July 11, 2024 Three years ago, we open-sourced Quickwit, a distributed search engine for large-scale datasets. Our goal was ambitious: to create a new breed of full-text search engine that is ten times more cost-efficient than Elasticsearch, significantly easier to configure and manage, and capable of scaling to petabytes of data 1. While we knew the potential of Quickwit, our tests typically did not exceed 100 TB of data and 1 GB/s of indexing throughput. We lacked the real-world datasets and computing resources to test Quickwit at a multi-petabyte scale. That is, until six months ago, when two engineers at Binance, the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, discovered Quickwit and began experimenting with it. Within a few months, they achieved what we had only dreamed of: they successfully migrated multiple petabyte-scale Elasticsearch clusters to Quickwit, with remarkable achievements including: Scaling indexing to 1.6 PB per day. Operating a search cluster handling 100 PB of logs. Saving millions of dollars annually by slashing compute costs by 80% and storage costs by 20x (for the same retention period). DatasetUncompressed Size 100 PB Size on S3 (compressed) 20 PB Num documents 181 trillions Indexing deploymentIndexing throughput 1.6 PB / day Num pods 700 Num vCPUs 4000 2800* RAM 6 5.6* TB Search deploymentSearchable dataset size 100 PB Num pods 30 Num vCPUs 1200 RAM 3 TB Infra costs vs. ElasticsearchCompute costs 5x reduction Storage costs for same retention 20x reduction *First figures initially published were wrong :/ In this blog post, I will share with you how Binance built a petabyte-scale log service and overcame the challenges of scaling Quickwit to multi-petabytes. Binance's challenge As the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance handles an enormous volume of transactions, each generating logs that are crucial for security, compliance, and operational insights. This results in processing roughly 21 million log lines per second, equivalent to 18.5 GB/s, or 1.6 PB per day. To manage such a volume, Binance previously relied on 20 Elasticsearch clusters. Around 600 Vector pods were pulling logs from different Kafka topics and processing them before pushing them into Elasticsearch. However, this setup fell short of Binance's requirements in several critical areas: Operational Complexity: Managing numerous Elasticsearch clusters was becoming increasingly challenging and time-consuming. Limited Retention: Binance was retaining most logs for only a few days. Their goal was to extend this to months, requiring the storage and management of 100 PB of logs, which was prohibitively expensive and complex with their Elasticsearch setup. Limited Reliability: Elasticsearch clusters with high ingestion throughput were configured without replication to limit infrastructure costs, compromising durability and availability. The team knew they needed a radical change to meet their growing needs for log management, retention, and analysis. Why Quickwit was (almost) the perfect fit When Binance's engineers discovered Quickwit, they quickly realized it offered several key advantages over their existing setup: Native Kafka integration: It allows ingesting logs directly from Kafka with exactly-once semantics, providing huge operational benefits. Concretely speaking, you can tear down your cluster, recreate it in a minute without losing any data, ready to ingest at 1.6 PB/day or search through petabytes, and scale up and down to handle temporary spikes. Built-in VRL transformations (Vector Remap Language): As Quickwit supports VRL, it eliminates the need for hundreds of Vector pods to handle log transformations. Object storage as the primary storage: All indexed data remains on object storage, removing the need for provisioning and managing storage on the cluster side. Better data compression: Quickwit typically achieves 2x better compression than Elasticsearch, further reducing the storage footprint of indexes. However, no users had scaled Quickwit to multi-petabytes, and any engineer knows that scaling a system by a factor of 10 or 100 can reveal unexpected issues. This did not stop them, and they were ready to take on the challenge! Scaling Indexing at 1.6 PB a day Binance rapidly scaled its indexing thanks to the Kafka datasource. One month into their Quickwit PoC, they were indexing at several GB/s. This quick progress was largely due to how Quickwit works with Kafka: Quickwit uses Kafka's consumer groups to distribute the workload across multiple pods. Each pod indexes a subset of the Kafka partitions and updates the metastore with the latest offsets, ensuring exactly-once semantics. This setup makes Quickwit's indexers stateless: you can tear down your entire cluster and restart it, and the indexers will resume from where they left off as if nothing happened. However, Binance's scale revealed two main issues: Cluster Stability Issues: A few months ago, Quickwit’s gossip protocol (called Chitchat) struggled with hundreds of pods: some indexers would leave the cluster and rejoin, making the indexing throughput unstable. Uneven Workload Distribution: Binance uses several Quickwit indexes for their logs, with varying indexing throughputs. Some have a high throughput of several GB/s, others just a few MB/s. Quickwit's placement algorithm does not spread its workload evenly. This is a known issue, and we will work on this later this year. To work around these limitations, Binance deployed separate indexing clusters for each high-throughput topic, keeping one cluster for smaller topics. Isolating each high-throughput cluster did not impose an operational burden thanks to stateless indexers. Additionally, all Vector pods were removed as Binance used Vector transformation directly in Quickwit. After several months of migration and optimization, Binance finally achieved an indexing throughput of 1.6 PB with 10 Quickwit indexing clusters, 700 pods requesting around 2800 vCPU and 6 TB of memory, that's 6.6 MB/s per vCPU on average. On a given high-throughput Kafka topic, this figure goes up to 11 MB/s per vCPU. Next challenge to come: scaling search! A single search cluster for 100 PB of logs With Quickwit now capable of efficiently indexing 1.6 PB daily, the challenge shifted to searching through petabytes of logs. With 10 clusters, Binance would normally need to deploy searcher pods for each cluster, undermining one of Quickwit’s strengths: pooling searcher resources to hit the object storage shared by all indexes. To avoid this pitfall, Binance's engineers devised a clever workaround: they created a unified metastore by replicating all metadata from each indexing cluster metastore into one PostgreSQL database. This unified metastore enables the deployment of one unique centralized search cluster capable of searching through all indexes! As we speak, Binance now manages a reasonably sized cluster of 30 searcher pods, each requesting 40 vCPU and 100GB memory. To give you an idea, you only need 5 searchers (8 vCPU, 6GB memory requests) to find the needle in the haystack in 400 TB of logs. Binance runs those types of queries on petabytes but also aggregation queries, hence the higher resource requests. Wrapping up Overall, Binance's migration to Quickwit was a huge success and brought several substantial benefits: 80% reduction in computing resources compared to Elasticsearch. Storage costs reduced by a factor of 20 for the same retention period. Economically viable solution for large-scale log management, both in terms of infrastructure costs and maintenance operations. Minimal configuration tweaking, working efficiently once the right number of pods and resources were determined. Increased log retention to one or several months, depending on the log type, improving internal troubleshooting capabilities. In conclusion, Binance’s migration from Elasticsearch to Quickwit has been an exciting 6-month experience between Binance and Quickwit engineers, and we are very proud of this collaboration. We have already planned improvements in data compression, multi-cluster support, and better workload spread with Kafka datasources. Huge kudos to Binance's engineers for their work and insights throughout this migration <3 You can read more about the architecture that made this possible in this blog post.↩",

Most log messages are useless 99.99% of the time. Best likely outcome is that its turned into a metric. The once in the blue moon outcome is that it tells you what went wrong when something crashed. Before you get to shipping _petabytes_ of logs, you really need to start thinking in metrics. Yes, you should log errors, you should also make sure they are stored centrally and are searchable. But logs shouldn't be your primary source of data, metrics should be. things like connection time, upstream service count, memory usage, transactions a second, failed transactions, upsteam/downstream end point health should all be metrics emitted by your app(or hosting layer), directly. Don't try and derive it from structured logs. Its fragile, slow and fucking expensive. comparing, cutting and slicing metrics across processes or even services is simple, with logs its not. reply zzyzxd 13 minutes agoparent> Most log messages are useless 99.99% of the time. Best likely outcome is that its turned into a metric. The once in the blue moon outcome is that it tells you what went wrong when something crashed. If it crashes, it's probably some scenario that was not properly handled. If it's not properly handled, it's also likely not properly logged. That's why you need verbose logs -- once in a blue moon you need to have the ability to retrospectively investigate something in the past that was not thought through, without using a time machine. This is more common in the financial world where audit trail is required to be kept long term for regulation. Some auditor may ask you for proof that you have done a unit test for a function 3 years ago. Every organization needs to find their balance between storage cost and quality of observability. I prefer to keep as much data as we are financially allowed. \"Do we absolutely need this data or not\" is a very tough question. Instead, I usually ask \"how long do we need to keep this data\" and apply proper retention policy. That's a much easier question to answer for everyone. reply reisse 4 hours agoparentprevMetrics are only good when you can disregard some amount of errors without investigation. But they're a financial organization, they have a certain amount of liability. Generalized metrics won't help to understand what happened to that one particular transaction that failed in a cumbersome way and caused some money to disappear. reply pavlov 1 hour agorootparent> \"But they're a financial organization, they have a certain amount of liability.\" In the loosest possible sense. Binance is an organization that pretended it doesn't have any physical location in any jurisdiction. Its founder is currently in jail in the United States. reply KaiserPro 1 hour agorootparentprevYou can still have logs. What I'm suggesting is that vast amounts of unstructured logs, are worse than useless. Metics tell you where and when something when wrong. Logs tell you why. However, a logging framework, which is generally lossy, and has the lowest level of priority in terms of deliverability is not an audit mechanism. especially as nowhere are ACLs or verifiability is mentioned. How do they prove that those logs originates from that machine? If you're going to have an audit mechanism, some generic logging framework is almost certainly a bad fit. reply sangnoir 43 minutes agorootparent> You can still have logs. What I'm suggesting is that vast amounts of unstructured logs, are worse than useless Until you need them, the you'd trade anything to get them. Logs are like backups, you don't need them most of the times, but when you need them, you really need them. On the flip side, the tendency is to over-log \"just in case\". A good compromise is to allocate a per-project storage budget for logs with log expiration, and let the ones close to the coal-face figure out how they use their allocation. reply nostrebored 1 hour agorootparentprevWhy would you assume they're unstructured? Even at very immature organizations, log data within a service is usually structured. Even in my personal projects if I'm doing anything parallel structured logging is the first helper function I write. I don't think I'm unrepresentative here. reply fells 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's always struck me that these are two wildly different concerns though. Use metrics & SLOs to help diagnose the health of your systems. Derive those directly from logs/traces, keep a sample of the raw data, and now you can point any alert to the sampled data to help go about understanding a client-facing issue. But, for auditing of a particular transaction, you don't need full indexing of the events? You need a transactional journal for every account/user, likely with a well-defined schema to describe successful changes and failed attempts. Perhaps these come from the same stream of data as the observability tooling, but I can only imagine it must be a much smaller subset of the 100PB that you can avoid doing full inverse indexes on this, because your search pattern is simply answering \"what happened to this transaction?\" reply alexchantavy 2 hours agorootparent> You need a transactional journal for every account/user, likely with a well-defined schema to describe successful changes and failed attempts. Sounds like a row in a database to me. Dumb question, but is that how structured log systems are implemented? reply renewiltord 2 hours agorootparentprevThe reality is that when their service delays something they owe us tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is the tool they’re using but if they can’t even get a precise notion of when a specific request arrived at their gateway they’re in trouble. reply _boffin_ 3 hours agoparentprevHogwash. I’ll agree that it’s not as simple with logs, but amazingly powerful, and even more so with distributed tracing. They both have their places and are both needed. Without logs, I would not have been able to pinpoint multiple issues that plagued our systems. With logs, we were able to tell google, Apigee, it was there problem, not ours. With tracing, we were able to tell a legacy team they had an issue and was able to pinpoint it after them telling us for 6 months that it was our fault. Without logging and tracing, we wouldn’t have been able to tell our largest client, that we never received a 1/3 of their requests they sent us as our company was running around frantically. They’re both needed, but for different things…ish. reply KaiserPro 1 hour agorootparentYou're missing my main point: logs should not be your primary source of information. > Without logs, I would not have been able to pinpoint multiple issues that plagued our systems. Logs are great for finding out what went wrong, but terrible at telling there is a problem. This is what I mean by primary information source. If you are sifting through TBs logs to pinpoint a issue, it sucks. Yes, there are tools, but its still hard. Logs are shit for deriving metrics, it usually requires some level of bespoke processing which is easy to break silently, especially for rarer messages. reply BonusPlay 49 minutes agoparentprevWhen performing forensic analysis, metrics don't usually help that much. I'd rather sift 2PB of logs, knowing that information I'm looking for is in there, than sit at the usual \"2 weeks of nginx access logs which roll over\". Obviously running everything with debug logging just burns through money, but having decent logs can help a lot other teams, not just the ones working on the project (developers, sysadmins, etc.) reply p-o 4 hours agoparentprevI would say from my experience, for _application logs_, it's the exact opposite. When you deal with a few GB/day of data, you want to have logs, and metrics can be derived from those logs. Logs are expensive compared to metrics, but they convey a lot more information about the state of your system. You want to move towards metrics over time only one hotspot at a time to reduce cost while keeping observability of your overall system. I'll take logs over metrics any day of the week, when cost isn't prohibitive. reply KaiserPro 4 hours agorootparentI was at a large financial news site, They were a total splunk shop. We had lots real steel machines shipping and chunking _loads_ of logs. Every team had a large screen showing off key metrics. Most of the time they were badly maintained and broken, so only the _really_ key metrics worked. Great for finding out what went wrong, terrible at alerting when it went wrong. However, over the space of about three years we shifted organically over to graphite+grafana. There wasn't a top down push, but once people realised how easy it was to make a dashboard, do templating and generally keep things working, they moved in droves. It also helped that people put metrics emitting system into the underlying hosting app library. What really sealed the deal was the non-tech business owners making or updating dashboards. They managed to take pure tech metrics and turn them into service/business metrics. reply david38 3 hours agorootparentThis. I was an engineer at Splunk for many years. I knew it cold. I then joined a startup where they just used metrics and the logs TTLed out after just a week. They were just used for short term debugging. The metrics were easier to put in, keep organized, make dashboards from, lighter, cheaper, better. I had been doing it wrong this whole time. reply brabel 2 hours agorootparent> the logs TTLed out after just a week \"expired\" is the word you're looking for. reply p-o 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's fair that you had a different experience than I had. However, your experience seems to be very close to what I was describing. Cost got prohibitive (splunk), and you chose a different avenue. It's totally acceptable to do that, but your experience doesn't reflect mine, and I don't think I'm the exception. I've used both grafana+metrics and logs to different degrees. I've enjoyed using both, but any system I work on starts with logs and gradually add metrics as needed, it feels like a natural evolution to me, and I've worked at different scale, like you. reply hanniabu 3 hours agorootparentprevI feel like I shouldn't need to mention this, but comparing a news site to a financial exchange with money at stake is not the same. If there is a glitch you need to be able to trace it back and you can't do that with some abstracted metrics. reply pixl97 2 hours agorootparentYea, on a news site, the metrics are important. If suddenly you start seeing errors accrue above background noise and it's affecting a number of people you can act on it. If it's affecting one user, you probably don't give a shit. In finance if someone puts and entry for 1,000,000,000 and it changes to 1,000,000 the SEC, fraud investigators, lawyers, banks, and some number of other FLAs are shining a flashlight up your butt as to what happened. reply KaiserPro 2 hours agorootparentright, and the SEC see that you're mixing verbose k8s logging with financial records, you're going to get a bollocking. reply KaiserPro 2 hours agorootparentprevYou are misreading me. I'm not saying that you can't log, I'm saying that logging _everything_ on debug in an unstructured way and then hoping to devine a signal from it, is madness. You will need logs, as they eventually tell you what went wrong. But they are very bad at telling you that something is going wrong now. Its also exceptionally bad at allowing you quickly pinpointing _when_ something changed. Even in a logging only environment, you get an alert, you look at the graphs, then dive into the logs. The big issue is that those metrics are out of date, hard to derrive and prone to breaking when you make changes. verbose logging is not a protection in a financial market, because if something goes wrong you'll need to process those logs for consumption by a third party. You'll then have to explain why the format changed three times in the two weeks leading up to that event. Moreover you will need to seperate the money audit trail from the verbose application logs, ideally at source. as its \"high value data\" you can't be mixing those stream at all reply lmpdev 4 hours agorootparentprevI’m not well versed in QA/Sysadmin/Logs but surely metrics suffer from Simpson’s paradox compared to properly probed questions only answered through having access to the entirety of the logs? If you average out metrics across all log files you’re potentially reaching false or worse inverse conclusions about multiple distinct subsets of the logs It’s part of the reason why statisticians are so pedantic about the wording of their conclusions and to which subpopulation their conclusions actually apply to reply anonygler 25 minutes agoparentprev\"Once in a blue moon\" -- you mean the thing that constantly happens? If you're not using logs, you're not practicing engineering. Metrics can't really diagnose problems. It's also a lot easier to inspect a log stream that maps to an alert with a trace id than it is to assemble a pile of metrics for each user action. reply hot_gril 20 minutes agorootparentI think the above comment is just saying that you shouldn't use logs to do the job of metrics. Like, if you have an alert that goes off when some HTTP server is sending lots of 5xx, that shouldn't rely on parsing logs. reply ryukoposting 1 hour agoparentprevMetrics are useful when you know what to measure, which implies that you already have a good idea for what can go wrong. If your entire product exists in some cloud servers that you fully control, that's probably feasible. Binance probably could have done something more elegant than storing extraordinary amounts of logs. However, if you're selling a physical product, and/or a service that integrates deeply with third party products/services, it becomes a lot more difficult to determine what's even worth measuring. A conservative approach to metrics collection will limit the usefulness of the metrics, for obvious reasons. A \"kitchen sink\" approach will take you right back to the same \"data volume\" problem you had with logs, but now your developers have to deal with more friction when creating diagnostics. Neither extreme is desirable, and finding the middle ground would require information that you simply don't have. On a related note, one approach I've found useful (at a certain scale) is to shove metrics inside of the logs themselves. Put a machine-readable suffix on your human-readable log messages. The resulting system requires no more infrastructure than what your logs are already using, and you get a reliable timeline of when certain metrics appear vs. when certain log messages appear. reply temporarely 1 hour agorootparentAny system has a 'natural set' of metrics. And metrics are not about \"what [went] wrong\" rather system health. So Metrics -> Alert -> Log Diagnostics. reply londons_explore 2 hours agoparentprevWhen you have metrics, you should also keep sampled logs. Ie. 1 per million log entries is kept. Write some rules to try and keep more of the more interesting ones. One way to do this is to have your logging macro include the source file and line number the logline came from, and then, for each file and line number emit/store no more than 1 logline per minute. That way you get detailed records of rare events, while filtering most of the noise. reply hooverd 1 hour agorootparentThere are also different types of logs. Maybe you want every transaction action but don't need a full fidelity copy of every load balancer ping from the last ten years. reply pawelduda 3 hours agoparentprevWith logs you can get an idea of what events happened in what order during some complex process, stretched over long timeframe, and so on. I don't think you can do this with a metric reply KaiserPro 1 hour agorootparent> With logs you can get an idea of what events happened in what order Again, if you're at that point, you need logs. But thats never going to be your primary source of information. if you have more than a few services running at many transactions a second, you can't scale that kind of understanding using logs. This is my point, if you have >100 services, each with many tens or hundreds of processes, your primary (well it shouldn't be, you need pre SLA fuckup alerts)alert to something going wrong is something breeching an SLA. That's almost certainly a metric. Using logs to derive that metric means you have a latency of 60-1500 seconds Getting your apps to emit metrics directly means that you are able to make things much more observable. It also forces your devs to think about _how_ their app is observed. reply zarathustreal 4 hours agoparentprevI’ve got to disagree here, especially with memoization and streaming, deriving metric from structured logs is extremely flexible, relatively fast, and can be configured to be as cheap as you need it to be. With streaming you can literally run your workload on a raspberry pi. Granted, you need to write the code to do so yourself, most off-the-shelf services probably are expensive reply KaiserPro 1 hour agorootparent> memoization and streaming, memoization isn't free in logs, you're basically deduping an unbounded queue and its difficult to scale from one machine. Its both CPU and Memory heavy. I mean sure you can use scuba, which is great, but that's basically a database made to look like a log store. > deriving metric from structured logs is extremely flexible Assuming you can actually generate structured logs reliably. but even if you do, its really easy to silently break it. > With streaming you can literally run your workload on a raspberry pi no, you really can't. Streaming logs to a centralised place is exceptionally IO heavy. If you want to generate metrics from it, its CPU heavy as well. If you need speed, then you'll also need lots of RAM, otherwise searching your logs will cause logging to stop. (either because you've run out of CPU, or you've just caused the VFS cache to drop because you're suddenly doing no predictable IO. ) greylog exists for streaming logs. hell, even rsyslog does it. Transporting logs is fairly simple, storing and generating signal from it is very much not. reply derefr 2 hours agoparentprevI would note that a notional \"log store\", doesn't have to just be used for things that are literally \"logs.\" You know what else you could call a log store? A CQRS/ES event store. (Specifically, a \"log store\" is a CQRS/ES event store that just so happens to also remember a primary-source textual representation for each structured event-document it ingests — i.e. the original \"log line\" — so that it can spit \"log lines\" back out unchanged from their input form when asked. But it might not even have this feature, if it's a structured log store that expects all \"log lines\" to be \"structured logging\" formatted, JSON, etc.) And you know what the most important operation a CQRS/ES event store performs is? A continuous streaming-reduction over particular filtered subsets of the events, to compute CQRS \"aggregates\" (= live snapshot states / incremental state deltas, which you then continuously load into a data warehouse to power the \"query\" part of CQRS.) Most CQRS/ES event stores are built atop message queues (like Kafka), or row-stores (like Postgres). But neither are actually very good backends for powering the \"ad-hoc-filtered incremental large-batch streaming\" operation. • With an MQ backend, streaming is easy, but MQs maintain no indices for events per se, just copies of events in different topics; so filtered streaming would either have the filtering occur mostly client-side; or would involve a bolt-on component that is its own \"client-side\", ala Kafka Streams. You can use topics for this — but only if you know exactly what reduction event-type-sets you'll need before you start publishing any events. Or if you're willing to keep an archival topic of every-event-ever online, so that you can stream over it to retroactively build new filtered topics. • With a row-store backend, filtered streaming without pre-indexing is tenable — it's a query plan consisting of a primary-key-index-directed seq scan with a filter node. But it's still a lot more expensive than it'd be to just be streaming through a flat file containing the same data, since a seq scan is going to be reading+materializing+discarding all the rows that don't match the filtering rule. You can create (partial!) indices to avoid this — and nicely-enough, in a row-store, you can do this retroactively, once you figure out what the needs of a given reduction job are. But it's still a DBA task rather than a dev task — the data warehouse needs to be tweaked to respond to the needs of the app, every time the needs of the app change. (I would also mention something about schema flexibility here, but Postgres has a JSON column type, and I presume CQRS/ES event-store backends would just use that.) A CQRS/ES event store built atop a fully-indexed document store / \"index store\" like ElasticSearch (or Quickwit, apparently) would have all the same advantages of the RDBMS approach, but wouldn't require any manual index creation. Such a store would perform as if you took the RDBMS version of the solution, and then wrote a little insert-trigger stored-procedure that reads the JSON documents out of each row, finds any novel keys in them, and creates a new partial index for each such novel key. (Except with much lower storage-overhead — because in an \"index store\" all the indices share data; and much better ability to combine use of multiple \"indices\", as in an \"index store\" these are often not actually separate indices at all, but just one index where the key is part of the index.) --- That being said, you know what you can use the CQRS/ES model for? Reducing your literal \"logs\" into metrics, as a continuous write-through reduction — to allow your platform to write log events, but have its associated observability platform read back pre-aggregated metrics time-series data, rather than having to crunch over logs itself at query time. And AFAIK, this \"modelling of log messages as CQRS/ES events in a CQRS/ES event store, so that you can do CQRS/ES reductions to them to compute metrics as aggregates\" approach is already widely in use — but just not much talked about. For example, when you use Google Cloud Logging, Google seems to be shoving your log messages into something approximating an event-store — and specifically, one with exactly the filtered-streaming-cost semantics of an \"index store\" like ElasticSearch (even though they're actually probably using a structured column-store architecture, i.e. \"BigTable but append-only and therefore serverless.\") And this event store then powers Cloud Logging's \"logs-based metrics\" reductions (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics). reply ram_rar 9 minutes agoprev>Limited Retention: Binance was retaining most logs for only a few days.

So indexing will cost them around $70k/month. For search, they need 1200 vCPUs, it will cost them around $30k/month. For storage, it will cost them $23/TB * 20000 = $460k/month. Storage costs are an issue. Of course, they pay less than $23/TB but it's still expensive. They are optimizing this either by using different storage classes or by moving data to cheaper cloud providers for long term storage (less requests mean you need less performant storage and usually you can get a very good price on those object storages). On quickwit side, we will also improve the compression ratio to reduce the storage footprint. [1]: I fixed the num vCPUs number of indexing, it was written 4000 when I published the post, but it corresponded to the total number of vCPUs for search and indexing. reply rcaught 4 hours agorootparentSavings plans, spot, EDP discounts.

The cost per year is much higher - that's using a 5-year amortization. reply BiteCode_dev 4 hours agorootparentSeems high. You can get a spinning disk of 18TB (not need for SSD if you can parallel write) for 224€. Let's round that to $300 for easy calculations. To store 100 petabytes of data by purchasing disks yourself, you would need approximately 5556 18TB hard drives totaling $1,666,800. Of course, you'll pay more than the disks. Let's add the cost of 93 enclosures at $3,000 each ($279,000), and accounting for controllers, network equipment ($100,000), and power and cooling infrastructure ($50,000, although it's probably already cool where they will host the thing), that would be a about $2.1 M. That's total, and that's for the uncompressed data. You would need 3 times that for redundancy, but it would still be 40% cheaper over 5 years, not to mention I used retail price. With their purchasing power they can get a big discount. Now, you do have the cost of having a team to maintain the whole thing but they likely have their own data center anyway if they go that route. reply rthnbgrredf 2 hours agorootparentFor this purpose you would likely not buy ordinary consumer disks but rather bullet proof enterprise HDDs.

Re: advanced querying: the recommended way to do this is to build an index out of band (like Redis (or a fork) or SQLite or something) that references the stored messages by sequence number. By doing that, your index is just this ephemeral thing that can be dynamically built to exactly optimize for the queries you're using it for. Re: sharding: no, it doesn't support simple sharding. You can achieve sharding by standing up multiple NATS instances, and making a new stream (KV and object store are also just streams) on each instance, and capture some subset of the stream on each instance. The client (or perhaps a service querying on behalf of the client) would have to me smart enough to be able to mux the sources together. reply ATsch 36 minutes agoprevIt's always very amusing how all of the blockchain companies wax lyrical about all of the huge supposed benefits of blockchains and how every industry and company is missing out by not adopting them and should definitely run a hyperledger private blockchain buzzword whatever.

These are impressive numbers but I wonder about something... Binance is a centralized cryptocurrencies exchange. But AIUI \"defi\" is a thing: instead of using a CEX (Centralized EXchange), people can use a DEX (Decentralized EXchange). And apparently there's a gigantic number of trades happening in the defi world. And it's all happening on public ledgers right? (I'm asking, I don't know: are the \"level 2\" chains public?). And the sum of all the public ledgers / blockchains transactions do not represent anywhere near 1.6 PB a day. And yet DEXes do work (and often now, seen that volume picked up, have liquidity and fees cheaper than centralized exchanges). Someone who know this stuff better than I do could comment but from a quick googling here's what I found: - a full Ethereum node today is 1.2 TB (not PB, but TB) - a full Bitcoin node today is 585 GB There are other blockchains but these two are the two most successful ones? So let's take Ethereum... For 1.2 TB you have the history of all the transactions that ever happened on Ethereum, since 2015 or something. And that's not just Ethereum but also all the \"tokens\" and \"NFTs\" on ethereum, including stablecoins like Circle/Coinbase's USDC. How do we go from a decentralized \"1.2 TB for the entire Ethereum history\" to \"1.6 PB per day for Binance transactions\"? That's 1500x the size of the freaking entire Ethereum blockchain generated by logs, in a day. And Ethereum is, basically, a public ledger. So it is... Logs? Or let's compared Binance's numbers to, say, the US equities options market. That feed is a bit less than 40 Gb/s I think, so 140 TB for a day of actual equities options trading datafeed. I understand these aren't \"logs\" but, same thing... How do we go from a daily 140 TB datafeed from the CBOE (where the big guys are and the real stuff if happening) to 10x that amount in daily Binance logs. Something doesn't sound right. You can say it's apples vs oranges but I don't it's that much of apples vs oranges. I mean: if these 1.6 PB of Binance logs per day are justified, it makes me think it's time to sell everything and go all-in in cryptocurrencies, because there may be way more interest and activity than people think. (yeah, I'm kidding) EDIT: 1.2 TB for Ethereum seems to be a full but not an \"archive\" node. An \"archive\" node is 6 TB. Still a far cry from 1.6 PB a day. reply arandomusername 1 hour agorootparentArchive node can go as low as ~2TB depending on the client, but regardless you do want to compare it to a full node, as the only difference is an \"archive\" node keeps the state at any block (e.g you want to replay a transaction that occured in the past, or see a state at a certain block). The full nodes still contain all events/txs (DEXes will emit events, akin to logs, for transfers) - so it's fair to compare it to a full node. On CEXes you see a lot more trades, market makers/high frequency trades just doing a ton of volume/creating orders and so on, since it's a lot cheaper. CEXes without a doubt have more trades than DEX by orders of magnitude. Additionally, they probably log multiple stuff for every request, including API request, which they most definitely get a ton of. reply tommek4077 1 hour agorootparentprevDefi is a fraction of whats happening on cefi exchanges. I have a customer placing hundreds of billions of orders per day on binance.

Junk your data based on time, scale horizontally. When you can scale horizontally it doesn't matter how much it is. Elastic is not something i would use for scaling horizontally basic logs, i would use it for live data which i need live with little latency or if i do constantly a lot of log analysis live again. Did Binance really needed elastic or did they just start pushing everything into elastic without every looking left and right? Did they do any log processing and cleanup before? reply fulmicoton 5 hours agoparentThis is their application logs. They need to search into it in a comfortable manner. They went for a search engine with Elasticsearch at first, and Quickwit after that because even after restriction the search on a tag and a time window \"grepping\" was not a viable option. reply jcgrillo 5 hours agorootparentThis position has always confused me. IME logs search tools (ELK and their SaaS ilk) are always far too restrictive and uncomfortable compared to Hadoop/Spark. I'd much rather have unfettered access to the data and have to wait a couple seconds for my query to return than be pigeonholed into some horrible DSL built around an indexing scheme. I couldn't care less about my logs queries returning in sub-second time, it's just not a requirement. The fact that people index logs is baffling. reply fulmicoton 4 hours agorootparentIf you can limit your research to GBs of logs, I kind of agree with you. It's ok if a log search request takes 100ms instead of 2s, and the \"grep\" approach is more flexible. Usually our users search into > 1TB. Let's imagine you have to search into 10TB (even after time/tag pruning). Distributing over 10k cores over 2 second is not practical and does not always economically make sense. reply jcgrillo 4 hours agorootparentI guess I was a little too prescriptive with \"a couple seconds\". What I really meant was a timescale of seconds to minutes is fine, probably five minutes is too long. > Let's imagine you have to search into 10TB (even after time/tag pruning). I'd love to know more about this. How frequently do users need to scan 10TB of data? Assuming it's all on one machine on a disk that supports a conservative 250MB/s sequential throughout (and your grep can also run at 250MB/s) that's about 11hr, so you could get it down to 4min on a cluster with 150 disks. But I still have trouble believing they actually need to scan 10TB each time. I guess a real world example would help. EDIT: To be clear, I really like quickwit, and what they've done here is really technically impressive! I don't mean to disparage this effort on its technical merits, I just have trouble understanding where the impulse to index everything comes from when applied specifically to the problem of logging and logs analysis. It seems like a poor fit. reply AJSDfljff 4 hours agorootparentprevThe question is why would someone need search through TBs of data. If you are not google cloud and just have your workers ready to stream all data in parallel on x amount of workers in parallel, i would force usefull limitations and for broad searches, i would add a background system. Start your query, come back later or get streaming results. On the other hand, if not toooo many people search in parallel constantly and you go with data pods like backblaze, just add a little bit more cpu and memory and use the cpu of the datapods for parallisation. Should still be much cheaper than putting it on s3 / cloud. reply esafak 4 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like you are doing ETL on your logs. Most people want to search them when something goes wrong, which means indexing. reply jcgrillo 3 hours agorootparentNo, what I'm doing is analysis on logs. That could be as simple as \"find me the first N occurrences of this pattern\" (which you might call search) but includes things like \"compute the distribution of request latencies for requests affected by a certain bug\" or \"find all the tenants impacted by a certain bug, whose signature may be complex and span multiple services across a long timescale\". Good luck doing that in a timely manner with Kibana. Indexed search is completely useless in this case, and it solves a problem (retrieval latency) I don't (and, I claim, you don't) have. EDIT: another way to look at this is the companies I've worked at where I've been able to actually do detailed analysis on the logs (they were stored sensibly such that I could run mapreduce jobs over them) I never reached a point where a problem was unsolvable. These days where we're often stuck with a restrictive \"logs search solution as a service\" I often run into situations where the answer simply isn't obtainable. Which situation is better for customers? I guess cynically you could say being unable to get to the bottom of an issue keeps me timeboxed and focused on feature development instead of fixing bugs.. I don't think anyone but the most craven get-rich-quick money grubber would actually believe that's better though. reply AJSDfljff 5 hours agorootparentprevWould be curious what they are searching exactly. At this size and cost, aligning what you log should save a lot of money. reply fulmicoton 4 hours agorootparentThe data is just Binance's application logs for observability. Typically what a smaller business would simply send to Datadog. This log search infra is handled by two engineers who do that for the entire company.

[3] https://www.uber.com/blog/modernizing-logging-with-clp-ii/ reply cletus 1 hour agoprevJust browsing the Quickwit documentation it seems like the general architecture here is to write JSON logs but stores them compressed. Is this just something like gzip compression? 20% compressed size does seem to align to ballpark estimates of JSON GZIP compression. This is what Quickwit (and this page) calls a \"document\": a single JSON record (just FYI). Additionally you need to store indices because this is what you actually search. Indices have a storage cost when you write them too. When I see a system like this my thoughts go to questions like: - What happens when you alter an index configuration? Or add or remove an index? - How quickly do indexes update when this happens? - What about cold storage? Data retention is another issue. Indexes have config for retention [1]. It's not immediately clear to me how document retention works, possibly from S3 expiration? So, network transfer from S3 is relatively expensive ($0.05/GB standard pricing [2] to the Internet, less to AWS regions). This will be a big factor in cost. I'm really curious to know how much all of this actually costs per PB per month. IME you almost never need to log and store this much data and there's almost no reason to ever store this much. Most logs are useless and you also have to question what the purpose is of any given log. Even if you're logging errors, you're likely to get the exact same value out of 1% sampling of logs than you are with logging everything. You might even get more value with 1% sampling because your query and monitoring might be a whole lot easier with substantially less data to deal with. Likewise, metrics tend to work just as well from sampled data. This post suggests 60 day log retention (100PB / 1.6PB daily). I would probably divide this into: 1. Metrics storage. You can get this from logs but you'll often find it useful to write it directly if you can. Getting it from logs can be error-prone (eg a log format changes, the sampling rate changes and so on); 2. Sampled data, generally for debugging. I would generally try to keep this at 10TB or less; 3. \"Offline\" data, which you would generally only query if you absolutely had to. This is particularly true on S3, for example, because the write costs are basically zero but the read costs are expensive. Additionally, you'd want to think about data aggregation as a lot of your logs are only useful when combined in some way [1]: https://quickwit.io/docs/overview/concepts/indexing [2]: https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/ reply elchief 4 hours agoprevmaybe drop the log level from debug to info... reply bearjaws 5 hours agoprev [2 more] [flagged] martijnvds 5 hours agoparent [–] Except for AWS ;) reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "The Overengineered Resume with Zola, JSON Resume, Weasyprint, and Nix Author David Reed Published 2023-11-09 Words 3578 Share Links Repo Maintaining a resume is not the most interesting use of time. Naturally, when I needed to bring my own up to date, I decided to spend a great deal more time on it and overengineer the process. I wanted a bunch of things that didn't necessarily fit together that well: A split between content and presentation, so that I could maintain my resume data separately from how it's rendered and swap out different rendered formats. Version control. I wanted everything in Git, in text-based formats that I can diff or process with scripts. Multiple output formats, at least in theory. PDF rendering, since most career sites accept PDF uploads. The option to publish my resume as a web page in the future. More visual flair and typesetting control than basic Google Docs-style resume templates. (I know applicant-tracking systems don't see visual flair, but it makes me happy). Straightforward text embedding in PDFs to ensure those ATSs do see what they need. Not to use LaTeX. It's been years since I used LaTeX in anger, and I'd prefer to stick with web technologies I know well. Here's where I ended up. (And here's the actual output). Building a Data-Driven Resume I'm only aware of one standard for representing resume data: JSON Resume. I always prefer to use standards where I can, although I'm disappointed there isn't a stronger ecosystem around this one. (And all the more that the major HR applications don't ingest it). Because I wanted to avoid LaTeX, I decided to try templating my resume data into either Markdown or HTML and CSS and then rendering that content as a PDF. That also gave me the optionality I was looking for on output formats; if I wanted a resume web page, I could just publish the HTML with a different stylesheet. I already use the static site generator Zola to build this website. Zola's Tera template engine is very similar to Jinja2, making it comfortable for me, and it's very fast. The HTML-to-PDF tool space doesn't have a huge number of players in it and most of the players seem to be eccentric in some respect. I've played with this kind of rendering in the past and had some success with Weasyprint, so I brought it back for this effort. Here's how these components come together into a data-to-PDF pipeline: Zola JSON Resume Data Tera Template CSS HTML PDF Weasyprint Resume data is defined in a resume.yaml file, using the JSON Resume schema. I find it much more pleasant to author YAML than JSON, and Zola supports both formats just fine. Here's the opening of my resume in YAML: # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/master/schema.json basics: name: David Reed label: Technical architect, engineer, communicator email: david@ktema.org url: https://ktema.org summary:I am a product-minded full-stack engineer and technical architect. I lead exceptional teams in building and scaling SaaS applications that shorten time-to-value for customers and maximize productivity for internal stakeholders. I've designed, shipped, and stewarded platforms that span CLI to cloud. I'm passionate about delivering products that empower every role to do their most impactful work, from engineers to business users. I believe in async, distributed work and thrive in cross-functional teams. I strive to center compassion in everything I build. The comment at the top instructs the YAML language server to use the JSON Resume schema to validate the data, which means I get hints in my editor where I've specified something invalid. On the Zola side, I need a template. The template defines the structure of my resume - how the data is converted into a readable, formatted, attractive presentation. Here's the opening of the template I developed (note that it uses the Jinja2-like Tera template language): {% set resume = load_data(path=\"content/resume.yaml\") %}{{ resume.basics.name }} {{ resume.basics.name }} ∙ {{ resume.basics.label }} {% if resume.basics.email %} email{{ resume.basics.email }}{% endif %} {% if resume.basics.url %} web {{ resume.basics.url }} {% endif %} {% if resume.basics.profiles %} {% for network in resume.basics.profiles %} {{ network.networklower }} {{ network.username }} {% endfor %} {% endif %}{{ resume.basics.summarymarkdownsafe }}See the full template on GitHub. Taking my cues from Simple.css, which I use for this site, I've prioritized using standard semantic HTML tags and using CSS to style them. Note the critical Tera template tag at the head of the template: {% set resume = load_data(path=page.extra.resume_data) %} This loads my resume data from resume.yaml into the variable resume, which the rest of my template then consumes to dynamically render my resume into HTML. I've also decided to treat most of the resume content, as specified in YAML, as Markdown (| markdownsafe, in Tera). That means I can style my highlights for each position, which I apply to call out metrics and achievements in color. I use only portions of the JSON Resume schema, and a couple of them I use in a way that's a bit questionable. (The story of standardized schemas, isn't it!) I've used the awards key in a fairly loose, unstructured way. I've also misused the skill.keywords key: when the word \"break\" is present as a keyword, the template starts a new sub-list of skills. (It doesn't otherwise use keywords for anything). The last element stitching all of this together is a Markdown content file. Zola needs a content file in order to render the template into a page. In this case, the content file's empty save for metadata in its front matter, which defines the mapping between the data file and the template. title=\"Resume\" template=\"resume.html\" [extra] resume_data=\"resume.yaml\" Because the template accepts the resume_data path as a parameter, I could in fact render multiple resumes by creating multiple .md files with different front matter. At this point, I can render my resume. Once I have zola and weasyprint installed via my package manager of choice (for more on which see below), I do $ zola build $ weasyprint public/resume/index.html Resume-David-Reed.pdf Voila - a PDF resume, beautifully rendered and ready for upload into an applicant-tracking system that could not care less about how snazzy it is. That's nowhere near enough overengineering. Let's automate the whole shebang. (Although you can stop here and still have a nice data-driven resume, if automation is not your cup of tea). Local Developer Experience I already alluded to tooling setup, which is one of the key aspects of the developer experience I want. I don't want to worry about tools, activating virtual environments, launching a container, or any other fiddling. I also don't ever want to run commands manually to synchronize some artifact A (here, a PDF) with some other artifact B (here, my data file and template). It should be magical. Magic is what software engineering is all about! Plus, a live preview function make the authoring experience so much better. I've been exploring NixOS lately, so rather than building a Dockerfile, I set up my local environment using nix-shell and direnv following these instructions. I created a shell.nix specifying my dependencies: { pkgs ? import{} }: pkgs.mkShell { nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs.buildPackages; [ zola just python311Packages.weasyprint inotify-tools yq ]; } and a .envrc containing use_nix Then, after I direnv allow, every time I cd into my resume project, weasyprint and zola are magically available for me to use. (See the link above for full setup details). I don't like memorizing commands, either, so I threw in a justfile with some useful abstractions: filename := \"resume.yaml\" build: zola build pdf: build weasyprint public/resume/index.html \\ Resume-$(cat resume.yamlyq -r '.basics.namesplit(\" \")join(\"-\")').pdf render: build pdf xdg-open Resume-$(cat resume.yamlyq -r '.basics.namesplit(\" \")join(\"-\")').pdf &disown Here I use yq to dynamically generate the filename of my output PDF from the resume data, which mostly just means I don't hard-code my own name. Now a just pdf creates my resume PDF, and a just render builds and opens the PDF in my preferred viewer. With a little more shell magic, I can add live previews: watch: #!/usr/bin/env sh inotifywait -m -r . \\ --exclude \"(.*\\\\.pdf$)|public|justfile|\\\\.git\" \\ -e close_write,move,create,delete \\while read -r directory events filename; do just render done I derived most of this from a great Stack Exchange answer. Now my workflow goes like this: I run just watch. The script watches the local directory for changes. I edit my resume data. inotifywait catches the event and runs just render. Zola and Weasyprint run a rebuild of my resume PDF. My PDF viewer refreshes with the new content. When I'm done, I hit Ctrl-C or kill my terminal. A full rebuild takes about a second on my machine, roughly nine tenths of which is PDF rendering time. I'd love that to be faster (the Zola HTML generation takes milliseconds!) but it works for now. So that's my local development story more or less sorted out. I'm relying on my editor's support for the YAML Language Server (available in Visual Studio Code and in Vim/Neovim) to provide validation and formatting of my YAML. I haven't configured precommit checks of my YAML as I don't know of an appropriate tool that uses the same YAML library as the language server. Continuous Integration Because my PDF is fundamentally a build product, I don't want to commit it to source control. I also don't want to be responsible for ensuring that a stored copy is up-to-date with my latest commit. Enter GitHub Actions. I added this workflow to my repo: name: \"Render Resume\" on: push: branches: - main jobs: render: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v23 with: nix_path: nixpkgs=channel:nixos-unstable - uses: DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action@v2 - run: nix-shell --run \"just pdf\" - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3 with: path: \"*.pdf\" Because nix-shell grabs my shell.nix by default, I get the same packages installed in CI that I use for local development. I could go further and pin a specific set of package versions to guarantee reproducibility. I've chosen not to do any pinning yet while I keep rolling out uses for Nix on my local machines. Once the PDF is rendered, I upload it as an artifact on this commit, so that it's associated with all of its sources. I can grab the PDF from my latest commit and upload it any time I submit a job application. If I wanted to use another distribution strategy, like including this PDF as an asset in my website, I could build further automation around that use case. That might be programmatically making a commit to a different repo, using my resume repo as a submodule, or something else entirely. I could go further still and add rendering on branches, too. I might let a branch represent a sector to which I want to apply, like nonprofit. Then I can segregate tailorings of my resume for specific job roles, and merge down global changes from main to keep everything in sync. The Result It's still just a resume, but it makes my engineer brain happy. If you'd like to indulge similar neuroses, you can clone a template repository and start from there. Have fun!",

    "commentBody": "The Overengineered Resume with Zola, JSON Resume, Weasyprint, and Nix (2023) (ktema.org)130 points by ahamez 10 hours agohidepastfavorite76 comments DEADMINCEDOS 6 hours agoI don't know that this is the right way to solve the resume 'problem' - I think LaTeX is a far superior choice, yet the author pretty much dimissed it as a possibility. For me personally, I found LaTeX to be the perfect solution. I have my resume tex setup so I can set toggles to define what gets output. E.g. applying for a manager position, I might keep it brief and more technical. The resume is modular and can be updated by updating external txt files and not the LaTeX itself. It looks nice, is always consistent, has nice links, etc. It's optimized for all the ATS nonsense it inevitably gets run through, it generates a PDF, and I've made it near impossible for recruiters to copy and paste and repurpose it without retyping much of it, and I have a tone of tech tricks in their like invisible text that automated systems might see. If LaTeX itself is sufficient, I can't imagine needing to add in something like Nix and a webserver or how that would be better in any way. reply taeric 1 hour agoparentLaTeX is fine to me, as well. Heck, now that I'm older, I think bare TeX is probably fine. In line with what you are saying, I can offload the semantic nature of my resume to text files and just use the markup of TeX to layout how I want the page to look. Much easier if I don't try and have a single source that is both all of my semantic data with the layout at the same time. reply datadeft 1 hour agoparentprevI have used LaTeX extensively over the years until Typst came along. Typst is exactly what I need. A lightweight syntax alternative of LaTeX without the issues. It supports SVGs and many more things that are very useful. reply Ilasky 4 hours agoparentprevI’ve actually made the switch over to Typst[0] for my app [1]. I’ve previously used a quick jinja .tex template that then just pasted things in, but LaTeX can really throw some strange errors and overall handling the files was a hassle. Typst was much easier to setup and the function-based operation meant that sending variables in was a breeze with better error handling there too. Also, I just grok the syntax a lot better. Just another option for folks looking to redo their resumes/not use Latex.

I use to have a LaTeX resume generated with LuaTeX. At an old company, I saw my LaTeX resume in the ATS long after I was hired. Apparently, something happened and the PDF displayed as blurred-but-not-unreadable in the ATS. Maybe the ATS did some post-processing or used a limited PDF display engine? Lucky for me, the resume for that job was just a formality. These days, I just use Google Docs and export to PDF. reply DEADMINCEDOS 3 hours agorootparentI've made sure all the most commonly used ATS systems can read the produced PDF without issue. reply webel0 23 minutes agorootparentI wouldn't worry about automated ATS. Their use is way overstated on LinkedIn, by \"resume experts,\" etc. I'm talking about whether a human can read the document comfortably. reply turboponyy 3 hours agoparentprevNix is completely orthogonal to whatever tech you use to build the resume - it's nice as a build tool + to provide dev environments for however you're going to realize your resume. reply DEADMINCEDOS 3 hours agorootparentThere is no reason to mention it, though. It's like mentioned Ubuntu as being necessary for having made a resume. reply IshKebab 1 hour agoparentprevI have yet to see a really good LaTeX CV. I guess it is possible but in my experience LaTeX just isn't designed for that and gives boring-looking results. reply semi-extrinsic 51 minutes agorootparentI agree that most LaTeX CVs are kind of boring. But I think they are more interesting than the end product in TFA, which I found completely underwhelming. Now I have spent quite a lot of time customizing LaTeX, to the point where people have come to ask how I produced certain documents, because it surely could not be LaTeX. If you have a specific design idea in your head, LaTeX is able to achieve it if you just spend enough time RTFMing. reply taeric 59 minutes agorootparentprevI have yet to see an impressive resume from someone that wasn't boring in layout. Worse, I have seen very few resumes that were not boring in looks that were attached to a good candidate. :( reply lucumo 9 hours agoprevAutomating your resume is a bit of a rite of passage for new software engineers. It just feels like a stupid repetitive task. I've found that I change job summaries so often, that automating it was a net negative in time spent on the thing. So now I just do the same as the digitally challenged: copy a Word file to \"resume (DATE).docx\" and change the contents as needed. My younger self would be surprised, and slightly annoyed, at how often I use the \"dumb\" solutions for problems. reply d3vmax 2 hours agoparentYea, no need of over-engineering. reply jefc1111 7 hours agoprevMine is also automated, but a lot more lightweight. I - like OP - use JSON Resume [1]. Besides that I just have a Github Action which creates a PDF and also updates a web-based version [2] hosted in AWS S3. My favourite thing about this setup is that if I want to make a small change I can just log in to Github and commit a quick edit in the repo [3] through Github's web-based UI A new PDF is generated and the web-based version being updates automatically.

I am a fan of seeing one page CVs. reply elbear 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah, it looks quite nice. reply Communitivity 6 hours agoprevCool project. That said, I never send the same resume to everyone. I tailor a resume for each job I apply to. This doesn't mean leaving off positions or lying. It does mean taking the work done in a position and giving it a slant toward the target job. For example, let's say I created a web app that shows a sales dashboard, with stats visualization, from raw daily sales data. Job 1 (applying for Front-End) - Created monthly sales dashboard web site using React, MaterialUI, SASS, Node, Riak, and D3. Dashboard provided grid-based summary over individual weeks, months, and years. It also provided configurable line graphs and pie charts for various sales metrics. Data pre-processing done with Sci-Kit. Later added sales prediction using Machine Learning. Job 2 (applying for Data Analysis) - Analyzed raw daily sales data to determine data cleansing needed, and created tool pipeline using Python NumPy, SciKit, and scikit-learn. Integrated pipeline into Riak data source ingest, and then built sales dashboard web site to visualize the data. Provided ML model for sales prediction built with scikit-learn, with XX parameters. Model achieved YY accuracy with only a ZZ mean error. Same work in both, but I highlight the tasks most relevant to the target job. Other thoughts are that Latex is a good way to get a well laid out PDF resume (PDF is not the web, you should have two versions of your resume), and I agree with other commenters - the final product needs more polish if it was actually going to be used to produce a resume to send in (I think it's fine as a proof of concept though). reply lelanthran 9 hours agoprevThe linked resume is a poor example of the process. It's neither visually pleasing nor is it more easily readable than other CVs that I have seen. It's fine for a CV to be visually ugly as long as its readable, or visually attractive in spite of being less readable. You can't fail at both dimensions. If you're really happy with a CV that looks and reads like this, save yourself all the effort and make a RTF document instead. reply pcrh 2 hours agoparentAgreed. It also has irrelevant fluff within the very first section, \"I'm passionate about delivering products....I strive to center compassion...\" etc. reply cm2187 9 hours agoprevI wish there was a standard format for resume that was universally used.

I am currently looking for jobs and went the 'career coaching' route for my CV. I did a few iterations with my coach until I got my current result (ideally I had a link): I first looked at Canva templates, but apparently nowadays you are supposed to do black/white and no fancy designs for ATS readability. Then I tried it with Google Docs b/w resumee template, which kinda got me to write actual skills. Then I approached the coach, got her template and iterated, and then I also added some rules from here (https://principiae.be/pdfs/ECV-1.01.pdf). I also involved ChatGPT to analyze job postings and to get the mix of keywords in my resumme right. Tools like https://tagcrowd.com/ also help with that. For example, I am targeting 'IT analyst' roles, and it does make sense that I have the word 'analysis' a few times in my CV. E: mine is basically structured the following way Name Title Summary 3x5 ATS keywords/skills specific to my profile and role last ten years, also written in a way that 'gamifies' ATS: 'Year, worked as ROLE at Company, did XYZ' --page 2-- Education (degree + grades) Skills Training Languages Some more IT skills (programming languages, project management, ...) E2: I obviously have no idea what I am doing, but I got three interview proposals for 10 applications, so I guess 30%. reply natertux 5 hours agoprevI had the same idea sometime ago. Not sure if you can say that it was over engineered or not but I used the following: * Frontend framework : Next.js / React (Functional components with React Hooks) * Rendering : Static Site Generation * Programming language : Typescript * CI/CD : Github actions * Unit test : jest * Design : SASS / Responsive design * Data validation : AJV / JSON Schema / Joi * Infrastructure : Cloudflare pages / Terraform * Package management: Yarn * Linting & Formatting : ESLint / StyleLint / Prettier * Pattern matching : ts-pattern * CSS framework : react-bootstrap * Monorepo : nx * PDF generation : jspdf * Contact form : web3forms * Captcha : hCaptcha I am quite happy with the final output : https://www.remikeat.com It would pull the data from https://data.remikeat.com/resume.en.json https://data.remikeat.com/resume.jp.json https://data.remikeat.com/resume.fr.json So I can just update the JSON and the webpage will update itself. Also as the PDF is generated locally, the PDF also get updated automatically. And I didn't know there was a JSON standard for resume. Maybe, I should migrate the format I designed to this open standard. Ultimately, I wanted to add a portfolio section, where I would show some of my projects like https://stackl.remikeat.com which is a stack language interpreter written in Ocaml and compiled to js with js_of_ocaml. reply BaculumMeumEst 7 hours agoprevThe only thing you should spend time on with your CV is the content. The ROI on tweaking the look and feel is very low. Aesthetics are not what people care about, unless your resume is so hideous that it gets thrown out. reply codetrotter 6 hours agoparentMy CV is a LibreOffice Writer document with no styling added. A “boring” short black and white non-interactive document that I export to PDF. It has my name, contact info, a list of recent work history, and mention of some of the technologies that I work with. Last time I was applying for jobs, two years ago, I got an interview and eventually a job offer from the company I most wanted to work for among the ones I’d been submitting applications to.

At least when applying to the kind of jobs that I prefer – backend software engineering work. reply lbrito 3 hours agorootparentSame. LibreOffice exported to PDF.

I've found that splitting data and representation is not as feasible as it sounds. You add a job and suddenly your CV doesn't fit on a page anymore, and cutting details from previous jobs isn't enough. So you change the layout, ever so slightly, because the data changed. And version control? Nice for building, but it's not like you'll ever go back in time anyway.

I noticed the container they run uses nix too, which is nice although I don't care about it as long as it works. I could add signing of the pdf maybe some day for fun. What's great with this approach is how little hassle there is and nothing to install, nowhere, and produces the same clean resume I've used for over a decade (but needed to install a thousand things I could never remember from one computer to another). reply Scubabear68 6 hours agoprevThe blog set me up for a really gorgeous typeset resume with lines in the intro like “More visual flair and typesetting control”.

The nice thing about this set up was that if a recruiter called me while I was out and wanted a CV quickly with a couple of tweaks made I could just do it on my note taking app and email an updated PDF in a few seconds. In theory I could easily change the style of the CV but in practice I haven't felt the need to touch it in years. reply elAhmo 8 hours agoprevIt is definitely overengineered and, unfortunately, outdated, as the most recent position in the resume and about page do not match. A lot of effort for something that is not accurate and obviously not used to apply for jobs, which is the purpose of a resume in most cases.

It uses LaTeX with a CD pipeline and I think it's is a good way to do resumes. Every time I push mine, the one linked on my personal website is updated to the new version. The diffing and version pinning is nice. Throughout intern application season I usually make updates to my resume and it's nice to be able to easily go back to the version of the resume that I applied with whenever I get a callback from a company.

Using git for collaboration it is really nice: https://github.com/nickorlow/cs-331-cheatsheet I do like the concept in the article of separating the data from the presentation. reply Xcelerate 7 hours agoprevI think the presentation of a resume is much less important than the content. It’s interesting that sourcers and recruiters make most of the decisions about who gets to the interview stage (particularly in a down market), yet they are the least qualified to assess the capabilities of the candidate of everyone in the whole process. Despite that, their assessment of a candidate’s resume has an outsized influence on the candidate’s outcome. When you have 1,000 resumes from laid off software engineers from FANG companies that all look mostly the same, how do you decide who to call? I’ve been thinking lately that an interesting project might be to look for publicly available resumes of people who have recently accepted new jobs within the tech industry and compare their resumes against those of people who have been looking for a new job for a while. The comparison would be qualitative if only a few resumes are available or perhaps quantitative (i.e., a classification model) if many are available. Recruiters are not looking for the same signals as hiring managers, and since I’m not a recruiter, I would really like to know exactly what it is that they are looking for. As an example of this kind of discrepancy that caught me totally off-guard, I was slightly below the “years of experience” requirement on a particular job posting that seemed to match my background perfectly. The recruiter I was talking to had reached out about another job posting where I did meet the YoE requirement, but I said the other posting was a significantly better fit for my skills and experience. The recruiter replied that the YoE requirement was not negotiable, so I was put onto the interview loop for the much less applicable role because of this arbitrary and narrowly missed line in the sand (and of course I failed that interview, wasting both my time and theirs). A hiring manager would care less about years in seat and more about capability. That such a YoE requirement might be used as a hard filter when scanning resumes caught me by surprise—I had previously sent out plenty of resumes where I narrowly missed the YoE requirement, and in retrospect, my application was probably discarded immediately while using up the “quota” of how many times I could apply to that company. These sorts of insights from the recruiting world would be great to know in advance from the candidate’s perspective. reply Terretta 7 hours agoparentUnfortunately you either (a) need to craft your resume to work for all types of recruiters and all types of hiring managers*, or (b) carefully pick the type of firm and hiring managers and recruiting team you want to work with, then tailor the CV to appeal to them and get rejected by organizations that would annoy you. The choice depends on your “need” for the next job. * Examples of opposites in resume-reading personas: Many roles open vs. single role open. In-house versus outsourced recruiting.

The final product here is BAD. The person reading the resume doesn't know it's automated so no credit points for that, and it looks like a person didn't pay attention to basic detail. This does you no good, it hurts you. Example glitches: The contact row dropping LinkedIn to next line. The ragged bullets hanging to the left of the left margin relative to headlines. The dates not right aligned. The too-large font making it take ALL of two pages for just a decade. These things do get judged at a glance when someone's looking at lots of PDFs. Also, just because a resume goes into an ATS doesn't mean the hiring manager isn't looking at the original PDF. Usually the ATS surfaces/sorts applicants but one reads the original PDF or Word doc anyway, because the ATS interpretation is often unreliable on its own. All that said... One idea to counter the above advice is either in italics under the contact line or in a clear footer, put a colophon or imprint saying: This PDF was auto-generated from my job history data, blogged about the automation here: https://full.web.link/resume-blog-post But still, exhibit a higher bar for the end product.

    "originBody": "Qualcomm’s Oryon Core: A Long Time in the Making July 9, 2024 Cheese, clamchowder 11 Comments In 2019, a startup called Nuvia came out of stealth mode. Nuvia was notable because its leadership included several notable chip architects, including one who used to work for Apple. Apple chips like the M1 drew recognition for landing in the same performance neighborhood as AMD and Intel’s offerings while offering better power efficiency. Nuvia had similar goals, aiming to create a power efficient core that could could surpass designs from AMD, Apple, Arm, and Intel. Qualcomm acquired Nuvia in 2021, bringing its staff into Qualcomm’s internal CPU efforts. Bringing on Nuvia staff rejuvenated Qualcomm’s internal CPU efforts, which led to the Oryon core in Snapdragon X Elite. Oryon arrives nearly five years after Nuvia hit the news, and almost eight years after Qualcomm last released a smartphone SoC with internally designed cores. For people following Nuvia’s developments, it has been a long wait. Now, thanks to the wonderful folks who donate to our Patreon members and Paypal donators, we have a Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge 16 inch Laptop equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon X1E-80-100 CPU in our possession. Note, because there has not been any upstreamed Device Tree for this laptop, we were not able to get a Linux desktop installed on it so a lot of our testing had to be done on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). System Architecture The Snapdragon X1E-80-10 implements 12 Oryon cores in three quad-core clusters, each with a 12 MB L2 cache. Like Kryo in the Snapdragon 820, Qualcomm opted against a hybrid core configuration. Instead, Snapdragon X Elite’s Oryon CPU clusters run at different maximum clocks to offer a combination of good single threaded and multithreaded performance. Snapdragon X Elite’s clustered arrangement is clearly visible from a core to core latency test, which bounces cachelines between core pairs and measures how long that takes. Transfers within a core are handled reasonably quickly, but cross-cluster transfers incur high latency especially for a monolithic chip with consumer core counts. Latencies are less consistent compared to Qualcomm’s prior attempt at making a laptop chip. The 8cx Gen 3 has four Cortex X1 cores and four Cortex A78 cores. It likely uses Arm’s DSU interconnect, which also implements a shared L3 cache. Nuvia’s co-founder used to work for Apple, making M1 is a notable comparison point. Apple also uses quad core clusters with a shared L2. However, M1 uses a hybrid core arrangement. Core to core latency is similar within a cluster. Cross-cluster transfers incur high latency much like on Snapdragon X Elite, though absolute values are a bit better. Run under Asahi Linux, on a Macbook Air owned by dgb. Mac OS does not have system calls for setting thread affinity Both Snapdragon X Elite and M1 have a System Level Cache (SLC) that can service multiple blocks on the chip, at the expense of lower performance than a cache dedicated to one block. Snapdragon X Elite’s main competitors will be AMD’s Phoenix and Intel’s Meteor Lake. AMD’s Phoenix SoC has eight Zen 4 cores with 16 MB of L3. All eight of Phoenix’s cores are placed in the same cluster, so a core to core latency test is pretty boring to look at. Latencies are very low overall. However, it’s worth noting that AMD’s cross-cluster latencies on 16 core desktop Zen 4 variants is still better than Snapdragon X Elite or M1’s, at 80-90 ns. Intel’s Meteor Lake has a complex hybrid setup with six Redwood Cove performance cores, eight Crestmont efficiency cores, and two Crestmont low power cores. The Redwood Cove and regular Cresmont cores share a 24 MB L3, while the low power Crestmont cluster makes do with a 2 MB L2 as its last level cache. Core to core latencies are low as long as we stay within Meteor Lake’s CPU tile, but crossing over to the low power E-Core cluster takes much longer. Clock Behavior CPUs conserve power by reducing clocks when idle. Transitioning from idle to a high performance state takes time. On battery power, the Snapdragon X Elite doesn’t reach maximum clock speeds until over 110 ms after load is applied. This is almost certainly a deliberate policy on Samsung’s part to extend battery life by avoiding high power states during short bursts of activity. Intel’s Meteor Lake takes that strategy to the extreme, and does not reach maximum boost clocks on battery. AMD has a very fast boost policy on both wall and battery power, reaching 5 GHz in a millisecond or less. On wall power, Samsung has opted not to let the CPU idle. This allows for better responsiveness because the cores start out at 3.4 GHz, and can reach 4 GHz in 1.44 milliseconds. However, it makes the laptop noticeably warm even at idle, a trait not shared by Meteor Lake or Phoenix. Core Overview Qualcomm’s Oryon is an 8-wide core with very high reordering capacity. True to its lineage, Oryon inherits philosophies from both Apple’s Firestorm and Qualcomm’s own much older Kryo. But unlike Kryo and M1, Oryon can run at 4 GHz and beyond. The top end Snapdragon X Elite SKU can reach 4.3 GHz on two cores. The X1E-80-100 we tested here can reach 4 GHz. Oryon Block Diagram Zen 4 still has a clock speed advantage, but the gap isn’t as big with mobile. Next to Oryon, Zen 4’s architecture looks tiny. It’s only 6-wide and has smaller out-of-order buffers. However, Zen 4 can run at higher clock speeds. The Ryzen 7840HS can reach 5.1 GHz in the HP ZBook Firefly 14 G10 A. Zen 4 Block Diagram Qualcomm states that Oryon has a 13 cycle misprediction penalty, which is the same as the common case for Zen 4. Branch Predictor The branch predictor is one of the best ways to get more performance per joule of energy spent. Modern CPUs therefore invest heavily in branch prediction. As core width and reordering capacity increase, an accurate branch predictor gets even more important because a mispredict tends to cause more wasted work. Direction Prediction The direction predictor does exactly as it sounds, it tells the branch predictor what direction the branch is likely to go. Oryon appears to have a single level direction predictor much like Golden Cove. Oryon’s direction predictor Oryon Branch Prediction Unit direction predictor does well against Golden Cove but does struggle against Zen 4. Oryon Direction Predictor Zen 4 Direction Predictor Branch Target Caching A branch predictor’s job can be simplified to telling the frontend what address it should fetch from next. Part of that involves determining whether a branch is taken. If it is, the predictor needs to tell the frontend where that branch goes with minimal delay. Branch Target Buffers (BTBs) cache branch destination addresses to speed that process up. Like any cache, different BTB implementations have varying performance characteristics. Modern CPUs often have multi-level BTBs too to get a balance between speed and ability to cope with large branch footprints. Oryon appears to tie its BTB to the instruction cache, as taken branches see higher latency as the test loop spills out of the instruction cache. Branches contained within a 8 KB footprint can be handled with single cycle latency, something AMD calls “zero bubble” branching. Applications with a larger branch footprint can do one taken branch every three cycles, as long as code fits in the 192 KB L1 instruction cache. Qualcomm could have a branch address calculator placed early in the decode pipeline. With that interpretation, Oryon would have a 8 KB L0 instruction cache with single cycle latency. The 192 KB L1i would have 3 cycle latency. Oryon’s BTB setup has parallels to Kryo’s, as both cores enjoy fast branching as long as the test fits within 8 KB. It also shares traits with M1, which also sees taken branch latency increase as the test exceeds certain code footprint sizes. M1 however only gets single cycle branching within 4 KB. AMD’s Zen 4, as well as Arm Ltd and Intel cores for that matter, decouple their branch target caching from the instruction cache. Clam’s BTB test sees higher latency once branches exceed certain counts, with branch spacing being less of a factor. Indirect Branch Prediction Indirect branches can go to more than one target, adding another degree of difficulty to prediction. Oryon appears to have a 2048 entry indirect branch predictor. Oryon’s indirect predictor isn’t as big as Zen 4’s 3072 entry indirect branch predictor and can’t track as many targets. But unlike Zen 4, there is no slowly increasing penalty after 32 targets for a single branch. This likely means that Oryon doesn’t use a similar mechanism to Zen 4. Now comparing Oryon to Golden Cove and they are very similar to each other but Oryon can track more targets than Golden Cove can. Returns are a special case of indirect branches. Oryon has a deep 48 entry return stack. Zen 4 for comparison has a 32 entry return stack. Both are quite deep, and likely enough to handle the vast majority of code. Qualcomm’s strategy mirrors that of Apple M1’s Firestorm architecture, which apparently has a 50 entry return stack. When return stack capacity is exceeded, Oryon sees a sharp increase in call+return time. 4-5 ns would be 15-18 cycles at 3.7 GHz, which is high enough to be a branch mispredict. That’s similar to what Dougall discovered on Apple’s M1 too, and suggests the core clears the return stack when it overflows instead of implementing a mechanism to more gracefully handle that case. Fetch and Decode Next, the frontend has to fetch instructions from memory and decode them into micro-ops. Oryon and Apple’s Firestorm cores use a very similar strategy. Both have a huge 192 KB L1 instruction cache feeding a 8-wide decoder. AMD’s Zen 4 enjoys high instruction bandwidth for small instruction footprints, but sustained bandwidth is restricted by Zen 4’s 6-wide rename stage downstream. Compared to Oryon and Firestorm, Zen 4c’s small 32 KB instruction cache is a distinct disadvantage. Credit to Dougall for contributing the M1 Max test result. Zen 4 is capped at 6 micro-ops per cycle. Throughput from the micro-op cache is higher in this simple test because Zen 4 fuses adjacent NOPs into a single micro-op However, AMD maintains high frontend bandwidth for very large code footprints, as it can sustain more than 12 bytes per cycle even when pulling code from L3. Oryon and M1 have much lower code fetch bandwidth after a L1i miss. Rename/Allocate Micro-ops from the frontend need to have backend resources allocated to track them during out-of-order execution. That process involves register renaming to break false write-after-write dependencies. The renamer can break other dependencies as well by creatively allocating backend resources. For example, an instruction that moves values between registers can be eliminated by having its “result” point to the source register. Instructions known to set a register to zero can similarly be optimized.Oryon IPC Zen 4 IPC Redwood Cove IPC Independent MOVs 7.4 5.73 4.77 Dependent MOVs 1.18 5.71 5.25 XOR/EOR r, r 1 5.73 4.05 MOV r, 0 5.32 3.77 4.97 Oryon has move elimination, though it’s not as robust as Intel or AMD’s implementation for chained dependent MOVs. There’s no zeroing idiom recognition for XOR-ing a register with itself, or subtracting a register from itself. Moving an immediate value of zero to a register works of course for breaking dependencies. However, throughput for that doesn’t exceed 6 IPC and suggests Oryon still uses an ALU pipe to write zero to a register. Out of Order Execution Oryon features a massive out-of-order execution engine to hide latency and extract instruction level parallelism. Its reorder buffer, which helps commit instruction results in program order, is massive with 680 entries. Both the integer and floating point register files have 384 entries available for speculative results. Add another 32 entries for known-good architectural register values, and that comes out to 416 total entries. Memory ordering queues are more conservatively sized. The load and store queues have 192 and 56 entries respectively. While the load queue has comparable capacity to Redwood Cove’s and is appropriately sized to cover the reorder buffer, the store queue feels a bit small. It’s strange to see Structure Applies to instructions that… Oryon Zen 4 Redwood Cove Reorder Buffer (ROB) Exist 680 entry 320 entry 512 entry Integer register file Write to a 64-bit scalar integer register 416 entry 224 entry 288 entry FP/vector register file Write to a FP/vector register 416 entry 192 entry 320 entry Load queue Read from memory 192 entry 136 entry 192 entry (measured) 240 entry (SPR slides) Store queue Write to memory 56 entry 64 entry 112 entry Where Oryon really excels is scheduling capacity. Schedulers are expensive structures because every cycle, they have to check all their entries for micro-ops that are ready to execute. And, they have to see if results coming from freshly completed micro-ops make any pending micro-ops ready. Doing all those checks and comparisons can make schedulers area and power hungry. Qualcomm has likely kept costs down by associating each scheduling queue with one execution port, ensuring each scheduler only has to select one micro-op per cycle. Firestorm scheduler arrangement from https://dougallj.github.io/applecpu/firestorm.html Oryon can bring an incredible 120 scheduler entries to bear for basic integer operations alone. It’s just short of Firestorm’s 134 entries, and far higher than Zen 4’s 96 entries. The gap between Oryon and Zen 4 is even wider because Zen 4’s ALU scheduling entries are shared with memory access operations. Intel’s Redwood Cove has 97 scheduling entries shared by integer and FP/vector operations. On the FP/vector side, Oryon similarly has massive scheduling capacity. Arm CPUs traditionally featured weak vector execution, since handing throughput bound workloads would be difficult in a smartphone or tablet power budget. x86 applications however have different expectations, and users expect to carry out intensive tasks locally instead of sending them to be processed on a remote server. Oryon tackles this by feeding four 128-bit execution ports with a total of 192 scheduler entries. All four pipes can handle basic floating point and vector integer operations. In that respect Oryon is very similar to Firestorm, though the two cores differ in how they handle less common operations. Firestorm also stands apart in using smaller (though still large in an absolute sense) schedulers, and compensating for that with a non-scheduling queue that can delay a stall at the rename stage. AMD again has the lowest scheduling capacity, instead using a huge non-scheduling queue to prevent full schedulers from causing stalls further up the pipeline. Still, Zen 4’s buffering capacity for incomplete FP/vector operations falls far short of Oryon. However, AVX(2) and AVX-512 can still give Zen 4 an edge, because wide vector operations do more work with a single micro-op. Intel’s Redwood Cove similarly stands to benefit from wider vectors, though Meteor Lake’s hybrid core setup prevents it from supporting AVX-512. Oryon’s FP/vector side feels like it’s about as strong as any NEOSIMD setup can reasonably be. Without SVE support, Oryon can’t use vectors wider than 128-bits. Supporting FMA ops on all four pipes gives it similar floating point throughput to Zen 4, but and potentially gives Oryon an advantage with code that doesn’t use vectors wider than 128 bits. But feeding that setup requires 12 FP register file ports, because each FMA needs three inputs. Pulling that off with a 416 entry register file sounds expensive. Firestorm scheduler arrangement again from Dougall Oryon has less scheduling capacity for address generation ops compared to math ones, but four 16 entry schedulers are nothing to sneeze at. Together, those schedulers can hold more micro-ops than Firestorm’s AGU scheduling and non-scheduling queues combined. Zen 4 can theoretically keep 72 incomplete address generation operations in flight, but those entries are shared with integer math operations. Address Translation On any modern CPU, programs operate on virtual addresses that get translated on-the-fly to physical addresses. Address translation caches, called Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs), help accelerate this by caching frequently used translations. Oryon features very large TLBs, helping reduce address translation latency. Oryon’s first level data TLB has 224 entries and is 7 way set associative, providing 896 KB of coverage with 4K pages. That’s a lot of capacity compared to first level TLBs on AMD and Intel CPUs. It’s reminiscent of Kryo’s 192 entry L1 DTLB, which similarly provided fast address translation coverage over a relatively large address space. And, it’s refreshing to see next to AMD, Intel, and Arm’s small L1 DTLBs. Level Oryon Zen 4 Apple Firestorm L1 DTLB 224 entry 7-way 72 entry fully associative 160 entry L2 TLB 8K+ entry 8-way 7 cycle latency 3072 entry 24-way 7-8 cycle latency 3072 entry But unlike Kryo, which dropped L1 TLB misses on the floor, Oryon has a large second level TLB with over 8K entries. Getting a translation from the L2 TLB appears to take 7 extra cycles, which is good especially considering Oryon’s 4 GHz+ clocks and the size of the L2 TLB. With 2 MB pages, each TLB entry can cover 2 MB of address space, minimizing address translation overhead. 4K pages are usually used for typical applications Measurements return confusing results though, showing an increase in address translation penalties past 6 MB. That would correspond to 1536 L2 TLB entries, which is far short of the 12 MB that Zen 4’s L2 TLB would cover. Testing sizes past 128 MB shows another increase, but that doesn’t correspond to 8K entries * 4K pages = 32 MB. Cache and Memory Access Oryon uses an Apple-like caching strategy. A large 96 KB L1 and relatively fast L2 with 20 cycles of latency together mean Oryon doesn’t need a mid-level cache. Firestorm has a bigger 128 KB L1, but Oryon’s L1 is still much larger than the 32 or 48 KB L1 caches in Zen 4 or Redwood Cove. AMD has a 1 MB L2 mid-level cache private to each core, then a 16 MB L3. That setup makes it easier to increase caching capacity, because the L2 cache can insulate the core from L3 latency. However, that advantage is minimal for mobile Zen 4 parts, which max out at 16 MB of L3. Oryon therefore provides competitive latency especially as accesses spill out of Zen 4’s L2. Meteor Lake follows a similar caching strategy to Zen 4, but has more caching capacity at the expense of higher latency. After L2, Oryon has a 6 MB System Level Cache (SLC) with a claimed latency of 26-29 ns. Test sizes between 12 and 18 MB generally align with that. For example, latency at 14 MB was approximately 25 ns using 2 MB pages. Accurately assessing SLC latency is difficult because many accesses within even a 18 MB array will result in L2 hits. The SLC’s low capacity compared to the L2 cache will likely limit its relevance for CPU-side code. DRAM latency is 110.9 ns with a 1 GB array, which isn’t far off Qualcomm’s claimed 102-104 ns. The Ryzen 7840HS achieves somewhat lower latency at 103.3 ns, likely because it uses DDR5 memory instead of LPDDR5X. Meteor Lake’s memory latency is worse at over 140 ns. Bandwidth x86 CPUs traditionally had a strong focus on vector execution, and have plenty of cache bandwidth to support their vector units. Oryon competes surprisingly well in this area. There’s no SVE support, but Oryon takes 128-bit vector widths about as far as they’ll reasonably go with support for four 128-bit loads per cycle. That’s a match for Zen 4’s 2×256-bit load bandwidth, though a bit behind Redwood Cove’s 3×256-bit load capability. Oryon’s large L1 cache capacity should let it hold up well for smaller data footprints, but AMD and Intel’s mid-level caches provide a bandwidth advantage if data spills out of L1. AMD’s L3 also does a good job, providing more bandwidth to a single core than Qualcomm’s L2. Apple’s Firestorm doesn’t emphasize vector workloads and is outpaced by other cores in this comparison. When reading from DRAM, a single Oryon core can achieve an incredible 80 GB/s of bandwidth. Qualcomm says each core can have over 50 in-flight requests to the system, and a L2 instance can track over 220 memory transactions. Those large queues are likely why a single Oryon core can pull so much bandwidth from DRAM. Shared caches get put under more pressure under multithreaded loads, as more cores ask for bandwidth. Oryon handles this well, with the L2 providing nearly 330 GB/s of bandwidth to four cores. That’s about 82 GB/s per core, and just a bit lower than the 100 GB/s an Oryon core can get without contention. Again, AMD and Intel enjoy lots of bandwidth from their core-private L2 caches, and AMD’s L3 continues to shine for larger data footprints. Intel’s Redwood Cove P-Cores have very high cache bandwidth, but that advantage falls off once data spills out into L3. For all-core workloads, Oryon trades blows with Phoenix depending on which level of the memory hierarchy we hit. L1 cache bandwidth is comparable, with AMD’s eight Zen 4 cores clocking higher to take a slight lead. AMD enjoys about 25% higher L2 bandwidth across all cores. Intel’s Meteor Lake generally has a bandwidth lead thanks to a combination of high core count and Redwood Cove’s 3×256-bit per cycle load capability. However, the lead is less significant when all threads are loaded because of clock speed drops and lower bandwidth E-Cores coming into play. As test sizes exceed AMD’s L2 capacity, Qualcomm’s three L2 instances can provide 16% more bandwidth than AMD’s L3. Snapdragon X Elite has three 12 MB L2 instances for 36 MB of total capacity. Using three L3 instances makes it easier to provide high bandwidth too. Finally, Qualcomm has much higher DRAM bandwidth thanks to fast LPDDR5X. With over 110 GB/s of measured read bandwidth, the Snapdragon X Elite is comfortably ahead of both Phoenix and Meteor Lake. Cinebench 2024 Maxon’s Cinebench has been a benchmarking staple for years because it’s able to scale with core count. Modern CPUs have a lot of cores, but delivering high multithreaded performance in a limited power budget is very difficult. Cinebench 2024 has a native ARM64 build, so the Snapdragon X Elite will be free from binary translation penalties. Qualcomm does very well. SMT helps AMD by giving each Zen 4 core explicit parallelism to work with. However, that’s not enough to counter the Snapdragon X Elite’s higher core count. The Snapdragon X Elite has 12 cores to AMD’s eight, and comes away with a 8.4% performance lead while drawing just 2% more power. From another perspective though, each Zen 4 core punches above its weight. Qualcomm is bringing 50% more cores to the table, and bigger cores too. Snapdragon X Elite should be crushing the competition on paper, but thermal and power restrictions prevent it from pulling away. Demo Config A has a 80W “Device TDP”, whatever that’s supposed to mean Qualcomm’s slides suggest a higher power reference device can indeed achieve such results. Higher core counts need more power and better cooling to shine. We don’t know what clock speeds Qualcomm’s higher power reference device was able to sustain. In the Samsung Book Edge4, the Snapdragon X Elite averaged 2.71 GHz. In the HP ZBook Firefly G10 A, the Ryzen 7840HS averaged 3.75 GHz, explaining how AMD’s able to get so close with fewer cores. Intel’s Meteor Lake has an even higher core count but fails to impress at similar platform power. It’s only slightly faster than Apple’s M2. In the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED, the Core Ultra 7 155H’s Redwood Cove P-Cores averaged 2.75 GHz. The Crestmont E-Cores averaged 2.33 GHz. One of the six P-Cores and the two LPE-Cores didn’t see significant load during the Cinebench 2024 run. Final Words Oryon combines design philosophies from both Firestorm and the company’s much older Kryo. The result is a very solid architecture, because Qualcomm took care to bring forward the best of those worlds. Qualcomm has wanted to move beyond smartphones and take a chunk of the laptop market for a long time, and Snapdragon X Elite is the strongest shot the company has taken yet. On paper, 12 big Oryon cores should be a formidable opponent for both AMD’s eight Zen 4 cores and Meteor Lake’s 16 cores of various types. We’ll leave detailed benchmarking to mainstream tech sites, since they can do so in a more controlled environment and have the budget to provide more comparison points. But at a glance, Snapdragon X Elite provides competitive performance when running native applications. Even with binary translation, Oryon is fast enough to provide usable performance. With that in mind, Oryon has fulfilled two of the conditions that drove Apple Firestorm’s 2020 success. From Qualcomm’s 2023 Snapdragon Summit But Snapdragon X Elite has a steeper hill to climb than Apple’s M1. Where Apple Silicon was the only upgrade option within the Apple ecosystem, PC customers have up-to-date AMD and Intel options to choose from. The PC ecosystem owes its popularity and staying power to a tradition of excellent software compatibility. Oryon relies on binary translation to execute x86 code, which comes with a performance penalty. Compatibility expectations extend to the operating system too. PC users expect to be able to (re)install an operating system of their choice. Generally a stock Linux or Windows image will boot on x86 CPUs going back several generations, regardless of device or motherboard manufacturer. Arm devices suffer from severe platform fragmentation, and Snapdragon X Elite is no exception. OS images have to be customized for each laptop, even ones that use the same Oryon cores. Qualcomm slide from their 2023 Snapdragon Summit Finally, Snapdragon X Elite devices are too expensive. Phoenix and Meteor Lake laptops often cost less, even when equipped with more RAM and larger SSDs. Convincing consumers to pay more for lower specifications is already a tough sell. Compatibility issues make it even tougher. Qualcomm needs to work with OEMs to deliver competitive prices. Lower prices will encourage skeptical consumers to try Snapdragon X Elite, getting more devices into circulation. That in turn leads to more developers with ARM64 Windows devices and more ARM64 native applications. Qualcomm has their work cut out for them. We look forward to their next generation of CPU cores, and hope it’ll be strong enough to keep pace with AMD and Intel’s next generation products.

I don’t understand where this idea that Apple has lost most of their chip design talent and is in trouble rhetoric is coming from. Apple still makes the world’s most advanced and efficient consumer chips, years after the M1. reply Rinzler89 3 hours agoparent>The M4 is the highest single core CPU in the world and it’s in a ridiculously thin tablet That's kind of the problem. The world's most powerful CPU is put in the world's most expensive and thinnest Netflix machine lol. Was the previous \"thicker\" M3 iPad holding anyone back? All that power and I can't use it to compile the Linux kernel, I can't use it to play the latest Steam/GOG games, or run CAD simulations, because it needs to be behind the restrictive iPad OS AppStore walled garden where only code blessed by Apple can run. Until it's put in a machine that can run Linux, it's more of a benchmarking flex than actually increasing productivity compared to previous M generations or the ARM/X86 competition that allows you to run any OS. reply dagmx 3 hours agorootparentThat’s a very narrow definition of “useful” and one I’d say is rather focused on yourself? Why is Linux the arbiter of what is “useful”? Why would it still be a benchmark flex if it was on macOS, an Os where millions of people do professional work everyday? And why is the iPad just a “Netflix machine” when tons of people use the iPad for professional creative use cases as well? reply thebeardisred 1 hour agorootparentI'll attempt the best interpretation of the comment. Installing Linux would allow for general purpose use of the device (in a freedom sense). This increases the \"utility\" of the device and lowers the bar for extending its functionality. reply zitterbewegung 0 minutes agorootparentYou can run iSH on the device for Linux (somewhat limited). It’s on the App Store https://github.com/ish-app/ish Rinzler89 1 hour agorootparentprev>And why is the iPad just a “Netflix machine” when tons of people use the iPad for professional creative use cases as well? I never said people can't use iPads for profesional applications, I was asking what professional tasks are people doing with the iPad that necessitated the M4 to be in that closed platform vs the M3 or M2, instead of being put in a more open one like the Mac where it can be put to better use at more generic compute tasks similar to what X86 and Nvidia chips are used for, instead of being stuck in a very restricted platform mostly targeted towards content consumption. And so far nobody has provided an answer to that question. All the answers are either repeating Apple's marketing or vague ones like \"you can use the iPad for professional applications too you know, it's not just a Netflix machine\". OK, but what exactly are those professional iPad applications that mandate the M4 being in the iPad instead of the Mac? I'm bringing this up, because commenters bring up the M4 as the holy grail of chips in discussions about the latest X86 and Qualcomm chips, so if you compare a chip that can currently only run AppStore apps vs chips that can run most SW ever then we're comparing Apples and Oranges. reply dagmx 1 hour agorootparentNo, people have provided answers. One of those people is me. You just don't like them because you seem to have a problem imaging other people have differing uses than your own. Edit: this person keeps ignoring any responses that don’t align with their world view and acting like they don’t exist. When challenged they have called multiple people names instead. I’m not responding to them further to prevent dragging this out further. reply Rinzler89 1 hour agorootparentSorry but your answer didn't actually answer what I asked for though. Which is fine, just don't claim you did and then switch to gaslighting me that \"I just don't like your answer\". Please keep a mature attitude and not act like a toddler. And it's not just \"my use case\" that I'm referring to since I don't do any of those, it's generic use cases that I'm talking about in examples, since X86/Qualcomm are also generic chips being used for a shit tonne of use cases and not restricted to certain AppStores like the M4 is in the iPad, so if you bring M4 in comparison with those generic chips then you'd better provide argument on how they're comparable given the current SW platform restrictions, and so far you haven't. reply gjsman-1000 1 hour agorootparentprev> And why is the iPad just a “Netflix machine” when tons of people use the iPad for professional creative use cases as well? For my family, the iPhone and other Apple devices are the ultimate productivity machines. The App Store, fantastic. Why? Because they are (rightly) terrified of installing apps on Windows. Or any “computer.” They’ve been burned too many times, warned too many times. Unless it’s Microsoft Office, it doesn’t happen. “Programs” are a threat. But apps? Apps don’t hurt you. iPhones and iPads turn on every day when you want them to, they act predictably, it feels consistent in a way a laptop is not. As for the speed of the chip only being useful for “consumption” - technology advances.

Sorry, I've been around for too long to believe this. :) No matter how big of a milestone, a jump in performance anything ever brought, it never stopped software from eventually using up all the resources available. Just another layer of abstraction, just another framework, just another useless ui gimmick and you'll see that the M4 isn't immune to this either. reply Rinzler89 1 hour agorootparentprevnext [4 more] [flagged] dagmx 1 hour agorootparentWhy are you allowed to have an opinion that trivializes how others work, but when other people do, then its astro-turfing? reply Rinzler89 59 minutes agorootparentHow are \"programs evil\" and \"apps good\"? Without any convincing arguments to back up such claims, they do read like astro-turfing and just regurgitating Tim Cook's keynote speeches. This board is called Hacker News last time I checked, no? reply datameta 13 minutes agorootparentI believe the point that was being made is that the perception, on average, is that iOS apps are carefully manicured and will not require troubleshooting by the typical user, as opposed to windows programs. There have been enough instances where this is true that for a certain slice of the population it is globally true. There is a different expectation of debugging from a consumer not versed in technology from those of us who work with/on it every day. reply runjake 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's not just a benchmark flex. I have been using Linux since 1992, for many or most of those years on both desktop and server. I am currently more productive while on an Apple Silicon Mac. I would venture to guess that for most people, they would be more productive on a Mac or an iPad versus Linux. Pedantry: To my knowledge, there was no M3 iPad. reply Rinzler89 2 hours agorootparentThe question from me was whether the M4 makes iPad users more productive vs the M3 iPad or whatever the last chip was, not if the iPad itself make you more productive than Linux or window s. And since people keep bringing up the M4 as the yardstick in discussions on generic X86 and Qualcomm chips, then my productivity metric for comparison was also meant in a global generic way, as in the general purpose compute chips like x86 and Nvidia have unlocked new innovations and improvements to our lives over decades being able to run code from specialty aerospace, CAD, earthquake prediction, to protein folding for vaccines and medical use because you could run anything on those chips from YouTube to Fortnite to mainframes and supercomputers. What similar improvements to humanity does the M4 iPad bring when it can only run apps off the AppStore compared to M3, most used iPAd apps being YouTube and Netflix? As long as the most cutting edge MX chips are restricted to running only Apple approved AppStore apps because Apple is addicted to the 30% AppStore tax that they can't charge on their laptops running MacOS/Linux with the same chips, then they're relatively useless chips for humanity in the grand scheme of things in comparisons with X86 and Arm who make the world go round, power research and innovation because they can run anything you can think of despite scoring a bit lower benchmarks. reply runjake 1 hour agorootparent> The question was whether the M4 makes you more productive on the iPad vs the M3 iPad or whatever the last chip was This same question applies to any other computing platform upgrade. So far, the hardware for most common platforms far out-scales the majority of use cases. Nonetheless, tech must and is advancing, regardless. Every platform is releasing newer and faster versions, and only a tiny fraction will make use of that power year over year. As to the rest of your comment, I see what you're saying, but those are your opinions. However, the vast majority of the user base would probably disagree with you, because they are not technical people. They are productive on these closed platforms. they have different workflows than you or I. I'm not very productive on these platforms. These are consumption devices for me. I need things like a development toolchain and a command-line interface to be productive. By and large, non-technical people are Apple's target audience, not technical people. In raw numbers, these people outnumber technical people by an order of magnitude. This dinosaur (me) recognizes that what constitutes a computer has evolved and shifted away from what I think of as a computer. And this shift will further continue. reply qwytw 1 hour agorootparent> This same question applies to any other computing platform upgrade Hardly. Or rather to a much lesser extent, at least pro/power users benefit a lot more from performance improvements on open general purpose platforms.. since well.. you can actually do stuff on them. What (performance sensitive) use cases does the iPad even have? I guess video/image editing to an extent but pretty much all of those apps on iOS are severely crippled and there are other limitations (storage and extremely low memory capacity). reply Rinzler89 1 hour agorootparentprev>They are productive on these closed platforms. I never said otherwise, I asked what's the point of commenters bringing up the M4 performance in comparisons with X86/Qualcomm when due to the open vs closed nature of the platforms they're not directly comparable because the M4 is much more restricted in the iPad vs the other chips. That's like comparing a Ferrari to a van saying how much faster Ferraris are. Sure, a Fierari will always be faster than a van, but you can do a lot more things with a van than with a faster Ferrari, and just like M4 iPad Pros, Ferraris are lot less relevant to the function of society than vans which deliver your food, medicine, kids to school, etc. Is the M4 good for you and an improvement for your own workflow? Good for you, just don't compare it to X86 until it can run the same app as those chips. Like you said, it's mostly a consumption device, and as such, the M4 is mostly wasted in that, until they bring it into a device with a more open OS that can run the same SW as the other X86/ARM platforms, which Apple delays intentionally because they're trying to nudge users off the open Mac platform towards the closed iPads OS platform for that sweet 30% AppStore cut they can't get on their devices running MacOS/Linux. reply pantalaimon 2 hours agorootparentprev> The world's most powerful CPU maybe the most powerful / watt - desktop CPUs like the 9950X are still way more powerful. reply qwytw 1 hour agorootparentM4 still has a 10% higher Geekbench single core score than the 9950X. reply jjtheblunt 1 hour agorootparentprevby what metric? reply 0x457 41 minutes agorootparentAmount of exposed PCI-E lines, I guess. reply sitkack 2 hours agorootparentprevI run Linux in a VM on my M1 mac all day long.

In what respect, the performance? reply seabrookmx 1 hour agorootparentI don't have recent experience with Docker Desktop. Around the time they went commercial we still had lots of stability issues with it (eating memory and needing restarted) so we told their sales people to take a hike. We tried Rancher Desktop for a while but something with their docker-cli implementation didn't play nice with dev containers so our remaining Mac users jumped to colima. For my part I'd had enough of faking docker/containerd on a non-native platform so I'm daily driving Linux (Fedora on a Framework 13). No more VM's for me :) reply monocasa 2 hours agorootparentprevTo a degree, that makes sense. Due to the end of dennard scaling, most high end raw compute makes more sense as more but simpler cores, and has for a long time. For instance the blue gene supercomputers made of tons of pretty individually anemic PowerPC 4xx cores. For battery powered devices, race to sleep is the current meta, where once you have some bit of heavy compute work, you power up a big core, run it fast to get through all of the work as quickly as possible, and get back to low power as quickly as possible. reply hajile 1 hour agorootparentBecause clockspeed ramps power exponentially, there’s a limit to how high you can clock before the cost of racing outweighs the savings of running a short time. I believe I’ve read that Apple’s chips run under 3GHz unless their job runs longer than 100-150ms. I suspect that’s their peak race to sleep range. reply jjtheblunt 1 hour agorootparentprevhttps://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/linux-on-the... reply entropicdrifter 1 hour agorootparentprevAsahi Linux runs great on all of the M-series Macs reply treyd 1 hour agorootparentThere's a lot of long tail issues with peripherals that still need to be worked out, to be fair. Sound wasn't enabled until fairly recently because they were still testing to ensure the drivers couldn't damage the hardware. reply evilduck 40 minutes agorootparentTo be fully fair, that's the status quo for Linux on hardware that didn't ship with Linux support as a selling point. I had issues with Intel Wifi 6 hardware compatibility on a Lenovo laptop within the last year or so. On 3 different x86 laptops with fingerprint readers, I've never been able to get any of them to function in Linux. One one of my laptops, the sound works but it's substantially degraded compared to the drivers for Windows on the same hardware. Another supports the USB4 port for data but won't switch to DP alt mode with it, though it works in Windows. On the other hand, my Steam Deck shipped with Linux and everything works great. Linux not supporting your hardware perfectly is just the nature of the beast.

Chips from Intel, AMD, NVidia, etc are big news because since they're generic compute chips, so they unlock new uses cases and research that can improve or even change the world, not just run IOS apps a bit faster. For example, do you think those Apple EEs are using iPads to design the M4 chips or X86/Mac computers? reply dagmx 2 hours agorootparentprevThere was no M3 iPad so the question is incorrect. But if you’re talking compared to the M2, it has a number of updates 1. Significant performance and efficiency gains 2. New GPU with raytracing and mesh shading , and much higher performance. 3. AV1 decode 4. New display controllers required for the new tandem OLED 5. Huge upgrade to the neural engine I’m sure I’m missing stuff, but the M4 iPad Pro is a legitimate step up from the M2 for capabilities. Unless you fall in the camp of it being just a media consumption device reply Rinzler89 2 hours agorootparentSure, those are nice improvements, no question about it, but none of those change the iPad fundaments or unlock new possibilities for it, which is that it wasn't previously compute limited but limited by iPad OS.

Did any of the stuff you mentioned you do has fundamentally changed in desktop in the last decade +. People like faster and snappier things. Along with that the new hardware unlocks the use of tandem oleds which is a big change for HDR creation and color accuracy. They go hand in hand. A lot of people create on iPads. I used to work in film and almost all my concept art friends have shifted over to iPad. A lot of my on set friends use it for on set management of content, visualization and rushes. The reviewers you mentioned don’t use the device that way. Would I similarly be right in taking their opinion about how niche it is to run Linux?

I asked that because people keep bring up the M4 in discussion, arguing against X86/Qualcomm chips, how they're slower than Apple's latest M4 chips, and for that I counteract with the fact that for a lot of cases the M4's extra performance over x86/Qualcomm is irelevant since X86/Qualcomm chips solve different and a lot more diverse problems that the highly restrictive and niche problems the iPad solves. And it's not me, because those are not my needs, I don't compile the linux kernel or doe CAD/CAE, or microbiology simulations but those to me (and to society and humanity) those are still more important than movie writers having a slightly faster iPad for drafts, since it's not like that was the reasons most movies suck nowadays. reply dagmx 1 hour agorootparentYou're arguing multiple axes and this argument feels really nonsensical to me as a result. So first of all, your entire argument hinges on YOUR belief that the iPad is just a consumption device. So you don't believe the M4 is a significant jump over the M2, even when I give you reasons that it is. Then your argument hinges on the comparison to Qualcomm SoCs, but isn't the use of the iPad irrelevant unless you also believe it'll not make its way to other devices? Which feels unfounded. Those are two distinct arguments that IMHO have no bearing on each other unless you also make the two assumptions that I think you're erroneously making. reply ben_w 1 hour agorootparentprev> I never said that.

OK, fine, but then what's the point of it being faster than those other chip if they can't run the same sw? Like I said, you're comparing a Ferrari to a van. It's faster yes, but totally different use cases. And the world runs mostly on people driving vans/trucks, not on people driving Ferraris. reply ben_w 13 minutes agorootparentYour complaint is more like saying a people carrier is an overpriced sportscar because of its inability to function as a backhoe, while ignoring evidence not only from all the people who use people people carriers, but also disregarding the usage and real world value evidence in the form of the particular company behind this people carrier manages to be wildly popular despite above average prices for every single model. tedunangst 4 hours agoparentprevYou're only allowed to be the darling for one year or so. Then you suck again. reply dagmx 3 hours agoparentprevThe idea that Apple lost their most important talent came from SemiAnalysis. It’s a saucy idea so it spread from there without much backing. They’re a tech news blog mixed with heavy doses of dramatized conjecture. The primary author has written multiple times that Apple has lost lots of their key talent but has never been able to back it up beyond “I keep tabs on LinkedIn”. End of the day, tech folks like drama as much as the next person. Sites like that are the equivalent to celebrity focused tabloids. reply stefan_ 39 minutes agoparentprevI don't understand what prompted you to bring up the M4 in a meticulously researched deep-dive on the Oryon architecture. The original article doesn't mention it once. Is this just flame bait? reply Derbasti 1 hour agoparentprevAnd that's exactly why it's so cool to see this in the Surface tablets. ...he writes, on his Snapdragon Surface tablet. (Also, I find it hella entertaining that a snapdragon is a cute little flower, martial naming notwithstanding) reply paulmd 1 hour agoparentprevIt comes from the idea that apple didn’t advance significantly in M2 and M3, which are equally untrue, but equally pervasive. People were absolutely sure that apple made basically no real advancement but just were running up the TDPs and that’s where all their M2 and M3 gains came from. That was the narrative for the last 2 years. But then you look at geekerwan and apple is making 20, 30% steps every gen, and with perf/w climbing upwards every gen too. Mainstream sites just didn’t want to do the diligence, plus there’s a weird persistent bias against the idea of apple being good. It’s gotta just be the node… or the accelerators… or the OS… Reminder that we sit here 3 years later and even giving AMD a node advantage (7940HS vs M2/M3 family) they’re still pulling >20W core-only single-thread power (even ignoring the x86 platform power problems!) to compete with a 5W M2 thread. And yes, you can limit it but then they lose on performance instead. https://youtu.be/EbDPvcbilCs?t=928 But yeah, anyway, that’s where it came from. People completely dismissed M2 and M3 as having any worthwhile advancement (even with laptops they could objectively analyze!) and were in the process of repeating this for M4 yet again. So why wouldn’t you think that three generations of stagnation indicates apple has a problem? The problem is just that apple hasn’t actually stagnated - there is an epistemic closure issue and a lot of people won’t admit it or aren’t exposed to that information, because it’s being proxied through this lens of 25% of the tech community being devout apple anti-fanboys. It's a problem with every single apple/android thread too. People will admit with the ML stuff that apple does a much better job handling PII (keeping it on-device, offering e2e encryption between devices, using anonymizing tokens when it needs to go to a service), and people intellectually understand they use the same approaches and techniques in other areas too, but suggest that maybe apple isn't quite as bad as the literal adtech company and you'll get the works. People don't want to think of themselves as fanboys but... there is a large contingent that does all the things fanboys would do and says all the things fanboys would say, and acts how fanboys would act, and nevertheless thinks they're the rock of neutrality standing between two equally-bad choices. False balance is very intellectually comforting. https://paulgraham.com/fh.html reply forrestthewoods 2 hours agoparentprev> I don’t understand where this idea that Apple has lost most of their chip design talent and is in trouble rhetoric is coming from. Why are you saying this? The article doesn't seem to imply that? Apple isn't in any kind of trouble. But the gap between Apple and the competition does appear to be closing. Right now Apple's biggest advantage is they buy up all of TSMC supply for the latest node. They're always a little faster because they're always a node ahead. Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite is reasonably impressive from a CPU and x86 emulation perspective. The GPU hardware seems kinda sorta ok. But their GPU drivers are dog poop.

It’s not ordinary today, but isn’t super surprising either. Apple bet big that we hasn’t hit the limits of how wide a machine can go. They created ARM64 to push this idea as it tries to eliminate things that make this hard. Everyone wrote off iPhone performance as mobile only and not really representative of performance on a “real” computer. M1 changed that and set the clock ticking. Once everyone realized it was possible, they needed to adjust future plans and start work on their own copy (with companies like Nuvia having a head start in accepting the new way of things due to leadership who believed in M1 performance). In the next few years, very wide machines will just be the way things are done and while they won’t be hyper common, they won’t be surprising either. reply Sakos 4 hours agoparentprevI think people generally expected larger improvements between iterations. Intel and AMD continue to deliver sizeable performance and efficiency gains every 1-2 years while it feels like the Apple M-series isn't getting comparable gains. It definitely seems like Apple has suffered significant enough brain drain in recent years that they're finding it difficult to iterate on the M1. reply mrbungie 4 hours agorootparentI'm still waiting for chips to compete with the perf/watt ratios and general efficiency of the M-series chips.

Isn't that better than what AMD and Intel have managed? reply bhouston 3 hours agorootparentI've been tracking the performance increase via GeekBench for M1, M2, M3 and now M4 and they are good incremental and consistent improvements: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i5dBe_rsiNaQATH-D-Pj... reply zamadatix 3 hours agorootparentprev\"Up to 20-30% faster\" or \"20-30% faster thanZen 5 (so one less generation) with a total gain of ~34% multicore and ~59% multicore gain. Intel went from ~10900k to ~14900k for a total of 76% single core and 128% multicore gain (i.e. more than double). Two disclaimers before the conclusion: This is just from one lazy benchmark (Geekbench 6) and of the high performing model. That doesn't necessarily tell the whole story on both accounts, but it at least gives some context around general trends. E.g. passmark is going to say the differences on Intel are a little smaller, comparisons between Max and non-Max generations confuse multi core growth, and changes in low-mid market chips may follow a different slope than the high end products. Also there are other considerations like \"and what about integrated graphics performance, which eats up a huge amount of die space and power budget?\" Anyways, my conclusion is that Apple is doing reasonably well with generational improvements vs the competition. Maybe not the absolute best, but not the worst. Being on top in the single core realm with a mobile passively cooled device makes equivalent gains all the more difficult but they're still doing it. Apple may be a victim of its own success in that the M1 from 2020 is still such a performance powerhouse that a 50% gain 4 generations later just isn't that interesting whereas with Intel a catchup of ~doubling multicore performance in the same time seems more impressive especially when M*'s story isn't as tantalizing on that half of things. reply Sakos 4 hours agorootparentprevNot really? https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/testing-apples-m3-pr...

That might be meaningful for your workload but it also means 20-30 percent per generation is quite a bit off. reply TylerE 3 hours agorootparentWhat increase has intel made over the same time period?

Geekbench scores are difficult to impossible to equate to real-world results. There are ways to measure it properly, but most sites seem to just do Geekbench or something else like it and call it a day. Single-core performance isn't this universal thing. What's your actual workload like? I'm all over the Ryzen x3D CPUs because they have proven massive performance improvements for things I care about like Factorio.

There is an ARM native port now and it’s really good. It something like doubled UPS over the old Intel binary.

According to a survey last year by Safehome.org, it’s not cars, strangers, or any other physical threat; it’s “internet/social media.” That’s not just for parents of teenagers and pre-teens, whose lives seem to revolve around their phones. It’s even true for parents of younger kids, ages 7-9 because every parent sees it coming and few know what to do about it. Parents don’t want their children to disappear into phones, as so many of their friends' children have; some resolve to wait until 8th grade, or later. Then their child hits them with the main argument that makes parents buckle: “But everyone else has a phone, so I’m being left out.” For parents who resisted, or who plan to resist, a new report may encourage many more parents to join you: Sapien Labs, which runs an ongoing global survey of mental health with nearly a million participants so far, released a “Rapid Report” today on a question they added in January asking young adults (those between ages 18 and 24): “At what age did you get your own smartphone or tablet (e.g. iPad) with Internet access that you could carry with you?” When they plot the age of first smartphone on the X axis against their extensive set of questions about mental health on the Y axis, they find a consistent pattern: the younger the age of getting the first smartphone, the worse the mental health that the young adult reports today. This is true in all the regions studied (the survey is offered in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Arabic, Hindi, and Swahili), and the relationships are consistently stronger for women. We believe these findings have important implications for parents, heads of K-12 schools, and legislators currently considering bills to raise minimum ages or require age verification for some kinds of sites (especially social media and pornography). We’ll address those implications at the end of this post. But first: what did Sapien Labs do, and what did they find? Subscribe 1. The Sapien Labs Study Sapien Labs is a non-profit research foundation with the goal of understanding how the rapidly changing social and technological environment is changing human brains and minds. Their main research project has been the Global Mind Project, an ongoing program that tracks mental well-being around the world using a comprehensive assessment of mental health along with questions about demographics and various cultural, technological, and lifestyle factors. They have issued a variety of reports on the state of mental health around the world. Among their most important findings is that in all the regions they’ve studied, mental health is worst for the youngest generations. It didn’t used to be this way. There is a well-known finding in happiness research that, across nearly all nations, happiness or well-being forms a U-shaped curve across the lifespan (See Rauch, 2018). Young adults and people in their 60s and 70s are happier than those in middle age. But that may be changing, especially for women, as Gen Z (born in and after 1996) enters young adulthood. You can see the sudden collapse of young adult mental health in some of our previous posts on this Substack. For example, Figure 1 shows that up until 2011, young Canadian women were the most likely to report having excellent or very good mental health. By 2015 they were the least likely, and the decline in their self-reported mental health accelerated after that, while it changed very little for older women. (The same pattern holds for Canadian men, but to a lesser degree.) Figure 1. Percent of Canadian women reporting excellent or very good mental health, by age group. Canadian Community Health Survey (2003-2019). Graphed by Zach Rausch. Why would this be? What changed in the early 2010s that could have rapidly reduced the mental health of teens around the world, with a bigger impact on girls? At the After Babel Substack, we have argued that the sudden switch of teen social life from flip phones (which are designed for communication) to smartphones (which enabled continuous access to social media and much higher levels of phone addiction), is the major cause, though not the only one. There are unique factors at work in each country, but we know of no alternative that can explain the synchronized, gendered, and global decline in teen mental health. At Sapien Labs, they decided to test the smartphone hypothesis by adding a question about the age at which people got their first smartphone (or tablet). Is it just a coincidence that the first global generation to grow up on smartphones became the first global generation to have lower well-being than the one before them? Sapien Labs uses a comprehensive assessment of mental well-being that asks participants about 47 elements of mental, social, and emotional functioning on a life impact scale. These 47 elements are aggregated into a single score called the Mental Health Quotient (MHQ), which gives extra weight to patterns that indicate severe problems. It also uses subsets of these 47 elements to create scores along six domains: Mood & Outlook, Social Self, Adaptability & Resilience, Drive & Motivation, Cognition, and Mind-Body Connection. (You can take the MHQ yourself and you can request access to the full dataset. For scoring and validation of the MHQ, see Newson, Pastukh, & Thiagarajan, 2022, and see this blog post that offers a clear explanation of how the MHQ is scored, and why.) Figure 2 shows the most basic result in the report: they simply plotted the responses from the nearly 28,000 participants who answered the “first phone” question, from all countries combined. Figure 2. As age of first smartphone goes up, so does the mental health reported by young adults, assessed by the MHQ. Data from SapienLabs.org. MHQ scores are calculated from responses to the 47 questions and converted to a scale that runs from -100 to 200, as shown here: As you can see, the respondents who got their first smartphone before they were 10 years old are doing worse, on average, than those who didn’t get one until they were in their teens. The most mentally healthy respondents are those who did not get a phone until their late teens.1 You can also see that the slope is steeper for young women than for young men. The Gen Z women who got their first smartphone before they were 9 years old are in negative territory, on average. The power and unique contribution of the Sapien Labs dataset come from two features of their work: First, they use a far more detailed measure of mental health than is used in most other large surveys. The second important feature is their international coverage. So, let’s zoom in and explore the six domain scores that make up the MHQ, first for the global sample, and then for the region and culture we know best: the Anglosphere. 2. Domains of Functioning As you’ll see if you read the full report, the next step after examining the overall MHQ scores is to examine scores on the six domains of mental functioning: Mood & Outlook: Includes items about optimism, calmness, anxiety, mood swings, sadness, and anger. Social Self: Includes items about self-worth, relationships with others, empathy, cooperation, aggression toward others Adaptability & Resilience: includes items about adaptability to change, ability to learn, and emotional resilience. Drive & Motivation: Includes items about motivation, curiosity, enthusiasm, and addictions. Cognition: Includes items about memory, decision-making and risk-taking, focus, and concentration, unwanted thoughts, hallucinations Mind-Body Connection: Includes items about sleep quality, energy level, appetite, and physical health issues. Figure 3 shows that for young women, all six domain scores show the same basic pattern as the MHQ: a consistent rise. You can also see that a few of the domains seem to rise more slowly or level off somewhat after the age of 13 or 14: Drive and motivation, Mind-body connection, and Cognition. However, the other three dimensions continue to rise all the way to age 18. The domain that rises fastest, meaning that it is most highly correlated with age of first smartphone, is the “social self” domain. Figure 3: The 6 domains of well-being, for young women, as a function of when they got their first smartphone. From SapienLabs.org. Figure 4 shows the same analysis for young men. The pattern is similar, with two important exceptions. First, the slopes are substantially lower, meaning that the mental health and well-being of young men are not as strongly related to the age at which they got their first smartphone as it is for their sisters, although it is still related. (All of the significance tests and effect sizes can be found in supplementary materials posted in this Google Drive link.2) The second difference is that all of the lines are higher for boys, meaning that boys are doing better than girls at all ages (at least, according to their self-reports). The one exception is that the line for Adaptability & Resilience reaches the same level for both sexes by age 18. Given the steeper slopes of all six lines for girls, this means that sex differences in adult mental health are larger among those who got a smartphone earlier. Figure 4: The 6 domains of well-being, for young men, as a function of when they got their first smartphone. From SapienLabs.org. One major issue in analyzing an international dataset is that there are just so many differences between countries, regions, and religions that there are many opportunities for confounding variables to lead us astray. For example, in the Sapien Labs dataset, in the less wealthy countries such as India, few young adults had received a smartphone before the age of 10, which means that the data points on the left sides of the graphs contain almost no Indians, whereas the data points on the right side (no phone until 17 or 18) contain many Indians and fewer from the USA. If Indians are mentally healthier than Americans (for other reasons), this could cause the lines to slope even if smartphones had no effect on mental health. It is important, therefore, to look at individual countries and regions. (The Sapien Labs report does this in its appendix, where you can see that the trends hold for each of the world regions). The region that we (Jon and Zach) know best and have written on extensively is the Anglosphere (the English-speaking countries of The United States, Canada, The United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and sometimes Ireland). We, therefore, decided to examine what Sapien Labs had found about those countries and compare it to what we have found. Share 3. Zooming in on the Anglosphere At the After Babel Substack, we have been documenting the patterns of rising mental illness among teens around the world, and, like Sapien Labs, we have found that the sudden decline of teenage mental health is an international phenomenon. Our research so far indicates that the increases in mental illness in the 2010s were slightly larger in the Anglosphere than in any other region we’ve examined. Figure 4 shows the large and sudden rise in self-harm rates among teens, particularly girls, in four of these nations (you can see much more in Zach’s initial report on the Anglosphere). Figure 5. Since 2010, rates of self-harm episodes have increased for teens in the Anglosphere countries. For data on Australia and for all sources, see Rausch and Haidt (2023). In every Anglosphere country, the mental health of teens declined sharply around the same time (~2012) and in the same way (depression, anxiety, and self-harm, with bigger increases for girls). We have also found that the five Nordic nations show similar trends, particularly when examining changing rates of depression and anxiety (though not always for self harm). The Sapien Labs study began in 2019 so it cannot show us trends since 2010, but it can show us how young adults are doing today, and it can link variations in mental health today to variations in age of first smartphone. We wanted to get more familiar with the data and examine these links for ourselves, so we downloaded the full dataset as it was available on their Brainbase site on May 13, 2023, which was just about 2 weeks later than the dataset used in the Sapien Lab report. Our dataset contains 1,798 more participants, for a total of 29,767. The number of participants from the six anglosphere countries was much smaller: 1,465 (823 females, 584 males). By country: 682 in the USA, 297 in the UK, 224 in Canada, 239 in Australia, 10 in New Zealand, and 13 in Ireland. We cleaned and organized our dataset in the same way as the team at Sapien Labs, with a small modification to account for our much smaller sample size. To reduce the jerkiness of the graph lines when we drop down to lower numbers of respondents for each point, we grouped participants into 2-year buckets (or three years, for our youngest bucket, 5-83). Figure 5 shows that the MHQ scores of Anglosphere boys and girls show patterns very similar to those reported in Figure 1 by Sapien Labs for the full 28,000-person international sample: The later the age of smartphone acquisition, the better the mental health. At least, that is true for the girls, all the way up to 18. For Anglosphere boys, there is a leveling off after the 11-12 mark. Delays beyond age 12 do not seem to be related to further increases in MHQ scores.4 Figure 6. Anglosphere countries only: As age of first smartphone goes up, so does the mental health reported by young adults, especially for women. Data from SapienLabs.org, graphed by Zach Rausch. We also plotted the six MHQ domain scores and found similar results. For females, all six dimensions of mental well-being improve as the age of smartphone acquisition increases.5 The effects are particularly strong for the “social self” and “mood and outlook”, which correspond well to the rise of internalizing disorders (depression and anxiety), which Zach has shown is rising within every Anglosphere nation. Figure 7. Anglosphere countries only: female MHQ dimension scores. Well-being on all 6 dimensions increases as age of smartphone acquisition increases. The trends for boys are similar to girls, though the effects are smaller and there is more fluctuation.6 Figure 8 shows that at the youngest ages, increasing age corresponds with improvements in each of the six dimensions. However, for boys, improvements tend to level off after age 12. Figure 8. Anglosphere countries only: male MHQ dimension scores. Changes are smaller and more varied compared to females. Leave a comment 4. Limitations It’s important to note that the report from Sapien Labs is one of their “rapid reports” made possible by their fast-growing number of participants and the easy access they offer to their data. They added the question about age of first smartphone in January and they are publishing a report, with data from nearly 28,000 participants, in May. We believe that this ability to move quickly is a public service during a global pandemic of teen mental illness. While their rapid report is not a standard academic publication and has not been through peer review (which often takes a year or more), the open access to the data has allowed us to investigate and confirm the trends they are reporting. We hope and expect that other researchers will download the dataset and offer critiques of the data, the analyses, and the conclusions drawn. This sort of “post-publication peer review” is becoming increasingly common as the problems with the existing peer review system become more widely known. One issue to keep in mind with the Sapien Labs dataset is that the participants in each country are not a random or representative sample of the people in that country. Such studies would be extremely expensive to run, and now that so few people agree to phone solicitations or even answer their phones, it is unclear how representative such surveys can be. Those who agree to be interviewed, or who are motivated by money to participate, are not representative of the broader population. For this Sapien Labs report, participants came to the site on their own, or from online advertisements paid for by Sapien Labs, for the purpose of getting a detailed report on their wellbeing. So, the means reported for any country should not be treated like direct measures of the true means. However, samples such as these are still very useful for examining differences within the sample, such as those between men and women, or between those who got a smartphone early and those who got one late. And the much larger size of the Sapien Labs dataset, compared to Gallup and other survey organizations, allows for many additional analyses. A second factor to keep in mind is that like all surveys, what we get is correlational data that is open to alternative interpretations. The graphs in the report are likely to suggest to most readers that getting a smartphone early causes later mental health problems. But with correlational data we must always consider the possibility that the causal arrow could run in reverse. In this case: having low well-being as a young adult could cause people to believe that they got a smartphone earlier than they did, but this seems unlikely. We must also always consider that there could be “third variables” that cause both of the first two variables to rise. In this case, one plausible confounding third variable is permissive parenting. Perhaps permissive parents (in each country) simultaneously do two things: they give their kids smartphones at very young ages, and they also give them few boundaries and little structure, which then interferes with development and produces struggling young adults. While this hypothesis is plausible and should be investigated, it is not clear how it would explain the fact that, in all the regions studied, it is the girls who show a tighter connection between early phone acquisition and later mental health problems, just as it is the girls who show a tighter connection between heavy social media use and concurrent mental health problems. Nor would it explain why mental health dropped so rapidly in the early 2010s (especially for girls) if permissive parenting (or some other variable about family life) was the real culprit. And finally, we note that no one study is definitive, and more research is needed. We have been able to find a few other studies that examined the age at which children got their first smartphones (We have created a new appendix [8.14] in our collaborative review doc on Social Media and Mental Health). So far they are mostly smaller studies that have produced mixed results. If you know of any others, please add them to the doc or put a link to them in the comments below. We want to get this right. 5. Implications We cannot be certain that the correlations shown in the data are evidence of causality, but we think it is appropriate for those who care for children to act on the preponderance of the evidence (which is the standard in a civil trial) rather than waiting for evidence beyond a reasonable doubt (which is the standard used in a criminal trial. See proposition 2 in this post.) There is increasing evidence that smartphones have a variety of detrimental effects on child development including reductions of sleep, focus, and time with friends in person, along with increases in addictive behaviors, so it makes sense that the cumulative effect of getting one’s first phone in elementary school would be larger than for those who don’t get a phone until high school. This is an important point made in the Sapien Labs report: The relationships they find suggest that there is a cumulative effect of having had a smartphone (and its many apps) over many years of childhood; they do not represent the effects of having used a phone a lot in recent days or weeks (which is the focus of most of the published research). We think the implications for action are strongest for policies related to children and younger teens––those still in elementary and middle school (that is, age 14 and below) In most of the graphs in this post, including those for the Anglosphere, the slopes of the lines are steepest for those ages, and the links are visible for boys as well as girls (though smaller for boys). This concern to protect children before and during early puberty is consistent with a study published last year which found that in a large longitudinal study of British adolescents, the peak years for evidence of links between social media use and lower satisfaction with life were 11-13 for girls (which corresponds to the early part of puberty), while for boys (who begin puberty a bit later) it was 14-15. On the other hand, the implications for action related to older teens and especially boys are less clear, at least within the United States and other Anglosphere nations. The lines for boys are somewhat flat in those ages, and the increases for girls generally slow down too. Furthermore, the arguments for why high school students need a smartphone (rather than an alternative, such as a flip-phone) are stronger than the arguments for why elementary and middle school students need one. We, therefore, believe that the Sapien Labs findings should motivate us to think carefully about whether and when to give children their own smart devices, especially before high school. It is not the Internet per se that is harmful; so much of the internet is fantastically educational, useful, and entertaining. The most relevant questions, we think, are: 1) At what age do you want to give a child continuous access to the internet and social media, even when away from home, even when sitting in class? 2) At what age do you want to give social media companies, and other companies, continuous access to a child’s attention? And 3) does a child really need a smartphone when other kinds of phones (such as “flip phones” or Light Phones) work just as well for general communication (phone calls and texting)? Implications for Parents The group Wait Until 8th was founded to solve the collective action problem that parents and teens are in: Even if most parents wanted to wait until high school to give their children smartphones and social media, as long as most kids have those things by 6th grade, there will be enormous pressure on their children, and hence on the parents, to relent. Unless the parents can coordinate. So Wait Until 8th asks parents to sign a pledge, when their children are in elementary school, that they will wait until 8th grade to give them a smartphone. The pledge only takes effect once ten families in that child’s grade have signed the pledge so that the child will have a community of peers and will not feel so isolated before 8th grade. We think this is a great idea, we just suggest that the pledge should be: Wait Until 9th. Or Wait Until High School. Children are usually 12 or 13 at the start of 8th grade; that is still within the period of early puberty. Plus, if 8th graders have smartphones, that means that smartphones will be everywhere in middle schools, increasing the desire of 7th graders to get them. To solve collective action problems, we think it’s best to focus on setting good norms within collectives (such as schools): make elementary schools and middle schools be smartphone free. Parents understandably want to be able to reach their children when they are away from home, and a flip phone or other “dumbphone” is a very reasonable first phone that allows parents and children to reach each other. We suggest that parents not give smartphones as first phones. Let children learn to master a simpler kind of phone, one that cannot be loaded with addictive apps. Wait Until 8th offers an excellent list of the many smartphone alternatives. Implications for Schools Many of the teachers and heads of schools that Jon talks to are bitter about the effects of smartphones on their students and their school culture. They complain about the constant drama unfolding on social media during the school day. They complain about the distraction and the increased difficulty of getting students’ attention during class, since many students sneak looks at their frequently-buzzing phones, especially those sitting in the back rows. Many schools say that they ban phones, but what they often seem to mean is “the rule is that you can’t take out your phone during class.” That means that some students (the ones most suffering from phone addiction) will learn to do it stealthily, and many of the rest will just pull out their phones as soon as class is over, thereby missing out on face-to-face interactions with the students right next to them. We suggest that schools consider going phone free, meaning that students can use their phones to arrive and depart from school, but once they enter, their phones (smart or dumb) would be placed in a phone locker, or in a lockable pouch. We think the case for doing this in elementary schools and middle schools is strongest. In a few weeks, Jon will write a substack post laying out the empirical evidence that smartphones distract students and disrupt education, even when they are kept in students’ pockets. We also suggest that school districts collaborate with social scientists to do experiments on entire schools, rather than on individual students. What if a state or district identified 20 middle schools that were willing to cooperate, and then randomly assigned half of them to go phone free? There is no research of this kind that we can find, yet such a simple study would give us results within a single year that could potentially yield findings that improve both mental health and educational outcomes. Implications for Legislatures If there is a cumulative effect of smartphone ownership in childhood, and if the effect is due in part to heavy use of certain kinds of apps (such as social media) rather than other kinds of apps (such as watching movies, or using Wikipedia), then it becomes even more vital that we develop ways of age-gating certain apps and content. At present, US law sets a minimum age of 13 at which children can sign contracts with companies to give away their data (when they check a box on the terms of service). But the law was written such that the companies are not required to verify ages. As long as a child says that she is 13 or older, she’s in and can create a social media account. This must change. If the minimum age were enforced, it would help parents solve their collective action problem, at least with regard to Instagram, Tiktok, and other social media sites for underage users. It is precisely Congress’s failure to enforce the age 13 rule that puts parents in the trap. Many states are now introducing legislation to remedy this omission. And there is one federal bill that does a particularly good job of focusing on age limits and age verification: The Protecting Kids on Social Media Act, introduced by Senators Schatz (D-HI), Cotton (R-AR), Murphy (D-CT), and Britt (R-AL). The act would “set a minimum age of 13 to use social media apps and would require parental consent for 13 through 17 year-olds. The bill would also prevent social media companies from feeding content using algorithms to users under the age of 18.” The bill also requires social media companies to develop rigorous age verification methods. (There are already many in existence, and many more would appear if the bill gets passed.) We also think the Kids Online Safety Act of 2022, introduced by senators Blumenthal (D-CT) and Blackburn (R-TN) would do a lot to make social media less damaging to children, and easier for parents to control. The fact that so many bills are bipartisan, at both the state and federal level, is a very encouraging sign in our polarized time. Legislators often report seeing the problems in their own children. In conclusion: there is a great deal that can be done, individually and collectively, to address one of the top fears that parents express, about the safety and health of their children. The Sapien Labs data offers us new insight into the nature of the problem, and it alerts us that the problem may be global. It also guides us to the ages at which reform efforts are most likely to work. Subscribe POSTSCRIPTS (added on May 18, 2023) 1—We welcome additional and deeper analyses of the Sapien Labs data, and will post links here to such reports whether they support or contradict our analyses in this post. 2—One issue we should have discussed in the text is the inclusion of tablets, along with smartphones, in the Sapien Labs’ questionnaire. If their findings differ from those of other labs which asked only about age of first smartphone, then we won’t know whether part of the difference is the inclusion of tablets. We hope that future studies will ask about the two devices separately to figure out which devices are associated with harm at which ages (if any). 3—Some commentary online has made the important point that it’s not the phone itself which is harmful; it is the particular apps that the child uses, a child with a particular personality, in the context of a particular family that does (or does not) exercise oversight and apply restrictions. We agree. The original iPhone introduced by Steve Jobs was three devices: a phone, an iPod, and a web browser. Great! Three tools. Probably not harmful. It’s the addition of the app store that turned the smartphone into a portal to everything. If early acquisition of a smartphone is shown to be reliably associated with developmental problems, it would likely be because it enables continuous 18-hour-per-day access to hundreds of activities. 1 There are relatively few participants who did not get a phone until after the age of 18, especially in developed nations. These participants were cut from the analysis, in the report, and in our analyses below. 2 This includes statistical tests between each age for each score and problem rating, as well as correlations and population trend statistics for both linear and logarithmic fits. 3 We dropped all participants who gave an age of first smartphone that was above 18 or below age 5. There were relatively few on both ends. 4 Using simple Pearson correlations, all 6 domain scores correlate significantly with age of phone acquisition at p < .01, except for mind-body connection, which correlates p < .05. 5 Using simple Pearson correlations, only two of the six domains correlate significantly with age of phone acquisition (both p < .05): cognition, and mind-body. We then tested the hypothesis that for boys, the correlation is confined to the earlier years (ages 5-14), as discussed below. When we examined just those participants, in the Anglosphere, we found that age of first smartphone was significantly correlated with the MHQ, and with the domains of adaptive resilience, and mood-outlook, all at p < .05. See our corresponding Google Doc for relevant correlation matrices. 6 Using simple Pearson correlations, only two of the six domains correlate significantly with age of phone acquisition (both p < .05): cognition, and mind-body.

The most notable thing about this post is the MHQ figures. However, you might note that the difference in age of smartphone use moves a person by at most one bucket. Given that he is suggesting a ban on smartphones and/or social media, I would expect some more catastrophic effect. In terms of the literature review, this time I read through [0]. It also finds small but significant effects on anxiety and depression, but finds no significant effects on overall measures of well-being. This is because social media also seems to have some positive effects on some other measures of well-being. This meta analysis also finds that age does not seem to change the effects of social media. On longitudinal studies, it seems like social well-being does decrease social media use, but anxiety and depression to not increase social media use. Also, social media use doesn't seem to cause anxiety and depression here, so there is probably some third factor causing anxiety, depression, and social media use which causes this correlation. Also interesting is that internationally the effects are neutral, and in the US, the effects are neutral, but in Europe they are negative, while in Asia they are positive. IDK why, but it doesn't really support his hypothesis that social media has some sort of catastrophic impact worth banning.

We just had a discussion on persistent vs obstinate[1]. It's this man's mission to be one of the two on this topic. To keep bringing up his bailiwick. This topic is going to keep coming up, almost every time by people like Haidt committed to the negative, committed to obstructing what they can only regard as a dangerous possibility. I do not particularly enjoy topics where we get blown in only one direction like this, it's rarely a useful dialog, it rarely adapts or changes to the world about it. (One use I do see for AI is being able to go search & synopsize who it is we are receiving broadcasts from. Right now it takes research to go find out who the transmitter is. We are easily cast to places with little context. (This is in part why the appeal of the darker web is so effective, because we are liable to drift in un-aware)). reply genrilz 2 hours agorootparentI would like to note that he has created/supported a variety of political causes in the past. His current cause does seem to be pointing to restricting kids internet access, but I can't really figure out what he wants. One of these is his \"moral foundations\" theory, which claims that people have different underlying reasons for having various moral opinions. He claimed to have identified some but left the exact reasons open ended and changeable. He claimed that everyone realizing this would decrease political polarization. Neuroscientists pointed out that the \"modules\" he described can't map to actual brain structures, and he claimed that it didn't matter. I'm kind of unsure of if I would even call this science, as I don't really see how to make a predictable hypothesis out of it. However, it could be valuable as political speech if people do indeed lack awareness that other people value different things than them. (I always assumed everyone knew that, but maybe they don't?) He also argued for \"anti-fragility\". The concept that kids these days are kept from experiencing failure and other unpleasant things, and that this will lead them to become worse off during adulthood. This seems more testable, but almost seems to be in direct contradiction to his current anti-smartphone/anti-social media cause. Perhaps this does come from a general \"Kids these days are online too much\" sort of sentiment, but anti-fragility by itself doesn't really directly suggest we should deny kids internet access. I really don't know what to think of the man's political leanings, but I don't trust his scholarship much either way. Any time I try to fact-check him, I come up with rather inconclusive or small effects. reply croemer 36 minutes agorootparentIf he had something that would hold up to scrutiny, he wouldn't put it on substack but in a proper journal. reply cchi_co 6 hours agoprevThe concern about the impact of internet and social media (and consequently smartphones) on children’s safety is well-founded.

It's when they start cramming unwanted content and \"influencers\" down your throat that the problem appears. reply belorn 4 hours agorootparentA common issue that studies like this often bring up, including this article, is the change from in-person teenage social life to an online teenage social life, done on social media platforms. In-person social life has limitations in both scope and size, and includes (among others) physical cues. The online equivalent version lacks both limits on size, but also has those unwanted aspects you bring up. I do not see direct person-to-person messaging to be a perfect equivalent version of a in-person talk. Even adult people in professional settings can be quite bad in an email conversation, and much more so than they would have been in-person. It also seems that people who start earlier in life with online text communication seem to not really become better (compared to others) at clear online text communication later in life. reply squigz 5 hours agorootparentprev> It's anything with a \"social\" component that's the problem.

The physical runtime we are in supports a massive diversity of gameplay and outcomes, unfortunately we've somehow \"chosen\" a model of governance that constantly makes poor choices. This could be fixed, but we've been trained to worship the very thing that is ruining life here on Earth. To me, this is quite a hilarious situation, it is like living in a sitcom.

I see this as developing a feel of helplessness. Compounded with current media landscape of distortion and distress is different. Finally I see that society would rather scapegoat the smartphone than point out the issue having TVs the public spaces makes consumption of this stress are background noise. reply bdcravens 6 hours agoprevCausation or correlation?

For a proper randomized controlled trials even voluntary enrollments are problematic: the researcher needs to choose and randomize the treatment. How can that ever be implemented for a sufficiently powered study of smartphones/social media use for children (or adults)? reply amanaplanacanal 3 hours agorootparent“We can’t do real science because it would be too expensive, so we’ll just assume that what we are trying to prove is true.” I hate it, and we need to figure out something better.

It's not unreasonable to imagine that the authors have significant confirmation bias. Everything they claim needs to be taken with a big grain of salt. Haidt is also marketing his book via the blog. It would be much more credible if he designed proper scientific studies and punished them in relevant Journals after peer review. The fact he doesn't publish properly is consistent with my hunch that his claims wouldn't stand up to scientific scrutiny. reply jimbokun 5 hours agoparentprevJonathan Haidt has covered the correlation/ causation question very rigorously. The case that smart phones and social media specifically have an impact is very strong. reply dbtablesorrows 5 hours agoprevYou all miss the obvious correlations. A society with prosperity but lacking athletic, artistic and intellectual pursuits will devolve into a crowd of purposeless humans living for the pleasures of the moment. That's what current generations are. 90% of people have enough to meet needs, and no meaningful purpose in life apart from scrolling tiktok, constant stream of sexualized and otherwise glorified (money, aesthetics) material. The popular culture also glorifies temporary pleasures (drugs, drinking, sexual promiscuity). Just look at average teenager, their lives revolve around celebrities and these habits. They're lookist, superficial and shallow AF. Of course they will lose mental health thinking about looks and comparing with some photoshopped instagram celebrity.

That's what current generations are... Just look at average teenager You must be looking at very different teenagers from the ones I am. I have literally never seen a more athletic, more artistic, or more intellectual generation than ever before. My parents' generation played one sport, if that. Now teens play four sports and go to pre-professional sports summer camps. My parents' generation didn't know art if it hit them on the head. These days being interested in design is a totally normal thing for teens, whether it's graphic design or interior design or fashion and so forth. My parents' generation all listened to the same music, and played in some pretty bad bands. Now teens create and share insanely creative new music -- across the world, not just limited to their small town. And intellectual pursuits? The proportion of teens applying to Ivy League universities, with all the intellectual rigor that requires, has never been higher. And the academic standards for getting in to those places has never been higher. Now does this describe all teens? Of course not. But the point isn't to compare teens to some kind of level of perfection, it's to compare them to past generations of teens. And in the areas you're describing -- athletic, artistic, intellectual -- they seem to be doing better than ever before in history. I mean, come on -- think about teens in the 1990's, the 1980's, the 1950's. Hanging out in the parking lot, drinking beers, smoking cigarettes, getting high, wasting time at the mall. I don't know what kind of artistic-intellectual athletes you seem to remember. The area they're doing worse in is mental health. Because the pressures and expectations on them also seem to be greater than ever before. So perhaps be a little more charitable and understanding, rather than so judgmental and critical. reply dbtablesorrows 1 hour agorootparentMy gut feeling is the gen-Zers doing well intellectually / athletically are probably top 10%, and they dont correlate much with mental health issues.

Wealthier parents parents, I suppose, would be more likely to have the free time (or that of paid help), emotional availability, educated tendancy to read and develop and understand of the importance and structure of shared time, healthy established family norms, and genes.

Ask yourselves - why are you all so desperate to deny this research? reply genrilz 3 hours agoparentI've done literature reviews after seeing posts from Haidt come up here and elsewhere. If you go to semanticscholar.org for instance, type in \"social media wellbeing meta-analysis\", you will get something like [0]. (found a free link by searching the study title) This and most other meta-analysis I have read on the subject seem to indicate that the effect of social media is pretty neutral. This one in particular does look at the effect on adolescents and depression specifically, and finds that it effects adolescents the same way it effects adults. That being said, there is a small but statistically significant effect on anxiety and depression. This is cancelled out in overall wellbeing by other positive effects. However, given Haidt is saying we should implement age gates on social media, I would want the evidence to indicate something a bit more catastrophic and not cancelled out by positive effects. So if you read the research, you will find there is good reason to be skeptical.

    "title": "The NYT book review is everything book criticism shouldn't be",
    "originLink": "https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/new-york-times-book-review",
    "originBody": "The NYT Book Review Is Everything Book Criticism Shouldn't Be Originally published in our magazine’s hallowed print edition 2024 May/June Details The Review is famous as an arbiter of taste and quality. But the publication utterly fails to seriously engage with books and the publishing industry. Yasmin Nair filed 08 July 2024 in Media The year is 2002. It is 5 a.m, Sunday, on a quiet, leafy street. The silence is broken by the sound of metal upon metal as a mailbox is opened and closed. Suddenly, a loud scream rends the air. It is followed by a deep, full-throated sobbing and the soft, raspy sound of paper being shredded. Someone somewhere has just read a review of her novel in the New York Times Book Review, and it is devastating. Someone somewhere now lies splayed in a fuzzy yellow bathrobe and pink bunny slippers, her left cheek imprinted by the grimy pavement while her right hand pounds desperately at the box, as if the action might reverse time itself. Her roommate, following the sound of her cries, has found her and is trying to get her up. The writer’s left hand clutches the now tattered remains of the review; the name “Michiko Kakutani” appears in the byline. A few phrases and words can be seen here and there: “a lot of pompous hot air,” “a definite dead end.” Slowly, the two make their way back to their house, the writer still sobbing, her roommate gently holding her up. Michiko Kakutani’s 2017 departure as the chief book critic at the New York Times was greeted with bombastic reverence: Vanity Fair declared that she had been “the most powerful book critic in the English-speaking world.” The New Yorker’s Alexandra Schwartz wrote that “her assessments of novels and memoirs, works of history, biography, politics, and poetry have guided generations of American readers.” The Authors Guild declared that she had been the rare critic whose reviews could “make or break a book.” And the Times, no doubt keen to inflate its own importance, declared her “feared and revered” and noted that her departure—“the changing of the guard among critics” at the paper—was a “seismic change.” Much of this, like the anecdote above, is an exaggeration. Still, Kakutani’s reputation helped solidify the Times’s Book Review and its Best Sellers List (which appears in the print version of the Review) as arbiters of taste and quality. This is an entirely undeserved reputation: while Kakutani’s reviews were occasionally, ah, bracing, she often seemed more focused on showing off her dexterity at snideness than reviewing books, sometimes adopting the voice of a literary character from a different book than the one she was reviewing: Holly Golightly in a review of Truman Capote’s Summer Crossing or Holden Caulfield when reviewing Benjamin Kunkel’s Indecision. (The results were embarrassing.) In recent years, the Book Review has become so anodyne, its reviewers so reluctant to express opinions that even Kakutani’s reviews might now prove a welcome distraction. As for any influence: A 2004 study of the impact of the Review on sales by Alan T. Sorensen and Scott J. Rasmussen found that while positive reviews increase sales, even negative reviews can positively impact sales. But the media landscape has since changed vastly. More recently, in 2023, the publicist Kathleen Schmidt opined that “media consumption has changed so much that big publicity isn’t necessarily effective” and that while “many authors dream of being reviewed in The New York Times, […] a review there rarely sells many copies of a book.” In a 2022 essay in The Nation, Kyle Paoletta writes about the Review having “less influence than it once had.” And yet, the Book Review, which has been around since 1896 (the Times was founded in 1851),1 remains influential, like the dying embers at the center of a slowly ebbing fire, and it continues to exercise its insidious influence upon the public, many readers, and book editors who are looking for examples of what the Review considers “good” or “great” books. Among the many ill effects: the Book Review tokenizes non-white writers in essentialist ways, reducing them to mere standard-bearers of their perceived cultures, and this attitude is too often replicated by even the most seemingly edgy review publications. Its emphasis on the Big Five publishers and book sales has meant that writers likely feel compelled to write towards what they imagine a Book Review critic might want to see. Despite all these issues, and its declining reputation notwithstanding, the Book Review has so long been imitated that its worst characteristics have seeped into that amorphous realm we might term “book culture”—a world where unspoken traditions about how to read and whom to read and why have taken hold and authors are compelled to write in ways that conform to gendered and racialized expectations or the apparently unrelenting public desire for more trauma memoirs. By reinforcing in its content the worst trends in publishing, the Book Review ultimately perpetuates the material inequality so prevalent in the publishing world. Publishing is massively profitable—but only for top executives at a few places: their salaries can run in the millions. For positions lower on the hierarchy, the average salary (some hiked by unionization at places like HarperCollins) generally starts around $48,000, which is a dismal salary for someone living in a city like New York, where most publishing houses are based. In fact, the book industry is increasingly skewed to include only those who can work for free in unpaid internships or for meager salaries supplemented by family or spousal wealth. In turn, these up-and-coming editors and agents tend to seek writing from those in their own spheres of influence which means that, more and more, fiction and nonfiction work only echo worldviews of a very particular set of people (in mainstream publishing, this means a very liberal mindset rather than any kind of truly left perspective, with rare exceptions). While many have criticized the Book Review on grounds that it is boring and perhaps simply irrelevant, few have considered the long-lasting economic effects of its moribund style. Kakutani’s reputation was built on a 38-year career at the 173-year-old Times, which she joined as a reporter in 1979 before becoming a book critic in 1983. Since then, the book review world has changed drastically, with fewer publications devoting money to books. For a while it looked like online blogs and Goodreads, a reader-generated online review site, might be plausible alternatives to more conventional media coverage of books, defying the norms set by professional critics. But by the 2010s, the blogs had mostly disappeared as their writers either stopped from the exhaustion of working for free or very little or, ironically, were absorbed into the mainstream. Goodreads, founded in 2007, was bought by Amazon in 2013 and has since become notorious as a den of pure spite. In June 2023, the author Elizabeth Gilbert announced she was “halting” the release of her forthcoming book The Snow Forest after hundreds of people on the site, many claiming to be Ukrainian, denounced her book for being set in Russia and “romanticizing the aggressor.” No one had read even an advance reader’s copy: all of the outrage was based simply on the fact of the location of the story. Gilbert, much to the consternation of many in the book world, capitulated to the hordes. Despite the apparent power of social media websites to “cancel” famous writers like Gilbert, these outlets are still more fragile than institutions like the New York Times. Consider, for instance, everything happening now to TikTok, which could be gone by the time this goes to print. Social media trends tend to wax and wane while readers seek reliable reviews. The Book Review, in this fragile and ever-changing world, still exerts too much influence on book culture. Reading the Book Review is a joyless task because it is mostly so massively, stiflingly dull. There is a sameness and a flatness to the reviews, held as they are to some invisible set of Times “standards,” the most obvious one of which seems to be, “Never be interesting.” A recent review of Anthony Fauci’s memoir, On Call, describes it as “a well-pressed gray flannel suit of a book with a white coat buttoned over it,” as if its dullness is the best thing about it. Other than a mild comment about the overuse of “bureaucratese” (phrases like “proof of the pudding” and “pushing the envelope,” which are simply clichés), the entire “review” by Alexandra Jacobs reads like a dutifully written 8th-grade summary. I have read reviews there by some of the wittiest writers whose prose sparkles elsewhere but who, when transplanted to the hallowed and hollow grounds of the Times, quietly shrivel and hush. To enter the world of the Book Review is to stumble into a boring tea party: everyone has nothing but niceties to murmur to each other, everyone is dropping quotes from Joan Didion and some dead white guys, and everyone’s tea is secretly laced with gin just to keep them going. If there are opinions, especially negative ones, they are offered tremulously, coddled in several caveats, as in the review of Fauci’s book. This is by design. In 2018, Pamela Paul, the Book Review editor from 2013 to 2022, said that it “has a long tradition of being a political Switzerland.” Paul eventually left her post to become an insipid bourgeois reactionary columnist for the Times opinion section, which indicates that even she grew tired of faking neutrality. But the principle still holds at the publication, where the reviews are so bland and sleep-inducing that one is tempted to hold every reviewer by their feet, upside down and outside a window, threatening to let go: Give me an opinion, damn it! Now! Or I drop you! A book review doesn’t have to be a vicious takedown in order to be interesting, but it should demonstrate some sense of a personality behind the work, of someone unafraid to deliver keen and original insights. Newspapers like the Washington Post and the San Francisco Chronicle do still have book sections, and there exist some publications devoted to reviews, like the Boston Review (BR), the New York Review of Books (NYRB), and the Los Angeles Review of Books (LARB). There are transnational publications, like the London Review of Books (LRB) and the Times Literary Supplement (TLS). All of these vary in their purposes and personalities: the LARB, a magazine for refugees from academia, is the Goth-ish graduate student who drops words like “epistemic” in an effort to impress their theory professor. The LRB, the most idiosyncratic (and usually the most lively) of the bunch, is that very clever and slightly high uncle who tells you about the latest book he’s been reading when you stop to chat at the Christmas party. By the end of the very long conversation, you will have learned absolutely nothing about the book, but you will have received some fantastic insights into the career and life of Lord Byron (later, a Google search will reveal that the book is about a 20-century physicist). The NYRB is that very boring family friend who has no idea how to talk to anyone who’s not a tenured professor and consequently spends most of his time in an armchair. The only person who will talk to him is the Book Review, and the two promptly engage in a competition to see who can drop the most quotations. Most of the newer review publications came about in the shadow of the Book Review. Some were formed as direct rivals (the New York Review of Books slyly took on a similar name at its inception in 1963). Others, like the LRB, which began life as an insert inside the NYRB and is famous for its long essays, usually on academic books, have consciously set out to be different. The Book Review, amidst all this, has resolutely stuck to its guns and persisted in being the most boring of the lot, holding on to its dullness as a badge of pride. Its age has meant that the Book Review has survived like and alongside the descendants of the robber barons who swooped into New York and stuck around long enough to place their names on public institutions, their money and philanthropy enabling them to buy respectability as a new aristocracy. Much of the Book Review’s reputation is based on lies and confabulation. For example: the famed bestseller list is, alas, utter bullshit. This fact first came to light in 1983, when William Peter Blatty, the best-selling author of The Exorcist, sued the Book Review for not including his novel Legion in its best-seller list. Blatty claimed that the book had been selling well enough to be placed there. Blatty lost the case because the Times admitted that its decisions about who is included are editorial and not purely based on quantitative figures. In other words, “Yes, you’re right, we ignored your book because we run on a lie. The bestseller list is not about the numbers, it’s about what we like!” Essentially, the Times admitted its “sales” list was meaningless (even as their website densely notes that their “methodology” involves sales). Speaking to Esquire in 2022, Temple University professor Laura McGrath, who teaches courses on the publishing world, “compares The New York Times’ list to the original recipe for Coca-Cola: ‘We have a pretty good idea of what goes into it, but not the exact amount of each ingredient.’” In 2013, Forbes wrote about authors gaming their way onto the list with bulk orders. Given all this, how and why does the Book Review, an armageddon-era cockroach scuttling around in the long shadows of nuclear towers, survive? Like its parent paper, the Book Review is less a cultural mirror (what is happening around you?) and more of a ladder for class ascension (who will or can you be?). The New York Times is not a paper of record as much as a guide to class assimilation and ascension: to read and absorb the Times is to learn (or so people hope) how to exist in a world that is in many ways brought into existence by the Times, one inhabited and controlled by the superrich. The paper’s real estate listings and reporting and its column “The Hunt” have long demonstrated that its core readership is either the very wealthy or those who aspire to be so. One column is titled, “She Realized Her American Dream With a Hamptons House” [that only cost $6.75 million]. Similarly, its “Vows” section features couples from wealthy and often celebrity families. Often, real estates and vows combine, as when wealthy newlyweds go looking for apartments. Over the years, the immensely wealthy have certainly grown more diverse, but their money remains the point. A recent wedding announcement about Sandy Dolores Yawn, a reality television celebrity, and her entrepreneur-gospel star wife, noted that their ceremony took place on a superyacht (we assume this is a term meant to denote a very, very, very big yacht, bigger than all the merely big yachts that the merely rich might use). New York is always a city of a new Gilded Age, each one representative of its era, and the Times is in charge of shepherding the denizens of each up the social ladder. As with clothing fashions, its fascination with the wealthy shifts according to the political tenor of the day. The paper might now adopt a sniggering tone towards Donald Trump, but in 1984, it was once deeply, madly in love with him: a 1976 profile began with the words, “He is tall, lean and blond, with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford.” In 1984, catching up with “The Expanding Empire of Donald Trump,” William E. Geist gushed about accompanying him on tours of his properties, without questioning the machinations behind his supposedly legendary dealmaking. The long article notes that Trump, who presented himself as a real estate magnate, had ditched his “flashy haberdashery” for more conservative “dark suits, white shirts, subdued ties and loafers.” Then, as now, the Times provided a seal of approval to an aspiring entrepreneur busily taking his family name out of Queens into Manhattan, where the newspaper’s imprimatur was one more step towards entrance into the elite(s) of New York. The Book Review is a ticket for entry into this world because one must not just be rich and successful, but cultured, able to engage in the topics of the day—and the best way to do that is through books. You might buy all the famed artworks you can afford, but to talk about them as a person of the class you’d like to occupy requires that you read all the “best” books that the Times will tell you about. The Book Review is like a culture sommelier, helping you sniff and sip through all the books, books, books, guiding you through an otherwise frightening world of words, words, words: it will tell you what to read or, at least, how to talk about the book you ought to read but might never get around to reading. (Similar to its NYT cousin, “The Ethicist” column, which instructs readers on proper—and often hideous—bourgeois morality, the Book Review will instruct you on proper bourgeois literary opinion.) To ensure its blandness, the Book Review engages in that ever popular and deeply cringe-inducing tradition that we might call the Dinner Party Syndrome: the tendency to valorize writers (at least the big names) as People You Might Love to Know and Invite to A Meal with Other Writers. Bits of this exist everywhere, but it’s especially pronounced in Elisabeth Egan’s breathy and mercifully brief interviews with authors, gathered in her regular Book Review column, “Inside the Best-Seller List.” Egan tells us that Barbara Kingsolver has established a tradition of including recipes in her books: “In Demon Copperhead, a beloved character makes black-eyed peas for New Year’s Day. Readers can practically smell the carrots, onions and essence of Christmas ham.” And she cannot resist a bad pun: “Kingsolver also baked in an important message about addiction.” The Author here is a BFF and down-home neighbor: famous writers are Just Like Us! In an interview with the suspense writer Mary Kubica, we learn that she fosters as many as a dozen cats at a time. As Egan tells us, warmly, “If you think about it, the process [of the family adjusting to the adopted cats] isn’t so different from writing books.” We can see the long-lasting effects of such an approach even in the most cerebral-seeming publications. In a recent Yale Review essay, Merve Emre writes rhapsodically about “The Critic as Friend,” ending with her assurance to the reader: “I can suggest that you may come to feel as I feel about a person, a book, that you may want to know it as intimately as I do. I can help it pass gracefully from my hand to another’s, from the present into the future.” The BFF-fication of the critic-subject pair finds its expression in the unhealthy parasocial relationships that authors find themselves compelled to develop with readers on platforms like BookTok and Bookstagram. The result is that they can no longer retreat as, say, Joan Didion was able to, behind their literal walls, to maintain a distance from overly friendly and sometimes dangerously enthusiastic fans. They must instead give in to their demands for actual social relations and are caught in a world of perennial selfies, both virtual and in real life. And yet, as Elizabeth Gilbert found out, no amount of such intimacy can guarantee that your readers will come to your support: her Instagram has long been filled with breathy videos that often start with greetings like, “Hello, Family!” or “It’s your Lizzy!” and end with phrases like, “Sending you a lot of love!” Despite her relentlessly sunny chirpiness, all delivered in the style of an Aunty Karen, Gilbert still felt compelled to cancel herself. In keeping with its sommelier role, the Times only bothers with the Big Five publishers (soon, we suspect, to become The Only One, given the thrust towards consolidation). Forbidden from this world are books from independent publishers and writers without the cachet of known agents and publishers that Times employees are bound to bump into at literary parties. Self-published books (horrors!) are, of course, out of the question. The Times has never challenged or even really interrogated the increasingly exploitative structure of the publishing world and, indeed, many of its main critics, such as Kakutani, Dwight Garner, and Barry Gewen, have been able to use their status as critics at the paper to land publishing deals with places like Penguin Random House, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and Norton. While they and others might argue that their talent brought them such enviable deals, we should wonder aloud (as few are willing to do) if their (supposed) ability to make or break writing careers did not in some way help them to obtain their publishing contracts. This brings up the complex and occasionally thorny issue of ethics. The Times’s handbook of Ethical Journalism can be found online, and the paper’s critics, like A.O Scott and Dwight Garner, have also posted individual statements online. But, as with its war reporting, ethics magically disappear. Dwight Garner, senior editor at the Book Review from 1998 to 2008 and currently a book critic, is married to Cree LeFavour, who has published a handful of cookbooks, a novel, and a memoir, some of which are mentioned (more than once) or reviewed in the Times. She has also frequently written book reviews. Sometimes there is mention of the fact that she is married to Garner. Food and wine writer Florence Fabricant favorably reviewed a new brand, Rocket Broth, noting only that the line is the creation of “Sheryl Moller, a certified health practitioner and nutrition guide, and Cree LeFavour, a cookbook writer…” LeFavour’s father, Bruce LeFavour, was a well-known chef. His 2019 obituary in the paper notes that she confirmed his death, but it does not mention her marriage to Garner or that she is also a critic at the paper. Readers ought to know that books and broths recommended by the Times happen to be written and produced by someone who works at the paper (her reviews in the print edition occupy prime real estate) and whose husband occupies an influential position at the paper. But then, as we know from the poor quality of the Times’s coverage, such as their now-debunked Oct. 7 “mass rape” story, “ethics” at the Times is a fungible commodity. And then there is the matter of race and ethnicity. Like every other publication of its ilk, including the New Yorker, the Book Review has been accused, justly, of being blazingly white. Kakutani is Japanese American (and perhaps the most powerful woman of color to ever have occupied such a position anywhere), and Gilbert Cruz replaced Pamela Paul in July 2022. There are more people of color reviewing books, and more books by people of color are being reviewed, certainly. And yet: the Book Review remains blindingly white in its outlook, moving between a discomfort with unfamiliar voices and styles to outright racism. The Book Review proves that whiteness—not as a racial identity but as a particular worldview—doesn’t need actual white people to extend its dominion. Karan Mahajan, reviewing Zadie Smith’s The Fraud, notes approvingly that she has a “multicultural eye,” and while we might imagine a giant ocular being surveying the London of the novel, it’s not clear what this brings to the book, which he mildly critiques as uneven in structure before quickly moving on with fulsome praise. But if a writer of the stature of Smith has produced an unevenly structured book, can it really be a fulfilling read or is the reviewer simply assuring white readers that Smith has, yet again, provided a lively cast of non-white people for their pleasure? As for white critics incapable of engaging with the perceived Other: consider Dwight Garner’s review of the Mexican writer Álvaro Enrigue’s You Dreamed of Empires, in which he writes: “There are many names in this novel, and they can blur. To American ears, some of the most magnificent—Ahuitzotl, Xocoyotzin—sound like elite anti-depressants of the sort that only Sofia Coppola and Bad Bunny can source.” Some commenters on social media pointed out that this is not only a deeply racist joke, but that the book includes a guide to pronouncing the names. Garner wrote this in 2024 (two years after Cruz took over), not 1954, as you might expect given its old-timey racism. Reading his words, I was reminded of a colleague’s boss who told his Indian employees that he couldn’t be bothered to learn their “difficult” names and would simply refer to all of them as “Ganesh.” Garner’s review of Enrigue’s book is a positive one, but he cannot resist several jabs, like his point that the writer, who has published several works translated into several languages worldwide, “has probably been best known as half of a literary power couple” and that “before their divorce, they were profiled in Vogue, adorably sharing a cigarette.” A white author featured in Vogue as part of a glamorous couple would have been written about with far more reverence, minus the sarcastic “adorably.” Here, Garner treats Enrigue as a curiosity. “Look,” he seems to say, “This adorable little foreigner can actually write! And haha, look at him preening in Vogue like one of us.” But blatant racism is not the only problem: works by non-white authors are rendered as tokenistic, considered worthy not for their brilliance as novels or nonfiction but as the work of racial and ethnic Others who have something to show us—a part of, say, the immigrant experience. Bich Minh Nguyen’s 2007 memoir, Stealing Buddha’s Dinner, is about growing up as a Vietnamese refugee and the now-standard “torn between two cultures” experience that included a version of the Bento Box story: an immigrant child is mocked for their food and… you can fill in the rest because this trope became so ubiquitous that it is now dismissed as clichéd. Nguyen, who has since changed her first name to Beth, wrote that first memoir when she was 33. Now, at 49, she has written a new one, Owner of a Lonely Heart, that continues the theme of her life story (really, there is only one) but with a new emphasis: her biological mother who stayed behind. But—worry not!—this memoir, reviewed by Sara Austin, also discusses food. Austin writes that Nguyen “was marked as a refugee by hostile stares and cruel jokes as a child, and as an adult in the way she can never quite unpack her bags in a new space.” Same book, new twists. Austin’s review says little about what Nguyen’s work contributes to the ever-growing genre of immigrant memoirs, has nothing to say about its politics, and only notes how it might make the reader feel: it is “poignant,” and “deeply ruminative and therapeutically self-indulgent.” Such is the kind of non-white fiction and nonfiction most favored by the Book Review. The immigrant’s story only exists to make us feel in a therapeutic way. This is not to blame Nguyen but a publishing and book review industry that seems unable to publish or review books by people who happen to be immigrants and are not just conduits for the same old stories. Nguyen had previously written two novels about similar life experiences but in fiction: like a squirrel hoarding its nuts for winter in its cheeks, she must feel compelled to carefully portion out bits and pieces of her life for literary consumption over the course of her writing career. Perhaps, in another decade, she will have the opportunity to capture a different slice of immigrant life, mining herself for yet another memoir (what might it be like to be the mother of second-generation immigrant children? we wonder, breathlessly). Might we ever reach a time when an immigrant writer writes about something other than stock immigrant experiences? Despite any appearance of autonomy, Nguyen and others like her are not free to create non-traditional immigrant narratives because the responses of reviewers create a closed loop of influence: when reviewers only react positively to the same stale stories and cannot conceive that the darkies also have interesting lives unrelated to their immigration status, publishers and editors are more likely to demand the same stock texts about immigration or, really, anything else. The Book Review may well wither and die under the weight of its own irrelevance, but it has had deleterious and long-term effects on writers and publishers—and it does not serve readers who look for work that disrupts their assumptions. Instead, the Book Review assumes they just want the same old boring oatmeal (immigrant readers, for instance, might be fed up with the same old trauma narratives). There are better and more interesting ways to think about books and book culture. One is to start thinking and actively writing about the economics of book publishing as part of the practice of reviewing books. Where the Book Review has for too long perpetuated stereotypes of books as fetish objects and authors as Sparkling Snowflakes we want to bring home to Mother, a better and more incisive book review culture would locate books firmly inside the material world, not outside of it. In this, podcasts—with more freedom and time and less pressure from traditional media—may be going in better, unexplored directions. Andrew Hankinson’s nonfiction podcast Logroll features writers who talk eloquently about their books within the context of the economics of publishing. In one episode, Hankinson talks to Sally Hayden, an independent researcher and author of My Fourth Time We Drowned, about refugees seeking to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Africa to Europe only to end up in detention centers in Libya. The conversation deftly connects the enormous difficulties facing these migrants with the trouble she had finding financial support for the project, all without being pedantic or engaging in white saviorism. Backlisted, a fiction podcast fronted by John Mitchinson and Andy Miller, considers little-known authors or lesser-known books by famous authors. The two share a deeply infectious enthusiasm for their subjects and a keen knowledge of literary forms and histories, proving that a “love for books” does not have to mean a choice between weird parasociality and excruciating dryness. In more conventional outlets: the Washington Post’s Ron Charles writes that Garth Halberg’s recent The Second Coming could have done with serious editing. Charles is not engaging in a snarky takedown but reflecting on an industry that churns out books, especially by star authors, without investing in committed editors. Editing was once considered an essential part of publishing, but this basic attention to detail is “unheard of today under a business model banking on the continual release of bestsellers and copycat stories.” Or, at least, considered secondary: I recently reviewed a book with passages repeated across chapters, a clear sign that no one at the prestigious imprint had bothered to give it a basic once-over before it went to print. In the Boston Globe, Lorraine Berry was one of the few (if any) book critics who pointed out that Barbara Kingsolver’s Demon Copperhead, based in Appalachia, is “a form of poverty porn, a slum tour where pity is the price of the ride.” (Berry also wrote about “A Day in the Life of a Freelancer” for Literary Hub, a rare piece where a writer discusses the near impossibility of creating a writing life of any stability or comfort unless one possesses independent wealth.) It is, in short, possible to take a deep pleasure in books and the act of reading without submitting to a Book Review-led, ah, fiction that A Life in Books stands apart from the material conditions of the world. The way forward is not to replicate or improve the Book Review but to be done with it and its anodyne presentation, after cataloging its effects on book culture. More works by small indie presses need to be considered in more outlets, and “self-published” should not always be so stigmatized. We might also consider regularly reviewing books of the past, instead of only bowing to the fashions generated by major publishers. There will undoubtedly be resistance to much of this and, sadly, writers are often the most obstinate about perpetuating myths about books and publishing. Esquire’s Kate Dwyer regularly reports on the publishing world, but her work is based on interviews with celebrity authors like Ayad Akhtar and Tom Perrotta, who are published by the Big Five, get excellent advances, and whose success and/or class status means they don’t have to take on day jobs to pay the bills. In a recent article on debut novels “failing” to launch, she again focused on books at the Big Five, thus reproducing the idea—made popular by the Book Review—that those are what matter most and what should be counted. In such ways, we see the lingering effects of the cultish era (and aura) of reviewers like Kakutani and the mythology of the publishing world created by the Book Review. The dawn of the internet did not bring about a democratization of book reviews for the better—let us look again at Goodreads as an example of what can happen and then, quickly, look away. We still need critics to review publications that bring in intellectual and other histories while making judgments about books but without fetishizing books or authors. Good book reviews take their subjects and genres seriously: a romance novel deserves the same consideration as a satire of, oh, say, the publishing world. The style and purpose of the publication matter: a scholarly review will require a different set of facts and suppositions and a demonstration that the reviewer knows the history of a book’s subject; a website devoted to fans of an author or genre might allow for more emotional responses tempered by some kind of critical appraisal; and an outlet like the Boston Globe is more concerned with communicating ideas to a larger, broader range of readers. Even with all these differences, there are still some basic principles of reviewing: reviews should in some way let readers know whether or not they should buy or borrow the book; readers should be able to trust that there are no conflicts of interest (consider, again, LeFavour and Garner). If a book is about 1950s suburban planning, it is pointless to spend three-quarters of the review ranting about gender imbalances in the workplaces of the time. We get it: you have a feminist politics, yay, but does the book provide an interesting history of its subject? Basic questions should be answered in some way: is the book’s thesis provable? If a novel, does it fulfill the basic requirements of plot and character? If it’s the kind of fiction that eschews such old-fashioned conventions, fine, but does it engage a reader in any way or is it simply like the sticker on a new Hermès bag: it doesn’t exist, and if you have to ask, you don’t know its value? Most of all, a review should deliver an opinion (this may seem like an obvious fact but, again, consider the Book Review). Kakutani retired by taking a buyout from her employer as the paper struggled to restructure and cut costs. In the years since her departure, she has written lavishly produced books that offer nothing more than warmed-over liberal takes on “democracy,” a favorite subject of hers. They have not gone over well: reviewing her 2018 The Death of Truth in the Times, Chris Hayes wrote with the despair of a man who wondered how to retrieve lost hours, observing that “it feels like spending a few hours scrolling through the #Resist hashtag on Twitter.” Her more recent The Great Wave: The Era of Radical Disruption and the Rise of the Outsider can be described entirely by its title and reads like a transcript of a TED talk: a simple and simplistic claim, repeated ad nauseam with great sincerity. Despite a lackluster response to her books and even searing critiques, Kakutani will probably keep getting book contracts while far more talented and interesting writers struggle even with article pitches as publications everywhere shutter or struggle to find resources. The Book Review, in all its stodgy glory, continues to exist. A 2006 C-Span interview with its employees featured editors talking about the seemingly complicated processes that bring it to life, but the Review to date has no explanation for why a “best-selling” author like Miranda July might receive the attention of no fewer than three separate print pieces (invaluable real estate) and a podcast devoted to her latest book, All Fours, while independent publishers and debut writers struggle to get their copies seen. Does the Book Review create the market for a book or reflect it? How much of the coverage of July’s book has to do with her status as a Hollywood-adjacent influencer-style figure, possessed of the kind of glamor rarely seen in the publishing world? Even if it disappears tomorrow, the Book Review’s lasting legacy will be that it perpetuated the inequalities of a publishing world and replicated its false and damaging hierarchies by only paying attention to stardom or the potential thereof. It creates a demand for tired stories, repackaged endlessly in new guises and, too often, the publishing industry forces writers to write towards the Book Review. Over the course of its long existence, it has shaped literary tastes without any real commitment to appraisal or critique, and it has taken pride in its ability to carry on a tradition of nothingness, no real engagement with books, only an often smarmy, worshipful reverence for (certain) books and (certain) writers. In a 2004 review of Dale Peck’s Hatchet Jobs, John Leonard—who hated the book—offered himself up as an exemplar of the best kind of critic. He reveals that, years ago, the Times had asked him to review John Cheever’s last novel, after the assignment had been turned down by many other critics who had balked because the book was not that good and they didn’t want to simply perform what Leonard called “a random act of kindness” to Cheever, who happened to be dying at the time. Leonard revealed, cheerily, that he was the one who agreed to review the novel because, “it never occurred to me that a thank-you note to a wonderful writer, a valediction as it were, would get me kicked out of any club I wanted to belong to, so I immediately said yes.” In other words, Leonard was unafraid to admit he had no integrity as a reviewer, and the Times was happy to print his review.2 As Succession’s Logan Roy might put it, these are not serious people. It is easy to dismiss any criticism of the Book Review by claiming that it does not matter or that it is simply part of a mainstream publishing world. But as many writers know too well, the shoddy standards set by the Review have long tentacles, creating book markets even in the indie world (where trauma narratives and stock immigrant stories still seem to rule). Ultimately, much of the conversation around books and publishing ignores a vital fact: what we need is not a world where writers might aspire to gigantic advances or viral reviews to sell their books but one where they are supported in their work and are free to create and perhaps even fail—to tweak Dwyer’s judgmental term—in their endeavors without worrying about their next month’s rent or meals. We could continue to have long and ultimately meaningless conversations about “The Role of Critics and Criticism” (Emre has created something of a cottage industry in this realm of thought), but these usually ignore—and this bears repeating—the material conditions of publishing. Writers are not creative geniuses spinning books out of thin air but people who have to eat and find shelter while pursuing their work (the same is true of critics, unless, like Emre, they exist in that bubble somewhere between academia and influencer culture). Talking about the economics of publishing does not mean that books are rendered less meaningful or even, dare I say, less magical, less able to transport us from everyday life. But we can (and should) also think about books and their markets as elements of a constructed reality. A bestseller is marked as such by a meaningless gold star on a book cover, which tells us nothing about actual numbers, its quality, or whether a reader ought to read it. Whose books are reviewed or not depends on any number of unseen factors (including whether or not you are at the right parties or, you know, married to the right people). “Diversity” in publishing is often another way to compel non-white authors to provide cultural therapy to white readers. Online and real-life discussions about the influence of the Book Review (waning or not) often result in calls to support more independent publishers, who cannot afford to hand out sustainable advances to writers. The underlying logic here is that writers are on their own: if a writer truly wants to write, they will simply find a way. But this assumes that a writer is not a professional writer consumed by their work but, rather, someone who works on the side, perhaps after a long day at work or on the weekends, for whom writing is a hobby. Such an attitude also leaves untouched the world created by the Book Review, where only a few authors receive massive advances (Lena Dunham’s $3.5 million comes to mind, as does the Obamas’ $65 million) and others don’t make enough to actually live on but must still, somehow, write. In the meantime, too many writers are persuaded by publications like Esquire that they will be the Special Ones to get big advances when, in fact, the system is rigged. This ecosystem, where writing is simply not considered labor, remains untouched. The solution is not to continue the dichotomous system where the Book Review and its kin survive by only reviewing Big Five or academic publishers while indie presses (supposedly) deliver different fare. It is also not to fetishize ill-paid “indie” writing and the idea that good writers will just keep writing, because that simply means that “good” writers will also have to be independently wealthy to even write for small presses. For any real change to occur, we have to strip bare the fabrications and confabulations upon which so much of the publishing industry is built. Revealing the cracks and regimes of power within the NYT’s Book Review is only a start. To build a new ecosystem means admitting that the old one is rotten to the core. Karl Marx, as we have pointed out several times in this magazine, had to keep pawning his winter coat to survive and could never have produced his work without the financial support of Friedrich Engels. What is true of the original Marxist is also true of countless novelists who have relied on friends, families, lovers, and clients to help keep them writing. We can fantasize about and through books all we want, but we cannot wish away the fact that books are made in and of the world itself. This includes the books we’ll never read because writers have been denied the means to create them. notes 1.

Elizabeth Hardwick wrote \"The Decline of Book Reviewing\" in Harpers in 1959, and then went on to co-found the NYRB with Robert Silver during a big publishing strike. In general, stuff like this is insanely inside baseball and navel gazing for the book review industry (of which little remains of the old glory days). That said, I don't know anyone into literature who takes the NYTBR seriously. That the Best Seller list is a gamified black box is basically an open secret. The NYTBR, in particular, has become far too interconnected into the MFA-publishing-literature industrial complex. The reviews are so bland and milquetoasty because so much MFA-lit is bland as all hell and the reviews are just marketing. The NYRB and the LRB are orders of magnitude better reading than the NYTBR, even if this article seems to criticize them (unfoundedly, in my opinion) as fuddy or old fashioned. They're not traditional \"reviews\" in the sense that they usually don't come around to saying whether a book is good or bad, though; they're essays that use the books reviewed as launch vehicles for pushing the ideas in them into new directions or put under a new light. The NYTBR, in contrast, often reads as ad copy or toothless summary (the latter being the plague that has infected nearly all film criticism as well). There has also been a big resurgence in smaller mags, like N+1 (now an elder statesmen of the new upstarts), The Drift, The European Review of Books (heavy focus on translation), and many others that have excellent, lively, criticism. Also subreddits like r/truelit are a great way to expose yourself to new or interesting books. I usually find a book to add to my TBR list once or twice a week. Is the writing always up to par with professional publications? Not always, but sometimes it honestly is. (r/truelit does have a strong slant towards formal experimentation, though, which some people aren't a fan of. People more interested in \"the classics\" or contemporary-lit can find great recs still in r/literature.) reply cafard 8 hours agoparentI hardly have the time to read the books I want to read. My second cup of coffee on Sunday morning is about the time I'm willing to give to reading about books somebody else wants me to read (or not), and for that the NYTBR is ok. Anthony Trollope give a chapter to criticism in his autobiography, which you can find at Gutenberg.org (else I wouldn't be quoting it). The second-last paragraph concludes And readers will also find that by devoting an hour or two on Saturday to the criticisms of the week, they will enable themselves to have an opinion about the books of the day. The knowledge so acquired will not be great, nor will that little be lasting; but it adds something to the pleasure of life to be able to talk on subjects of which others are speaking; and the man who has sedulously gone through the literary notices in the Spectator and the Saturday may perhaps be justified in thinking himself as well able to talk about the new book as his friend who has brought that new book on the tapis, and who, not improbably, obtained his information from the same source. reply jfim 17 hours agoparentprevIn this context, what does MFA stand for?

It includes an imaginary house and was painted from memory because he wasn't allowed to paint in his room (medical treatment in a total institution), but he was allowed to use a spare room in the half-full asylum which was normally for the wealthy (obvious). That said, he considered it a painting from nature, rather than an \"abstraction\", a form which was preferred by Gaugin in order to indicate harmony between man and nature (a fin de siècle concern which also directly lead to the rejections of liberal democracy and bourgeois society in the early 20th Century). On his own account, the subject matter of stars connotes a spiritual hope — and you can make what you will of the more specific religous and astronomical interpratations that came later. In a narrow sense, there's no political art except electoral propaganda, in a broad sense anything made by humans is political. So I don't find the game of definitions is not particularly interesting. It's not even that interesting whether the political content of art is intentional or self-concious on the part of the author or whether it's imposed by others.

Art is strongly related to culture, and culture is strongly related to politics. The fact that art these days is very much viewed in a political frame, in the US in this case, is because politics have taken a huge role in US culture. Like, it's all American people seem to be thinking about these days. But no, art is not political in itself. Art, by some definition, is a thing whose meaning is created by who experiences it. Art might look political if the observer looks at it in a political point-of-view. But in reality, tinned faeces [1] are not a political statement nor a reflection on the human condition. They are literally just shit in a box. 1: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist%27s_Shit reply aorist 4 hours agorootparentI think this is too strong. If art has no inherent meaning, you can't say that it's not making a political statement, only that whether it's making a political statment or not is undefined. Otherwise, saying that something is not making a political statement is actually a very strong political statement in itself (e.g. things which are \"not political\" can't be negotiated or changed). reply AlbertCory 13 hours agorootparentprevNo, it isn't. That's only what people say if they insist on injecting politics into everything, even if it had gotten along fine without it. reply StefanBatory 11 hours agorootparentYou read a book YA about young heroine rebelling.

Do you enjoy adventure books, but avoid reading them because the content isn't weighty enough? Personally I powered through some boring-but-virtuous books in my youth, but now I'm a middle-aged adult with less free time, I've realised reading is supposed to be fun. So if a book review tells me a book is virtuous without telling me if it's fun, that book review isn't much use to me. reply Akronymus 7 hours agorootparentprev> You read a book YA about young heroine rebelling. > Why isn't she instead studying for her exams or volunteering for charity work?

Everything involving a substantial agreement or disagreement between persons is politics, that's what it means. Claiming that something 'should not be political' is almost always an assertion that your position is unassailably correct. reply AlbertCory 3 hours agorootparent> almost always an assertion that your position is unassailably correct. No, it it's an assertion that there's a whole world beyond your conception of \"politics\" and your position is impoverishing of the human experience. reply Jensson 8 hours agorootparentprevThe act of asking those questions is politics, you don't have to ask those questions. The real answer to those questions is that it makes the story more interesting. You are searching for a political reason where there is none. The question \"what makes a story interesting\" is philosophy and writing and not politics. reply AlbertCory 3 hours agorootparentprevumm... There you go injecting politics where it doesn't belong. Although the first sentence \"YA about young heroine rebelling\" is itself about politics really, so my comment doesn't apply. Authors write what they feel like writing and what readers feel like reading, not what some liberal arts professor wants to include in their \"the politics of YA books\" course. Let me assure you that neither the writer nor the reader are interested in your concerns. reply retox 13 hours agorootparentprevPeople can project politics onto anything, but art does not need to be political. reply fake-name 12 hours agorootparent> art does not need to be political Art is intrinsically political. If you think it's not political, that's because it's just taking a political position you either don't see, or one you agree with. The only way to remove politics from art would be to remove the people. reply 8f2ab37a-ed6c 10 hours agorootparentI drew a painting of a rock at the beach. What are the intrinsic politics of the painting? reply patates 10 hours agorootparentIs this art? What is the context? I can't tell without knowing the context. Who drew it? How did they draw it? Why did they draw it? What inspired them? Without understanding these aspects, nothing is art, or everything is art, and it loses its meaning. Yes, art is the projection of skill and beauty, but how we define skill and our perception of beauty also depend on context. You accepting the painting of the Mona Lisa as art tells something about you, while my grandfather rejecting it with the words \"my 7-year-old granddaughter can draw better\" tells something about him. This is inherently political. A modern art painting with color splashes is, in the most basic sense, not distinct from a 5-year-old playing with paint without context. With context, whether you accept it as art or not is political. > Politics is the set of activities associated with making decisions in groups or other forms of power relations among individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status. So even if you could argue that art itself is not political, you surely cannot argue that the perception of it isn't. reply Jensson 8 hours agorootparent> you surely cannot argue that the perception of it isn't. Your perception of it is, most people don't see art as political. Nobody would find a painting of a sea with a rock to be political, except really annoying people. reply patates 6 hours agorootparentI'm not really sure you didn't really read my comment or if this an unsuccessful attempt on appeal to absurdity. Anyway, funnily, the 1888 piece, \"The Rocks\", from Van Gogh was very political to show his impressionist alignment :) To repeat what a previous commenter said, nothing is political as long as they fit your political view. reply Jensson 3 hours agorootparent> To repeat what a previous commenter said, nothing is political as long as they fit your political view. I don't share the politics of Van Gogh, yet I don't feel \"The Rocks\" is political. So in general there are plenty of stuff that you wont find political even if you don't share the views, that is what people mean when they say an art piece isn't political. A person who says such an art piece is political is just trying to find politics in art where there isn't one. Even if the original artist says it is political it isn't, because there is no politics in the art the politics was in his statement that it is political. Art stands on their own free from the opinions of their creators. You can of course embed political messages into art pieces making them political, but this isn't such a case. If you can't deduce what politics the person is trying to convey just from the art piece alone then it isn't political. reply sva_ 10 hours agorootparentprevYour gracious political leaders have allowed you to sit on the beach and draw a picture, of course. reply lotsoweiners 3 hours agorootparentprevArt is something people do for enjoyment oftentimes. My kids enjoy drawing and painting and I fail to see the political message behind their artwork. reply abecedarius 8 hours agorootparentprev\"All art is political\" is like \"atheism is a religion\". Obviously true if politics is everything to you. I'd call it 'true' in the same self-referential way as \"dollars/bitcoin have value\": it holds to the extent everyone believes in it. It's worth asking if the world where it holds is a better one. reply atoav 3 hours agorootparentI disagree with your comparison. All art is political, because art relates itself to the society it is made in whether the artist likes it or not. Is a Nazi painter that paints totally apolitical pictures of landscapes while the genocide is happening one village over apolitical? i'd argue that this would be deeply political art, even if it wasn't meant to be just that. Taking no stance, while the world around you is happening is a political stance in itself. Being apolitical is also political – in a stark difference to various gods politics will also affect you and your life, if you don't believe in politics. reply abecedarius 2 hours agorootparentI did kind of say that to the extent the people around you make all of life political, you can't avoid that constructed social truth. But like the value of money it's a 'truth' conditioned on a particular equilibrium. There's another equilibrium where pushy haters of private life are a small minority. reply chiefalchemist 9 hours agorootparentprev> All art is political. By definition, all art should challenge the participant/consumer of it. That challenge can be personal, or something else. But all is not political. It only looks that way because in the current cultural environment The Politics Industrial Complex has over-developed (?) it's position in the hierarchy of the broader culture. It creases unhealthy biases etc to the point that We have forgotten \"The government needs us, we don't need it.\" Everything is not political. We as individuals still have influence. The PIC's lens isn't working. It's a false god. The sooner we change that, the better. reply aniviacat 9 hours agorootparentWhy should art challenge the participant? If I draw a painting of a pretty flower, that does not challenge you. It's just nice to look at. reply dsr_ 4 hours agorootparentWhich flower did you choose to paint? Why? Is it native, an import, a new arrival, or endangered? Is there cultural context? The Victorian Brits encoded messages into flowers; some of those meanings are still current. (Give a friend a red rose, another friend a potted daisy. Do they react differently?) A red poppy is a symbol of one thing, specifically because of culture. Chrysanthemums mean different things in America and Japan. And if the artist writes a statement: \"This is just a painting of a pretty flower.\" that too is a political statement. reply aniviacat 4 hours agorootparentIf everything is political, then all art is political, too. But this definition makes the term \"political\" meaningless. If you choose a definition for \"political\" which has actual use, not all art is political. reply chiefalchemist 5 hours agorootparentprevThen it's just whatever it is. Air? Beige? \"Pretty\"?

I’ve read NYRoB since the 1990s and you are right, they had and have a lot of really good writing and reviews. The thing OP unforgivably misses is that today’s NYRoB is not the same as a decade ago. The editors have changed and it’s noticeably less “clubby” (less, as they used to say, “New York Review of each other’s books”). Also, worryingly thinner? So the characterization in OP is out of date, to the extent that it ever had some truth. Also, what’s the fucking problem with writing at the level of sophistication of a tenured professor? * Also, someone has to toss this quote in somewhere: >> Thirty-six years earlier, disgust with the same ubiquitous, thin gruel [in NYTBR] had prompted Edmund Wilson to declare in the second issue of The New York Review of Books: “The disappearance of the Times Sunday book section at the time of the printers’ strike only made us realize it had never existed.” As quoted in: https://www.cjr.org/cover_story/goodbye_to_all_that_1.php reply shuckles 17 hours agoparentprevThe New York Times Book Review and New York Review of Books are different publications. reply zerocrates 16 hours agorootparentThey are, but the comment you replied to is quoting a part of the article that's offhandedly criticizing the New York Review of Books. reply Popeyes 9 hours agorootparentprevJust like functions, naming your book review publication in New York is hard. reply cageface 16 hours agorootparentprevYep I know.

She was the chief book critic of the arts section. The Book Review is a separate organization within the NYT, with an entirely separate editing staff. Sure sometimes critics like Kakutani and A.O. Scott would review things there, but it was always an assignment, not representative of the NYTBR. Generally, editors in the NYTBR strive to pick folks who are \"interesting\" to review the book rather than not, which leads to spicy reviews because they want to sell the Sunday section. This article is confused from the get go. reply karaterobot 18 hours agoprevYeesh, that was a long one. > there are still some basic principles of reviewing: reviews should in some way let readers know whether or not they should buy or borrow the book ... Most of all, a review should deliver an opinion. I think this is usually interpreted as saying the reviewer should tell me whether a book is bad or good, but I don't want reviewers to do that. Ignore the bad books; let them sink into obscurity on their own. My ideal book review outlet would only showcase books the reviewers personally thought were worthwhile, and the reviews would focus on what the reviewer themselves liked about the book, or (if not liked) at least thought was significant enough to present in their publication. Instead offer me what you think is best, make your case for it it with specifics, and entertain me with your own wit and insight if you can.

Any occasional whining / coverage of uninteresting material is usually just about mainstream comics from the Big Two, where a definite golden age has long been defined, and the era vulgaris is a foregone conclusion. Any indy stuff is covered because it's worthwhile, and the review itself is just additional color. reply zogrodea 9 hours agoprevI remember this quote from a 1930s book when the topic of book reviews come up, and I think it applies to NYT in particular. \"There are critics and reviewers, literary and artistic journals, which ought to be at work mitigating these evils and establishing contact between a writer or painter and the kind of audience he needs. But in practice they seldom seem to understand that this is, or should be, their function, and either they do nothing at all or they do more harm than good. The fact is becoming notorious; publishers are ceasing to be interested in the reviews their books get, and beginning to decide that they make no difference to the sales.\" The quote is about connecting writers with an audience interested in that kind of work, and allowing writers to receive feedback which will improve the writer's future output, which is a relationship beneficial to both. Without it, writers may be \"driven into a choice between commercialism and barren eccentricity\". I'm not sure the NYT book reviews help; they may do more damage than there would be without their interference. reply impure 11 hours agoprevThis is the way all writing is going.

I understand the desire and would prefer it myself, but a shift to opinionated reviews changes the game.
