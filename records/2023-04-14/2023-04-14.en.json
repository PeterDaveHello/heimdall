    "content": "Mission Local is informed that the San Francisco Police Department early this morning made an arrest in the April 4 killing of tech executive Bob Lee, following an operation undertaken outside the city\u2019s borders. The alleged killer also works in tech and is a man Lee purportedly knew.We are told that police today were dispatched to Emeryville with a warrant to arrest a man named Nima Momeni. The name and Emeryville address SFPD officers traveled to correspond with this man, the owner of a company called Expand IT.Multiple police sources have described the predawn knifing last week, which left the 43-year-old Lee dead in a deserted section of downtown San Francisco, as neither a robbery attempt nor a random attack. Rather, Lee and Momeni were portrayed by police as being familiar with one another. In the wee hours of April 4, they were purportedly driving together through downtown San Francisco in a car registered to the suspect. Some manner of confrontation allegedly commenced while both men were in the vehicle, and potentially continued after Lee exited the car. Police allege that Momeni stabbed Lee multiple times with a knife that was recovered not far from the spot on the 300 block of Main Street to which officers initially responded. This scenario would explain, in part, why Lee was walking through a portion of Main Street in which there is little to no foot traffic at 2:30 a.m. That was one of several incongruous circumstances surrounding Lee\u2019s violent death, which law-enforcement sources, from the get-go felt made it far from a straightforward or random crime. Nevertheless, some of Lee\u2019s fellow tech luminaries and a chorus of other influential voices portrayed this killing as part and parcel of a city awash in violent crime and on a descent into further chaos. While Lee is one of a dozen homicide victims in San Francisco this year, his is the only killing that has garnered national coverage \u2014 or, in most cases, even cursory local coverage. San Francisco\u2019s other homicide victims in 2023 are Gavin Boston, 40; Irving Sanchez-Morales, 28; Carlos Romero Flores, 29; Maxwell Maltzman, 18; Demario Lockett, 44; Maxwell Mason, 29; Humberto Avila, 46; Gregory McFarland Jr, 36; Kareem Sims, 43; Debra Lynn Hord, 57; and Jermaine Reeves, 52.The dozen homicides recorded in San Francisco as of April 13, 2023. Map by Will Jarrett. Basemap from Mapbox.San Francisco is home to much in the way of visible public misery, unnerving street behavior and overt drug use. Its property crime rate has long been high, and the police clearance rate for property crimes has long been minimal. But the city\u2019s violent crime rate is at a near-historic low, and is lower than most mid-to-large-sized cities.Today\u2019s arrest would appear to undermine the premise that Lee\u2019s violent death was due to street conditions in San Francisco. If the police do have their man, this was not a robbery gone bad nor a motiveless assault by some random attacker, but an alleged grievance between men who knew one another, which the suspect purportedly escalated into a lethal conflict.Homicides per 100,000 residents1816Over the past few years,homicides did rise in SanFrancisco \u2013 but they remainlow compared tohistoric trends1412108642019851990199520002005201020152020YearChart by Will Jarrett. Data from the California Department of Justice and the Census Bureau.Lee\u2019s death, however, was packaged in the media and on social media into a highlight reel of recent San Francisco misfortunes and crimes: large groups of young people brawling at Stonestown; the abrupt closure of the mid-market Whole Foods, leaving San Franciscans just eight other Whole Foods within city limits; the severe beating of former fire commissioner Don Carmignani in the Marina District, allegedly by belligerent homeless people \u2014 it all adds up to a feeling of a city coming undone.This manner of coverage, however, does not capture the actual lived experience of the vast majority of San Franciscans. It also omits potentially mitigating details of the individual events. Carmignani, for instance, was brutally struck in the head with a metal rod and hospitalized. But the lawyer for his alleged attacker claims that the former fire commissioner first pepper-sprayed the homeless man accused of beating him \u2014 which certainly would color this incident.Of note, police sources say that a series of homeless people had previously been pepper-sprayed in the Marina District prior to this instance.The arrest in the Lee case is a breaking story.

    "hn_content": "An arrest has been made in the San Francisco murder of Bob Lee, who was apparently killed by an \"entrepreneur\" who also worked in tech. Several comments on Hacker News bring up issues of homelessness, mental health, and drug addiction as potential factors in violent crime. Others suggest that the emotional reaction to this tragedy reveals how easily people can be drawn into a powerful narrative, even without supporting facts. Overall, the post generates discussion about the complex intersections between wealth, mental health, and violence in the tech industry and San Francisco more broadly.A tech entrepreneur's recent murder in San Francisco has prompted discussion on factors that may have led to the crime, including homelessness, drug addiction, and mental illness. However, commenters are cautioned against making generalizations about these issues; homeless individuals are, statistically speaking, no more likely to be violent than others, and mental illness and drug addiction should not be demonized. Rather than relying on personal biases, discussions should focus on factors like poverty and the impact of money. Some readers also find value in discussion, no matter how unpleasant.An HN post discusses crime rates in San Francisco, where the debate focuses on the usage of statistics versus direct anecdotes. While city-wide statistics may be misleading because violent crimes are often concentrated in specific parts frequented by a certain crowd, individual anecdotes are also problematic as they are colored by emotion and can cloud reality. The emotional appeal of personal anecdotes is often relied on to dismiss statistical conclusions, which is not helpful when trying to assess big problems such as crime rates. While official statistics may be less than useful because most victims of minor crimes do not file police reports, they still offer valuable information to observe trends.A Tech Times article provides an insider's perspective on the panhandling issue in San Francisco. Homelessness, drug addiction, and petty property crime are major problems that have persisted for decades. The promise of an overnight transformation leads to solutions that do not work, such as homelessness sweeps and policing non-violent property crime. The long-term solution is a community-involved approach to access resources for those living on the street, healing from addiction, and preventing petty property crimes for survival. Encampments built around navigation centers offer potential solutions, but involuntary mental health treatment centers and job training opportunities may also be necessary. The visible signs of homelessness, drug use, and urinating on the sidewalks affect the city's overall quality of life but do not necessarily lead to danger or increase in crime rates.Comments on a recent post highlight the complexity of the issues facing San Francisco. One user notes that actual Bay Area degeneration should be the determining factor in discussions surrounding the city's state. Another identifies a morality-driven approach to defining what makes a city great. Several users note that San Francisco's violent crime rate is among the lowest in major US cities, but quality of life crime remains high. The city's housing crisis is identified as the root cause of homelessness, property crime, and the outflux of residents. The disconnection between commonly perceived safety issues and quantitative crime data is also noted.Comments on a post discuss crime in San Francisco and other major cities, with some users sharing personal experiences of crime. Some compare crime rates between cities and question the relevance of discussing crime in relation to an individual murder case. One comment points out that data may not reflect non-reported crimes, particularly those related to homelessness and drug use. Users also discuss the importance of relying on actual data rather than sensationalist media or personal anecdotes. An HN user recommends evaluating crime levels in relation to poverty rather than comparing different cultures.A murder of a crypto executive in San Francisco has prompted discussions about the city's crime problem being overblown, with data pointing to worse murder rates in other states. The majority of those who claim that the crime problem is overblown, however, live in nicer, low-crime areas of San Francisco. Many express fear of crime and have difficulty accepting data-informed analysis, often behaving as if they're worried it might be contagious. There is rampant speculation around the cause of the crime and what the victim may have been involved in, with little input from the actual investigation.An HN user discusses the recent attack on the fire commissioner, refuting claims that it was not a random attack. Another HN user argues that people should stop paying attention to tech industry people's opinions. The recent SF murder reflects both narratives of the city's decline, with concern about not sensationalizing the situation. The lesson is not to jump to global conclusions based on one single case, but the emotional narrative about San Francisco's decline is correct. High homicide rates in certain areas often mean that victims are in connected social graphs. Police can address homicide rates by intervening in these areas.Comments on a tragedy in San Francisco caution against blaming the homeless and point out that violent crimes are usually committed by individuals known to the victim. One commenter cites a study linking the removal of lead from gasoline to lower crime rates in the '70s. Others note that there are legitimate viewpoints and approaches to the city's struggles with homelessness, drugs, and crimes. HN users discuss violent crime and statistics, with one saying not all violent crimes are committed by people known to their victims but most are. Another commenter criticizes the \"culture warriors\" who use such incidents to advance existing opinions. Applications for YC Summer 2023 are open.",

    "content": "HOME > PIRACY >Last week, a German court ruled that Uberspace is liable for hosting the website of youtube-dl, an open-source tool that allows people to download content from YouTube. The owner of the hosting company warns that this \"ridiculous\" and \"devastating\" verdict opens the door to privatized censorship.In 2020, the RIAA infuriated many players in the open source community by targeting YouTube-ripping tool youtube-dl.The RIAA sent a takedown notice to GitHub, alleging that the software bypassed technological protection measures, in violation of the DMCA.GitHub initially complied but later changed course. After consulting legal experts, including those at the EFF, it restored the youtube-dl repository. GitHub also launched a million-dollar defense fund to assist developers in similar disputes.Targeting Youtube-dl\u2019s HostThis episode was a massive setback for the music industry, which had been fighting stream-ripping tools for years. However, instead of laying down their arms, the music companies went after Uberspace, youtube-dl\u2019s website hosting company in Germany.A few days ago this lawsuit resulted in a clear victory for Sony Entertainment, Warner Music Group and Universal Music. The district court of Hamburg essentially ruled that youtube-dl violates the law as it bypasses YouTube\u2019s technological protection measures.Going one step further, the court also concluded that as a host, Uberspace can be held liable for youtube-dl\u2019s activity. The hosting provider received a takedown notice for the website in the past but continued to host it. According to Uberspace, the software wasn\u2019t clearly illegal but the court ruled that the company should have known better.With the dust beginning to settle, TorrentFreak spoke with Uberspace owner Jonas Pasche, who has decided to appeal the ruling. According to Pasche, the court made a big mistake that could have far-reaching consequences.Uberspace Responds to Court VerdictFor starters, Pasche still doesn\u2019t believe that it\u2019s clear that youtube-dl violates copyright law. More importantly for his own business, however, is the court\u2019s finding that a hosting company can be held liable for doubting the validity of a takedown request.German law requires hosting companies to remove the content as soon as they learn about \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018obvious\u2019 illegal activity. That\u2019s an easy decision in many cases, but Uberspace paused for thought in youtube-dl\u2019s case, presumably for good reason.\u201cJust because someone \u2018claims\u2019 that something hosted with us is illegal, it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be true. So when we received the notice from the Rasch law firm that we\u2019re hosting youtube-dl which they claimed to be illegal, our first reaction was: Really? Is it..? Let\u2019s do some research,\u201d Pasche tells us.\u201cAnd boy, did we do some research. Starting with a simple Google search for \u2018youtube download legal\u2019, there is a TON of sources \u2013 well-known, serious, public magazines \u2013 basically all stating: Yeah, it\u2019s totally legal to download videos from YouTube.\u201dUberspace knows that answers that appear through Google should be carefully weighed. So Uberspace continued looking for answers. The company reviewed YouTube\u2019s protection measures, for example, which didn\u2019t appear to involve any type of encryption for free and publicly available videos.\u2018Clearly Not Clearly Illegal\u2019Also, Uberspace couldn\u2019t find any claims from YouTube itself that their content has effective copy protection. If anything, the company\u2019s searches suggested that the opposite was true.For example, GitHub eventually concluded that youtube-dl wasn\u2019t violating US copyright law, a decision that was based on input from the legal experts at EFF. In addition, Uberspace consulted a lawyer in Germany who reached a similar conclusion.\u201cWe also got ourselves informed about \u2018fair use\u2019 under German law. We even appointed a lawyer, at our own cost, who did his own research and also came to the conclusion that what youtube-dl does is perfectly legal and covered by fair use,\u201d Uberspace\u2019s owner tells us.Uberspace Keeps Youtube-dl OnlineBased on its own investigation into youtube-dl, Uberspace decided to keep the website online. The company informed Rasch, the music company\u2019s law firm, of its decision, which responded with some follow-up questions.For example, the law firm wanted to know how many times the youtube-dl software had been downloaded. However, Uberspace couldn\u2019t answer this question since it didn\u2019t host or distribute the actual code, which was stored on GitHub.\u201cI guess they didn\u2019t like my answer, but that\u2019s their problem, not mine. How about asking GitHub for download numbers? We suggested that to them! I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t even ask over there.\u201dThe biggest disappointment and threat ultimately comes from the court\u2019s conclusion that Uberspace is liable for youtube-dl\u2019s alleged wrongdoing because it failed to take the website offline. Apparently, Uberspace should have known that youtube-dl was illegal, even though that wasn\u2019t clear.\u201cThis is ridiculous. And it\u2019s devastating,\u201d Pasche says, fearing that the court order will have a chilling effect on the hosting business.\u201cThe consequences of this will be that hosting providers receiving complaints will most likely kick out their customers without a court ruling, for things that might be perfectly legal. Otherwise, they have to fear being held responsible by a court that might see things differently.\u201dHosting Companies as Internet Police?In a way, the court order requires hosting companies to police their network, which requires weighing advanced legal issues that even legal experts have different opinions on.Ultimately, many hosting companies will likely take the cautious option and terminate customer accounts to avoid liability.\u201cThis court decision basically takes away the option of staying neutral for a hosting provider,\u201d Pasche says.\u201cThey will be unable to say \u2018it might be unlawful, but it\u2019s not really clear. Let a court decide about this, and until then continue to host it. After all, we have a hosting contract to fulfill!\u2019 In the future, they will have to say \u2018It might be unlawful, so better let\u2019s get rid of it, without a court order\u2019.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just too risky to insist on a court decision because we might face damages for \u2018helping\u2019 with illegal activity.\u201dPasche also finds it bizarre that the court ordered Uberspace to answer various questions it can\u2019t answer. This includes the number of youtube-dl downloads, which is information that it simply doesn\u2019t have.GitHub?There is a much more logical target in this case in the form of GitHub, which actually hosts the software. For some reason, the music companies have decided to go after Uberspace instead.\u201cGitHub isn\u2019t some shady bulletproof hoster located on some cozy island. It\u2019s a Microsoft-owned corporation. They have processes to deal with complaints. They have a legal team. They could perfectly block youtube-dl, even just in Germany,\u201d Pasche says.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of suing the hosting provider of a website pointing to that GitHub repository, when they had perfectly established ways to file a complaint with the hosting provider of the actual software they want to see banned?\u201dThe music companies did approach GitHub earlier, of course, but went after Uberspace when their DMCA takedown was denied. According to Pasche, the music companies chose to pick an \u2018easier\u2019 target after this setback.\u201cIt really looks like they just didn\u2019t want to face what they might regard as a \u2018real\u2019 opponent; Microsoft. Instead, they\u2019re going for what they might have regarded as an \u2018easy target\u2019. This is exactly the behavior of bullies.\u201dLegal Battle ContinuesUberspace doesn\u2019t like being bullied, so it will continue to fight back through the appeal court. In fact, the company is determined to fight this battle to the bitter end, whatever it takes.Pasche believes that the recent court order effectively opens the door to increased censorship, and he hopes to shut that door again before it\u2019s too late.\u201cThis is a shameful day for the freedom of speech. It\u2019s paving the way for privatized censorship. Do we as a society really want this? We strongly believe we\u2019re on the right side of history here. Everyone except the music industry knows this,\u201d he concludes.",

    "hn_content": "The banning of YouTube-DL hosting is seen as a move towards privatized censorship. The RIAA and MPAA prioritizing money and power over decency is not surprising. The Hamburg court's decision is seen as another example of siding with media industry for decades. The issue is not about piracy but rather, censorship. There is a power imbalance with the consumer having no ability to negotiate in unilateral policies. Consumers giving up their rights with these agreements is a form of entitlement.The concept of \"intellectual property\" and its restriction on the free flow of information is debated in the comments. Some argue that it is unreasonable to treat intangible objects as physical property, while others argue that creative industries rely on intellectual property to incentivize content creation. The discussion also touches on the distinction between copyright infringement and plagiarism. However, there is no clear consensus on whether or not intellectual property should be considered true property or if it should be limited in scope and duration.The article discusses the coordination problem of funding TV shows, and the potential for the internet to solve it; meanwhile, a user argues that proposed regulations would unfairly suppress innocent parties who must prove their innocence, and others argue for the legitimacy of YouTube-DL as a tool rather than piracy facilitator. Privatized censorship is also raised as a point, with Clarifire pointed out as a representative example of the phenomenon. The time-sensitive nature of funding coordination is stressed, and a discussion of freedom of association concludes the post.The article discusses private censorship and the importance of non-discrimination. HN users suggest that protecting specific groups of people is important, and the use of CDNs by websites is due to distributed DDoS attacks. Invidious provides an alternative to YouTube, and technological protection measures should not affect a media's legality, according to some users. Additionally, users discuss the death of youtube-dl and the emergence of yt-dlp.The \"Youtube-dl\" repository is not dead, but a major feature that's not working for two months has shaken users' faith in its future. The inability to adjust to Python 3 vs. Python 2.7 syntax and semantics causing the \"python\" vs. \"python3\" issue is still prevalent. Different Linux distros behave differently with respect to the \"python\" executable, some have an existing binary, some don't. Arch's decision to symlink python to python3 has messed up other distros, too. People with Arch build programs on it using the python3 -> python symlink, causing friction when the program is packaged for other distros. While some forks and fixes of Youtube-dl are available, it's easy to look for alternative programs.Users discuss the usefulness of two other YouTube downloading programs, yt-dlp and youtube-dl, in comparison to the almost unusable YouTube. The programs can still rip from hundreds of websites despite efforts to stymie ripping. While yt-dlp offers additional functionalities compared to youtube-dl, some users argue that the latter is still worth using. Recent legal troubles are causing a stir, with one user noting an abnormal court decision in Germany, and others mentioning other copyrighted material sharing services that continue to survive. Uberspace.de is defending itself for hosting a website that linked to youtube-dl on GitHub. German law delineating fair use is being put forward by some users to protect the software's legality.A German court ruling in favor of a copyright holder shows that different countries' legal systems affect the internet, and that the internet must evolve to adapt to regional variations while offering resistance to censorship, and retirees of judges are not the solution to personal biases from jurists. The possibility of generative sound in the music industry sparks concerns of new technologies' potential impact on the industry's business model; AI-generated songs may breach copyright laws in Apple Music and Spotify. The conversation also mentions the infamous Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal and how the industry adapts to the assimilation or copying of important experiences in the music industry.Hacker News users discuss various aspects of the recent lawsuit against YouTube-dl, a program that allows users to download videos off YouTube, with some expressing concern about the broader implications of the lawsuit for free speech online. Other users suggest that decentralized solutions and alternative tools may help in safeguarding free expression online. An HN user notes that while there are advantages to decentralized internet solutions, blockchains are not always necessary or appropriate. Some users also criticize the reliance of many FLOSS projects on centralized platforms such as GitHub for code hosting and version control, highlighting the need for alternative, distributed tools.It is illegal in Germany to bypass copy protection measures, which includes ripping a Netflix stream that uses Widivine/DRM. A recent court case may have used this argument, and it's worth noting that YouTube videos may use browser DRM. Copy protections on YouTube may rely more on security by obscurity, and some users speculate that it involves weird endpoints, parameters, and requirements. There is no evidence that YouTube's copy protection involves funding concentration camps, as one user sarcastically suggested. Meanwhile, applications for YC Summer 2023 are now open.",

Searching through websites and youtube can be soooo exhausting and overwhelming. It's a true blessing to have everything covered in one place in such an easy, simple and detailed way like in your website and video courses. \ud83d\ude00Amila S Kosovo20 February 2018@0xP1kachu JapanAny questionsCan I start watching today?Absolutely. There are 14 hours of lessons covering the whole engine and most of the engine bay systems. We're filming more every week, and all future content is included.How long do I get access?Forever. Until the course is completed the pricing is a one-time payment of $25. When I've finished the course I might look at some sort of monthly subscription but for now, I know that I prefer to pay a fair price once and get everything. That's how it works in a shop and I believe that's how it should work online.When will the series be complete?June 2023. I work full-time on this series, and it takes a long time to setup, write, record and edit every lesson. But the quality is extremely high, and I want it to be a reference piece for the next 10 years. As technology develops I will go back and add more lessons.Can I download the videos?You can install the free apps for Android and iOS - these apps let you download the videos for offline viewing. At the moment you can't download the video files (mainly because I want to completely finish every lesson before I make them 'permanent').Will this course teach me to fix my car?I am asked this a lot. If you just want to fix one thing on a car then you don't need to understand automotive engineering or how things work. You can find videos on YouTube that will show you almost any repair, and you just follow those videos. But if you want to be able to diagnose and fix any car, any engine without spending hours Googling then you want a deep understanding of car mechanics. That is what you'll get from this series. You'll understand how things work, and by the time you've finished watching you'll really know what things like a MAF sensor, or a PCV valve are. It's universal, fascinating stuff! I love it.What about subtitles?Every lesson is professionally subtitled in English. Sometimes people ask whethe I will make subtitles in other languages and I'm afraid the answer is probably not. Technical foreign languge subtitles cost around $3 per minute. Right now we have 853 minutes of lessons, so it would cost $2,561 to translate. Sorry guys, there's just too much quality content!Can I donate or support you on Patreon?Thanks - you're kind! Honestly, the video course sales make enough to cover production costs and that's good enough for me at the moment. I love working on this project and I like creating a product that people buy and enjoy. If you've bought the course then that's great!

Additionally, Apple has been innovating to reduce plastic use in packaging using digital printing and new varnishing technology. Apple creates machines for its vendors and further reducing waste by producing less. There is substantial debate on whether Apple ought to make its recycling tech public knowledge to promote environmentalism. Though the efficacy of these changes is debated, it has created a culture of sustainability in the company.Apple aims to reduce the amount of cobalt put into its batteries, with old batteries containing more cobalt than the ones expected to be used by Apple in 2025, according to an HN user. Meanwhile, a debate over user-replaceable batteries continues, with one user arguing they are environmentally negative due to the waste generated by used batteries. However, recycling methods and the extended lifespan of durable products suggest the situation could be changed, a further user noted. On the other hand, users have pointed out some of the difficulties associated with repairing or replacing parts.Efficient battery disposal, recycling and replacement are issues faced by everyone or every region differently. Some places have better solutions, while some don't. Electronics stores and big boxes that sell devices containing Li-ion/Li-po batteries are a few places to recycle them. However, the recycling rates of businesses specializing in phone repairs may not be great compared to that of batteries. Mandating the companies that claim to recycle batteries to do so, rather than allowing them to send the batteries to a landfill can ensure a higher recycling rate. Apple offers a financial incentive to trade in your phone, but some view it as a controlling move. Besides, Apple offers a cheaper option of replacing batteries for continued phone use, which does not put the whole device in the trash. While user-replaceable batteries make devices easier to repair, they do not guarantee that the battery will be responsibly disposed of. If Apple did not exist, all smartphones might have user-replaceable batteries, but smartphones would look radically different.Apple's battery replacement policy is clear \u2013 no user replaceable batteries. However, they do offer replacements and third-party shops can do it too. While airpods add to e-waste, their limited lifespan is not very different from wired headphones. The iPhone 14 has improved repairability, but Apple is still criticized for their design. Apple also faces criticism over their cobalt supply chain, which involves child labor in DRC. Nevertheless, the company\u2019s commitment to recyclable materials and a carbon-neutral supply chain continues. Although some may accuse Apple of greenwashing with this effort, they are headed in the right direction.While some argue that iPhones have a lifespan of around 5-6 years, others believe that the hardware, which often works fine for over a decade, is made obsolete by the software. However, older iPhones still receive security updates for much longer than 5 years, making them some of the longest-term supported devices on the market. Older Android phones also receive security updates for a long time via Google Play Services. Apple's device support and lifespan are best-in-class, with some users still using their operational iPhone 5s or 2013 MacBook Pro.Apple announces that starting from 2025, it will only use batteries with 100% recycled cobalt. The move signifies a shift towards sustainability and efficient recycling. Android phones receive security patches for longer than two years, contrary to common belief. Experts compare the support span of iPhones, Samsungs and recent Pixels with the aging Nexus 5X to ascertain Android's overall longevity. Although Apple batteries use a lot of cobalt, the metal's decreasing importance in the energy sector will lessen its impact. The pledges of sustainable production by tech companies are criticized as insincere marketing tactics.An HN discussion about Apple\u2019s recycling cobalt policy suggests skepticism towards the genuineness of the program as marketing strategy, rather than sound ecological engineering. Some comments argue that recycling cobalt may not necessarily have a positive effect on the environment, given the marginal cost of increasing recycling, the price for recycled Cobalt, and that dollars spent serve as the best proxy for ecological damage. Endisneigh suggests MagSafe batteries should act as the primary battery for iPhones, using the MagSafe battery first and the built-in battery secondarily. The critical importance lies in keeping the phone running, especially in the context of a future Apple car. However, layer8 criticized MagSafe's inefficiency arguing that if Apple couldn't win, they ought to have opted for the environmentally-friendly option.MagSafe charging may not work if the phone's battery is completely dead. Users have raised questions about how MagSafe works differently than the traditional charging system, but it's unclear as there is no additional information available online. Some users express that MagSafe would be cool if it could charge a dead phone.",

The team analyzed what happens when Podman starts a container and why it takes so long, addressing minor inefficiencies that became significant when grinding with a profiler. They also provided workarounds for kernel issues and used transient storage to speed up container startup.Red Hat's container engine, Podman, is working on finding and fixing performance issues in container start-up. By creating Podman with this new approach, it moved all container locking, reads, and writes, as well as the Podman database, to /run, which is a temporary filesystem, thus dramatically increasing the speed of starting a container from 2 seconds on the Raspberry Pi to under 0.3 seconds. This makes using the --transient-store option particularly great for an edge device or server. However, note that you cannot run containers in a mixed mode, where some are transient and others persist.",

However, some HN users expressed concern over the increasing complexity of software in cars after a bad experience with a breakdown, although other users pointed out that software can prevent catastrophic failures. There was also a debate about whether more software in cars is a good thing or not, with some suggesting that it can lead to more code bloat. One user made a joke about Kubernetes in cars, but others pointed out that the U.S. Air Force has indeed deployed Kubernetes in planes.HN users discuss the overcomplication of modern cars and point out the trade-off between electronics and reliability. Some users suggest using technologies such as Erlang or Docker Compose, while others argue that reliability never comes from unnecessary complexity. The conversation diverges into a discussion about the ease of use and reliability of modern printers compared to older models, and how some users prefer to use separate print servers to prevent unnecessary complexity. Overall, the discussion highlights the need to balance technological advancements with practicality and reliability.Older printers were overengineered, making them more reliable but with a higher cost. Some comments suggest that modern appliances with fewer discrete components are more reliable than the older ones. However, cars, phones, and other devices with complex software and numerous sensors may be harder to repair and maintain, leading some people to prefer older models. An HN user suggests that manufacturers could make \"dumb cars\" with fewer components and less software. Mechanically skilled IT people may be in short supply in the future, given the move to electronic and possibly electric cars. Finally, an HN user suggests the use of a code reader for checking engine lights in cars, which could save money on garage diagnostics.A discussion on diagnosing complex auto issues leads to a debate on the right to repair, liability issues, and the potential for containerization in automobiles. HN users argue that it is cheaper and better for the environment to allow tinkering with software in cars and hold entities liable for their own modifications. Some argue that the use of microservices in cars can cause integration issues and testing complexities. One user jokingly suggests a scenario where a mechanic diagnoses a car problem using Kubernetes terminology.Experts discuss the advantages and disadvantages of microservices and containers in relation to scalability, service isolation, update management, and system resilience. While some users argue that deploying separate services in containers can help achieve better service isolation and security, others point out that such an approach might increase memory usage and reduce the sharing of resources. Although containers' toolset has potential benefits, some users stress that too much reliance on them might create new problems, including security, compatibility issues, and container sprawl. Finally, experts suggest that it's up to individual teams and organizations to choose the tools that fit their specific needs instead of blindly adopting the latest tech trends.A discussion on Hacker News has sparked debate over the use of containers in various programs such as car entertainment systems. Proponents argue that containers simplify the update process and unify apps while reducing risk and allowing for better resource sharing, which can be particularly helpful for inessential systems like vehicle entertainment systems. However, opponents say that containers are not necessary and can introduce security risks. The discussion raises questions about the use of containers in various applications, and whether they ultimately help or hinder the development process.Red Hat's Podman container system is improving in its startup speeds for cars as we now learn that containers are commonly used in cars. Though Podman has improved it has experienced continuity issues with files at times leaving the network in an undefined state. Docker favors improvements in their 'rootless mode' however, after multiple problematic runs with Podman, trust was lost between developers and Podman will always have its issues. It seems the use of containers in cars is becoming widespread and thus developers must constantly innovate in constraints enabling constant creativity.",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35559124",
    "content": "The ability to peek under the hood of the operating system can be a powerful tool for debugging. Spelunking Apple\u2019s Open Source, a recent blog post by Daniel Jalkut\u2019s, struck a very familiar chord with me, reminding me of times I spent poring through WebKit internals at my previous employer. I've been able to continue that pattern at Tailscale, now more focused on Darwin (the operating system at the core of macOS and iOS), its kernel and its userland tools.Just recently, Apple's open source came in handy when debugging an issue for the Tailscale 1.36 release. We were investigating two network-interface related bugs \u2013 one where Tailscale traffic was looping on itself (instead of being passed through to the actual physical network connection) and another where Tailscale was sending traffic over the phone\u2019s cellular interface (even though Wi-Fi was available). The fix for both of these involved more consistently \u201cbinding\u201d Tailscale\u2019s network requests to the active network interface (and re-binding them when it changes).Normally figuring out what the active network interface is pretty straightforward \u2014 it is the interface that is associated with the default route. However, when Tailscale is configured to use an exit node, it becomes the default route, thus putting us back in danger of looping traffic. We want to know what the interface would be if Tailscale was not present (but without actually disabling it, since that is disruptive). I initially had an approach that lived in our closed-source repo and relied on private APIs (that I should probably plead the 5th instead of discussing further). Worse yet, we started to get reports that users were having issues because we were sometimes detecting the wrong interface.Brad mentioned we should see how the ifconfig outputs changes in various states: when Tailscale is the default route, when the default physical interface changes (e.g. from Ethernet to Wi-Fi), and combinations of the two. While the default output didn\u2019t have anything interesting, getting more verbose information (via the -v flag) had a clue: an \u201ceffective interface\u201d field appeared for the virtual Tailscale utunN interface, with the name of the actual physical interface (en0, en10, etc.) that should be handling the traffic.utun5: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1280 index 34  eflags=5002080<TXSTART,NOAUTOIPV6LL,ECN_ENABLE,CHANNEL_DRV>  inet 100.118.111.67 --> 100.118.111.67 netmask 0xffffffff  ...  effective interface: en4  ...ifconfig is part of the code that Apple open-sources, and a quick search through it turned up the implementation of that line:if (ioctl(s, SIOCGIFDELEGATE, &ifr) != -1 && ifr.ifr_delegated) {  char delegatedif[IFNAMSIZ+1];  if (if_indextoname(ifr.ifr_delegated, delegatedif) != NULL)    printf(\"\\teffective interface: %s\\n\", delegatedif);}ioctl is kind of a Swiss Army knife system call, in this particular case the SIOCGIFDELEGATE option allows the underlying physical interface to be obtained. The Darwin Networking chapter of the *OS Internals book has more details.Now that we knew what ifconfig did, it was a matter of trying to replicate it in Tailscale\u2019s client. Go ends up using various ioctls to implement standard library functionality on Darwin (e.g. to get the MTU associated with an interface), but it didn\u2019t happen to have a wrapper for SIOCGIFDELEGATE. Luckily it was not too much boilerplate to do the equivalent within Tailscale\u2019s code.I ran the code on my MacBook and it worked! But what about iOS? ifconfig (and the Darwin userland tools in general) is not available on iOS (except for creative hacks), and the iOS sandbox may be more restrictive when it comes to which ioctls it allows. I was betting on this being a shared implementation on Apple\u2019s side, and thus that it worked on all of their platforms. The moment of truth came a few minutes later when I tried it on my iPhone, and luckily it worked there too.The final implementation ended up being pretty concise, and it was satisfying to have it an unstable build the next day and have users confirm that the problem was fixed.",

    "content": "Amazon CodeWhisperer, Free for Individual Use, is Now Generally Availableby Steve Roberts | on 13 APR 2023 | in Amazon CodeWhisperer, Amazon Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, AWS Cloud9, AWS Toolkit For JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA, AWS Toolkit For JetBrains PyCharm, AWS Toolkit For JetBrains Rider, AWS Toolkit For JetBrains WebStorm, AWS Toolkit For VS Code, Developer Tools, Launch, News | Permalink | Comments | ShareToday, Amazon CodeWhisperer, a real-time AI coding companion, is generally available and also includes a CodeWhisperer Individual tier that\u2019s free to use for all developers. Originally launched in preview last year, CodeWhisperer keeps developers in the zone and productive, helping them write code quickly and securely and without needing to break their flow by leaving their IDE to research something. Faced with creating code for complex and ever-changing environments, developers can improve their productivity and simplify their work by making use of CodeWhisperer inside their favorite IDEs, including Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and others. CodeWhisperer helps with creating code for routine or time-consuming, undifferentiated tasks, working with unfamiliar APIs or SDKs, making correct and effective use of AWS APIs, and other common coding scenarios such as reading and writing files, image processing, writing unit tests, and lots more.Using just an email account, you can sign up and, in just a few minutes, become more productive writing code\u2014and you don\u2019t even need to be an AWS customer. For business users, CodeWhisperer offers a Professional tier that adds administrative features, like SSO and IAM Identity Center integration, policy control for referenced code suggestions, and higher limits on security scanning. And in addition to generating code suggestions for Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#, the generally available release also now supports Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, C, C++, Shell scripting, SQL, and Scala. CodeWhisperer is available to developers working in Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, CLion, GoLand, WebStorm, Rider, PhpStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, and DataGrip IDEs (when the appropriate AWS extensions for those IDEs are installed), or natively in AWS Cloud9 or AWS Lambda console.Helping to keep developers in their flow is increasingly important as, facing increasing time pressure to get their work done, developers are often forced to break that flow to turn to an internet search, sites such as StackOverflow, or their colleagues for help in completing tasks. While this can help them obtain the starter code they need, it\u2019s disruptive as they\u2019ve had to leave their IDE environment to search or ask questions in a forum or find and ask a colleague\u2014further adding to the disruption. Instead, CodeWhisperer meets developers where they are most productive, providing recommendations in real time as they write code or comments in their IDE. During the preview we ran a productivity challenge, and participants who used CodeWhisperer were 27% more likely to complete tasks successfully and did so an average of 57% faster than those who didn\u2019t use CodeWhisperer.Code generation from a commentThe code developers eventually locate may, however, contain issues such as hidden security vulnerabilities, be biased or unfair, or fail to handle open source responsibly. These issues won\u2019t improve the developer\u2019s productivity when they later have to resolve them. CodeWhisperer is the best coding companion when it comes to coding securely and using AI responsibly. To help you code responsibly, CodeWhisperer filters out code suggestions that might be considered biased or unfair, and it\u2019s the only coding companion that can filter or flag code suggestions that may resemble particular open-source training data. It provides additional data for suggestions\u2014for example, the repository URL and license\u2014when code similar to training data is generated, helping lower the risk of using the code and enabling developers to reuse it with confidence.Open-source reference trackingCodeWhisperer is also the only AI coding companion to have security scanning for finding and suggesting remediations for hard-to-detect vulnerabilities, scanning both generated and developer-written code looking for vulnerabilities such as those in the top ten listed in the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). If it finds a vulnerability, CodeWhisperer provides suggestions to help remediate the issue.Scanning for vulnerabilitiesCode suggestions provided by CodeWhisperer are not specific to working with AWS. However, CodeWhisperer is optimized for the most-used AWS APIs, for example AWS Lambda, or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), making it the best coding companion for those building applications on AWS. While CodeWhisperer provides suggestions for general-purpose use cases across a variety of languages, the tuning performed using additional data on AWS APIs means you can be confident it is the highest quality, most accurate code generation you can get for working with AWS.Meet Your new AI Code Companion TodayAmazon CodeWhisperer is generally available today to all developers\u2014not just those with an AWS account or working with AWS\u2014writing code in Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, C, C++, Shell scripting, SQL, and Scala. You can sign up with just an email address, and, as I mentioned at the top of this post, CodeWhisperer offers an Individual tier that\u2019s freely available to all developers. More information on the Individual tier, and pricing for the Professional tier, can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/pricing.

    "hn_content": "Amazon CodeWhisperer is now generally available and supports Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C# plus ten other languages, including Go, Kotlin, Rust, PHP, and SQL. Copilot is reportedly better than CodeWhisperer, although CodeWhisperer is a useful tool. Copilot is not limited to language support as it even provides elaborate slabs of code for languages it doesn't know. The future of coding may involve LLMs (large language models) for coding, debugging, and refactoring, allowing design to take center stage. However, computer time may be cheaper than developer time, which may create problems for the future.Amazon has launched CodeGuru Reviewer, an AI tool that scans code to identify issues and recommend fixes for efficiency and cost reduction. The CodeGuru also offers security and privacy controls, and its subscription is priced according to code analysis frequency. The service can be run on specific existing code or on whole new projects, enabling the opportunity to take corrective measures before issues become entrenched problems. It remains unclear whether pricing is scalable to large commercial users, who may also harbour confidential concerns around privacy.Amazon's CodeWhisperer goes through a significant compliance process to ensure security, and AWS treats user data with utmost care; CodeWhisperer uses AI to help write code, and users are sceptical about privacy and trust; the new technology is not yet 100% reliable, though it may be heading towards a time when AI-generated code is the norm; the value of the AI-generated code is yet to be seen, but it's theoretically possible there will come a time where the code is not even seen by its author.CodeWhisperer, a new AI-powered coding assistant developed by AWS, uses language models to assist developers in writing code, only requiring the user to provide descriptions of the desired functionality. However, the coding assistant system is non-deterministic, and for software development beyond typical use cases, prompt engineering is likely to become increasingly important. Although LLM generated apps may be efficient for rapid prototyping, building complicated systems will require human intervention. Furthermore, users hoping to use the AI generated code must ensure that the instructions are carefully and specifically designed. Finally, CodeWhisperer filters code suggestions that may be biased or unfair, and can identify similarities to open-source training data.Amazon CodeGuru has released a new version including more languages compared to Copilot, although an HN user pointed out that it has terrible UX and Copilot has miles more intelligent suggestions. It's possible to use CodeWhisperer to generate code, but potential legal concerns arise from the use of AI-generated code. The product is free for individual use, but pricing for enterprise use is unclear. Amazon seems to want to drive adoption and compete against established Copilot products. Free software has its place in getting users to pay for business licenses and encouraging the use of more AWS API stuff, which CodeWhisperer is fine-tuned on.",

    "content": "Google's 2023 Shutdown Spree: 6 Products Pulled in Just 4 MonthsPublished on 2023-04-11 by ToolHubGoogle Graveyard 2023Google is notorious for its habit of killing off products, and 2023 has been no exception. In just the first four months of the year, the tech giant has already pulled the plug on six products, leaving users scrambling for alternatives. Let's take a closer look at each of the products that have been shut down in 2023 so far:Google Code JamGoogle Code Jam: This international programming competition was hosted and administered by Google. It consisted of multiple rounds of online and onsite contests, where participants had to solve challenging problems using their preferred programming language. The top 25 finalists got to compete for the title of Code Jam Champion and a prize of 15,000 USD at the Google headquarters. However, Google has decided to shut it down in 2023.Google CurrentsGoogle Currents: This service provided social media features similar to Google+ for Workspace users. It was launched in July 2020 as a rebrand of the now-defunct Google+ platform. However, it was shut down in April 2023, and people using it were pushed to Spaces, Google's equivalent of a Slack channel.Google Street ViewGoogle Street View app: This app was available on Android and iOS and enabled people to get a 360-degree view of locations around the world. It was over 12 years old but was shut down in March 2023. While the app is now gone, its functionality still exists on Google Maps and Street View Studio. As this comment on HN pointed out, this was a good move by Google.Google JacquardGoogle Jacquard: This small tag could be embedded into clothing and paired with a smartphone, allowing people to perform certain customizable actions on their phones without actually touching them. For example, a double-tap could play/pause music, brushing the fabric could change tracks, and covering the sensor would mute/unmute notifications. It was first unveiled back in 2015 by Google Advanced Technology & Projects (ATAP), but was killed in March 2023.Google StadiaGoogle Stadia: Google's cloud gaming service allowed gamers to run AAA titles on cheaper hardware, including phones, laptops, and TVs. However, it was shut down on January 18 due to low user adoption. Google refunded all Stadia hardware purchased through the Google Store along with the games and add-ons purchased from the Stadia Store.Google OnHubGoogle OnHub: This wireless router was powered by Google software and managed by Google apps. It offered special features like Google Assistant and was sold in two versions, manufactured by either Asus or TP-Link. In 2021, Google announced that the OnHub routers would no longer receive any software updates. Then in January 2023, the company rendered the product almost completely useless by disabling most of its features.Share Tweet Share Share Share Share",
    "summary": "Google has shut down six products in the first four months of 2023, including the Code Jam programming competition, social media platform Google Currents, the Street View app, wearable tech Google Jacquard, cloud gaming service Google Stadia, and wireless router Google OnHub. While some of these products were over a decade old, Google has faced criticism for its habit of abruptly ending popular services.",

    "hn_content": "Google has discontinued six products already this year, with a dedicated Streetview app being the most recent. Some users argue that Google should be more transparent about which projects are side projects and which are products. Others suggest releasing side projects under a different brand name. Some users criticize Google's practice of labeling products as \"beta\" or \"experimental,\" as this can damage public perception of their products. One example is Gmail, which was in beta for five years despite having over a billion users. Stadia, a recent Google product, was refunded to users after it was shut down.Google's spotty track record for new products includes failed endeavors such as Google Glass, Google Plus, and Google Wave. The lack of trust in Google comes from its failure to stand behind their roadmaps and lack of clear support for products. The company cannot simply experiment without facing the risk of adverse effects for those who bet on their experiment. However, Google's cloud unit, while dismissed by some as just another side project, is growing with around 10% of the market share in the cloud market.Google's cloud business has grown to over $20B/year and is still expanding. However, some users note concerns over Google's customer and developer engagement as well as fears about its account-killing algorithm. An HN user also questions GCP's profitability and market share in comparison to AWS. Other comments point out issues with Google's product development and acquisitions. Despite these concerns, readers understand the potential of Google's technological innovation, specifically mentioning Stadia and Google Earth on mobile. Nonetheless, past reports about its struggling services continue to plague Google's online reputation.Comments on an article about Google's decision to discontinue its Street View app suggest that the company's reputation for killing off products has led to consumer distrust. Some HN users claim that Google is missing opportunities to create new revenue streams and to evolve beyond ads, while others argue that the decision to cancel the Stadia gaming service was an inevitable consequence of a flawed business model that failed to attract users. One HN user suggests that Google should have focused on improving its voice assistant, Google Assistant, in a bid to compete with Siri and Alexa.Comments on Google's products range from half-assed implementations to compatibility issues with other services. Some users have experienced losing their data with no support available. Despite this, companies and individuals still use Google's products. Google's reputation damage does not significantly affect their revenue as their primary income comes from advertising. Google's decision-making process for launching, maintaining, and killing products seems sudden and quick compared to other companies. The search function is not considered reliable anymore, causing the ChatGPT tool to capitalize on this weakness. While accuracy in Google's AI language tools is improving with each iteration, efficiency is becoming stagnant.An HN discussion about the accuracy of ChatGPT has users debating solutions such as the costly GPT4, 5, or custom hardware; even if the industry is optimistic, AI developers should consider the enormous cost of maintaining and developing this tech. OpenAI and Microsoft are pioneers of LLMs, which have proven to monopolize the search engine space and could potentially be a danger to Google's search engine interface. While Google's performance evaluation system is aimed at bringing new and innovative projects to life, there's an urgent need for \"steady hand on the tiller\" engineers to maintain existing projects.Google's tendency to abandon projects and its impact on the company's reputation are a popular topic among HN users, although the majority of people outside of tech enthusiasts do not seem to care; many HN users question why Google does not use a different brand name to experiment with new products, rather than risking damage to its main brand image; contractors may be used to mitigate staff retention and overwhelming developers with maintenance work, but this is not always effective and can harm career progression prospects; the idea that people would rather work on less exciting maintenance tasks at Google due to the high pay is also discussed; while it is acknowledged that other companies cancel projects, Google's reputation for doing so frequently, and sometimes capriciously, draws criticism; it is noted that this reputation can negatively impact Google's profits in lines of business beyond ads.Stadia was shut down by Google, leading users to question why Gmail is free and lives forever but Stadia, with paying customers, was not good enough. This has led to speculation that users are sold out to advertisers. Google is known for killing moderately successful products that users depend on while launching competitor products, as evident in its numerous chat/messaging platforms. Alphabet exists to generate profits for shareholders, not to make cool stuff or make users happy. Users have expressed dissatisfaction in relation to Google's wave of unfinished products it has launched over the past decade. Some commentators have pointed out that when Google cancels its products, it's not usually due to financial constraints.Google employees and their company's practices are criticized for minimizing negative press and stymying discussion, and for being notoriously unreliable partners due to product cancellations with short notice and poor path forward. However, other big tech corporations such as Microsoft and Amazon have also frequently launched and canceled products. HN users pointed out specific cases of Google's questionable product shutdown methods, such as with Stadia, while a website called 'killedbygoogle.com' lists all of Google's discontinued products. Overall, the article focuses on discussions about corporate practices in big tech companies and how they affect product support for consumers.",

RTX Remix, part of the NVIDIA Studio suite of apps, is composed of two core components that work together to enable modders to remaster classic PC games: the RTX Remix creator toolkit, and a custom RTX Remix runtime.The RTX Remix creator toolkit, built on NVIDIA Omniverse and used to develop Portal with RTX, allows modders to assign new assets and lights within their remastered scene, and use AI tools to rebuild the look of any asset. The RTX Remix creator toolkit Early Access is coming soon.The RTX Remix runtime captures a game scene, and replaces assets at playback while injecting RTX technology, such as path tracing, DLSS 3 and Reflex into the game. Already, mod developers have been using the RTX Remix runtime from Portal With RTX to create experimental ray traced scenes in numerous classic games.To further empower the mod development community to extend Remix\u2019s game compatibility and feature set, NVIDIA is releasing the RTX Remix runtime as open source on GitHub today.The RTX Remix runtime is open source with a permissive MIT license, and includes the following components:USD capture and replacement modules, which are responsible for capturing a game scene to USD, and replacing original game assets with modded game assets at runtime.Bridge, which translates the renderer from a x86 to a x64 instruction set. This component uncaps the memory available for rendering.Scene manager, which uses information coming through the D3D9 fixed function API to create a representation of the original scene, track game objects frame to frame, and set up the scene to be path traced.The core path tracer, which includes the rendering loop, the material handling, and the game specific rendering features (e.g., decals and particles). Please note, the various technologies (DLSS, NRD, RTXDI) that accelerate our path tracer and enable it to render in real time will continue to be available via their existing SDKs and licenses from the NVIDIA Developer portal.Open sourcing unlocks numerous possibilities to extend the feature set of the Remix runtime. A few examples of projects that advanced mod developers might tackle via source code access include:Making more of their favorite games compatible with RemixModernizing the fluid simulation to render smoke and fire with realistic volumetricsInjecting custom post effects shaders in the runtimeAdding animated lights (e.g., flickering fire, or lights that cycle through colors)Replacing animated character meshesChanging camera positions in games (e.g., turning a first person game into an isometric one)Incorporating virtual reality support into the rendererImplementing dynamic conditional replacements (e.g., add fog or change a light in response to a player\u2019s position)There is ample opportunity to change how classic titles are played, and open source widens the possibilities beyond our imagination. We look forward to seeing what mod developers will build with source access.For PC gamers, an open source RTX Remix runtime will help broaden the variety of games with RTX mods and the types of mods themselves.How To Get InvolvedThe RTX Remix runtime source code can be found on GitHub, and bugs can be reported here.Our main goal is to expand game compatibility and extend the features of Remix in collaboration with the community. In keeping with that aim, NVIDIA will accept pull requests on Github for code submissions from the community, provide feedback, and help advance code until it is mature enough to be merged into the official RTX Remix runtime.To further help the community with Remix, several Remix engineers have joined the community-led RTX Remix Showcase Discord server, are providing guidelines on compatibility, and responding to mod developers\u2019 questions about RTX Remix. If you are looking to get started with your own Remix runtime open source project, head over to the Discord to find subject matter experts to collaborate with. We have also prepared some starter guides and documentation for mod developers as we continue to prepare the RTX Remix application.Modding is all about community, and providing an open source RTX Remix runtime will help empower mod developers to expand Remix compatibility to even more classic PC games.

The program is based on the DXVK open-source program. Expert users can determine how the program works, and how the technology can be incorporated into older games; however, not all games will work. The innovation has been well received by the tech-savvy. While some older games can look janky, there is an increasing appreciation for early 3D aesthetics. Nvidia has a lot of open-source work, sharing 349 repositories on Github; however, proprietary closed-source desktop driver limitations affected Nvidia's user reputation.An online discussion on Hacker News compares the open-source contributions of Nvidia and its competitors, with opinions varying on the importance of open-source drivers. While some argue that open-source graphics drivers are crucial for Linux compatibility, others point out that the proprietary nature of HDMI and other interfaces forces everyone to use some closed-source code. Users also discuss the poor performance of Nvidia's RTX ray-tracing technology on non-Nvidia hardware, and speculate on any potential favoritism on Nvidia's part. One user suggests supporting cryptocurrency developers that implement GPU-only proof-of-work schemes.The polygon rounding issue in computer games is due to the cost of detail scaling and the dominance of triangles in graphics card hardware. Unreal 5's Nanite is a new, unique system that will fix this problem, but currently, only a few games are out, and no other big engines have a competing technology. The polygon count affects the game's quality and performance, and game developers must balance the two. While alternatives to NURBS exist, they are not popular. The article's prominent readers are experts in the field who seek new and exciting developments in computer games.Nvidia's AI-based upscaling tool, Remix, has been released and can revive old DirectX 7 and 8 PC games, and Nvidia might open-source the tech if publishers don't adopt it, according to users on Hacker News. \"Max Payne\" PC games remakes are also in development by Remedy. The only known example of Remix in action is a \"Portal\" mod, which has just been released. An Nvidia video showcasing Remix's capabilities was posted to YouTube, while PC users have reported seeking fixes for the visibly-impressive tech's frame pacing and stuttering. Compatibility issues could scuttle integration of the Nvidia-only tech into other devices.",
