BY ADAM BANKHURST UPDATED: JAN 23, 2024 7:35 PM POSTED: JAN 23, 2024 7:34 PM Alongside announcing that Lanny Smoot will be the first Disney employee besides Walt to be inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Disney also shared one of his newest projects called the HoloTile floor, which just may be a game changer for VR and could bring us ever closer to experiencing the Holodeck from Star Trek. Disney shared the news and a video of the HoloTile floor in action in a blog celebrating Smoot, who holds over 100 patents and secured 74 of those during his 25 years at The Walt Disney Company. As for the HoloTile floor itself, it is described by Disney as the \"world’s first multi-person, omni-directional, modular, expandable, treadmill floor.\" You have to think of it like a floor made of many tiles that do all they can to keep people or objects in the center of them. This could allow people to \"have a shared virtual reality (VR) experience, walk an unlimited distance in any direction, and never collide or walk off its surface.\" Many of us have experienced the joy that can be a really stellar VR experience, but there are always certain limitations to the immersion that comes with it. While it's great to be able to visit The Black Spire Outpost on the planet of Batuu in Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge in VR, you also run the risk of being pulled back to Earth when you bump into your couch and can only move a few feet here and there. With the HoloTile floor, Disney appears to be envisioning a future where those limitations are no more and we can explore wide environments and feel that we are actually walking or running through them despite us staying mostly in one place. For those Star Trek fans out there, this sounds a lot like the promise of the Holodeck, a smallish-room that could virtually take our favorite crews wherever they wanted for some fun and relaxation between missions when it wasn't malfunctioning and trying to murder them. The HoloTile floor can do more than just let people walk on it, as it can also move objects around. In the video, we see an object being moved around the floor and an arm extending at the corner of the screen, as if they were using the Force to move an object. Yes, the possibilities of this are making a Star Wars fan like myself VERY happy. LANNY SMOOT ON THE HOLOTILE FLOOR. IMAGE CREDIT: THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY The applications of the HoloTile floor also extend beyond virtual reality, as Disney notes \"The HoloTile floor can also be an insert in a theatrical stage, allowing performers to move and dance in new ways, or stage props and structures to move around or appear to set themselves up.\" However, it's important not to get too excited yet as Smoot notes \"we don't know yet where that will be used.\" So, while we may have to wait a while to see what this tech could become, its an exciting glimpse into the future that could hopefully one day change how we experience our favorite universes in Disney Parks, our homes, and beyond.

[1] So that's what these tiny tiles are, something ultrasonic, not tiny wheels. EDIT: Found some more explanation in a reddit comment. [2] Ultrasound vibration makes it slippery, then it has an X-Y pistons underneath. So it makes itself slippery when it wants to reset position, then makes itself sticky again when it wants to move you back into position. Now repeat this process to fast for you to tell anything is happening. [1]: https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloa... [2]: https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/comments/19eef29/comment/k... reply mrtksn 16 hours agoparentInterestingly, on the video it appears as rotating wheels that change inclination: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YMEmaF0rs&t=203s From the close-up shots, you can clearly see them rotating and changing inclination. By changing inclination they can control the contact surface of the rotating wheels and as a result control the direction of your movement. Very clever and simple but might be dangerous(you wouldn't want to have your pinky stuck between load bearing rotating wheels) and prone to tear and wear due to the high dynamic friction. However, if there's actually a way to make it sticky or slippery with ultrasound then you can get away with a partial rotation back and forth while turning it sticky in one direction to push the objects in that direction and turn it slippery to reset its own position and get ready for another push. This probably will make it quite safe. reply smusamashah 14 hours agorootparentThat's what I am still confused on how these discs look like wheels to people because lots of comments are saying that. All I see is discs changing angles and can't see them rotating like rotating wheels. reply mrtksn 14 hours agorootparentAt 3:33 there's a close up and you can see dirt stuck on the edge of some wheels and it clearly goes around. Maybe, the part that goes from slippery to sticky with ultrasound is beneath the rubber disks and when there's no load they just rotate freely? reply thrdbndndn 14 hours agorootparentIt looks to me that they're spinning than rotating; in other words, rotate around an axis that is perpendicular to the ground, instead of parallel to the ground. And because of this, the person above is stepping on the \"spinning surface\" (the \"base\" surface of a cylinder) of these tiny disks, instead of the curved surface like a normal wheel or some industrial conveyor wheels (as someone linked below, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRS0Uj2WdpA ). So in a sense, they're not \"rotating like rotating wheels\" despite being wheels/disks. BTW, it looks like they also can adjust its axis angle slightly (less than 30 degree), which I imagine is also crucial to how it works. reply spyder 13 hours agorootparentYep, and by tilting the spinning discs/cylinders you can have omnidirectional control by changing which part of the edge of the rotating cylinder is in contact with the surface above it. You don't need the ultrasound thing posted in the other comment, that patent may be a different path they've also tried. reply oatmeal1 3 hours agorootparentBeautifully simple that it only has to spin the wheels one direction! I do imagine it has to stop though when the person stops walking. The drawback of this is that it requires a firm contact point like shoes to work. You wouldn't want to walk in socks on this. You also couldn't have a performer lay directly on the surface and transport them across the stage, nor allow them to have baggy clothing near it. Running would be difficult from a balance perspective, not to mention holding a wheel at a particular tilt would require quite a bit of force if someone runs on it. It's going to have a very particular use case for Disney. reply Groxx 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I think this is right too. It'd also explain the sound. Feels like a very mechanically-simple strategy, but hard to make durable / safe from fingers (and detecting \"skin\" vs \"shoe\" doesn't seem like something you can make foolproof) / that would hurt to fall onto. reply Mtinie 2 hours agorootparentSociety says that progress goes forward. Toes? Not always. reply mrtksn 14 hours agorootparentprevThat's what I mean. Rotating around their axis, which is spinning. Like the world rotates or spins. And by wheels I also mean disk, probably disks is more precise just as the spinning but really don't see why anyone would be confused when there's a video. But anyway, thanks for improving my English. reply smusamashah 14 hours agorootparentEnglish isn't my first language but if it people were referring the motion as spinning instead of rotating and discs instead of wheels it wouldn't be confusing. reply thrdbndndn 14 hours agorootparentprev(Text here is removed due to bad wording.) To mrtksn: yeah I think your original post is pretty clear. But there are indeed other comments in this thread that are confusing the two. reply mrtksn 14 hours agorootparentYeah probably but there's a minutes long video with close ups. In my mental model its wheels attached in different way that rotate around an axis perpendicular to the ground. I call in wheels because moves the things around. I'm really confused by the confusion. Isn't it obvious on the video that its cylindrical objects that can be considered thick disks and wouldn't all disks rotate on the round surface around the axis? reply bear141 12 hours agorootparentI also found the close up video to be self explanatory but I understand the confusion. People are thinking of it as multiple tiny treadmills that change direction rather than the spinning disc it actually is. reply gimmeThaBeet 16 hours agoparentprevThat's pretty gnarly. So the discs are basically doing little inchworming steps back and forth but never has to break contact by modulating the friction? Very much a bit of cleverness turned magic. The one thing that I notice is item 726/Fig 7./PDF pg 10, it has \"with the soles and attached/embedded ultrasonic transducers\". Is that maybe a different or older envisioning of this system? His shoes seemed totally normal. Just trying to wrap my head around how much the friction can be changed by vibration, like a solid-ish state fluidized bed. Don't know it both contact surfaces need to be vibrating. reply Animats 14 hours agorootparentThat's a cute system. Moving stuff around with controlled vibration is known. There's a cute trick where you drive a flat horizontal plate in three axes (X, Y, and rotate about Z). Sawtooth waveforms will move things around; the slow part of the sawtooth produces motion, and the fast part yanks the plate back to the starting point, breaking from static friction to weaker sliding friction. It's even possible, by using combinations of translation and rotation, to move multiple objects in different directions. The original research was funded by United Parcel Service. They wanted to take a table full of boxes, separate them, align them, and send them to a conveyor. Didn't work well enough, although someone did a chessboard demo where multiple pieces were moved around separately. This is a similar idea, but at a finer scale. > \"with the soles and attached/embedded ultrasonic transducers\" That suggests doing this in the shoe, instead of in the floor. Different system. Disney might license that to Nike. I can't see it for theme park customers. This system can make people fall down. Performers, though... reply gimmeThaBeet 14 hours agorootparentOh, okay, I see, in that alternative system, the tiles still move, but your shoe with transducers is used to adjust the friction. reply blamestross 7 hours agorootparentprevThe normal model of friction already has static vs moving friction. They just vibrate to switch between them. reply pxmpxm 17 hours agoparentprevThey must be vibrating the surface of those picks with ultrasound to modulate the friction. Pretty clever. reply ehsankia 10 hours agoparentprevHow does that work for moving the box then? reply eastbound 16 hours agoparentprevSorry but if I input energy into the system by walking, and the holotiles input energy by producing ultrasound… how is this energy dissipated? reply dymk 16 hours agorootparentHeat, and not very much reply fizx 16 hours agorootparentprevheat reply BryanLegend 16 hours agoprevJohn Carmacks take: I am skeptical of something like this making an impact for consumer VR, but it should be possible to integrate the sensor input at the OpenXR level, allowing it to work with all apps without needing per-app specialization. However, it probably doesn’t “solve” motion sickness, because the vestibular system still won’t think you are going forward. The bouncing around motion of walking does have a masking effect that will help some. Source: https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1750557236798148613 reply RobCodeSlayer 10 hours agoparentYou don’t need to fully fool the vestibular system. This could be installed in a large room and move users slowly back to center as they approach the edge reply marssaxman 9 hours agorootparentI tried out an experience last night called \"SandboxVR\" which would be the perfect customer for such a system - you walk into a room equipped with motion-tracker cameras, the staff straps you into VR gear, then you play an immersive video game with your friends. The games are designed so you don't need to move around much, because a flashing red grid appears in your vision if you get too close to the walls; with a moving floor, they could give you a lot more freedom to explore. reply randall 9 hours agorootparentprevI think this is the most likely outcome. Then you get unlimited walking distance and no vestibular drama (or light vestibular drama). I wonder if it makes you puke if you don't quite move as far as you expected... like each step counts for 3/4ths of a step or something... and then you imperceptibly move backward. reply persolb 8 hours agorootparentThere is an Oculus game Tea for God that had step scaling as an option. It is rooms ale, but every step you take, it moves you 1.25 steps of distance. I get motion sick easy, but this option doesn’t make me sick. reply Rapzid 5 hours agorootparentprevOr even just a medium room. Let the user accelerate faster and then the system accelerate slower to start centering then. reply ambrop7 45 minutes agoparentprevThe issue is not motion, the vestibular system cannot measure velocity, only linear acceleration and rotation. The only issue is while you are accelerating in a horizontal direction in VR, but you are not actually acccelerating (remember acceleration is absolute not relative). But I don't expect this will be much of an issue. We don't have a problem speeding up or slowing down on a treadmill. reply ehsankia 10 hours agoparentprevFrom the video it kinda seemed like to people had to walk quite carefully, and it seemed a little awkward. I can't imagine it working well with a headset on your head in a virtual world not being able to see the real world. Most other VR walking systems, you're strapped in an safe from falling. reply beowulfey 8 hours agorootparentits a tiny setup, too small for normal steps. it may be just fine if it were bigger. and anyway, it probably won't be the final iteration of this. it's just a prototype, a proof-of-concept. people are looking at this like you can go down and buy it today and are writing it off. reply ehsankia 4 hours agorootparentThat's another thing that I found strange. Why make the version you show the public so tiny, especially if you want to show off multiple people on it. I understand it's a prototype, but surely they can scale it up a bit more to a reasonable size before showing it? reply afavour 3 hours agorootparentYou might as well ask “why show it at all”. If you’re a small research outfit you do demos like this to attract potential clients but Disney has more than enough internal applications for this thing to keep them occupied for a long time. My cynical view is that an exec was looking at the share price and thought “ahh crap let’s go film some stuff in R&D to reassure people we’ve got the future in hand”. Didn’t matter they hadn’t scaled the thing up, we’re still all talking about it in the top post of HN. reply wolverine876 15 hours agoparentprev> the vestibular system still won’t think you are going forward Why not? Movement is relative, of course, and I'm moving relative to the floor and relative to what I see. What does the vestibular system detect that isn't happening? reply derefr 15 hours agorootparentThe simplest thing is air resistance / drag — you can feel yourself moving through air (or any other fluid.) But a sufficiently-clever mechanical VR system could blow air at you as you move, so let's ignore that one. Your inner ear is literally an accelerometer. When you accelerate (or rotate your body around relative to a gravitational pull), the liquid in your cochlea sloshes around, and the hairs in it (which aren't just on the bottom surface, but all around the sides and top as well) feel the liquid as it passes by them and build an image of your position and acceleration in space. (It's oddly similar to how the wires in an old-school mercury tilt-switch accelerometer interpret the mercury sloshing around. Just with a lot more pairs of wires!) Also, you've got an interoceptive sense: your organs are somewhat free to move inside your body; and so, as you experience g-forces, your internal organs continue to move a bit after your body is stopped — and you experience this relative displacement of your organs as a familiar and intuitive \"lurching\" sensation. When your inner-ear accelerometer signal fails to cohere with your overall computed sense of motion, you get the feverish-dizzy, lacking-air, mentally-induced-nausea feeling of carsickness. When your interoceptive signal fails to cohere with your overall computed sense of motion, you get the bad kind of \"lurching sensation\" — which, if it happens enough times, causes a unique kind of acute \"body load\" nausea purely localized within the gut (something common among riders of rollercoasters with negative-g-force moments.) reply Balgair 10 hours agorootparentNit picks from former vestibular researcher : > the liquid in your cochlea sloshes around The vestibules are not the cochlea. The cochlea is responsible for sound. The vestibules are just about the sensation of movement, the structures are called Semicircular canals. You have one is each axis of rotation, more or less (x-y-z) > feel the liquid as it passes by them The hair cells are embedded in a crystal matrix, the otolith. The inertia of the 'heavy' crystal pulls the hair cells (which only look like hair and are not actually hair) and that sends a signal to the brain. Not the liquid. The Spins from drunkenness are due to the change in the density of the liquid in the vestibules (from the additional alcohol) causing a different buoyancy of the otoliths and thereby making the hair cells change resting position. > build an image of your position and acceleration Only the acceleration, not the position. You can only feel, via these organs, the 2nd derivative of position (0th derivative - position, 1st derivative - velocity, 2nd derivative - acceleration) > When your inner-ear accelerometer signal fails to cohere with your overall computed sense of motion, you get the feverish-dizzy, lacking-air, mentally-induced-nausea feeling of carsickness. This feeling is very unique to people and their lived experiences. Seasickness will subside for most people, and sailors/figure skaters/ballerinas/skateboarders/etc generally have a higher tolerance to motion sickness. Overall, very good overview! Thank you! reply crazygringo 11 hours agorootparentprevSo here's the first thing I thought of: remember those \"spaceship\" amusement park rides that sat about a dozen people, with the space adventure playing on the front \"window\", and it tilted front/back and side/side to simulate the effects of acceleration and deceleration. And I don't think there's any way of actually telling whether you're accelerating or tilting, as long as you keep the forces within a certain limited range? Which immediately makes me wonder -- what if you put this HoloTile floor on top of a platform that can tilt on both axes? What if the moment it starts to detect you walking forwards, it tilts \"uphill\" in the direction you're walking? When you suddenly stop walking, it tilts backwards slightly for a split second, then resets to level. Because this actually matches what our body experiences on a sidewalk -- when we walk forwards we actually tilt our body slightly forwards as we accelerate, and tilt it backwards briefly to stop. (Same as a Segway does, if that's easier to picture.) So if the floor tilts... would that be good enough to complete the illusion, and send the right signals to the inner ear? Because the liquid in your cochlea is now sloshing around in the right way? The interoception is matching as well? reply starkparker 10 hours agorootparentThis is what I'm thinking, yeah. This is Disney, perspective and momentum tricks like this are decades old and pretty well refined by this point. If holotile works out it just gives them another dimension to layer onto the existing tricks to make small linear spaces look and feel just enough like they're large and non-linear to shuffle people through an attraction. reply nickthegreek 13 hours agorootparentprevI almost always put a fan on me in in VR. It helps keep me cool and I use it to know which direction I’m facing. reply chungus 12 hours agorootparent+1, honestly essential. Allows me to go for hours playing Jet Island reply hhjinks 9 hours agorootparentprevHow much does the inner ear accelerate horizontally when you're already moving, though? After you're moving at a set pace, wouldn't almost all the acceleration be up or down, depending on how much \"bounce\" there is in your gait? reply InSteady 2 hours agorootparentprev>When your interoceptive signal fails to cohere with your overall computed sense of motion, you get the bad kind of \"lurching sensation\" — which, if it happens enough times, causes a unique kind of acute \"body load\" nausea purely localized within the gut Something like this would happen to me sometimes when I was intoxicated on alcohol and cannabis together (getting crunk, the kids used to say). After achieving a substantial buzz, if I closed my eyes and leaned back deeply in a chair or lay down on my back, I could get this vivid sensation of falling rapidly. Just like going down a steep rollercoaster. As long as I stayed in the sweet spot intoxication-wise, it was a thrilling and pleasurable sensation. From what I recall, after a few brief moments of exhilaration (that I could maybe relax and focus into in order to prolong), a subconscious awareness that I'm not actually moving takes over, which turns the sensation into pure nausea. Right in the pit of my stomach, like you describe. Sometimes if the nausea passed quickly enough I could open my eyes and sit up, re-center myself, and then induce the effect again. Anyway, kind of relevant in a weird way. The things we do for cheap thrills... And on that note, I could see potential for some people to get acclimated to this effect of the technology and actually enjoy it as part of the experience. reply jschlesser 15 hours agorootparentprevYour legs are moving but your head / vestibular system isn’t experiencing acceleration that it expects with those leg movements. Think of it this way, if you are holding a pendulum and take a normal step forward, the pendulum will start to swing. If you take a step forward on the magic floor tiles, your legs move normally but since your body stays in the same place, the pendulum is motionless. reply leereeves 15 hours agorootparent> Your legs are moving but your head / vestibular system isn’t experiencing acceleration that it expects with those leg movements That's also true on a treadmill. I think the bigger problem would be that the world appears to be moving (unlike a treadmill) and you don't feel any acceleration. reply Ringz 15 hours agorootparentSo can I use the Disney system to simulate running on a treadmill? reply maximus-decimus 14 hours agorootparentprevBut on a threadmill you're going in a straight line and usually at constant speed. A constant speed, you don't have acceleration. reply c0pium 13 hours agorootparent> you don't have acceleration If you actually use a treadmill, or watch motion capture, you’ll see that this isn’t the case. It’s a lot of slight accelerations and decelerations. The variation change from person to person, and more experienced runners are able to minimize them, but they’re still present. Edit: this study is peripherally related https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8160945/ reply leereeves 12 hours agorootparent> It’s a lot of slight accelerations and decelerations Isn't that always true? If I pay attention to it, I notice a lot of tiny movements of my head, as I just sit here typing. \"You don't have acceleration\" is just talking about the big accelerations from 0 mph to roughly 3 mph to 0 mph, not implying that you're completely motionless as if frozen in ice. reply c0pium 3 hours agorootparentAcceleration is change in velocity and change in time, either can effect the apparent amount of acceleration. The velocity you accelerate to or from is just an implementation detail. reply leereeves 14 hours agorootparentprevExactly, you don't have acceleration, and the world around you isn't moving relative to you, so there's no mismatch. The treadmill shows that performing the walking movements without acceleration doesn't generally cause motion sickness. reply 93po 14 hours agorootparentprevYou don't get motion sick on a treadmill because you're not wearing a VR headset. There's no forward motion of your head captured with your eyes to mismatch what your vestibular system is feeling. reply dr_kiszonka 13 hours agorootparentTo add to your point, there is a somewhat unpleasant sensation once you get off the treadmill, i.e., even if you are standing in place, it feels like you are moving forward. reply aspenmayer 8 hours agorootparentThis reminds me of the similar weird sensation of phantom movement after jumping on a trampoline. reply berniedurfee 8 hours agorootparentprevI actually do get a bit of motion sickness when I get off a treadmill. It takes me a couple minutes to get my bearings after stopping. reply c0pium 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is incorrect. You don’t get motion sick on a treadmill because the small accelerations and decelerations match what your eyes are seeing. There is motion. reply brookst 1 hour agorootparentprevInertia from the fluids in your ear being sloshed backwards when you move forward. Think of it like a plumb bob hung inside your skull. Would it be canted forward or back? I don’t think relative to floor matters for that kind of mechanical detection of movement. reply codexb 11 hours agorootparentprevMovement is relative, momentum is not. Run as fast as you can and then come to a screeching halt where you lean backwards. You can’t do that on treadmill. You might be able to simulate the screech and the lean by moving you on the treadmill, but the rest of your body can feel that relative motion. reply c0pium 3 hours agorootparentOf course you can, just put your feet on the sides instead of on the belt (don’t actually do this, you will absolutely hurt yourself). reply lttlrck 16 hours agoparentprevPerhaps headsets that manipulate the vestibular system via ultrasonic are in our future. (a entirely uneducated conjecture) reply modeless 16 hours agorootparentUnfortunately physics can't be fooled. Your limbs will still move according to the laws of inertia, and when that motion doesn't match your sense of balance your brain will likely be just as confused. But more importantly, you will immediately fall over if your sense of balance doesn't match reality exactly. Then you'd have to be supported by a harness. Obviously constantly being prevented from falling over by leaning on a harness is not going to feel like the natural movement that people want these systems to achieve. reply __MatrixMan__ 15 hours agorootparentI don't know, humans are pretty adaptable. I'm imagining spending a day \"running\" around in VR and then running in IRL and having all of this unexpected momentum causing me to fall over whenever I want to stop. reply Izkata 15 hours agorootparentprev> Then you'd have to be supported by a harness. Single-person omnidirectional treadmills for VR already exist, and as far as I know all of them use just such a harness: https://www.virtuix.com/ reply modeless 14 hours agorootparentYes, I know and I've used several types. They remain extremely niche exactly because they don't achieve anything like the natural walking feel people imagine these systems would provide. reply Animats 9 hours agorootparentHere's a good overview of omnidirectional treadmills by a VR native.[1] There are schemes with rows of endless belts. Ball bearings. Slippery surfaces. Running while going nowhere can be made to work in VR. At least for people who are somewhat athletic. Note, though, that the Disney demo doesn't show any fast motion. Useful advice from the VR native: get on platform, harness up, then put on headgear.

This is basically like walking on ice, except you slip more slowly, and you also un-slip (your feet are actively moved) occasionally to recenter. That limits both the speed you can pretend to walk, and the speed at which you can be moved back to center; because both relative movements are working against your natural balance. You will never be able to work with or against the inertia of your body weight. That is the core limitation of any treadmill. reply colordrops 16 hours agorootparentprevIt looks like it's limited in speed. reply croes 4 hours agorootparentIt's the first version reply michaelmrose 3 hours agorootparentHow do you make it fast without accidentally throwing people on their ass or ripping their fingers off if they trip? reply danmaz74 17 hours agoparentprevFor the lazy, from minute 3:28 reply Roritharr 17 hours agoprevSo, from looking at the video, it looks like these are wheels that can be angled so they make contact with whatever is on top of them more than the wheels next to them, applying a tiny bit of momentum in the desired direction to then angle out of the way while another wheel takes over. This is a really cool solution, but I can't imagine it not feeling very weird while walking since it's not you being moved with your entire contact surface area instead of some parts of your shoe getting dragged somewhere. In general the unexpected inertia must also feel really weird. reply btbuildem 17 hours agoparentI wonder how that interacts with being visually immersed in a VR environment. The walker will have no momentum, but still go through the motions of walking -- the visual feedback won't align with that of the inner ear. Maybe the next step is to put the rolly floor on a platform that can be dynamically angled away from horizontal, effectively creating a pitch that makes the person feel like they're leaning (well, they would be leaning) and that might be enough to fool the inner ear? Gravity and acceleration are pretty interchangeable after all. reply coffeebeqn 10 hours agorootparentAlso what if you walk into a virtual wall? Is there some collision detection and can it force you to stop somehow reply c0pium 13 hours agoparentprevIf you actually read the article you will see it works in an entirely different manner. reply bsza 17 hours agoparentprevThe same is true for a treadmill, and that doesn’t feel really weird to walk on. Though omni-directional treadmills for VR have been tested before, and IIRC it’s the starting and stopping that feels weird. reply rafaelmn 17 hours agorootparent> and that doesn’t feel really weird. Seeing people step on a treadmill for the first time I'd say it definitely does. You get used to it but the feeling is very different from regular walking/running. reply bsza 17 hours agorootparentIf it’s running at a constant speed, it shouldn’t be any different according to Newtonian mechanics. Perhaps seeing the environment stand still is weird, but in VR (which I understand would be the main application here) that’s a non-issue. reply tshaddox 17 hours agorootparentIt also needs to be sufficiently low-latency in its reactions to your change in speed. That’s not an issue when you’re walking or running outside. I think the need to maintain a very consistent speed is one of the difficulties in using a treadmill for the first time. reply armchairhacker 16 hours agorootparentprevMy issues with a treadmill is that there’s this wall right in front of me I run into if I run too fast, so it’s hard to run fast (even if I don’t run into the wall); the tread is narrow so I can’t move too far to the side (which makes it harder to run even if I don’t move to the side, I also find it a bit harder to run on a narrow sidewalk than a wide one); and of course I can’t run too slow or I’ll fall off. Seeing everything around me completely still as I run makes me nauseous, but that’s much less of an issue. The main issue, having to consciously constrain how I run (even if I actually run at a constant speed in a very straight line outside, so in theory it wouldn’t be necessary), makes running outside significantly easier and faster. VR should stick to bike trainers. Making an immersive bike that can simulate hills and turns and feel natural seems achievable today and is relatively a piece of cake. reply malfist 17 hours agorootparentprevIt's weird, but it's not \"learning a bike\" weird reply jayd16 17 hours agorootparentprev> IIRC it’s the starting and stopping that feels weird.

Recently I’ve realised that I was very wrong, and this is why. The visual element of VR is pretty much solved. Audio no problem. But the movement in space is intractable I now believe, and it is an absolutely critical issue that scuppers the whole idea. Tricks like this can give you a better approximation but I don’t think it’ll ever be good enough. You want to jump, spin, crouch, crawl, lie down. And interact with others. I think AR is going to be massive and Apple Vision Pro will be a big hit by gen 3 or 4, but VR is something likely to be “Human-Brain-Interface complete”. Given HBI success will likely arrive on or after the time we reach AGI, I don’t really know how that’s going to work out. I think headsets will be really fun for a while, but we’re not going to get the full experience.

I find current HMDs strapped to my head very uncomfortable, and that they're a major hurdle for mass VR adoption. In general, people want to be _less_ physically absorbed by technology, not more. I can't imagine anyone would want to use an exoskeleton robot suit for increased VR immersion. If anything, you would be less immersed because of the suit itself. I think this level of physical immersion is not feasible.

However, it probably doesn’t “solve” motion sickness, because the vestibular system still won’t think you are going forward. The bouncing around motion of walking does have a masking effect that will help some.“ I personally could not get over the awful bout of motion sickness after I played my first “walking around” game on VR. reply xg15 17 hours agoparentI think it depends how it's supposed to be used. If you try to use it like a treadmill in a tiny room then no - and I'm sceptical it would work at all, because the motors would probably be overpowered by any kind of decent sprint or jump. However I could imagine this to be able to expand the abilities of venues that already have enough space to let you walk around: You could have people move on their own as long as there is space, but then \"stealthily\" move them around when they think they're standing still, allowing either much larger geometries than would even fit in a hall or let you play around with non-euclidean geometries, etc. But yeah, in general I agree, I don't see how this will enable some kind of VR breakthrough or even just move us in the direction on one: Even with this tech working perfectly, you'd be restricted to scenarios where you walk on flat ground and never touch anything. Even a basic hike in the woods has more complex interactions than that, not even starting with the kind of over-the-top acrobatics that we're used to from non-VR videogames. So yeah, you could probably do the Stanley Parable in VR with this (without the staircases and the drops), but I don't see much else. reply Nevermark 17 hours agorootparent> you'd be restricted to scenarios where you walk on flat ground I don’t think it’s either surprising or discouraging that flat walking surfaces get worked out before dynamic surfaces. It might take a while, but it is inevitable. A rolling wave, with a grippy active surface, could keep you centered while you perceived an upward slope. Seeing and feeling a vista of uneven slopes in VR would be fantastic. I would love Skyrim as a health app! Also, simple tilting could provide the force feedback of changing speeds. reply thfuran 15 hours agorootparentprevI wonder how quickly you can spin someone while they're walking without it being perceptible. If you have a large area, you could use sneaky rotation to constrain movement while minimizing the amount of sliding people around you have to do. Though I'm not actually sure that'd be less noticeable at practical sizes. reply mlyle 17 hours agoparentprevCalling this a fatal flaw is silly. It may not fix everything with movement wearing a HMD, but one can imagine a whole lot of use cases without HMDs, and it might improve a lot of HMD use cases. reply djhope99 17 hours agorootparentSure but I think that Disney is likely to be presenting this as a potential consumer use case and if it can’t make traction there it seems pretty fatal if they can’t find a way to make money from it.

Well, yeah; they (Disney Research) are a tech company, not a product company, and this is — essentially — a B2B presentation for those big partner companies of theirs who might want to license this technology. They're not talking to consumers; they're talking to businesses who could build this thing into a product of theirs that is then sold to consumers. When this is in an actual product, they won't be talking about the tech of it at all. Disney Imagineering (the department that builds Disney's theme park rides) tries to make the tech as invisible to the experience as possible.

Somewhere of course like a Disney theme park or an airport where you choose your destination and you're shuttled to your gate with your luggage following. Or perhaps a secure room/floor in a building that if you don't have authorization to you simply cannot walk into without being pushed out of it. If we go dystopian, imagine a business suspects you of shoplifting and simply doesn't let you leave, or shuttles you to security automatically. reply InCityDreams 1 hour agoparentBut the suspicion is unfounded. Profit! reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 14 hours agoprevThis is really neat. Although in Star Trek, holodecks never had such a feature. Instead the simulation would use trickery to make sure you're never lead into the wall. E.g it would use illusions to trick you into thinking you're walking straight, but you're actually walking in a circle. reply easton 9 hours agoparentDepends on the implementation. I remember the TNG tech manual having a description of treadmills on the floor of the holodeck being used for exactly this. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 9 hours agorootparentHuh, I did not know that. Never read the tech manual, but I can't remember that being mentioned in show though.

One hack that room-scale VR systems do to make you feel like you're in a larger space is subtly curve the direction you're walking, so you end up walking in a large arc but you \"see\" you're walking in a straight line.

And then the edge case is extreme but topologically, can something like this work for running where you can lose contact with the ground and your body is sort of compensating for momentum?

Out of curiosity, is your primary goal to cultivate understanding and demystify, or to encourage people to build their own small models tailored to their needs? reply rasbt 16 hours agoparentI'd say my primary motivation is an educational goal, i.e., helping people understand how LLMs work by building one. LLMs are an important topic, and there are lots of hand-wavy videos and articles out there -- I think if one codes an LLM from the ground up, it will clarify lots of concepts. Now, the secondary goal is, of course, also to help people with building their own LLMs if they need to. The book will code the whole pipeline, including pretraining and finetuning, but I will also show how to load pretrained weights because I don't think it's feasible to pretrain an LLM from a financial perspective. We are coding everything from scratch in this book using GPT-2-like LLM (so that we can load the weights for models ranging from 124M that run on a laptop to the 1558M that runs on a small GPU). In practice, you probably want to use a framework like HF transformers or axolotl, but I hope this from-scratch approach will demystify the process so that these frameworks are less of a black box. reply pr337h4m 2 minutes agorootparentWhile pretraining a decent-sized LLM from scratch is not financially feasible for the average person, it is very much feasible for the average YC/VC backed startup (ignoring the fact that it's almost always easier to just use something like Mixtral or LLaMa 2 and fine-tune as necessary). >Introducing MPT-7B, the first entry in our MosaicML Foundation Series. MPT-7B is a transformer trained from scratch on 1T tokens of text and code. It is open source, available for commercial use, and matches the quality of LLaMA-7B.

For example, I know \"attention\" is used in a variety of models, and I know transformers are used in more than just language models. Will this book help me understand attention and transformers well enough that I can use them outside of language models? reply AndrewKemendo 16 hours agoprevWriting a technical book in public is a level of anxiety I can’t imagine, so kudos to the author! reply rasbt 16 hours agoparentIt kind of is, but it's also kind of motivating :) reply waynesonfire 14 hours agoparentprevIt's actually less risky.

Incredible. reply whartung 15 hours agoprevCan I use any of the information in this book to learn about reinforcement learning? My goal is to have something learn to land, like a lunar lander. Simple, start at 100 feet, thrust in one direction, keep trying until you stop making craters. Then start adding variables, such as now it's moving horizontally, adding a horizontal thruster. next, remove the horizontal thruster and let the lander pivot. Etc. I just have no idea how to start with this, but this seems \"mainstream\" ML, curious if this book would help with that. reply Buttons840 15 hours agoparentI enjoyed \"Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning\"[0]. It doesn't include anything about transformers though. Also, see Python's gymnasium[1] library for a lunar lander environment, it's the one I focused on most while I was learning and I've solved it a few different ways now. You can also look at my own notebook I used when implementing Soft Actor Critic with PyTorch not too long ago[2], it's not great for teaching, but maybe you can get something out of it.

Even with things like AlphaGo, what you find is basically work in using deep neural networks as an input into classic RL techniques. Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction is widely considered a the definitive intro to the topic. reply rasbt 14 hours agoparentprevSorry, in that case I would rather recommend a dedicated RL book. The RL part in LLMs will be very specific to LLMs, and I will only cover what's absolutely relevant in terms of background info. I do have a longish intro chapter on RL in my other general ML/DL book (https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book/tree/main/ch1...) but like others said, I would recommend a dedicated RL book in your case. reply thatguysaguy 15 hours agoparentprevTry OpenAI's spinning up: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/ reply Buttons840 14 hours agorootparentThis is a good and short introduction to RL. The density of the information in Spinning Up was just right for me and I think I've referred to it more often than any other resource when actually implementing my own RL algorithms (PPO and SAC). If I had to recommend a curriculum to a friend I would say: (1) Spend a few hours on Spinning Up. (2) If the mathematical notation is intimidating, read Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning (from Manning), which is slower paced and spends a lot of time explaining the notation itself, rather than just assuming the mathematical notation is self-explanatory as is so often the case. This book has good theoretical explanations and will get you some running code. (3) Spend a few hours with Spinning Up again. By this point you should be a little comfortable with a few different RL algorithms. (4) Read Sutton's book, which is \"the bible\" of reinforcement learning. It's quite approachable, but it would be a bit dry and abstract without some hands-on experience with RL I think. reply sorenjan 6 hours agoparentprevThat's exactly what the Q-learning lab in this course does: https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDC17/info/labs/rl.en.shtml reply smokel 15 hours agoparentprevThis book seems to focus on large language models, for which RLHF is sometimes a useful addition. To learn more about RL, most people would advise the Sutton and Barto book, available at: http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html reply Buttons840 14 hours agorootparentI would recommend this as a second book after reading a \"cookbook\" style book that is more focused on getting real code working. After some hands-on experience with RL (whether you succeed or fail), Sutton's book will be a lot more interesting and approachable. reply npalli 15 hours agoprevimport torch From the first code sample, not quite from scratch :-) reply rasbt 15 hours agoparentLol ok, otherwise it would probably be not very readable due to the verbosity. The book shows how to implement LayerNorm, Softmax, Linear layers, GeLU etc without using the pre-packaged torch versions though. reply PheonixPharts 14 hours agoparentprevAutomatic differentiation is why we are able to have complex models like transformers, it's arguably the key reason (in addition to large amounts of data and massive compute resources) that we have the revolution in AI that we have. Nobody working in this space is hand calculating derivatives for these models. Thinking in terms of differentiable programming is a given and I think certainly counts as \"from scratch\" in this case. Any time I see someone post a comment like this, I suspect the don't really understand what's happening under the hood or how contemporary machine learning works. reply re 11 hours agorootparent> Thinking in terms of differentiable programming is a given and I think certainly counts as \"from scratch\" in this case. I have to disagree on that being an obvious assumption for the meaning of \"from scratch\", especially given that the book description says that readers only need to know Python. It feels like if I read \"Crafting Interpreters\" only to find that step one is to download Lex and Yacc because everyone working in the space already knows how parsers work. > I suspect the don't really understand what's happening under the hood or how contemporary machine learning works. Everyone has to start somewhere. I thought I would be interested in a book like this precisely because I don't already fully understand what's happening under the hood, but it sounds like it might not actually be a good starting point for my idea of \"from scratch.\" reply rasbt 8 hours agorootparentOn that note, I have a relative comprehensive intro to PyTorch in the Appendix (~40 pages) that go over automatic differentiation etc. The alternative, if you want to build something truly from scratch, would be to implement everything in CUDA, but that would not be a very accessible book. reply antonvs 6 hours agorootparent“If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.” —- Carl Sagan reply d0mine 3 hours agorootparentprevNobody writes code in terms of Nands but there is Nand to Tetris course (\"The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles\" book) https://www.nand2tetris.org pytorch to LLMs has a lot to show even without Python to pytorch part.

Creating educational materials requires an insane amount of work, and I can promise, no matter how successful this book is, if rasbt were do the math on income generated over hours spent creating it wouldn't make sense as an hourly rate. Plenty of other people have this understanding of these topics, and you know what they chose to do with that knowledge? Keep it to themselves and go work at OpenAI to make far more money keeping that knowledge private. If you want to live in a world where this knowledge is open, at the very least refrain from publicly complaining about a book that cost roughly the same as a decent dinner. reply rasbt 14 hours agorootparentYeah, I don't think creating educational materials makes sense from an economical perspective, but it's one of my hobbies that gives me joy for some reason :). Hah, and 'insane amount of work' is probably right -- lots of sacrifices to carve out that necessary time. reply layer8 11 hours agorootparentprev> anyone working in the AI space I would have expected the main target audience to be people NOT working in the AI space, that don’t have any prior knowledge (“from scratch”), just curious to learn how an LLM works. reply _giorgio_ 13 hours agorootparentprevNot to be pedantic, but in this case it's probably 30 usd for print and ebook (there are always coupons on the manning website). reply wslh 14 hours agorootparentprevNot talking about affordability but about following links thinking that I would find another kind of resource.

They reached out whether I was interested in writing a book for them (probably because of my other writings online), I mentioned what kind I book I want to write, submitted a proposal, and they liked that idea :) reply iamcreasy 11 hours agoprevThank you for this endeavour. Do you have an ETA for the completion of the book? reply rasbt 8 hours agoparentThe ETA for the last chapter is August if things continue to go well. It's usually available in the MEAP a few weeks after that, some time in September. And print version should be available early 2025 I think. reply iamcreasy 5 hours agorootparentI'll definitely buy it once released. In the meantime, do you know any other free/paid resource that comes close to what you are trying to achieve with this book? reply malermeister 15 hours agoprevHow does this compare to the karpathy video [0]? I'm trying to get into LLMs and am trying to figure out what the best resource to get that level of understanding would be. [0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY reply rasbt 15 hours agoparentHaven't fully watched this but from a brief skimming, here are some differences that the book has: - it implements a real word-level LLM instead of a character-level LLM - after pretraining also shows how to load pretrained weights - instruction-finetune that LLM after pretraining - code the alignment process for the instruction-finetuned LLM - also show how to finetune the LLM for classification tasks - the book it overall has a lots of figures. For Chapter 3, there are 26 figures alone :) The video looks awesome though. I think it's probably a great complementary resource to get a good solid intro because it's just 2 hours. I think reading the book will probably be more like 10 times that time investment. reply malermeister 13 hours agorootparentThank you for the answer! What is the knowledge that your book requires? If I have a lot of software dev experience and sorta kinda remember algebra from uni, would it be a good fit? reply rasbt 8 hours agorootparentGood question. I think a Python background is strongly recommended. PyTorch knowledge would be a nice to have (although I've written a comprehensive 40 page intro for the Appendix, which is also already available). From a math perspective, I think it should be gentle. I'm introducing dot products in Chapter 3, but I also explain how you could do the same with for-loops. Same with matrix multiplication. I'm bad at estimating requirements, but I hope this should be sufficient. reply _giorgio_ 15 hours agoparentprevYou can't understand it unless you already know most of the stuff. I've watched it many times to understand well most of it. And obviously you must already know pytorch really well, including the matrix multiplication, backpropagation etc. He speaks very fast too... reply hadjian 14 hours agorootparentDid you really watch all videos in the playlist? I am at video 4 and had no background in PyTorch or numpy. In my opinion he covers everything needed to understand his lectures. Even broadcasting and multidimensional indexing with numpy. Also in the first lecture you will implement your own python class for building expressions including backprop with an API modeled after PyTorch. IMHO it is the second lecture I can recommend without hesitation. The other is Gilbert Strang on linear algebra. reply fbdab103 14 hours agorootparentTo echo this sentiment, I thought he does a really reasonable job of working up to the topic. Sure, it is fast paced, but it is a video you can rewind, plus play with the notebooks. There is a lot to learn, but I think he touches on all of the highlights which would give the viewer the tools to have a better understanding if they want to explore the topic in depth. Plus, I like that the videos are not overly polished. He occasionally makes a minor blunder, which really humanizes the experience. reply _giorgio_ 13 hours agorootparentprevI was talking about the last video. It's difficult unless you don't know most of the material, or if you havent watched the other videos in the series. Anyway those videos are quite advanced. Surely not for beginners. reply tayo42 15 hours agorootparentprevHe has like 4 or 5 videos that can be watched before that one where all of that is covered. He goes over stuff like writing back prop from scratch and implementing layers without torch. reply _giorgio_ 15 hours agorootparentI know... That material isn't for beginners. reply mikeiavelli 6 hours agorootparent...but then, what material did you expect as a beginner? reply Karupan 14 hours agoprevBought a copy. Good luck rasbt! reply rasbt 8 hours agoparentThanks :) reply clueless 16 hours agoprev [–] are the code for chapter 4 through 8 missing? reply rasbt 16 hours agoparentIt's in progress still. I have most of the code working, but it's not organized into the chapter structure, yet. I am planning to add a new chapter every ~month (I wish I could do this faster, but I also have some other commitments). Chapter 4 will be either uploaded by the end of this weekend or by the end of next weekend. reply _giorgio_ 15 hours agoparentprev [–] Depending on your level, it could take a lot of weeks to go through the already available material (code and pdf), so I'd suggest to purchase it anyway...

Show activity on this post. Is it insider trading if I bought Boeing puts while I am inside the wrecked airplane? No. Insider information is information obtained from an \"insider\" such as an executive or director of the company, or perhaps someone subject to a non-disclosure agreement with the company. Engaging in stock trading based upon confidential information from an insider source, before it is publicly disclosed, is illegal in most cases. See, e.g., here and here. From the first link: SEC Rule 10b-5 prohibits corporate officers and directors or other insider employees from using confidential corporate information to reap a profit (or avoid a loss) by trading in the Company’s stock. This rule also prohibits “tipping” of confidential corporate information to third parties. · Who is an insider? An “insider” is an officer, director, 10% stockholder and anyone who possesses inside information because of his or her relationship with the Company or with an officer, director or principal stockholder of the Company. Rule 10b-5’s application goes considerably beyond just officers, directors and principal stockholders. This rule also covers any employee who has obtained material non-public corporate information, as well as any person who has received a “tip” from an Insider of the Company concerning information about the Company that is material and nonpublic, and trades (i.e. purchase or sells) the Company’s stock or other securities. When you are not personally an insider, and you are relying on your own personal knowledge, you are not relying on knowledge from an \"insider\", so you are not engaged in insider trading. It is also worth noting that Boeing is an aircraft manufacturer, not an airline. So, no one employed by the airline flying the plane would be an insider with respect to Boeing.

(The question is about Boeing stock, not United stock.) – phoog Jan 11 at 6:52 5 @ZizyArcher It seems inconceivable that the CEO of Boeing wouldn’t know something that’s not public knowledge and is relevant to share price movements after the accident. – Mike Scott Jan 11 at 13:27Show 15 more comments This answer is useful 29 This answer is not useful Save this answer. Show activity on this post. Matt Levine has answered this exact question in his yesterday’s Money Stuff column (archive.is link): Nothing here is ever legal advice but this seems fine? Insider trading, I like to say, is not about fairness, it’s about theft. It’s illegal to trade on information that isn’t public and that you have some duty to keep secret. If you work for Boeing Co. and you put the bolts in wrong and trade on that information, that’s bad: You learned the nonpublic information in your job, and you had a duty to Boeing to use it only for the good of Boeing rather than trading on it. If you’re the pilot, don’t buy puts when the door flies off. (Land the plane!) But if you are just a regular person and you go to McDonald’s and buy a burger and say “this burger tastes bad, I’m gonna short the stock,” that’s fine, that’s legitimate research. If you log into Instagram and say “hey this app is good” and buy Meta stock, that’s good. People are supposed to go around observing companies’ products and services, evaluating them, and incorporating those evaluations into their investment decisions. That’s how stock prices become efficient and how capital gets allocated to good uses rather than bad ones. Similarly if you’re on a plane and the door blows off and you think “this plane is poorly constructed, I’m gonna short some stocks here,” seems fine. What duty do you have to keep it confidential? Maybe there’s some fine print in your ticket contract but I doubt it. There are probably edge cases. What if you are flying for a work trip: Do you owe some obligation to your employer not to use the information to trade for your own account? Still probably not a huge enforcement priority to come after you.

As if no one else on the plane has realized the door has blown off? As if the whole world won't shortly know about it? – pacoverflow Jan 11 at 16:47 13 @pacoverflow That's a rhetorical question which is immediately answered with \"NO\". The author agrees with you that there is no duty to confidentiality – divibisan Jan 11 at 17:04 6 Insider trading, I like to say, is not about fairness, it’s about theft. That seems off. Why does the SEC care about theft from a company? The SEC's remit is protecting stockholders and the market in general, not looking after the private interests of particular companies. If you steal cash from your employer and use it to buy stock, you've also profited illicitly from your employer. But it's not the SEC which is going to prosecute you. -- Is the \"insider trading = theft\" angle a widely held one, or is this just Matt Levine's personal hot-take? – R.M. Jan 11 at 21:52 @pacoverflow: I think it's in the context of in the moment of the trade, to your trader - you're telling the stock exchange that you're shorting the stock, and then you happen to successfully short it because of an event happening to your knowledge that will lead to the stock shorting in short notice. But the knowledge isn't something you personally had a hand in. – Alexander The 1st Jan 11 at 22:00 2 @R.M. The word \"theft\" is definitely a poor choice in a legal discussion, since it has it's own specific definition. But colloquially, theft refers to stealing value from the person at the other side of the trade. E.g. I buy a share from you for $100 based on inside information. The price then goes up to $110 after the information becomes public. You should have benefited from the $10, not me. So, I've \"stolen\" $10 from you by buying the share at a time when it was illegal to do so. – JBentley Jan 12 at 10:46Show 9 more comments This answer is useful 4 This answer is not useful Save this answer.

No, this is not illegal insider trading: U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION - Insider Trading Illegal insider trading refers generally to buying or selling a security, in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, on the basis of material, nonpublic information about the security. Insider trading violations may also include \"tipping\" such information, securities trading by the person \"tipped,\" and securities trading by those who misappropriate such information. As an ordinary passenger, you have no fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence to Boeing, so illegal insider trading isn't applicable to this case. (Unless there is something obscure in the fine print on an airline ticket, somehow burdening you with fiduciary responsibility.)

If an insider with confidentiality obligations shares material non-public information with a person who has no confidentiality obligation, and that person trades on that information, that would be insider trading. The link you referenced also clarifies this point, but it is different from what is written in your comment.

You are, as parent mentioned, just the first to know the news. reply Retric 12 hours agorootparentThat’s not quite correct, it depends on the nature of the disclosure. Someone receiving information from an insider needs be independent of personal, financial, and quid pro quo relationships.

O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642 (1997), individuals could only be liable for insider trading under the classical theory of insider trading. In U.S. v. O’Hagan, the U.S. Supreme Court faced a scenario where a partner at a large law firm purchased stock futures in a company conducting a tender offer based on inside information that he gleaned from other partners at the firm working on the deal. Although the partner had no fiduciary duty to the companies in whose stock he traded, the Supreme Court found him liable under Rule 10 b-5 on the grounds that he used confidential information to trade securities. The Court reasoned that such insider trading is fraudulent because it is akin to embezzlement; that is, the owner of the confidential information has exclusive use of such information, and the trader misappropriates that information by trading on it and not disclosing the use of the information to the owner of the information. reply Retric 9 hours agorootparentThat partner had privileged access to that confidential information and as such wasn’t an unrelated 3rd party.

Theft from the company is the central tenet, whether you are an insider, have a fiduciary responsibility, or an outsider who comes across data from inside the company. Material nonpublic information that isn't taken from the company is fair game, thus all the quant funds that collect detailed market intelligence and trade on it (or the posted example, a passenger on the plane who knew the news ahead of the public).

Further, I struggle to understand how one could learn information which is non-public without \"theft\" of that information. It would seem that, by definition, if the organization begins sharing that information with individuals who have no confidentiality obligation, they have now made that information public. What does tend to happen often is that others assume \"public\" means \"written in the news\" and that is certainly not the case. There are plenty of things that are knowable by the public but not obvious, and it's perfectly fine to trade on that. reply sokoloff 13 hours agorootparentYou’re missing a clause in what constitutes illegal insider trading. From an SEC site: https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-ba... (italics added by me) > Illegal insider trading refers generally to buying or selling a security, in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, on the basis of material, nonpublic information about the security. reply colinmorelli 13 hours agorootparentMy statement was copied from Cornell Law's definition [1]. But, yes, all of these shorthand definitions are designed for the general public's consumption, and skip over specific nuances - including the SEC's definition. The sentence read above would seem to permit a person with a fiduciary duty to share information with someone who does not have one, and for that person to trade based on the information. However, we know this is not permitted. In any case, I think my comment still stands. I specifically called out in my parenthetical in the original comment that the information would need to be knowable only by those with a fiduciary or confidentiality obligation to the company. This seems to cover your comment and sibling's concern. [1]: https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/insider_trading reply paulsutter 13 hours agorootparentprevYou're thinking too narrowly. Example: logs of search queries that suddenly trend with adverse information about companies. Those logs are not public, in fact you need to buy them, but they have real signal (thus material and nonpublic), and are perfectly legal to buy and use. Satellite photos to estimate material stacking up outside a factory, or how many cars are in the parking lots of retail stores. Mobile data that has been statistically tied to foot traffic in stores. Credit card purchase data (not public! very material! perfectly ok!)

Suppose you are a independent technician repairing cars. Over time you notice, that, say BMW car quality used to be good but has gone to shit. That's not public information, but you would be allowed to short BMW stock in the hopes that, once public catches on, their share price will tank. In fact half the point of stock trading if for you to do research, including your own investigation and testing. And then use that as an advantage.

The gp's wording is a little confusing but he's just trying to explain the transitive logic of non-public information transferring from a \"true insider\" to an outsider is also \"insider trading\" and thus illegal. Think of it as the provenance of information coming from an insider. E.g. Martha Stewart is an \"outsider\" and not an insider of drug company ImClone but she was found guilty of insider trading because she did get confidential information from insiders at the Merrill Lynch brokerage that handled stock trades for the ImClone CEO: https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-69.htm Your scenario of a mechanic repairing cars, or somebody counting the number of cars in various Walmart parking lots, or a hacker that discovers a serious website vulnerability that may cause embarrassment and stock price drop ... none of those situations have a corporate insider in that information disclosure loop. reply injb 14 hours agorootparent>> Martha Stewart is an \"outsider\" and not an insider of drug company ImClone but she was found guilty of insider trading Minor correction: she was not convicted of insider trading.

I was trying to avoid the use of \"insider,\" because people tend to assume that means employees or directors, but that is not the case. Outside organizations who have, as an example, signed an NDA with the organization may learn of material non-public information, and trading on that could constitute insider trading. reply nightpool 13 hours agorootparent> \"Non-public\" in this context refers to information which would only be available to those with a fiduciary responsibility and/or a confidentiality obligation to the organization. Right, but information available to those with a confidentiality obligation can still be traded on if acquired legally. That's the crucial point. It's not enough for it to be non-public and material, you must also be in breach of a fiduciary duty (or acting in concert with somebody who is). For example, if a Boeing CEO was at a coffee shop discussing an upcoming acquisition at the table next to you, you'd be able to trade on it, even though it was confidential information not available to the general public and obviously material to Boeing's stock price. reply colinmorelli 13 hours agorootparentIt's not required – to my knowledge – that specific person disclosing the information be in breach of a fiduciary duty, as one could easily overcome that by disclosing to someone who discloses it to someone else, who then trades on it. The scenario you mentioned is generally understood to be permissible, but it's not exactly clear to me why. Perhaps that the information became \"public\" (whether intentional or not) when discussing it in a public forum such as a coffee shop? reply ada1981 11 hours agorootparentprevI’m curious about trading on your supply chain partners.

The situation you're describing is very similar to the Boeing situation above. You just happen to be the first person aware of the news, because your job provides you the ability to see a bunch of cars and understand how their quality is trending. Nor is it any different than you buying, say, one of the first Rivans, thinking the QC was horrible, and shorting the stock. Regardless of when you learned it, the quality of BMW's cars (in this example) became public information when they started selling them to the public. Now, however, if an internal employee told the technician that BMW had removed all QA checks from their line, and (s)he should expect quality to fall precipitously in the years ahead, that would be different. reply ghaff 14 hours agorootparentprevJust because Car and Driver hasn't published an expose doesn't mean the information isn't public.

That \"someone who would have happily bought it at the same price or possibly a higher price\" is someone who wouldn't have done it, knowing what the insider knows, they would've waited.

On the other hand, if I am aware of some fault in Apple Inc. and am prohibited or prevented from selling my AAPL shares, the buyers whom I would have sold to will not only still buy AAPL shares from someone else, they will likely pay a higher price for them! Again, if the law required corporations to publicly reveal, as soon as possible, any and all insider information that may potentially influence the company’s market valuation, that would be one thing. Instead, not only are they not required to do that, but the information is not even allowed to leak out onto the markets in the form of insider sales which would depress the stock price and tip off investors that, even if they don’t know exactly what it is, that something is wrong with the company. reply kevinmchugh 14 hours agoparentprevIf I work for Apple and I'm on the special secret new Apple Glasses project, I reasonably know that when the product is announced the stock is going to go up.

By buying shares before the announcement, I'm capturing some of the gain that should be Apple's. reply filoleg 14 hours agorootparentThat's why companies like Apple have very strongly enforced rules related to this for their employees, like blackout windows on trading AAPL shares and not allowing them trading AAPL shares at all. And there are even more restrictions for those working on certain teams and in certain areas (e.g., finance/accounting). Buying/selling right before the big announcement or earnings reports is straight up not allowed. I don't know the actual dates for Apple (as I only have friends working there, I haven't worked there myself, and I didn't quite care to ask for the exact length of trading blackout windows). But I know for a fact myself that at Google you get a trading blackout window that starts around 3-4 weeks before the quarterly earnings announcements and ends around a week or so after. And you are not allowed to trade GOOG options at all while an emlpoyee, not even outside of those trading blackout windows. There are additional blackout windows as well, but that's beside the point, and I don't remember them off the top of my head.

    "title": "The End of Square Checkboxes: Evolution and Future of User Controls",
    "originLink": "https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/",
    "originBody": "In Loving Memory of Square Checkbox This is a checkbox: It’s square, it has a checkmark inside, and its distinguishing feature is that you can select any number of them at the same time: Different operating systems rendered them differently during their evolution: macOS Sonoma (2023) OS X Mavericks (2013) OS X Leopard (2007) Mac OS 9 (1999) Mac OS 7.5 (1994) Windows 11 (2021) Windows 8 (2012) Windows 7 (2009) Windows XP (2001) Windows 2000 (2000) Windows 95 (1995) Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (1993) As you can see, even the checkmark wasn’t always there. But one thing remained constant: checkboxes were square. Why square? Because that’s how you can tell them from radio buttons: Their distinguishing feature is a single choice. If you select one, everything else is de-selected. I’m not sure when the distinction between square/round was introduced, but it seems to already exist in the 90-s: Turbo Pascal 7.0 (1992) Norton Commander 5 (1993) And since then, every major operating system followed this tradition. From Windows 3.11: Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (1993) through Windows 95: to Windows 11: Windows 11 (2021) from Mac OS 4: Mac OS 4 (1987) till macOS Sonoma: macOS Sonoma (2023) There was a brief confusion up until 1986 when Apple used rounded rectangles instead of circles: Mac OS 3 (1986) but it was quickly resolved. The point is, every major OS vendor has been adhering to the convention that checkboxes are square and radio buttons are round. Then the Web came. And when I say Web, I mean CSS. And when I say CSS, I mean Flash and then JavaScript. You see, people on the Web think conventions are boring. That regular controls need to be reinvented and redesigned. They don’t believe there are any norms. That’s why it’s common to see radio buttons containing checkmarks: Twitter (2024) Or square radio buttons: Yandex Maps (2024) Following the Web’s example, native apps introduced us to round checkboxes: Telegram for macOS (2024) Sometimes people just don’t make distinctions anymore. For example, here the first group is single-choice, while the second one is multiple-choice: Yandex Maps (2024) Or here, one of those polls is single-answer, another is multiple-answer: Telegram Web (2024) How are people supposed to know? But despite all this chaos and temptation, operating system vendors knew better. To this day, they follow THE convention: checkboxes are square, radio buttons are round. Maybe it was part of their internal training. Maybe they had experienced art directors. Maybe it was just luck. I don’t know — it doesn’t really matter — but — somehow — they managed to stick to the convention. Until this day. Apple is the first major operating system vendor who had abandoned a four-decades-long tradition. Their new visionOS — for the first time in the history of Apple — will have round checkboxes. Apple Design Resouces — visionOS — Library How should we even call these? Radio checks? Check buttons? Anyway, with Apple’s betrayal, I think it’s fair to say there’s no hope for this tradition to continue. I therefore officially announce 2024 to be the year when the square checkbox has finally died. Kids these days will use a toggle anyway. Credits Resources used to prepare this post: Version Museum Guidebook 512 Pixels Internet Archive Apple Developer ilyabirman.net January 29, 2024",

Likewise I thought the article’s punchline was going to be the increasing use of on-off toggles instead of checkboxes. Like how the settings app on macOS now has more on-off toggles than ever before.

They turn green when you shove them to the right into the on position. That's about as much as my brain can process. In many other environments these clues are more subtle or completely absent and I never know which is which. I don't necessarily wish my check-box back, because I think a slider is easier to handle on touch devices[1], but it should be done in a way that indicates the status clearly. Apple's use of color is also not perfect, but at least they did not fall into the trap of using red and green. Light grey and vibrant green should be distinguishable for most people with color deficiencies even. [1] At least when implemented properly. I am looking at you Ninebot.

I remember user interface design class at my university ca. 2005 where 20 out of the 30 best practice interaction design patterns originated at Apple! Steve Jobs for the most part really cared and you could feel those priorities clearly: \"it's how it works, not how it looks!\" Aside from some natural missteps, the \"form over function\" critique at the time was predominantly false. Apple is slowly getting there though, joining \"ignorant web\" as correctly called out here by Nikita. The thing is that none of this is a joke or could be taken however lightly. It's 2024 and by now we've fundamentally realized the \"Software is Eating the World\" prophecy; living in a digitally permeated world. Bad design is a moral issue, in worst case scenarios it has been killing people before and will increasingly kill or harm even more going forward. It always starts with the little things, especially so in design / engineering. I desperately hope that Zoomers at least will start to realize that Millenials really fucked it up in that regard. I know, I know it also were the bosses pushing for this but we clearly should have said \"no\" much more often as the professionals (?) implementing this stuff. There is much satisfaction waiting in learning; a full-grown craft with deep history.

Preset radios came in a huge variety and some of them were actually round. Car radios (the radios that have stuck around the longest) need big and bulky buttons so you can operate them without taking your eyes off the road, but some home radios had smaller, circular buttons instead. The \"radio\" buttons I used as a kid were small, rectangular sticks poking out of a metal plate that you pushed in. Every brand had their own shapes and designs. Unfortunately, I can't find any pictures of older radios on the internet because every image searching site seems to have been overtaken with badly generated AI art, stock photos, and cheap, plastic \"retro vintage\" Amazon listings. reply eskodhi 55 minutes agoparentprevYeah the name definitely refers more to the functionality/behavior of the buttons.

When you push another button in to choose another station, the previously pressed button would \"pop\" back up/depress (thereby \"unselecting\" itself), thereby enforcing the mutual exclusivity of a station selection. reply xg15 1 hour agoprevMy impression is that in modern UIs, both checkboxes and option buttons are being phased out: Checkboxes seems to be replaced with apple-style toggle buttons, which I guess are more intuitive for some people? Option buttons don't have any direct replacement that I can think of, you just see them incredibly rarely. My guess is that they always were one of several possible means to have the user select from a set of choices, the other prominent ones being a plain listbox widget or a combobox/dropdown widget - or of course, just use plain buttons. For some reason, designers seem to prefer plain buttons or a dropdown for this usecase today. reply AlienRobot 1 minute agoprevIs everybody insane? I go to Windows, terrible GUI choices.

WIth that, it might make sense to reevaluate if they're still a useful UI language idiom, and if the different handling is still necessary. reply skgough 50 minutes agoparentI also think the visual idiom doesn't hold up, especially since implementers don't use radio buttons correctly half the time.

What can I say? The world (of computing) changes under our feet. Nostalgia on Sunday morning... reply squarefoot 2 hours agoprevNot to mention the confusion arising from checkboxes in web pages used in place of checkmarks. A checkmark alone should be the correct object to use for output only, while a checkbox normally would accept an input from the user. I don't recall where, but have seen this some times around the web and found it misleading. reply alentred 47 minutes agoprevI remember reading a book about UX years ago, and one of the fundamental principles there was the discoverability and the intuitive use, which boiled down to sticking to conventions that are rooted in everyone's experience. Stuff like using check boxes and radio buttons properly, having the \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons in their regular places (and not a \"Maybe later\"), using unambiguous confirmations (unlike the \"Are you sure you do not want to not unsubscribe?\"), sticking to the same navigation patterns users see in most other apps. Now, I don't subscribe to it in full. There needs to be room for innovation. To my taste, it was quite boring when all software looked literally the same. Nevertheless, I agree there needs to be some reason too. Some short time ago every new app looked like a new game where you needed go through a tutorial to learn the basics. That was probably too much. But, I don't know, as of late it feels like this iteration comes to and end, the apps start being intuitive again and reuse some patterns. The sidebars, user menus, etc. all in the same place. Mostly. So, yay discoverability and intuitive use. But that doesn't mean we can't innovate in UX, while keeping it intuitive. Just not the \"Maybe later\" abusive way, please. reply eviks 2 hours agoprevWhile the checkbox is less confusing than a lot of toggles (eg, the ones in Windows' settings are bad), relying on the unintuitive distinction between a circle and a square is just one of those bad old UI traditions that, I guess, persist until the next tech generation, little to love here. The better UI would be for the circles to be visually connected somehow to illustrate that only one selection is possible like you have in physical switches with more than two positions reply Findecanor 12 minutes agoparentFor mutually-exclusive buttons with the labels inside the buttons, there exists such a convention: Group the buttons together with no space between them. Sometimes, the corners of the buttons at the far edges are rounded but the lines between them are not. You will often see these in word processors, for aligning text ( leftcentredor right ). A related issue with radio buttons and check boxes is that in some GUIs, clicking the label next to the box/button also clicks the widget, but there was no visual indication that that is the case. Sometimes the clickable area even extends the whole width of the window. This carries the risk of users making a selection when all they wanted to do was to click the window in a seemingly inactive area to make it come to front. I think we could solve that issue and visually connect radio buttons by placing them onto a background rectangle with rounded corners — thus adapting a visual cue from the button group widget. Then highlight the background portion that is clickable when the mouse hovers over it, and when the button/area gets clicked. Further, you could choose to make the colours consistent with those you'd use for selecting items in lists. reply saghm 2 hours agoparentprev> The better UI would be for the circles to be visually connected somehow to illustrate that only one selection is possible like you have in physical switches with more than two positions This is an interesting point. Radio buttons are kind of weird in terms of their initial position because unlike with checkboxes, there's no way to get back to the \"empty\" state where none is selected. It took me a bit to wrap my head around what you described, but the more I think about it, the more it seems like a \"slider\" with clearly marked stopping positions. If it's too confusing for people to have some sort of \"default\" option, maybe having a different color for the part of the slider that's moved based on whether it's in a valid position could help; at the top of the slider, it could be one color indicating \"must be moved\", and then when you slide and drop it at one of the marked options (or click the option; it could move automatically to the position like a scrollbar), it changes color to show it's valid. reply xg15 1 hour agorootparentMicrosoft briefly experimented with this, in the \"security zones\" dialog in Windows XP: http://hs.windows.microsoft.com/resbox/en/6.2/main/9f04b9c9-... It's not the exact design you describe: The slider is there, but only the label of the selected option is shown, the other options are only represented as tick marks. I think there are two problems with the design though, (which would also still be there if all labels were shown): - The slider widget back then was normally used for selecting continuous numeric or at least interval scaled input values: That's what the mechanism of dragging it with the mouse was developed for. It could be configured with a small number of discrete values as options, but then dragging became awkward: Either the ticks were spaced very far, then you had to drag the cursor a long distance before there was any kind of visual feedback at all - or the ticks were spaced closely, like here, but then dragging the slider to one specific tick became difficult. - It's possible to click the slider, but there is no visual indication that you can do so. In fact, the visual indicators are almost inverse to how you'd need them: The selected option has a big handle that you can not click (only drag), the unselected options have no handle though you can actually click on the empty slider bar to move the handle in that direction. I guess that's why they never did this again after this one try - which is sort of a pity, because you could probably build a redesigned slider widget optimized for discrete input that solved those problems. reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 50 minutes agorootparentBut if it was implemented the way the parent poster said then it would be much more clear the discrete points are clickable. reply eviks 1 hour agorootparentprevCould be a slider with the same radio circles denoting the stopping position, could be those circle volume buttons with labeled marks, could be non-circle switches like these (other/position/steer on the right) https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/b81ca6f4-730a-4561-852c-096..., etc Re. the missing default - you can have an explicit element \"none selected\" with the slider positioned there Plenty of options to make UI more intuitive reply wruza 1 hour agorootparentprevRadio buttons are always one-of.

Especially the pizza toppings example, that obviously make no sense with toggles. reply zogrodea 1 hour agorootparentCheckboxes can also have an indeterminate state (usually with a \"-\" in place of the checkmark), like the ones you can see at the below link (and which your link also mentions). https://storybook.react95.io/?path=/story/controls-checkbox-... I think the ternary checkbox has two uses: when it's a master checkbox, showing whether all of the binary checkboxes in a group are selected, and it may also be used on its own (the UI may have different actions for the three possible states). reply emayljames 1 hour agorootparentprevOnly if that is how you implement it.

Look at the pizza toppings example in the link above again, it’s a clear semantic difference. I can implement a radio button that allows multiple choices also, doesn’t mean it is the right thing to do. Now there are of course exceptions to the rule. One case where instant reaction on checkboxes are common is filters in online stores. I think that’s a leftover design from the days you had to actively click search on each change to the filters.

That alone is not a very useful anecdatum, but I'm having trouble figuring out what it is that would cause different adhdemons to favour the toggles. There is a nice visual distinction for toggles, as if you have an \"On\" and \"Off\" column for each option. Then again that idea would have a conflict where it should be a radio circle because you can't be both On and Off, but a checkbox square because more than on option (row) could be On. Maybe a shape with a flat top and rounded sides (a \"stadium\") would be good for following the conventions while being worse and more confusing overall. reply Calzifer 1 hour agoparentprevThe first time my mother encountered a toggle she tried to actually slide it. I also once saw a website which replaced in a redesign checkboxes with toggles where the cursor changes to a \"grab hand\" but of cause you cannot grab and slide them need to click it.

People see something round, \"box\" isn't the first word that comes to mind. In my previous history as a ... as a web person (I think that's both broad and vague enough to encompass the yes-I-did-that-too sense of things), I had an ever-growing disdain for the designers who were off on their own flights of fancy. Usable? Explainable? Accessible? Senior-friendly? Then, late to the party, I got this iPhone thing and I was astonished at how much the device expected me to know about how the interface worked, on a deep level. I tried to get my mother into an iPad and, frustratingly, could find no good cheat sheets on the \"gestures,\" to the point where I made a laminated, color-coded and numbered set of sheet on gestures, screen, etc. I help out an even older senior with her computer and ... well, I think the i-UX people are frankly out in their own la-la land and their hubris is sustained only by Apple's inertia/network effect/market dominance. In a kinder, gentler world, these UX teams would be required to make a general style sheet document, which would be applied to various real-world applications, and then they would be forced to watch a senior citizen attempt to navigate their trash to, say, get a test result from the hospital. Should this not be accomplished in under five minutes, they are thrown into a hell of leather-clad demons who beat them with sticks while patiently explaining that their design, in fact, sucks. UX design has begun to resemble fashion in an Oscar Wilde manner, \"so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months.\" It's getting divorced from meaning and utility, and worse yet, constancy. Nobody wants to relearn UX for your crap app just so you can be cutting edge with sliders that resemble the phases of the moon. reply abraae 1 hour agoprevMuch as I love a good rant like this, I have to wonder if this is just the world moving on. I used to hate it (still do a little) when I toggle a checkbox, then go to hit \"Save\" and realise that the checkbox had immediate effect. Now I observe that this is almost the norm. I guess I need to get over it. I also hate it when people changed the scrollbar behaviour in any way. Then today I realised that one of my micro-frustrations with eclipse is that some UX genius decided to make the scrollbars fade away if there is inactivity. (Inactivity of a few seconds in an IDE is pretty normal - it represents thinking!). But then I reflect that eclipse is a hard core programming tool, used by exactly the kind of people I would have expected to hate on this kind of thing. Instead, it seems that this highly technical audience is OK with this. This article is absolutely on the money, and using rounded checkboxes is deliberately sabotaging one of the few strong mental models that we are able to hold about a UI. But maybe this battle is over, and the UX enshittifiers have won. reply Kwpolska 46 minutes agoparentEclipse is a hardcore masochism tool, try IntelliJ IDEA for Java or just about anything else. That said, is this behaviour actually Eclipse's, or is it following the settings of your OS?

I'm not a big suckless user generally, I respect that kind of software but find myself gravitating more to kitchen-sink stuff like emacs and KDE. That said, sxmo is much snappier than KDE or Phosh and once you get over the the discoverability hump (I think megi had a nice cheatsheet) it's really functional and intuitive (subjectively speaking ofc). reply chrismorgan 1 hour agoparentI haven’t used my PinePhone for six months (travel-related reasons), and have gone through another period of not using it (for inscrutable reasons, phone calls weren’t getting audio), but cumulatively I think I’ve got around a year and a half of using it as my phone. I tried other desktop environments, but settled on sxmo/swmo, mostly because I liked the theory of it, and having control in putting pieces together, and being able to ignore my phone and use it over SSH from my laptop, which I’m much more likely to have with me and out, and I’m already used to Sway. Also phosh and KDE both had fairly debilitating issues when I started. They’re probably much better and more suitable now. I’ve always found sxmo seriously buggy. Huge numbers of race conditions that will ruin things until you restart. In order to get open and unlocked, you might need to press the power button once, twice or three times, or press and hold for at least half a second and press a second time, or who knows what else, I can’t remember—all depending on sleep states and what was happening earlier. And any things like status and mode changes will take most of a second before they’re updated visually, rather than happening instantly, which is a surprisingly big drag. Or some mutex state will go bad in some way and you’ll end up with an ever-increasing number of new processes trying to control how the LED should flash, and before long you’ll have to pull the battery out because even holding down the power button isn’t doing anything. You know how people talk up Rust over C, and talk about how various categories of bugs wouldn’t have occurred if only they’d chosen Rust with its memory safety and its superior data model? Well, sxmo is largely implemented in shell scripts, which for large-scale design are considerably worse than C. You get even fewer proper primitives, and it shows. The system as a whole is a hodge-podge of pieces that have covered their eyes and ears to the existence of the other pieces, when if only they would work together, they could achieve much more stable results. Sometimes these things seem OK, but aren’t implemented completely correctly; other times the design is just overcomplicated and ill-conceived. I doubt it’s changed in the last six months, so I challenge anyone that uses sxmo: figure out (a) how to change the system tray clock’s presentation (can’t remember what it was I baulked at, 24h or 12h with zero-padding, where I wanted 12h without zero-padding), and (b) how to have it actually update at the right time rather than up to 55 seconds late (!). The endeavour will take you through a few completely different systems as a 55s timer sets a cached value and the status bar fetches the cached value, but I think it was more complicated than just that, and it comes from at least three significantly different locations on disk (you will want something like ripgrep to aid you in finding stuff in these exercises), and you’ll come away wondering why the status bar command didn’t just include a direct `date +'%H:%M'` command that you could change to `date +'%-I:%M %P'`. Functionally also various things that on Android would Just Work just don’t at all, and even some that on Phosh would Just Work don’t really, or don’t smoothly. But if you can figure out how to make something happen, you can now script it far better. But… yeah, I’ve done a lot of scripting of things. My own personal workflows, I’ve made more convenient than on any other OS (though I dunno, I think I heard Apple had some scripting thing that maybe could come close). Some of these issues have been fixed over time, others have been introduced; overall its actual quality remains fairly low; I continue to use it; perhaps I’m a masochist. In the end, I don’t actually know a single person that I would recommend sxmo/swmo to. But the sort of person that I would recommend it to would certainly already be using a tiling window manager on their desktop, and probably doesn’t care much about phones in general. reply righthand 19 hours agoparentprevI’ve been running Plasma Mobile on my Librem 5 and it’s pretty snappy though I’m not sure how viable it will be as an app platform as KDE has chosen to rewrite all their core apps using a more mobile friendly framework.

    "originLink": "https://www.scmagazine.com/news/gitlab-password-reset-bug-leaves-more-than-5-3k-servers-up-for-grabs",
    "originBody": "Critical GitLab vulnerability CVE-2023-7028 was not patched on more than 5,300 servers as of Tuesday, potentially enabling remote takeover of software developers’ accounts. The bug, with a maximum CVSS score of 10, was first disclosed and patched by GitLab on Jan. 11. The vulnerability in GitLab’s login system would allow an attacker to have a password reset link sent to their own unverified email address without any user interaction by the victim. “Account takeover can be achieved by crafting a specially formatted HTTP request that is capable of sending a password reset email to an unverified email address in an unpatched version,” a GitLab spokesperson told SC Media in a Jan. 12 email. Security updates were released for GitLab versions 16.5.6, 16.6.4 and 16.7.2 and backported to versions 16.1.6, 16.2.9, 16.3.7 and 16.4.5, as well. One researcher who tested the bug on GitLab Community Edition version 16.6.1 and shared their results on AttackerKB said CVE-2023-7028 was, “Very effective and easy to exploit.” Nearly two weeks after patches became available, 5,379 vulnerable instances of GitLab were detected worldwide by the Shadowserver Foundation. The nonprofit organization, which monitors malicious activity online, posted the data from Jan. 23 on X, noting that the United States and Germany had the most vulnerable instances, with 964 and 730 respectively. Shadowserver’s dashboard tool showed fewer vulnerable instances (4,652) on Jan. 24. A Shadowserver spokesperson confirmed with SC Media that there was \"a drop in detected vulnerable instances, which is a positive development,\" but that more time would be needed to determine whether this decrease was a trend or a \"blip\" in Shadowserver's scans. Indicators of compromise for GitLab CVE-2023-7028 GitLab customers with self-managed instances of the affected products — GitLab Community Edition and GitLab Enterprise Edition — should review their logs for exploitation of CVE-2023-7028 using the two following methods, as outlined by GitLab: Check gitlab-rails/production_json.log for HTTP requests to the /users/password path with params.value.email consisting of a JSON array with multiple email addresses Check gitlabs-rails/audit_json.log for entries with meta.caller.id of PasswordsController#create and target_Details consisting of a JSON array with multiple email addresses The company said no exploitation of the bug on GitLab.com or GitLab Dedicated instances has been detected. GitLab recommended customers also enable two-factor authentication (2FA), which prevents account takeover via CVE-2023-7028, although users of unpatched instances are still vulnerable to being locked out of their accounts if an attacker exploits the flaw to reset their password.",

Which, I guess that's my word: terrifying, one of the things pentesters make a beeline to mess with, with a vulnerability history stretching all the way back to the early 2000s when these features were often implemented on standard Unix MTAs that could be tricked into sending password resets to multiple addresses at once, an attack featureful web frameworks seem to have resurrected in Gitlab. If you're a normal HN reader that found themselves interested in this story, go check your password reset feature, specifically the email association logic! Gitlab has, as I understand it, a pretty excellent security team, which gives some sense of how hard this bug class is to avoid. reply ndriscoll 10 hours agoparent> Gitlab has, as I understand it, a pretty excellent security team, which gives some sense of how hard this bug class is to avoid. Based on the other comment that describes how this bug works, it is completely trivial to avoid. If you use a statically typed language, you'd have to go out of your way to create this bug, and it'd stand out like a sore thumb in code review, to the extent that if I saw that I might wonder whether my coworker is actively trying to create a backdoor. reply tptacek 10 hours agorootparent\"This bug is completely trivial to avoid. Just rewrite your whole product in a different language\". reply ndriscoll 10 hours agorootparentThe suggestion would more be to choose the correct technology from the start. Something like Scala is 20 years old, has a massive library ecosystem since it integrates with Java, and has type inference so it basically feels like a dynamically typed language, except bugs like this can't happen. It's also high performance thanks to the JVM. I don't know what it was like when Gitlab launched in 2014, but I know it was very solid in 2017 when I started using it. Or if that feels too hipster/niche, just use Java. It's not my cup of tea, but it's boring, practical, and the developer pool is infinite. reply kelnos 2 hours agorootparentI've written a lot of Scala, and really like the language (well, aside from them not ditching null and exceptions entirely), but years ago I stopped recommending it for new projects, especially in a corporate setting. It's hard to hire experienced Scala developers, and most Java developers I've worked with were either completely uninterested in writing Scala at all, or didn't care to learn the language well enough to actually make use of its better features, and somehow ended up writing Scala that looked like worse Java than the Java they'd usually write. reply simonw 10 hours agorootparentprevYou understand that's not exactly actionable or helpful advice, right? reply ndriscoll 9 hours agorootparentIt's not actionable for Gitlab, but it's actionable for anyone weighing what technologies they should use for future projects. Use one that doesn't open you to this kind of mistake, and ignore people who talk about \"productivity\" because that's going to be people arguing about their gut feelings anyway, and everyone will say their chosen stack is more productive. Something like Java is going to have the largest hiring pool, the largest ecosystem, and support from every major vendor. I don't particularly like it and think that Scala is pretty much a straight upgrade, but Java's a smart choice. reply tptacek 9 hours agorootparentYou get that the track record of Java and Java frameworks on web vulnerabilities is pretty abysmal, right? There's a whole gigantic RCE bug class (RCE! in the 2020s!) that originates there. My general take is: glass houses, etc. And: everybody is in a glass house. reply ndriscoll 9 hours agorootparentI'm not sure what you mean with the bug class; Java serialization? If so I think that's been something where common advice is not to use it for 20+ years. Maybe Spring has had issues. Like I said I don't actually like Java and all the annotation stuff. I avoid it, but it's still going to be one of the more robust choices you can make since every major enterprise uses it. Java had log4shell, which was pretty bad, and probably wouldn't have happened if Java had had string macros. It's one of the reasons why Scala is a better language: people use things like compile time macros which prevents those sorts of mistakes. It looks like akka-http for example has only had DoS vulnerabilities (e.g. getting zip bombed) + some niche stuff like request smuggling if you used it to build a reverse proxy or usage of directory listing on Windows. That said, sure, large frameworks all have bugs. But not being able to tell whether you are dealing with a string or an array in your business logic is just silly. reply tptacek 9 hours agorootparentIf you like Java, use Java. Don't worry about people pointing out how gnarly the security track record is; the security track record of every popular thing is gnarly. I'm not here to tell you what framework to use, only that empirically, you're not going to improve your odds significantly by choosing a different mainstream framework. reply ndriscoll 8 hours agorootparentI don't like Java and I don't consider jobs where I'd be doing a nontrivial amount of Java. But the original comment I replied to said this class of bug is hard to avoid, and it's not. Use any statically typed language, and it can't happen. Java's the obvious choice. C# is probably fine too. Same with something like SQL injection or log4shell. These are also preventable using string formatting macros. If `DatabaseConnection.run` takes a `SqlQuery`, not a `String`, and you can only make a `SqlQuery` through a safe API, and your escape hatch is a macro that does query parameterization instead of string substitution, then your users can't get it wrong. This is how Scala libraries actually work and have worked for years. Similarly if you build your logging library to take MDC objects that are built with format macros. These are solved problems. reply tptacek 8 hours agorootparentThis is a logic bug, not a typing bug. One clear way you know this is: this bug occurs in both Java and C# applications, routinely. But that's OK! I'm not going to dunk on you for using C#, even though it is practically the ground spring from which all web app vulnerabilities have emerged (you'd think it'd be PHP, but C# has a better claim to the title). reply ndriscoll 7 hours agorootparentTyping bugs are just logic bugs that you were able to encode into the type system, and therefore the checker is able to reject for you. Types are propositions and values are proofs. This is not just an academic fact; my SqlQuery example is a direct practical application. reply tptacek 7 hours agorootparentThe claim here being that C# and Java apps rarely have SQL injection vulnerabilities? reply ndriscoll 6 hours agorootparentThe claims being SQL injection is a problem with a known solution, that Scala does it right, and that it's an example of turning logic errors into type errors. reply neonsunset 8 hours agorootparentprevCan you show examples of such bug in these two languages? (I'm in particular interested in how it could manifest with EF Core) reply tptacek 8 hours agorootparentRight now I'll just say that from 2005-2015, Java and C# applications were literally the bread and butter of every application security shop (house accounts for web appsec firms were Fortune 100 companies that built all their line of business apps in those two languages), and password reset bugs wereo one of the first place you'd look. I think I even included password reset in a \"Seven Deadly Features\" blog post I wrote at Matasano. None of that is a reason to avoid C#! I'm not trying to say that using the two most fertile sources of web application security vulnerabilities over the last 20 years is per se a bad decision! reply blackoil 6 hours agorootparent> that from 2005-2015, Java and C# applications were literally the bread and butter of every application security sho That is because that is what enterprise uses, I don't think it would have changed a lot now. reply dheera 4 hours agorootparentprevAlmost every technology today is the wrong choice if you look at it from the perspective of 20 years from now. When Facebook was founded there weren't actually many good alternatives to PHP. reply amatecha 12 hours agoparentprevYeah, every single time I get a spurious password reset email (presumably from someone trying to hijack my account), I'm worried they've somehow managed to add an unauthorized recovery email address outside of my control. It hasn't yet happened to me, but as we can see from this story, it is absolutely possible unfortunately. reply andix 12 hours agorootparentI can't remember getting something like that. Maybe because I use a different e-mail address for signing up to services than for regular communication. I just had an idea, maybe using a + alias (yourname+some-alias-address@example.com, made famous by gmail) could help against attackers. Even if they find out your email they will never guess the part after the plus. If you forget it though then you can't reset your password anymore either. reply starttoaster 10 hours agorootparent> If you forget it though then you can't reset your password anymore either. If you struggle with memorizing your username/email, there's a near zero chance you're using a password manager, which also means there's a near zero chance you're using decent passwords for your logins, in my experience. reply hansvm 3 hours agorootparentprevOr it could open you up to other attacks when the service coalesces all those emails to one canonical example (to uniquely identify you or whatever -- note that almost no online service recognizes the importance of caps in the email address you use as a username for example, where the underlying email provider sometimes does) but does so differently than the actual email service, allowing anyone and their dog to create an email which will collide with yours. reply TylerE 3 hours agorootparentprevActually, I find the gmail features the opposite of helpful, because websites aren’t aware of them, and will happily treat as unique addresses using them, that in fact aren’t. I have my username @ gmail (since very early days, when you needed an invite). At least once a week I get somebodies receipt of confirmation because they enter an email like tyler.e@ reply kazinator 11 hours agorootparentprevIf they hijacked the domain, so that they control the MX record for it, they could just use that very address. reply kazinator 7 hours agorootparentThis could happen when the owner of a domain loses or drops it, and a bad actor picks it up. All they have to do is set up a SMTP server and wait for junk mails, thereby learning about the e-mail addresses. Say Walmart sends some flyer. Poof, they have that user's e-mail, and the fact they are registered with Walmart. reply thebruce87m 11 hours agorootparentprevSometimes mine come in Spanish. I don’t speak Spanish. reply Sleaker 13 hours agoparentprevIt doesn't sound like they have a great security team, they added the \"Associate a secondary email address\" feature recently. This isn't something that has always been in the software. It seems more like they were cutting corners and not properly testing through ways to exploit their own new feature when it was related to account security. On top of that it looks like they had a 9.6 CVE that allowed integrations to perform commands as other users... From the outside it looks like they are trying to ship features faster than they can keep them safe and tested. Perhaps because they are having an incredibly difficult time monetizing well? It makes sense from business standpoint in some respects, but also the security stuff could just absolutely tank the business when the whole point of a (self)hosted git solution is essentially just account management. reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentI don't put much stock in this \"9.6\" stuff; CVSS is a ouija board that will say whatever people want it to say. But regardless: the best security teams in the world still see critical vulnerabilities in their software, because software is all garbage. reply EdwardDiego 11 hours agorootparentI've recently stopped two design choices in external facing resources that posed significant security risks. One of which was around credentials resetting to emails that aren't stored in the API auth system itself, but rather come into Salesforce as a support case. \"Don't worry, a support team member has to action the request\" was meant to be reassuring, until I explained that this translated to \"the only mechanism in place to prevent credentials being stolen comes with a massive social engineering vulnerability\". But it's the previous choices I haven't come across yet that worry me. reply blibble 12 hours agorootparentprev> From the outside it looks like they are trying to ship features faster than they can keep them safe and tested. this sums up their entire product every feature you could possibly imagine, somewhat working reply EduardoBautista 12 hours agorootparentA few years ago there would be people defending GitLab for “transparency” every time something went wrong.

Seems to be a new design every 6 months. reply bogota 3 hours agorootparentprevAll i needed to know about the quality of software gitlab ships can be found in using their CI system on any half decent size project. You can tell it was half baked with many bugs and edge cases that can be easily avoided. When you look at the bug tracker all of them have been documented for years and they just ignore them. My favorites are * using included files that run no job is a failure. The only real work around is adding a noop job all over your ci system. * try to use code reviewers based on groups. The logic is so complex and full of errors i can’t even explain it unless i spend an hour reading the docs. * when using the merge train and enabling merge result pipelines you end up with two different jobs per commit. This is cool except in the UI it always shows merge results first. If you have ten commits you need to look on the second page to find the most recent commits ci jobs. That is just annoying but more no environment variables overlap for what MR or commit it is. This makes doing trivial things like implementing break glass pipless almost impossible. Anyway gitlab sucks i wanted to not use github but really it’s just bad. Not to mention we have outages monthly that we always know of 30 minutes to an hour before gitlab does then we look on the status page and see the downtime is 10 minutes when its been 40 for us and likely everyone else. We have in the last year had close to 2 full days combined of downtime from gitlab. Of course they report 99.95% uptime. reply 1oooqooq 40 minutes agorootparentgithub post Microsoft was also a major pain to add code review for groups that were not a per-project, manually curated list of users. there were some \"addons\" like panda something that made it less worse, but still a crap fest in terms of usability and compliance. not to mention that now you can barely use it without being logged in. im overall glad to have moved to gitlab and codeberg. do not miss github AT ALL. reply zeroxfe 10 hours agorootparentprev> It doesn't sound like they have a great security team That's an unfair comment. Even the best teams ship bugs. If you want to measure the quality of a security team, you look at their performance trajectory (for both detection and response) relative to the size of their total threat surface. reply Rapzid 8 hours agoparentprev> Gitlab has, as I understand it, a pretty excellent security team, which gives some sense of how hard this bug class is to avoid. I disagree. It's a bonehead mistake to send password resets out to tainted email addresses. As this was an authentication change it should have received extra scrutiny and so have been even harder to introduce. Something is wrong with their engineering culture that needs correcting. reply tptacek 8 hours agorootparentEvery time we get a story about a vulnerability, we get comments about how they're indications that engineering cultures need correcting. All I'll say is, the impression one gets is that every engineering culture needs correcting. I buy it! reply TylerE 3 hours agorootparentFrom my experience people say “engineering culture” when what they actually mean management culture. It’s not typically the engineers that are the problem. reply Rapzid 2 hours agorootparentWhat's the difference. That's a statement. reply Rapzid 7 hours agorootparentprevSure, but some corrections are more urgent than others. Such as that time they deleted the prod database. reply j-bos 13 hours agoparentprevHow does this exploit work? Or do you have a link to a rundown of it? reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentI'm guessing here, because I only read a high-level description of it, but I think it's a password reset flow endpoint that takes the email address to look up and send a reset to, and the framework will accept an array instead of a simple string; the endpoint looks up the first address, but the variable used to determine who to send the reset mail to is the array. Again: just a guess as to the underlying bug (I've seen that specific bug before is why I guessed). reply nightpool 13 hours agorootparentThis is correct: The vulnerability lies in the management of emails when resetting passwords. An attacker can provide 2 emails and the reset code will be sent to both. It is therefore possible to provide the e-mail address of the target account as well as that of the attacker, and to reset the administrator password. Here's an example payload: user[email][]=my.target@example.com&user[email][]=hacker@evil.com (per this POC github: https://github.com/Vozec/CVE-2023-7028) reply tptacek 13 hours agorootparentYep, so it's the classic Rails bug pattern. reply simonw 10 hours agorootparentA tiny little piece of Django design that I'm pleased to have participated in is this: emails = request.POST.getlist(\"email\") Django doesn't mix lists and single string values, because I'd been burned by that problem in PHP. reply EGreg 2 hours agorootparentwait, what do you mean by in PHP? reply technion 11 hours agorootparentprevStrong parameters has been a core security feature of rails for a long time, and all the guides go into detail about the boilerplate you need just to accept a form input past the strong parameter filters. It's weird to me that the pattern doesn't also include a \"must he a string\" option. I know you can add to_s everywhere, but making it part of the existing strong params would actually incentivise use. reply kevinmchugh 9 hours agorootparentIt's weird, as I recall with strong params one of the only things it really makes you decide is whether a value is a scalar, array, or Hash. You can certainly allow a value to be scalar or array, but it's not very natural in strong params. I mostly hate the way strong params gets used - it's a bad compromise between letting Ruby people do Ruby things and trying to plug up a category of vulnerability that's been biting rails apps for a decade.

But that's true of all bugs. The C apologists used to say, \"just bounds check properly!\" reply tzs 12 hours agorootparentprevI think I'd count that as a bug and a design error. The bug is accepting an array when it should only take a scalar. The design error is that the endpoint should not be taking email addresses at all. It should take account IDs. Even if a system uses email addresses as account IDs they are conceptually not the same and the code should not muddle them. Keep them separate and then even if you get an \"allows an array where it should have been a scalar\" bug the result should be either just the first account in the array gets a reset email or all the accounts in the array that are existing accounts get reset emails for their accounts. reply tptacek 10 hours agorootparentUsers hate this, because it requires them to do two email round trips (the first to recover the account ID). reply tzs 10 hours agorootparentI think it is OK to call the account ID \"Email Address\" on everything the user sees, and make it the same string as the user's email address. As far as the user is concerned they login with email address and password. I'm just saying that in the software and in the database store account ID and email separately. Treat the fact that the account ID column matches the email address column as just a coincidence that you do not take advantage of. I'd enforce not taking advantage of it by having employee accounts actually use an account ID that does not match their email address, such as their name, so that if we accidentally leave out a call to EmailFromAccountID(...) somewhere and try to use an account ID directly as an email address it will break employee accounts. Also, it is not clear to me that even with user visible account ID that is not the same as email address that it would take two email rounds trips. The reset page could take email address, not account ID. The reset endpoint could then look up the account ID from the email address, and initiate the reset, calling the SendEmailToAccount service with the account ID to send the email. That service would look up the email address for the account. reply tptacek 9 hours agorootparentOh, sure. Storing the email address in a canonical column and using the provided address as a key helps. But I think the underlying bug is still there, because the email code will still _accept_ the user input if you feed that to it. reply EGreg 2 hours agorootparentPersonally, I like when people have usernames, and have to enter those, to receive a recovery message sent to the associated email. Or better yet, enter both username and email together. Because it's more likely the attacker won't know both. In any event, I have been recommending to everyone for years to use email aliases (that GMail and others support) as your login. Have a different one for each site, for example yourname+az@gmail.com for amazon. That way, you can avoid crap like this which is out of your control, since the attacker won't even be able to repeat your login email: https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking... reply fbdab103 9 hours agorootparentprevFor something which should be a rare action (account recovery) is extra friction that bad? reply justincormack 6 minutes agorootparentI think some people use the recovery flow a lot, instead of using a password manager. plagiarist 8 hours agorootparentprevIf they have to allow lookup by email I don't understand why they wouldn't throw out the input data.

If not e-mail, then what would you associate it with? I've been running a site for over 20 years with a large user base. We initially used usernames, but it was disastrous. Everyone knew each other's usernames, making it easy to attempt brute force attacks on passwords, reset them, etc. Using e-mails isn't the problem, the issue is overcomplicating the login and password recovery logic, tons of abstraction everywhere, overengineering, people rushing to push code without proper checks in security sensitive parts etc. > Gitlab has, as I understand it, a pretty excellent security team, which gives some sense of how hard this bug class is to avoid.

Gitlab is the worst product I've used security wise. reply SlightlyLeftPad 11 hours agorootparentI tend to agree. Regarding Gitlab, there’s a bit of a dichotomy here. On one hand it’s good that they’re diligently catching and patching these things quickly and effectively notifying with transparency, that’s a great thing. On the other hand, it means Gitlab is an absolute nightmare to maintain, the process to upgrade it is not always trivial and to add to that, consistently, the day after a Gitlab upgrade a critical vulnerability is found and patched. Every product has security issues and what should worry you more, things that never see security patches or something that does? reply lossolo 9 hours agorootparentGitlab upgrades, omg that was a nightmare, so many broken upgrades, there are literally thousands of issues on their issue tracker only about problems with upgrades. reply tptacek 10 hours agorootparentprevYou took the wrong thing away from the comment.

It seems you might not be using their on-premises product, considering your guesswork. We used it for years and it was a nightmare. Almost every upgrade was problematic, and we often had to scour through GitLab issues to find solutions from other users. These solutions were often makeshift and carried the risk of causing further issues. Their salaries are below market rate, which reflects in the quality of staff they hire (there are few exceptions). I prefer not to point fingers, so I won't link to any specific discussions from GitLab. It's worth noting that they have a culture of open discussion, and from what I've observed, the engineering quality in some of the teams was quite low. We utilize numerous other large scale open source projects in our stack and have never encountered as many problems as we did with GitLab. reply tptacek 8 hours agorootparentWhat guesswork? I use Github. My point is that you don't hear about most vulnerabilities in SAAS products, because there is no norm of disclosing them.

BUt disclosure is unavoidable for open source on-prem products. I already addressed that point, explaining that we use other on-premises open source products of similar size, and GitLab was the poorest in terms of quality. I haven't drawn any comparisons between GitLab's on-premises and SaaS products, so I'm puzzled as to why you continue to 'guess' the reasons behind our experiences, especially when those guesses have been evidently incorrect. reply alexpls 12 hours agoprevFor folks who wanna see what led to this exploit in a Rails codebase, here’s the commit where it’s fixed: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/c571840ba2f0e9... reply thedanbob 7 hours agoparentThis doesn't look like the actual fix but rather a follow-up refactor.

I kid, but also I don't. Initially a single email could be passed into the API/form call and they would look it up. If found they would send a recovery to that email but it was the email the user supplied not what was in the DB. Oh, no problem we looked it up so they are the same! But then the ability to look up accounts from a list of emails was added. If any email matches the account lookup would succeed. Then they sent the reset link to that same user supplied value but OH NOEHS IT'S AN ARRAY NOW AND SOME MIGHT NOT HAVE MATCHED ACCOUNT EMAILS! So they ended up sending out reset links to a tainted list of emails. Rails \"concerns\" are the worst IMHO anyway, but looks like they aren't using strong params here either which is even worse. Also someone thought it was more elegant to reuse the tainted value which is par for the RoR course. reply szundi 3 hours agorootparentprevOmg is this fix had to be this bloated? reply dijit 12 hours agoprevI got hit by this, we also noticed it being used with a second “feature” that exposed us a bit more than it should have. Basically a requirement for this attack is to know the email of the user you want to reset, but, there is a hidden email address that is tied to your gitlab userid (a number incrementing from 1). Since its a safe bet that ID 1 or 2 is an admin: thats a good target. the email is something like 1-user@mail.noreply..

And the worst part: On most services you can't even disable it, the only way around is often only Enterprise SSO. On some services you can set up a phone number for SMS token instead.

Password reset only with e-mail AND SMS token. reply admax88qqq 7 hours agoparentWhat makes it a security nightmare in your opinion? reply jchw 4 hours agorootparentThere's really nothing about the e-mail system that makes it particularly good for anything secure at all. - Easy to accidentally forward confidential tokens - Validation of email sender authenticity is still piecemeal, and there are relatively frequently ways to bypass or work around validation. - Mail is not end-to-end encrypted. I hope that it's at least encrypted with TLS, but last time I actually messed with talking directly to an MX, it seemed like TLS was still limited to smart relays, and actual mail delivery always went to port 25 as usual... - The cardinality of e-mail addresses is not really defined anywhere. Gmail has plus addressing and ignores periods for the purposes of delivering an e-mail. Meanwhile, Google Workspace defaults to not ignoring the periods. Pretty sure some mailbox providers are case-sensitive and others are not. This means you can't know if an e-mail address at a given provider is unique. Best bet is to treat the entire damn address as a bag of bytes, but that opens up room for UX issues of all sorts, so it's hard to balance. - It's bad that if your e-mail address gets compromised, any account you have that doesn't have some kind of secure 2FA is literally seconds away from being compromised, too. Obviously, this is not a limitation that is limited to e-mail addresses, people wrongly treat SMS as secure, too. The thing with e-mail addresses though is that they're easier to treat as secure because it is somehow still less of a crapshoot than cell carrier security, and also because literally the majority of online accounts can be stolen with just access to the user's email address, and it can be done quickly and easily, and in many cases it can be hard to convince support that you are the correct owner afterwards. reply bluedino 12 hours agoprevReminds me of a bug where you could brute force an account by putting an array of passwords in the login form.

Dan Goodin - 1/27/2024, 12:29 AM Enlarge reader comments 103 The hackers who recently broke into Microsoft’s network and monitored top executives’ email for two months did so by gaining access to an aging test account with administrative privileges, a major gaffe on the company's part, a researcher said. Further Reading Microsoft network breached through password-spraying by Russia-state hackers The new detail was provided in vaguely worded language included in a post Microsoft published on Thursday. It expanded on a disclosure Microsoft published late last Friday. Russia-state hackers, Microsoft said, used a technique known as password spraying to exploit a weak credential for logging into a “legacy non-production test tenant account” that wasn’t protected by multifactor authentication. From there, they somehow acquired the ability to access email accounts that belonged to senior executives and employees working in security and legal teams. A “pretty big config error” In Thursday’s post updating customers on findings from its ongoing investigation, Microsoft provided more details on how the hackers achieved this monumental escalation of access. The hackers, part of a group Microsoft tracks as Midnight Blizzard, gained persistent access to the privileged email accounts by abusing the OAuth authorization protcol, which is used industry-wide to allow an array of apps to access resources on a network. After compromising the test tenant, Midnight Blizzard used it to create a malicious app and assign it rights to access every email address on Microsoft’s Office 365 email service. Advertisement In Thursday’s update, Microsoft officials said as much, although in language that largely obscured the extent of the major blunder. They wrote: Threat actors like Midnight Blizzard compromise user accounts to create, modify, and grant high permissions to OAuth applications that they can misuse to hide malicious activity. The misuse of OAuth also enables threat actors to maintain access to applications, even if they lose access to the initially compromised account. Midnight Blizzard leveraged their initial access to identify and compromise a legacy test OAuth application that had elevated access to the Microsoft corporate environment. The actor created additional malicious OAuth applications. They created a new user account to grant consent in the Microsoft corporate environment to the actor controlled malicious OAuth applications. The threat actor then used the legacy test OAuth application to grant them the Office 365 Exchange Online full_access_as_app role, which allows access to mailboxes. [Emphasis added.] Kevin Beaumont—a researcher and security professional with decades of experience, including a stint working for Microsoft—pointed out on Mastodon that the only way for an account to assign the all-powerful full_access_as_app role to an OAuth app is for the account to have administrator privileges. “Somebody,” he said, “made a pretty big config error in production.” Page: 1 2 Next → reader comments 103 Dan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he oversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking, encryption, and passwords.

Groups and teams get created all over the place, with mysterious permissions, just so that you can play in Teams, or OneDrive, and these persist in the company directory almost indistinguishable from security groups. Sometimes you get automated emails asking you if you still need something, but the messages are opaque, and in a really big company there's no-one you can really ask (helpdesk takes 2 days to get back to you, and what are you gonna do, hit up John Savill on Twitter?), so you hit ok and try to carry on.

Its also compounded by every job is a cross-cross-cross-parttimecross-cross-dualrole-trirole job these days. I've seen role based controls that had more roles than actual permissions that were possible to grant so the entire point of the RBAC was self defeating. It was actually less time to simply grant permissions individually but of course that meant the reports would not show roles so it was not allowed. That doesn't come from the tech people that comes from poor leadership. On a side note I once designed an add on to a RBAC permission system to overcome this problem for an in house ERP. We had a permission type called \"Permission Exception\" If someone needed a permission outside of their role they got it assigned this way so a report could be generated that showed everyone that could do things outside of a job role. I've never seen it anywhere else. All it did was add a flag to the permission but it worked. HR would check the permission exceptions every quarter and see what needed removed from people. It kept the permissions in check by actual knowledgeable authority rather than some part time help desk position trying to cluelessly trial error untangle permissions. reply wolverine876 14 hours agorootparentYes, that's what I was saying, though it could be technical management.

The systems are your work domain (depending on your job title); you can make clear that outsiders are not permitted inside. An essential is to establish credibility: 'Leave it to me - stay off my turf - and it will get done.' When they say the VIP needs something, find out what they really need and deliver that with amazing promptness and reliability (i.e., no saying later, 'oh, I didn't think of that!').

This blog post and the quotes in the article are calling this a \"gaffe\", but in an organization the size and complexity of Microsoft, I'd say that mistaken permissions assignments are inevitable. So I don't think it's really helpful to focus on the \"someone in a 220k person company made a mistake at some point\" angle. However, at most companies there is usually a hard thick line between production and test systems. Granting production access to a test account should be basically impossible, so how that happened should be what the investigation should focus on. reply kerng 7 hours agorootparentMight be better to say that most companies think they have that kind of isolation, but pentesting, red teaming and incidents then later proof they don't. I have even seen companies routing prod traffic to test systems, it's not uncommon. Test pretty much always leads to prod. reply cedws 13 hours agorootparentprevWell said. A test account having admin privileges over a non-prod system is not the real problem. Poor isolation between prod and non-prod is. reply twisteriffic 9 hours agorootparentprevThis is almost certainly another key trust misconfiguration, just like the last few major breaches at Microsoft. Last time it was leaving expired keys in place along with not enforcing expiry checks in the client. This time it's configuring the same key in both prod and test. It's grade school stuff that they keep getting wrong. reply HenryBemis 13 hours agorootparentprevOn top of that, when one (person/company) sets up a test account they should (at the creation/activation) set the deletion/deactivation date. So even if the admin is hit by a bus, that damn account will go off on DDMMYYYY and not \"live long enough to become the villain\". Also, TERRIBLE/HORRIBLE user access management and review. How do they let a test account be live for \"months\"? Don't they have some alerts for all test accounts in PROD environment to pester them daily??

I’ve worked for/with numerous people whose method of testing almost always involves giving maximum latitude for idk… shotgun debugging?

No, don't do that. Not only are you exposing your company to breaches, you're giving me responsibilities I don't want.

Basically, we're experiencing the Windows XP security popup equivalent but at a service level, where at every step of a task you're asked to identify to something else and the back and forth to get the proper credentials with the proper rights can take days. Support teams calling it fucks and throwing half the accounts and permission bucket at any newcomer is just humane. reply quickthrower2 7 hours agorootparentIt is probably a good idea to seperate production and other environments. Most of devs work is done in non prod environments so you can throw a lot of dev/test permission at them. Support should be able to support through app permissions only.

The Invention of a New Pasta Shape posted by Jason Kottke Mar 19, 2021 For the past three years, Dan Pashman of The Sporkful podcast has been on something of a mission: to invent a new pasta shape. All of Pashman's hard work has paid off with the debut of cascatelli pasta, available for sale from Sfoglini. Pashman and Sfoglini engineered the new shape to maximize the amount of sauce that sticks to it, make it easier to get your fork on it, and have it feel good when you bite into it. Cascatelli is designed to maximize the three qualities by which Dan believes all pasta shapes should be judged: Sauceability: How readily sauce adheres to the shape Forkability: How easy it is to get the shape on your fork and keep it there Toothsinkability: How satisfying it is to sink your teeth into it Pashman documented the invention of cascatelli in a 5-part series on The Sporkful podcast — you can listen to the first episode here — and on Instagram. You can order some cascatelli to try it out at home, but it looks like they are currently sold out of everything aside from 5-lb bulk bags.

Further, the non-uniformaty of the joints of the pasta means that the ruffley bits had a tendency to shear off during the cooking process, or in the final step when you cook it with sauce. When I tried to leave a 4-star review on their website, along with my commentary, it was rejected. In all honesty, my 4 stars was too generous though. The main \"problem\" that this pasta claims to solve is much more easily solved by cooking the pasta in your sauce for 30 seconds, after which your sauce will happily adhere to any shape of pasta you can imagine. Ultimately this is a marketing gimmick rather than a genuine iteration, which should not be surprising. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 9 hours agoparentWhen you said your 4 star review was denied, I figured it must be out of 10. But no, it's out of 5, and the store does indeed show 138 reviews with an average of 5 stars. That's wild. I know deleting 1 star reviews is common and I hate that as well but these people aren't even trying to make it look legit.

But nobody should be doing that sort of comparison anyway — that is, cross-site review comparison. If I’m looking at first party reviews, I’m comparing them to, at most, reviews on other products of the same site. They for me, they still carry some relative (intra-site) weight, but definitely no absolute (cross-site) weight. reply pclmulqdq 6 hours agoparentprevA lot of novice cooks I know will fully cook their pasta, strain it, and get it pretty dry before putting sauce on. The starchy pasta water is actually a \"glue\" that helps adhere the sauce to the pasta. If you leave your pasta a bit wet before saucing, you get better adhesion by a lot, and it's even better if you cook the pasta (and pasta water) into the sauce to release more starches into the sauce. reply pohl 11 hours agoparentprevThe texture differential at the T-intersections was a deliberate choice for the mouth feel component and is one that I appreciate. It gives an inner region of tooth resistance. The frills stay on if you time it right. If I want to cook it in the sauce I pull it out of the water earlier. NBD. I haven’t yet used what Trader Joe’s offers. I suppose it’s possible the two products are not identical. reply greggsy 6 minutes agorootparentHe used the term ‘toothfeel’ in the podcast, which is analogous to al-dente. I’ve found that the amount of salt in the water, and how crowded the pot is will play a big part in how well it cooks. reply RankingMember 5 hours agorootparentprevI can tell you the Trader Joe's version was so bad with the frilly parts coming off that I hoped it was just their version being cheap, but apparently that's not the case based on parent's comments. reply kamranjon 2 hours agorootparentI’ve cooked the TJ version a number of times - the only time the ribs have fallen off was when I overcooked them.

I think the funny thing about it is, the \"problem\" it solves feels completely imaginary. Like, I don't think I was ever striving to max out the amount of sauce per piece of pasta before this thing came along, and after trying it, my conclusion was, well, I guess it holds more sauce, but so what? It's a bit akin to those \"scoop\" style tortilla chips. Yeah, they hold more crap on them, but they're also worse tasting than the normal tortilla chips we buy or make at home. reply bruce343434 11 hours agoprevI am not situated anywhere near the US, so for a regular peasant like me Cavatappi is a pretty good pasta shape. It is a hollow tube that has been bent into a corkscrew shape, with ridges on the outside running lengthwise along the tube. - Chunks get tangled in it - Surface area to volume ratio is quite good (sauce) - Tube means sauce goes inside It is a better macaroni (which is my second favourite shape). reply shermantanktop 10 hours agoparentAgree, cavatappi is great.

I believe it's the proper name, and I've tried searching for it in the past. It seems somewhat rare in the western US under either name. The place that I originally got it from was a tiny market at 24th and Valencia in SF. I think they just happened into it via some distributor and ran out after I slowly bought all of it. While I've kept an eye out, but I haven't put a lot of effort into finding it.

Which means this is solving a non-problem. If your sauce isn't sticking, add a little water from the pasta to it, after cooking the pasta. The starch in the water makes a big difference to make the sauce stickier. Every Italian restaurant does this, basically. And toss the pasta in the sauce before serving, don't just dump the sauce on top of naked noodles. reply shagie 9 hours agoparentprevAmerica's Test Kitchen looks into that - bronze cut vs teflon cut and what happens if you take sandpaper to the dried pasta: https://www.americastestkitchen.com/cooksillustrated/article... reply stephenr 2 hours agorootparentAmericas test kitchen also says you can't make crispy pork belly without frying it, I don't know why people put so much trust in a group that can get something so easy, wrong. reply jghn 2 hours agorootparentATK/CI, Kenji, etc - they all have said that many times they're talking about best results.

There's sometimes usage as well for cylindrical shapes like rigatoni when making chunkier sauces, and smaller shapes like penne can be made in smaller pots with smaller amounts of water, thus concentrating the amount of starch in the pasta water and improving the sauce when the pasta water is added to the sauce at the end, while the smaller pot is also easier to clean for people without dishwashers. But most of the issues people mark up to spaghetti and linguini have more to do with people's cooking skills than they do with the pasta's shape. reply weinzierl 7 hours agoprevThe world of pasta shapes is utterly fascinating.

Nowadays I'm partial to linguini or orecchiette (I suspect my parents still think that's fancy). Of course once you actually visit Italy or otherwise eat in a restaurant serving actual Italian pasta, your views on what pasta is all about tend to change. reply zabzonk 9 hours agoparentah, the joys of dutch cuisine! reply dang 5 hours agoprevRelated: The Invention of a New Pasta Shape - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26521761 - March 2021 (181 comments) reply p1mrx 11 hours agoprevIf the goal is to raise the sauce/carbs ratio, then I wonder if it's possible to make pasta with air bubbles to reduce its density. Gyroid infill would probably be delicious. reply kmoser 10 hours agoparentThe simpler solution is to just eat your pasta with a spoon, which will allow you to scoop up more sauce per mouthful. But if you want to over-engineer it, you could write software to create the optimal pasta shape which would maximize surface area and ensure even thickness for consistent al dente mouthfeel. I'm guessing the optimal shape will look fractal-like. reply thfuran 11 hours agoparentprevThat doesn't sound very extrudable. I'm not sure how amenable pasta is to 3d printing, but that'd probably be the only option. I assume that means the cost would be at least an order of magnitude or two higher than more manufacturable shapes. reply lr4444lr 8 hours agoprevIsn't this just creste di gallo pasta? reply jghn 7 hours agoparentNot quite. When I first saw this, I had the same thought. It was at a spot that normally carries a local brand who makes creste di gallo. They weren't quite the same. This new shop has a concave spine with two frills instead of just the one. The claim is that groove can hold sauce. reply caesil 12 hours agoprevIt's a good shape. The \"sauce trough\" thing is a little questionable though; having eaten a couple boxes, I think it would make more sense to have it on the inside surface, more sauce retained that way. reply pohl 12 hours agoparentThe series of podcast episodes is worth a listen. The task is not just imagining an ideal shape balancing the 3 constraints, but to do one that will actually come out a pasta extruder die.

As Italian, I've just realized I take pasta shapes for granted. They're actually something that can be invented and that involves plenty of creativity and passion. reply toyg 11 hours agoparentUs Italians, we are very conservative about food, sometimes irrationally so. Maybe because my favourite has always been the rotella/ruota, I tend to try exotic shapes pretty often - recently I had some radiatori and they can be pretty good with amatriciana or other \"strong\" sauces. This said, I think the actual pasta quality will always be more important than any fancy shape. Cascatelli that overcook in an instant will always be worse than some old-fashioned penne that don't. reply shermantanktop 10 hours agorootparentAgree. The quality of the wheat and production methods are going to have a bigger impact than the specific details of the shape. But alas, the shape can be seen with the naked eye. The idea of a special shape also suggests that the interaction between sauce and pasta is a mechanical process, which is appealing in the US, where pasta and sauce used to be (and may still be) served in separate bowls. reply nfw2 4 hours agorootparentprevI think radiatori has some additional advantages compared to this. Its shape is more symmetrical, so more consistent saucing, and it's easy to get the right size bite with a fork. Eating this pasta seems a bit awkward due to the asymmetric, oblong shape reply evrydayhustling 7 hours agorootparentprevI was thinking about radiatori going into this. Anybody know on which axes this shape is supposed to beat radiatori? Seems to me radiatori has max surface area per wheat, so it should dominate on sauceability. Also thrilled to have an opportunity to say \"radiatori\" 3, nay 4 times in context. reply djur 1 hour agorootparentEDIT: I take this back. I think it's \"forkability\"; their description specifically points out that this shape is long enough to be easily picked up with a fork. Radiatori are pretty small and often easier to spoon. I like them a lot, though. reply potatoman22 12 hours agoprevI wonder if earlier shapes of pasta were created with a similar mindset. Was macaroni engineered for an optimal eating experience? reply pacbard 11 hours agoparentProbably not. A pasta tube is the easiest shape to make by extrusion (and difficult to make by hand) and it was likely the first thing they tried after thinking of using extrusion to make pasta. reply toyg 11 hours agorootparentIsh. Yes, the basic shapes come from what was possible back then, but some varieties ended up being more popular because they do work better. Sadly I lack the English vocabulary to describe the difference between penne liscie and penne rigate... reply bagels 10 hours agorootparentLooks like the difference is one has longitudinal ridges, and the other is smooth. reply mongol 10 hours agorootparentprevThis is what ChatGPT has to say about the difference. Does it capture your view of the matter? Penne liscie and penne rigate are both types of penne pasta, but they differ in their surface texture: 1. *Penne Liscie*: This type of penne has a smooth surface. The word \"liscie\" in Italian means \"smooth.\" Due to its smooth texture, it generally holds lighter sauces better, as the surface doesn't trap as much sauce. 2. *Penne Rigate*: In contrast, penne rigate has a ridged surface. \"Rigate\" means \"ridged\" or \"grooved\" in Italian. These ridges or grooves are excellent for holding onto thicker, heartier sauces, as they provide more surface area for the sauce to adhere to. The choice between the two usually depends on the type of sauce being used and personal preference. Penne rigate's ability to hold more sauce makes it a popular choice for many robust and creamy sauces. reply Traubenfuchs 12 hours agoprevThe most sauceable pasta was developed long ago.

So, even if it's not patented, it might not be profitable to just copy it. After all, most other shapes are cheaper and no \"real\" pasta company is going to get into a PR fiasco just to sell a different shape out of the 100s they already have.

In it, I went through the reasons why competent teams will be distributed for bits work, today and into the future (for atoms work we still need a human presence — for now). I’ve nothing really to add to that part of the conversation, remote work isn’t even new, people have been doing it since the 90s. But in the time since I wrote the above post, remote work won and became a normal part of life for a large cohort of the population. This will only continue to grow, and so I wanted to comment a bit more on the topic as some are still strangely in denial. Let’s start with this chart a friend shared with me on remote work quietly reaching equilibrium, which happened last year. There is plenty other data, samples and trend sources here you can google, but broadly it is all pretty steady that over 1/4 of employees in the US are working remote in a durable fashion since 2020, and probably more interestingly 68% would prefer to be fully remote. Note it’s higher % of people working remote in cities because of the type of work done there. Endless cubicle farms were never the end state of anything, and all this can be repurposed for better use: shopping, socialization, recreation, residential and exciting/novel concepts we’ve not even considered yet. The future here is something to look forward to: going to city centers purely to do something alone you can do anywhere makes no logical sense. This was all inevitable and good, unless you wanted humans to remain enslaved and great real estate locations to be stuck in 1950s-era industrial economy use. Even the old guard suits at Goldman Sachs believe remote is here to stay [via Axios]: Remote work appears likely to be the most persistent economic legacy of the pandemic,\" write Goldman Sachs economists in a recent note. About 20%-25% of workers in the U.S. work from home at least part of the week, according to data Goldman cites. That's below a peak of 47% during the pandemic but well above its prior average of around 3%. \"The battle is over,\" said Diana Scott, human capital center leader at The Conference Board. \"There are so many other issues CEOs are facing.” Now that remote has been normalized for some time it was cool to also see some new research on public firms and distributed work just published December, 2023. The full paper is worth reading, but the summary is what you would expect if you’re paying attention and viewing this issue objectively (emphasis mine). Using a sample of Standard and Poor’s 500 firms, we examine determinants and consequences of U.S. firms’ return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Results of our determinant analyses are consistent with managers using RTO mandates to reassert control over employees and blame employees as a scapegoat for bad firm performance. …our findings do not support the argument that managers impose mandates because they believe RTO increases firm values. Further, our difference in differences tests report significant declines in employees’ job satisfactions mandates but no significant changes in financial performance or firm values after RTO mandates. So basically, TL;DR: you will make your employees hate their lives, make less money and be less efficient by electing to assert authoritarian control over their movements and do the same work in a different arbitrary building every day. And I am not being hyperbolic here, I have heard stories from friends in legacy sectors whose teams have started location-tracking employees during the day. It’s straight out of a dystopian panopticon science fiction novel. I can’t imagine anyone competent staying at such firms very long. Absolute top companies like like NVIDIA worth well >$1 trillion are running remote operations for their teams, so there’s really no excuse that “this is just for smaller shops.” My team at Google was distributed many years before this was normalized and we worked on software at internet scale. So when execs comment here, they’re simply putting their lack of (modern) management skills on display for the world to see. I Tweeted jokingly about this over the weekend here. Really the only other dinosaurs howling into the wind about the latest fax machine going extinct due to the internet are CRE bagholders, who are of course upset they (god forbid) have to reinvest or change strategies, and continue to clutch pearls hoping the world would revert to a previous state. They of course don’t believe Earth can change (something it’s literally defined by). We’re a free capitalist society and so everyone has to go through the ringer of disruption, but ultimately we come out the other side better for the vast majority. They’ll evolve, but for some reason this group are extremely sore losers here. There was this story last year in Minneapolis which was emblematic of so much I’ve seen in local markets, in which a CRE owner says \"hey , please put a gun to your employee's heads bc I want to make more money\" …quite the take. The irony of this quote is Randolph Street Realty Capital and Jonathan himself are based on Chicago, not Minneapolis. They aren’t even a local part of the community they claim to care about (they literally just care about their holdings, of course). They also flex aggregate asset value >600M on their website. It’s incredible for a number of reasons, that there are grown adults who basically sound like children, but anyway if your income relies on political pressure for people to be forced to do something — sounds pretty un-American to me. This happened across America, and because of such public tantrums no one feels bad for them. Where we go from here… Daily commutes into an office are simply not coming back for competent people. Everyone I talk to who loves their craft would rather simply not work than go back to wasting their lives in traffic (and this is how we designed America). They would rather have that time purely for working, which they can now do. The analogy to best understand this which I’ve said before is like believing in Santa Claus as a child, and later discovering Santa isn’t real. You can’t go back. The spell of the office being a requisite for modern work was broken. The genie is impossible to put back in the bottle. Everyone will adapt. So all we have left are bad bosses, CRE bagholders who want everyone to be miserable in order to prop up their portfolios, and some % of mid-managers who simply hate their lives and want their peers to sit in traffic for 2 hours a day (literally the cause of unhappiness in modernity). The world is pretty dark already, but I can’t imagine letting any of these groups claw-back an inevitable future the pandemic let us have early (basically the only positive outcome for our suffering here, if we didn’t keep it we’d have made it through all this for nothing). There will of course be more nonsense: layoffs in the name of “RTO” using it as an excuse (which we know is a lie, and have research on linked above) and property owners who have no idea how the knowledge economy functions believing they get to dictate how corporate America works. Sane people will continue to point out the absurdity and hypocrisy. And for investors, employees or even just customers: remember any company doing “RTO” is a giant red flag they don't know what they're doing, are lying to the market, or hate their own employees. It’s really just layoffs by another name, because they can’t simply be honest. In summary: remote work won, don’t let anyone gaslight you to believe otherwise.

For me, I certainly agree with all of his noted pros: less time wasted in traffic, more flexibility especially for working parents, and even some things he didn't mention, like fewer distractions when you need \"heads down\" time. Even before the pandemic I always preferred working from home when I knew I just needed a long stretch of coding time, and things like huge open-plan offices terrified me. I also agree that RTO plans are largely useless; you often just get the \"people come in and then just spend half their time on Zoom because some colleagues are still remote\" dynamic. But I do worry about the long-term effects of so much remote work, primarily: 1. When I was new in my career, I learned a ton just \"through osmosis\" by being around more experienced colleagues. I also built good relationship and friendships early in my work career (to be honest, I always felt kind of sad for people who took the \"colleagues aren't your friends\" mindset. Perhaps not all of them, but why not make friends with people you spend a lot of time with?) I certainly understand married people with kids and with well-developed friend groups being much more happier with remote work, but I think it's much harder to develop those relationships in the first place if you start out remote from the get go. 2. I really worry about overall isolation, and also an increase in polarization. We used to talk about the loss of \"third spaces\" when countries became much less religious, and now we're seeing the loss of that \"second space\" (the office) as well. I go into the office multiple times a week just because I get stir crazy staying in my house all the time. The average number of people I have contact with in any week is way, way down, and that doesn't help my tendency toward depression. In other words, yes, I agree that remote work has won, but given that, I think it's a good time to focus on ameliorating the negatives. reply johnnyanmac 1 hour agoparentYeah, I resonate a lot with these two issues. 1) While I'm sure there's always going to be some imposter syndrome, I simply feel like I'm not growing the same in a post pandemic world. People in general are less connected and that osmosis from random lunch conversations or overhearing other engineer's problems may be a big part of how the pioneers of yester-decade could take command of a system or entire product and truly thrive. not only do I not get that knowledge, but I feel I get less opportunities to really show I can push to the next level. I'm not as trusted with unfamiliar areas because I'm less a face and more a name that pings for PRs. I can't branch out as much because it's even harder to converse with other teams, I find it harder to get promoted as it's hard to point to \"significant impact\" (which I never get a chance to) and if I go looking for jobs I get less impressive things to talk about that may help with a more senior role. This may indeed be a young/old divide as someone who was surrounded by older folk with families who feel elated (and after consulting my own family with young kids, I start to get it). Whereas I always felt more ambivalent on the situation. It does feel great once you get to a point where you feel no need to grow, but I very much do. 2) isolation is also a huge problem as well, especially since I moved to a town where none of my college friends are. Now with remote work I have to physically force myself to get out for the sake of sanity. I live alone so I can legitimately go a week without seeing another physical face if I fell into my usual habits. to call it \"loneliness\" is an understatement, and it doesn't feel healthy at all. reply smarmgoblin 16 hours agoparentprevTotally agree that these are issues worth thinking about and mitigating. One thing I’ve started doing at work is documenting workflows in various ways: not just docs but talks and screencasts where a new engineer could see my workflow. (I also give new engineers advice to keep a digital notebook! I still learn tons by doing this.) For the isolation bit I just wonder what we will see replacing that. It’s possible we never see anything and everyone just deals with it but I hope shared office spaces or something similar picks up. I get plenty of socialization elsewhere but little breaks in the workday to not focus on productivity and just chitchat were nice and maybe important some days. reply DonsDiscountGas 12 hours agoparentprev> why not make friends with people you spend a lot of time with? All well and fine if you can, but you shouldn't be forced to. And it shouldn't be the only way to make friends. People with that mindset typically have other social groups. > I think it's a good time to focus on ameliorating the negatives Agreed, and this is something we should've been doing starting decades ago (see: Bowling Alone). We already link health insurance to peoples jobs, it shouldn't be a persons entire social life. reply johnnyanmac 1 hour agorootparent>And it shouldn't be the only way to make friends. I'm all ears on current ways to make friends as an adult, or at least ideas on where to go. Like the GP said, 3rd places are down and instead of talking about ways to build more 3rd places we're potentially seeing the collapse of 2nd places. And I don't think people are exactly comfortable going or inviting people into their 1st place as of now.

There are many coworkers I met during Covid and have only known then remotely for years. I feel pretty close to them and know their kids, hobbies, etc. In some cases I’ve gotten to meet them in person and it feels like I sat next to them for years. In some ways it’s easier because I can have these virtual connections to more people, but in IRL I would only sit next to 1-3 people. What I do miss is going to lunch every day. That was really nice. But at my current org, there’s no lunch culture so it was rare to eat lunch with people before remote work. reply johnnyanmac 1 hour agorootparent>In some ways it’s easier because I can have these virtual connections to more people, but in IRL I would only sit next to 1-3 people. interesting, it's the opposite for me. I was in a small satellite office but I felt I got to know half of the 30 people in my area fairly quickly. once the office shut down I never saw nor talked to most of those people. Just my immediate team of 3-5 people (2 of which came after the pandemic). The main upside was that I did talk more to people in the main office than I did before, but there was no chance of any get together when we're 500 miles apart. I agree with missing lunch. That was definitely the best time to talk to people you'd never have a chance to otherwise. reply kyleee 5 hours agorootparentprevLunch is the true pandemic casualty reply lewdev 6 hours agoparentprevI think the negatives apply to new/inexperienced workers and it's unfortunate that it wasn't addressed in the article, but this affects the smaller population of the entire workforce and will be one of those things that will be improved on over time. I imagine there being new processes to get new workers on-boarded and adjusted to remote work and that could be having them temporarily in the office. I also started my career in a cubicle farm with a lot of other software engineers which was great for my growth, but I think that could be replaced with adjustments to the process of ramping up juniors. Perhaps colleges or training programs will incorporate training to deal with the lack of seniors or assign juniors with seniors to work together in a mentorship with guidelines. reply johnnyanmac 1 hour agorootparent>but this affects the smaller population of the entire workforce and will be one of those things that will be improved on over time. I'm not as optimistic. that class of 2020-2022 (high school and college) got socially stunted in a way that I feel will only break the physical divide further. Those kids in 20 years won't even see it as a problem that they never got a proper prom, a chance to walk the stage, a chance to properly onboard into their first step of their career and form connections that will help them grow. It'll just be a new normal, a colder normal facilitated by the false platitudes that is modern social media. The only possibly good long term (20+ year) ramifications will be that a lot of old crusty government processes will definitely be streamlined through the net. Having platforms livestream electorial forums to a populace who treat the internet as a natural extension of their bodies will completely change the dynamics of how candidates argue and pander. reply odyssey7 15 hours agoparentprevPoint (1) is a function of the team's culture around new hires and working relationships generally. Occupying the same building, the same floor, or even the same room as a coworker is simply not equivalent to having a beneficial work culture. You can neglect new hires just as effectively in an office, and you can support new hires just as effectively over Teams. reply kaashif 15 hours agorootparent> You can neglect new hires just as effectively in an office, and you can support new hires just as effectively over Teams. My experience is that some people are just much less likely to ask questions over Slack or start a Zoom call, which hurts them. My productivity is higher if I don't have people asking me stuff, but if those questions just never get asked it's bad for new hires' growth. There might be ways to fix this but I don't know what they are. Just telling people \"feel free to ask questions whenever\" doesn't always work. Having regular meetings just results in people withholding questions until those meetings. I don't think it's possible to lower the bar for questions to the same level as just opening your mouth and speaking, maybe with a constant Zoom call but no-one wants to do that. reply odyssey7 14 hours agorootparentIf the organization has a widespread issue where employees hesitate to ask questions via impromptu Slack messages or phone calls, then managers need more training on establishing an effective organizational culture.

But I don't think that negates that being in-office with a good work culture can have significant benefits over being remote with a good work culture. Also, my issue isn't just with \"new hires\", it's with new inexperienced hires. I started my career in a company that had a \"boot camp\"-like training environment for new grads, and I found it hugely, hugely beneficial for both learning new things and for developing strong relationships that have lasted 25 years later.

Feelings are fine, the data shows the model is effective. You can hire the best talent anywhere, talent that has options. That is a material competitive edge vs hiring a cohort that is willing to tolerate a non remote operating model. My hot take: Don’t hire helpless people, and the people you do hire, make sure they are fully supported to know what they need to do their job (internal mentor/buddy, knowledge base, frequent check ins until they’re more autonomous, etc). In person onboarding can help, as can week long in person on sites every quarter or twice a year (team cohesion). reply spixy 9 hours agorootparentI value more ability to socialize and have fun with coworkers physically, than maybe more money in high value enterprise where I would work from my room and be alone most of the day. reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentprev> There’s over $120B in enterprise value of remote first enterprises. 1.

In other words, you can just listen to what other people are trying to solve when doing your task and are free to interrupt them if you feel interested in so on. * Every 3 months we try to get together as much as possible for 2-3 days (it never happened 100% as we live on different continents, the rest joins from their local offices or homes) - and it feels great! * My teammates are really cool and our bosses too, so we have the necessary space to communicate without worrying it will impact our performance.

Give me the numbers not the feels. If you are a massive company, by allowing full remote you could be saving hundreds of millions of dollars on real estate, office upkeep, electricity, etc. You can recruit employees from all over the country so your access to talent is superior and you can afford to pay talent less. These benefits are easy to analyze, it's just a massive amount of money and time being saved. Now to go to the less tangible benefits that don't necessarily positively impact the business itself, employees can live in cheaper cost of living areas and actually have the ability to one day own property. Massive reductions in carbon emissions because of 0 commute. Massive time savings for employees because of 0 commute that they can then use to spend more time with family or friends, exercise, or sleep more (all of which could lead to healthier employees). Oh, and they will actually be able to live close to family since they will not need to move to a different state / city. There will be much more efficient use of space, office space is basically redundant when employees can work from home. This freed up space could be used for housing which we desperately need. I'm sure I could come up with a million more benefits of wfh. To advocate for return to office you need to make all these logical leaps that somehow being together in person will result in us making more money than what we save from being remote and is better for employees somehow. reply hn_throwaway_99 15 hours agoparent> My biggest problem with the RTO argument is that it's not quantitative. I have never seen any reasonable examples of what could be \"quantified\" here though. To be clear, leaders at big tech companies are not so worried about \"number of tickets closed in office vs. remote\" or some such related easily quantifiable metric. And the jobs that are easily quantifiable are the ones that leaders are least worried about doing remotely (both up and down the spectrum, from call center workers who can be measured on number of calls, to diagnostic radiologists who can be measured in RVUs). Corporate leaders, especially in tech, are largely worried about a slow deterioration/decline in innovation, general employee dedication (i.e. employees feeling less connected to their job), and overall quality. Those things are extremely difficult if not impossible to measure, especially since they can take years to pan out. I'm certainly open to hearing counterpoints, but I haven't heard any yet that sound believable to me. reply lsy 14 hours agorootparent\"I have a worry about X that I can't justify in any way\" isn't a good basis for forcing people into a decision that (as the GP mentions) has dozens of obvious, immediate, and measurable benefits in the other direction. The simplest explanation for why \"leaders\" are fighting for RTO is not that office work was, improbably, a perfect global maximum for productivity, innovation, esprit de corps, or whatever, but merely that office work is how things used to be done and a lot of people got used to it both organizationally and economically. From that perspective, I think the burden of proof is completely on those who are fighting for a return to status quo to argue why workers (and society at large!) should be willing to trade all of the obvious benefits of remote work for these supposed intangibles. reply jkic47 13 hours agorootparentI think that's an oversimplification of the argument being made. For people early in their careers, face time on site can be invaluable. They get to learn from people who get things done, and emulate them (or not). On-site, they learn from both positive and negative examples. This is simply less effective through meetings only. The counterpoint also ignores human behavior. The person getting promoted is likely to be the person who shows up every day and visibly contributes when compared head-to-head against an equivalently performing employee WFH. First time people managers will likely be expected to manage people where their boss can keep an eye on them before entrusting them with remote teams. This could create a career choke point. the advantages you mention are real, but WFH is poor career advice unless you can compete on price with low-cost foreign workers who are just as remote as the person I am paying a US salary to reply IshKebab 13 hours agorootparentprevHe's not saying it can't be justified; he's saying it can't be measured. Big difference. Anyway I think you're both wrong about this. The reason for RTO is two-fold: * Working in an office is much better for higher ups because their job is much more talking to people than doing \"actual work\". If you're spending literally all day in meetings it is worth the commute to avoid Zoom. If you're only spending 1-2 hours in meetings it definitely isn't. * They have a fear that people will do no work if they're at home. Honestly I think it's completely unfounded, and it's just as easy to do no work at work. But it's a real fear. Actually I think hn_throway_99 has a point about them being worried about disinvestment too. But it's mostly the fact that WFH is way worse for management than it is for the bottom rung. reply Viliam1234 13 hours agorootparentprev> leaders at big tech companies are not so worried about \"number of tickets closed ... or some such related easily quantifiable metric ... Corporate leaders, especially in tech, are largely worried about a slow deterioration/decline in innovation, general employee dedication So, why is there so much (corporate anti-)Scrum everywhere? I mean, most employees hate it with a passion, and the typical excuse is that it makes velocity more predictable, even if slower. Now you are telling me that the corporate leaders in tech do not care about quantifiable things, and are worried about innovation and employees. How can both of this be true at the same time? I guess I will stay with my null hypothesis that most corporate leaders have no idea what they are doing, and just randomly do whatever feels right at the moment. reply johnnyanmac 1 hour agorootparentThey may all be under one company, but I think we all know different teams even within the same org can have very different cultures. I think that's the issue. Some cutting edge R&D team may have legitmately worries about innovation. the team maintaining decade old legacy code, less so. But for several reasons these kinds of mandates need to be company wide, not just opt in/out per team (though yes, there will be exceptions for the exceptional, as always).

(Though I’m sure some use could be found for the space.) Charles Munger tried to do it differently with beds on the inside, but this is unpopular [1]. One reason that companies go for an open design is to get more natural light into the interior, which makes for a good first impression, but has other downsides like noise.

Being socially isolated from the other members of your team and only having VC is, in my mind, just as poor of an alternative. Imagine instead if you and (the majority of) your colleagues came to work by cycling for 20 minutes through green pastures, parks, under willow trees along the river, and through the centre of one of the most famous historic towns in England. That’s what we do here in Cambridge. We also do not operate a cubicle farm. Our office is spacious, filled with breakout spaces, relaxation spots, a library (aka quiet room), VC equipped rooms of all sizes, with a mini- and a maxi-kitchen and free snacks and meals. We come and go as we please with two days a week all together and frequently other in-office days for sub teams too, agreed by consensus not fiat. I often work at home in the morning or go home after lunch for the afternoon if I need uninterrupted focus / maker time. We have a personal IT budget for our home offices so I don’t need to cycle with my laptop (which btw is an Ubuntu Dell XPS, because our IT team know what they’re doing — you can have a MacBook if you insist.) Cambridge has gigabit fibre which is handy when pushing and pulling models from the A100 machines in our remote data centre. We still allow people to be as remote as they want and we also have a satellite office in London.

The businesses you mention - grocery stores - aren't even usually patronized by commuters, and their recent appearance in city centers has been precipitated by downtowns shifting from commercial-only blight to round-the-clock mixed use, something that will only accelerate as downtowns are liberated from massive buildings that sit empty 2/3 of the day, small businesses that have to shut down at 6pm and all weekend, and peaky congestion that requires all facilities to overinvest in capacity to handle a couple of hours on weekdays with much lower usage otherwise.

There’s no reason to pay inflated rates for Bay Area or New York City employees, beyond the very few that are genuinely differentiated. It has nothing to do with preference at the end of the day.

(2) People have investments in commercial real-estate, and forcing RTO is a way to profit from those investments even if it immiserates the workers (article discusses this point). (3) Cities offer tax breaks to encourage businesses to move, on the basis that the workers will use ancillary services (transport, restaurants, shopping, etc). If the tax breaks go that will negatively affect the companies. If the ancillary service businesses go that will negatively affect the city's revenues. (4) Bad middle managers feel they lack control if a worker isn't present. reply 0l 14 hours agorootparentGood points, but I thought OP was saying that the NYT had a manipulative motive, and not the employers. reply photochemsyn 16 hours agoprevDid worker bees escape from the corporation's office-based system of control, or did they just bring the corporation into their home? > \"First, a little background.

We had a global pandemic. Government spending had a massive impact on eviscerating poverty, raising some 11.2 million Americans out of poverty [1]. To keep companies afloat and to avoid the healthcare system collapsing, people stayed indoors and worked from home. Many took pay cuts or loss of benefits to do this. A lot of people realized they didn't need to go into the office at all and they could have a substantial improvement in the quality of life by not wasting hours a day in a car and/or moving somewhere more affordable. Demand did drop in 2020/2021 but it came roaring back and companies saw an ppportunity to recoup lost profits with predatory price incresaes. They saw massive profits and inflation shot through the roof as a result [2]. To compare to the oil shock of the 1970s, Nixon instituted price and wage freezes to stave off shock inflation [3]. The Fed responded to inflation by raising interest rates. They government had a far more effective tool available: corporate taxation. Some countries like Spain instituted a windfall profits tax. Taxes fill government coffers. Interest rates enrich bankers. Certain workers gained wage increases in the pandemic as they were essential. Inflation eroded much of this and employers took further opportunity to suppress or claw back wage incresaes through layoffs. Layoffs increase the workload of those workers who remain and reduce the ability for workers to demand wage increses, even cost-of-living adjustments. Return to office mandates are soft layoffs. They're cheaper too since if people quit they don't get a severance payout. The only effective wage increases gained during the pandemic were through labor organization, such as with the UAW and the Big Three automakers. So here are the lessons to draw: 1. Government policy exists almost entirely to transfer wealth from the poor to the already wealthy; 2. Employers are not your friends. You owe them absolutely no loyalty. In fact, given the trend to rescinding job offers, I would strongly advise people not to quit their job before starting their new one. Just don't show up. Two weeks notice is a courtesy not a legal or even contractual requirement. \"At will\" employment goes both ways. 3. Government spending is a way to redistribute wealth from the ultra-wealthy to the poor and it is incredibly effective. Post-GFC we've had many countries operate with austerity measures. This is simply propaganda to stop this wealth transfer. 4. Greed is the primary driver in inflation. Taxation would at least allow the government to help those worst affected; 5. Companies use layoffs and return to office mandates to suppress your wages; and 6. The only effective counter to wage suppression is labor organization ie unions.

No one I know working outside of tech is even close to this in their attitudes towards remote work. Nowhere else is anyone who disagrees \"gaslighting\". Nowhere else is this all a \"plot by commercial real estate\". Most want the flexibility to work remotely when they need to (or a few days a week), but prefer working alongside their coworkers for a variety of reasons. The complaints about entire divisions or floors being ghost towns and it being impossible to find the person for help with something are perennial. I know there's some selection bias in who comments on the topic, but I think there's more to it: most people here work in a context where they take a ticket, work on it, etc with ideally minimal synchronization points or meetings. Of all forms of work it's among the most well suited (there are others) to working remotely. Not to mention the absolutely horrific Bay Area commutes. I don't blame you all. But have some humility.

Regardless of the industry. Meanwhile if you work with folk who struggle to plug something into a USB, you may be more inclined to simply be there in person, for multiple reasons.

Credits: Credit: MIT Self-Assembly Lab Previous image Next image MIT researchers have developed an additive manufacturing technique that can print rapidly with liquid metal, producing large-scale parts like table legs and chair frames in a matter of minutes. Their technique, called liquid metal printing (LMP), involves depositing molten aluminum along a predefined path into a bed of tiny glass beads. The aluminum quickly hardens into a 3D structure. Play video The researchers say LMP is at least 10 times faster than a comparable metal additive manufacturing process, and the procedure to heat and melt the metal is more efficient than some other methods. The technique does sacrifice resolution for speed and scale. While it can print components that are larger than those typically made with slower additive techniques, and at a lower cost, it cannot achieve high resolutions. For instance, parts produced with LMP would be suitable for some applications in architecture, construction, and industrial design, where components of larger structures often don’t require extremely fine details. It could also be utilized effectively for rapid prototyping with recycled or scrap metal. In a recent study, the researchers demonstrated the procedure by printing aluminum frames and parts for tables and chairs which were strong enough to withstand postprint machining. They showed how components made with LMP could be combined with high-resolution processes and additional materials to create functional furniture. “This is a completely different direction in how we think about metal manufacturing that has some huge advantages. It has downsides, too. But most of our built world — the things around us like tables, chairs, and buildings — doesn’t need extremely high resolution. Speed and scale, and also repeatability and energy consumption, are all important metrics,” says Skylar Tibbits, associate professor in the Department of Architecture and co-director of the Self-Assembly Lab, who is senior author of a paper introducing LMP. Tibbits is joined on the paper by lead author Zain Karsan SM ’23, who is now a PhD student at ETH Zurich; as well as Kimball Kaiser SM ’22 and Jared Laucks, a research scientist and lab co-director. The research was presented at the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture Conference and recently published in the association’s proceedings. Significant speedup One method for printing with metals that is common in construction and architecture, called wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), is able to produce large, low-resolution structures, but these can be susceptible to cracking and warping because some portions must be remelted during the printing process. LMP, on the other hand, keeps the material molten throughout the process, avoiding some of the structural issues caused by remelting. Drawing on the group’s previous work on rapid liquid printing with rubber, the researchers built a machine that melts aluminum, holds the molten metal, and deposits it through a nozzle at high speeds. Large-scale parts can be printed in just a few seconds, and then the molten aluminum cools in several minutes. “Our process rate is really high, but it is also very difficult to control. It is more or less like opening a faucet. You have a big volume of material to melt, which takes some time, but once you get that to melt, it is just like opening a tap. That enables us to print these geometries very quickly,” Karsan explains. The team chose aluminum because it is commonly used in construction and can be recycled cheaply and efficiently. Bread loaf-sized pieces of aluminum are deposited into an electric furnace, “which is basically like a scaled-up toaster,” Karsan adds. Metal coils inside the furnace heat the metal to 700 degrees Celsius, slightly above aluminum’s 660-degree melting point. The aluminum is held at a high temperature in a graphite crucible, and then molten material is gravity-fed through a ceramic nozzle into a print bed along a preset path. They found that the larger the amount of aluminum they could melt, the faster the printer can go. “Molten aluminum will destroy just about everything in its path. We started with stainless steel nozzles and then moved to titanium before we ended up with ceramic. But even ceramic nozzles can clog because the heating is not always entirely uniform in the nozzle tip,” Karsan says. By injecting the molten material directly into a granular substance, the researchers don’t need to print supports to hold the aluminum structure as it takes shape. Perfecting the process They experimented with a number of materials to fill the print bed, including graphite powders and salt, before selecting 100-micron glass beads. The tiny glass beads, which can withstand the extremely high temperature of molten aluminum, act as a neutral suspension so the metal can cool quickly. “The glass beads are so fine that they feel like silk in your hand. The powder is so small that it doesn’t really change the surface characteristics of the printed object,” Tibbits says. The amount of molten material held in the crucible, the depth of the print bed, and the size and shape of the nozzle have the biggest impacts on the geometry of the final object. For instance, parts of the object with larger diameters are printed first, since the amount of aluminum the nozzle dispenses tapers off as the crucible empties. Changing the depth of the nozzle alters the thickness of the metal structure. To aid in the LMP process, the researchers developed a numerical model to estimate the amount of material that will be deposited into the print bed at a given time. Because the nozzle pushes into the glass bead powder, the researchers can’t watch the molten aluminum as it is deposited, so they needed a way to simulate what should be going on at certain points in the printing process, Tibbits explains. They used LMP to rapidly produce aluminum frames with variable thicknesses, which were durable enough to withstand machining processes like milling and boring. They demonstrated a combination of LMP and these post-processing techniques to make chairs and a table composed of lower-resolution, rapidly printed aluminum parts and other components, like wood pieces. Moving forward, the researchers want to keep iterating on the machine so they can enable consistent heating in the nozzle to prevent material from sticking, and also achieve better control over the flow of molten material. But larger nozzle diameters can lead to irregular prints, so there are still technical challenges to overcome. “If we could make this machine something that people could actually use to melt down recycled aluminum and print parts, that would be a game-changer in metal manufacturing. Right now, it is not reliable enough to do that, but that’s the goal,” Tibbits says. “At Emeco, we come from the world of very analog manufacturing, so seeing the liquid metal printing creating nuanced geometries with the potential for fully structural parts was really compelling,” says Jaye Buchbinder, who leads business development for the furniture company Emeco and was not involved with this work. “The liquid metal printing really walks the line in terms of ability to produce metal parts in custom geometries while maintaining quick turnaround that you don’t normally get in other printing or forming technologies. There is definitely potential for the technology to revolutionize the way metal printing and metal forming are currently handled.” Additional researchers who worked on this project include Kimball Kaiser, Jeremy Bilotti, Bjorn Sparrman, Schendy Kernizan, and Maria Esteban Casanas. This research was funded, in part, by Aisin Group, Amada Global, and Emeco.

The parts it produces have to be milled and machined afterwards which in some cases could increase the manufacturing time overall. I do like their approach of keeping it hot and printing inside the sand. Much like casting. The nozzle however pushes sand all over the place and is probably pushing it into the path, causing the poorer quality prints. I spent a couple years as a young adult in a metal part manufacturing plant while going to school. It’s exciting though because I believe we’ll have a time, not too far from now, where a design can be fed to a molten printer to print a base part, transferred to cnc mill for final refining, and then polished and painted for shipping. It won’t cost $10M to create a fabrication facility. It won’t require 25 years of industrial mechanics to build your “plant”.

To me this seems like it overcomplicated the task because they chose to print the aluminum, rather than just printing a form that can hold molten aluminum as a traditional casting might.

Would love to know someone else's informed guess on this. reply neltnerb 3 hours agoparentYes, there are a wide variety of what amount to recipe books for different aluminum alloys along with their post treatment temperature profiles. Usually this includes details such as various impurity concentrations (more for steels), what temperature and time it is held at for each step of treatment, and processes like work hardening would be in there. There may be barriers to work hardening here but the heat treatment process seems like it should be similar to other casting processes. At least I'd think so, sand and glass beads aren't terribly different. I would expect that temperature and nozzle clogging would be where you'd see issues, with speed and probably small solid chunks causing bursts in flow rate since it's gravity fed. I'm sure they've thought of it... I'd expect it to be better than something built up layer by layer though, there's no messy attaching aluminum oxide layers to one another and figuring out a clean way to do it and then afterwards heat treat it properly all over again. reply s0rce 8 hours agoparentprevProbably yes, forging is often best but I suspect this is similar to casting although there might be more voids. For non-critical structural applications it might work.

Photograph: Luc Novovitch/Alamy UFOs Pentagon ex-UFO chief says conspiracy theorists in government drive spending Sean Kirkpatrick, the first director of the all-domain anomaly resolution office, blames ‘core group’ of government workers Richard Luscombe @richlusc Sat 27 Jan 2024 08.00 EST Conspiracy theorists working for and within the US government are perpetuating myths about UFOs that millions of taxpayer dollars are then spent looking into, a “self-licking ice cream cone”, according to the Pentagon’s former chief investigator of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). Sean Kirkpatrick made the claim in a podcast this week after stepping down last month as the first director of the defense department’s all-domain anomaly resolution office (Aaro). It was set up in 2022 to collate military reports of UAP sightings and to be more transparent about what the government knows. US Congress passes stripped-down measure to release UFO records Read more Aaro’s first comprehensive historical record report, which has been submitted to Congress and is set for publication later this year, contains no evidence of the existence of alien life, or any government cover-up, Kirkpatrick says. But many lawmakers, he insists, are only too happy to embrace unsubstantiated stories circulated by “a core group of people” about secret government UFO research programs. Those include startling claims from the former US intelligence official and whistleblower David Grusch last year about intact alien vehicles and non-human “biologics”, or biological matter, stored at a remote facility. “They’re some of the same people that have been working behind the scenes with Congress to write legislation,” Kirkpatrick told the In the Room With Peter Bergen podcast. “They’re the same people that worked with a US company and the US army to explore a piece of material that they claim was a UAP and really is a piece of missile casing from the 1950s. They’re the same people that have been influencing some of these whistleblowers who have come forward to say: ‘Hey, I don’t have any first-hand evidence, but all these people are telling me this.’” Kirkpatrick declined to identify the people by name, but agreed with Bergen’s observation that “the actual conspiracy is being carried out by a group of true believers themselves to get the government involved in the business of investigating aliens”. “That is a self-licking ice cream cone, exactly,” Kirkpatrick said. “The best thing that could have happened in this job is I found the aliens, and I could have rolled them out, but there’s none. There is no evidence of extraterrestrials. There is no evidence of aliens, and there’s no evidence of the government conspiracy.” Kirkpatrick said in a resignation essay published by Scientific American last week that he feared lawmakers had succumbed to “conspiracy-driven decision-making” and sensationalism in their rush to “uncover the cover-up”. “Worrisome is the willingness of some to make judgments and take actions on these stories without having seen or even requested supporting evidence, an omission that is all the more problematic when the claims are so extraordinary,” he wrote. “Some members of Congress prefer to opine about aliens to the press rather than get an evidence-based briefing on the matter. Members have a responsibility to exhibit critical-thinking skills instead of seeking the spotlight.” His frustration was apparent in his conversation with Bergen. He said his department’s mission to use a “rigorous scientific framework and a data-driven approach” to collate and evaluate UFO reports and sightings going back decades had been hampered by misrepresentations, half-truths and other snippets of misinformation from unreliable sources. “You’ve got people that talk to people who come in to tell the story, or tell the media, and other people come in, but it turns out none of them have any first-hand evidence or knowledge,” Kirkpatrick said. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And if you track where all those people know each other, it all goes back to the same core group of people.” What his team was able to deduce, Kirkpatrick said, was that at least 90% of recorded UFO sightings, including some videos of military encounters declassified by the Pentagon in recent years, have a perfectly logical explanation. “When you dig into those kinds of observations, and we had hundreds, you go back and work with the pilot, you work with the sensor, and you reconstruct the entire engagement, nine times out of 10 or more that turns into an optical illusion that we call parallax,” he said. “Most of the times when we can’t give an explanation, it is because there is a lack of data, and by that I mean consistent, solid, recorded data that you can put into a computer and you can do analysis on.” Even so, Kirkpatrick said, there are those unlikely to ever accept scientific explanations. “There is absolutely nothing that I’m going to do, say or produce evidentially that is going to make the true believers convert,” he said. “It is basically a religion, a religious belief that transcends critical thinking and rational thought.” Explore more on these topics UFOs US Congress Alien life news Reuse this content",

Do they not realize they are sewing the first seeds of doubt the children will have in their household religion? reply consumer451 15 hours agorootparentHmm, I wonder if it serves a societal purpose. As far as I can remember, catching my parents in \"the big Santa lie\" was the first time that I realized that adults are full of crap. This is a valuable lesson, right? But I felt so betrayed! It was the beginning of my journey into fact-based reasoning, naturalism, etc. I distinctively remember thinking: I will never believe in magic again! I started asking too many questions at catholic Sunday school, and the Sunday school teacher and I decided it was best that we part ways. I am over 40 now, but this is such a strong and important memory. I am still a little pissed off about it. This is hilarious, and maybe a bit profound. reply graemep 15 hours agorootparentprevI think the \"ostensibly\" has a lot to do with it. I am Christian and never told my kids Santa Claus was real. On the other hand there is no harm in stories. I also do not want my kids to believe something just because I believe it. They should think for themselves and to do otherwise it is dishonest. I do agree it is sometimes odd. I found myself trying to explain to a bewildered Sikh guy on Twitter why British society gets upset when people tell kids that Santa Claus is not real but is fine with people telling kids that Jesus is not real. reply 127361 14 hours agorootparentprevAnd how deceiving children is normalized in society, together with even worse forms of mistreatment. Because children are low status and can't fight back, adults and society in general can get away with doing all sorts of unjustified nasty things to them. That no adult would ever tolerate. It really is a dominance hierarchy there, something we expect from animals. People are supposed to be better than that. reply Slow_Hand 14 hours agorootparentprevThat’s certainly what happened to me. I can’t recall ever believing in Santa whole-heartedly and the knowledge of it’s falseness was a foot in the door to question everything else. Strangely my brother was far, far older when my mother and I had to convince him that Santa was not actually real. She was afraid that kids at school would make fun of him if we didn’t pop his bubble first. I’m not sure what to make of that difference in belief between my brother and I. reply mrtksn 15 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn't even have to be a metaphor, there are literal cults based on literal aliens. Some of them are quite large and influential. The non-organised ones though, I think make people feel good for themselves by either making them feel important(advanced civilisation came across the universe for me) or reassured (it's going to be alright, the universe works as expected - no funny business) reply 01272024 15 hours agorootparentprevDon't be so quick to dismiss claims. In this case, it's very real, and you're doing yourself a disservice by asserting otherwise without searching. I know for a fact that it's real. I spent about a year outside in Colorado, and saw several objects beyond explanation. Most are small and hard to see unless you know to look in the darkness of the sky between the stars. A couple put the fear of God into me - so big that they were the size of my two outstretched hands against the sky. Spheres cloaked against clouds in the night sky. Incomprehensibly large Y-shaped craft studded with what look like stars. Military-looking craft silently soaring directly above. Who knows if they're alien or manmade.. but whether you believe it or not, they're in the sky every night. reply consumer451 15 hours agorootparentI have seen slightly weird things in the sky. But to assume that they are an advanced technological species is not an assumption that I can jump to. I always found a much more plausible explanation. For 15 years, I lived near a NOAA station which launched balloons, but I didn't know that at first. They launch one right at sunset, every day. When it hits the sun at 1000 feet, it looks pretty darn crazy! Sometimes there were shadows from low clouds blocking the sunset, and the balloon would only get lit up at >10,000 feet, and it would \"jump\" in different directions due to high altitude wind sheers. I was very disappointed when I learned that truth. reply 01272024 15 hours agorootparentI agree, assuming it's aliens is a huge stretch. I can only say that aerial vehicles hundreds of meters across are silently traversing the sky. I hesitate to say it's manmade or otherwise. I'd have to see it to believe it. And while I'll concede that there are bizarre phenomenon of weather and lighting that can occur (google \"crown flash\"), the \"Y\" ship I saw was 5 full moons in width and absolutely, assuredly there. On a side note, these objects also have the ability to \"come out of\" and \"return to\" the night sky. It's as if a spotlight were pointed at one area of the sky, and the craft unintentionally crossed the path. They come from nothing, and they return to nothing, within about 15 seconds. It's hard to explain. Anyways, nothing personal if we don't agree on the matter. I know HN is based on hard evidence and logic, I can't provide either. But it's good to keep an open mind and keep looking for answers. reply krapp 14 hours agorootparentTo be fair, if you're seeing vast, incomprehensibly large craft in the sky and no one else is, as something like that should have hundreds if not thousands of people to corroborate, as well as photos, video sightings,etc, that's a sign that what you're seeing is not objectively real. reply nradov 9 hours agorootparentprevPics or it didn't happen reply gfodor 13 hours agoparentprevCorrect - but also sufficiently alien that you should consider a scenario where we have a sibling species here on Earth with us. reply tiahura 15 hours agoparentprevAnd have nothing better to do than fly around the US Southwest until they have engine trouble. reply cyanydeez 10 hours agoparentprevI'm not willing to believe any intelligent life is coming here because the timescale and physics are basically insurmountable. until demonstrated otherwise, it's indistinguishable from magic or religion. reply krapp 14 hours agoparentprevBefore flying saucers became pop culture, people reported \"phantom rocketships\" or literal sailing ships in the sky. When people claimed to encounter the aliens in such craft, they would claim to be from Venus or Mars, until it became common knowledge that neither Venus nor Mars contain advanced life. Once the \"greys\" became popular, everyone reported greys. Before that, aliens were far more diverse in appearance (notwithstanding the common appearance of \"space white people\".) If you study accounts of alien encounters and abduction, none of the technology abductees report seems extremely advanced, much less alien. Recognizable computers with buttons and dials. Levers. The aliens never bother to offer any equations or technical diagrams to prove their technology. In the whole centuries-long span of avowed alien encounters, no one has ever come away with anything we didn't already know. Of course, one could say the same thing about prophecies and Nostradamus. Encounters with angels, or demon summoning. Always just a hall of mirrors, always maddeningly subjective, never anything to hang one's hat on. Even in the very first recorded modern abduction scenario, Betty and Barney Hill, the aliens gave Betty a book to take with her. Evidence! Oh, but later another alien just look it back. Womp womp. Oh but there's a star map. Oh wait, it turns out it doesn't stand up to actual scrutiny. It's just dots and circles on a piece of paper, and so simple one wonders why an advanced civilization would even find it useful. And here we are in 2024 being told about city-sized craft and black pyramids and \"non human biologics\" and still not a damn bit of proof. And even with the weird outliers like the Falcon Lake incident or the Phoenix lights or Shag Harbor, where there is evidence of something weird or multiple eyewitnesses (not that that necessarily means anything,) things still don't make sense. Tell me how the Falcon Lake UFO makes sense. The witness looks like he pressed a waffle-iron against his chest because the UFO (allegedly) hit him with its weird grid of exhaust ports before taking off. The technology being described is both advanced and ridiculously quaint, as it so often is. The thing reported by Japan airlines 1628 - a weird spinning cylinder covered in flaming tubes and random lights. Obviously not Venus unless the pilot was deranged (which can't be taken off the table,) but if not, then what? You'd be surprised just how many UFOs seem to incorporate flames and rockets and that vanish in bursts of sulfur and flame as if they were demons returning to Hell. Almost as if they draw from the same subconscious archetypes. None of it makes any sense if taken at face value, and so much of it is obviously folklore, as it follows the structure of folklore. reply gfodor 12 hours agorootparentThe problem is these stories while inconsistent in the ways you mention are also inexplicably consistent in other ways. Imagine we have another small population of moderately more technologically advanced hominids right here on Earth. Say they want to fool us and make us think they are ET. Imagine they have technology we we have, like VR, drugs, and some we don’t like novel high energy hydroelectrodynamic atmospheric propulsion. Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, and if you experienced it, you would probably find yourself hallucinating details like the ones you mentioned to make it fit into some kind of coherent picture based on the technology and even physics you know. reply hackerlight 13 hours agorootparentprev> If you study accounts of alien encounters and abduction Ever find it strange how many abduction stories happen in people's bedrooms while they're lying down? It's because it's a hypnagogic hallucination during sleep paralysis. Alternatively, they don't remember the abduction but recovered the memory under hypnosis. It's almost certainly the case that these were false memories. A third options is that they are just legitimately insane.

There are 200 sextillion stars. For the opposite position (they shouldn't be here) to make sense, there has to be either no other civilizations, or our probe-sending habits are so rare that no other civilizations do it, or we are the first. Any of those other stances seem vastly more improbable, as they assume that our sample-of-one society just happens to be ludicrously different than all others. reply georgeecollins 16 hours agorootparentI think the reason why it seems improbable is that we conceptualize interstellar travel with a mental model of travel and exploration based on our human history of exploration and travel on Earth. So we think-- if there were a civilization a thousand light years away of course they would come visit and study us. What if the time it takes to travel between stars is longer than most civilizations exist? What if we aren't that interesting to alien species or aren't worth the time and energy to discover? We've never sent a functioning probe to any other star and probably won't in my lifetime. And life may not be at the nearest star, it may be thousands of light years away. We may never have the resources available to do it. reply ericb 16 hours agorootparent> What if the time it takes to travel between stars is longer than most civilizations exist? The probe doesn't require its parent civilization to continue existing to keep working. It self-replicates. You don't have to \"pick\" where self-replicating probes go. Each can self-replicate, and you can get nigh-infinite probes for \"free.\" A von Neuman probe finds its own resources. reply georgeecollins 14 hours agorootparentWe have never built anything complicated enough to self - replicate or self -repair that could last a hundred years. We have never built a biosphere that can exist in a self contained manner for a hundred years. I am not saying we won't but you are assuming we will figure out how to makes something that will maintain its message integrity for a hundred thousand years and then we will have the energy or the ability to shrink it enough to be able to send it off to some life supporting star. We have only had complicated writing for a few thousand years. People have wondered if a technical civilization existed on earth a hundred million years ago would there be any thing around now as evidence. If it takes a million years of travel in the freezing, radioactive vacuum of space to reach another life form, you don't know that humans will be around long enough as a civilization to figure out how to actually build the thing that you are describing.

Once they work inside a solar system, then work on making them withstand, say, a few million years in orbit and see if they still work, once they survive a few million years \"inactive\" (or constantly repairing themselves or whatever it takes), send them off to the stars. But it would take a patience and scale of industry we humans literally can only vaguely dream of. reply ericb 16 hours agorootparent> withstand, say, a few million years in orbit > ...scale of industry They don't have to do that.

Light speed delays would still matter, but any important news and communications would get delivered. reply krapp 12 hours agorootparentA communications network that works with an average latency of five years (the average distance between stars), and an edge case of millions of years would be all but useless. The civilization that started it might not even be the civilization that receives the first message, or even the same species. And what does \"important news and communications\" even mean with that kind of latency? Also there is signal degradation to consider. Depending on their broadcast strength, there is a limited range beyond which any signal they send will be indistinguishable from background noise. According to this quora post[0] that limit could be as little as four light years. It certainly would not work on any significantly pan-galactic scale. Lasers would fare little better, they would also diffuse and be absorbed by interstellar material. Also, at that scale, whatever message gets sent may no longer be relevant, or factual, by the time it's received. A lot can happen in a million years. It's difficult for me to think of a message worth sending that also doesn't matter if it takes longer than the time it took humans to evolve to get from point to point. [0]https://www.quora.com/How-far-do-radio-signals-travel-into-s... reply matthewdgreen 8 hours agorootparentI think a better way to think about this is: what would humans do if they had a few crucial pieces of technology? Assume you have computers advanced enough to self-replicate and carry out some pre-programmed set of goals creatively (this is essentially required for Von Neumann probes to work, and doesn’t seem wildly out of the ballpark for even humans in a few hundred years.) My guess is that we would optimistically assume human survival and build a network capable of exploring the galaxy without us. Since lightspeed delays make real-time communication impossible, individual nodes would be programmed to replicate and explore, following a specific set of parameters. They would report their findings back to some central hub if they found anything interesting, which would probably be only rarely. No doubt for very surprising findings (eg advanced intelligent species) they’d have additional instructions to enter a holding pattern and observe until they received explicit commands. Which, as you point out, might never come. I can’t speak to what aliens might do. humans would absolutely build this system the moment they had the technology to do it. The fact that we might not survive to use it would be acknowledged and then we’d do it anyway. If anything we’d see it as a fitting memorial to our existence. reply zabzonk 7 hours agorootparentonce again, someone suggests that humans will develop (at probably staggering costs) probes that cannot report back to them for tens of thousands of years. how many human civilizations have lasted that long - zero? it is simply not in our interest to do so. reply ericb 13 hours agorootparentprevThat's a fair point. If they are autonomous and carrying out a mission on your behalf, perhaps they don't need to communicate back to be useful. Might still leave defense, advance scouting, resource location (a broad search), panspermia, or other possibilities. reply hackerlight 12 hours agoparentprevMy issue with this thesis is it anthropomorphizes intentions and capabilities. We're predicting the behavior of civilizations a lot more advanced than us. We need a level of humility to realize that this is a lost cause, and a lot of the paradigms we take for granted will be shown to be false. So while everything you said makes sense, the space of unknown unknowns is so large that we should moderate our confidence in the underlying assumptions downwards. reply cratermoon 16 hours agoparentprevSpace is far, far larger than the mind can easily conceive. To \"von Neuman probes should be here\" is to fail to comprehend just how improbable it would be for a spacecraft to be aimed at Earth. reply ericb 16 hours agorootparentYou don't aim a von Neuman probe anywhere. You use unbounded exponential math to send them everywhere as they are free. It seems like you might find the idea interesting if you look into the concept a bit closer. reply cratermoon 15 hours agorootparentYes, but space is still vast. The chance of one hitting earth is infinitesimal. Also, \"they are free\" isn't strictly true. Where do they get the resources to reproduce? Using unbounded exponential math implies a sort of paperclip maximizer that would eat up everything in its path. reply Teever 9 hours agorootparentBut the point of sending out Von Nuemann probes is to send them to every star in a galaxy, so that you can watch the goings on of all those stars. That means that any Von Neumann plan in the Milky Way will involve Earth. > Where do they get the resources to reproduce? From the the star systems that they reach.

Recordings of shit in the sky doesn't mean aliens. In that sense, it's obvious that the phenomenon is real. reply krapp 15 hours agorootparentprevGrusch doesn't know anything, he only repeats what he's been told, and what he's been told comes from the same group of Skinwalker Ranch/UFO grifters that have been blowing smoke up the backsides of Schumer and other credulous dupes for years. There is no reason to believe aliens are real in this scenario, or that whatever goes on in private briefings involves \"real evidence\" of such, as opposed to just passing on more nonsense that happens to be classified (like a lot of the already debunked UAP videos.) Just because someone says something under oath, doesn't mean it's true. Just because someone says something in a SCIF, doesn't mean it's true. Just because a video seems to show a weird light or an orb or a triangle and the government says it hasn't been tampered with, doesn't mean the government is admitting that it shows proof of actual extraterrestrial craft. The scenario presented in TFA is the simplest explanation that makes the most sense, even more so than it all being a distraction or intentional psyop to fool the Chinese or Russians. Maybe at the core of everything, there is some exotic foreign drone activity the Navy wants people to feel free to report, but the stigma of \"UFOs\" has gotten in the way. I can see some of this being part of a campaign by the military to make the phenomenon credible for the sake of national security, but not because actual aliens are involved. reply rocgf 10 hours agorootparentDavid Grusch is supposedly in the process of writing an op-ed in which he reveals more about his actual knowledge.

My hypothesis is they are in a large void under one of the oceans, in physical pods. They don't eat solid food, but absorb a liquid diet. They probably do produce a heat signature, if we looked. I don't have a good explanation for the relative lack of evidence of their surface phase, but we do have some evidence that timelines around technological civilization are very off base. For your last point, I think most of them are not physically able to travel to the surface at all, and any instance of crashed manned UAPs (which imo, are no longer manned at all) may have explanations of the kind you state.

So, while absence of evidence doesn't prove anything about that being the case, absence of evidence would be expected if it was: if human civilization developed ubiquitious high-res sensing tech, then you'd expect the adversary to respond in kind. In other words, if they're real, and they're trying to hide, then the fact we all have iPhones hasn't yielded more evidence doesn't prove anything, because if it was us, we'd change our tactics to avoid being detected by those things. As we do in war. It's very important to notice I'm not saying this tells us that is what is going on - we have to build up our priors in other ways to decide if that's true - but what I'm saying is that the claim that we all have cameras and yet not more UFO videos has absolutely zero epistemological effect, since it's smuggling in the assumption these objects are behaving like a natural phenomenon that will maintain their visible presence in spite of our own technological advancement.

I have been this way since I was a child, although I went from \"I want to believe\" to \"This is an example of people being stupid\" and finally my current position. UAPs are intermittent, non-reproducible phenomenon. Life is full of such experiences. Sadly, when these experiences involve extraordinary experiences, they tend to make all of those involved look stupid. Turns out people and organizations don't like looking stupid. The reason National Security is so tied up in this area is that when or if a new weapons system is deployed against the U.S., it's going to involve a lot of these exact kinds of reports. Any investigation into any of them is, in effect, an investigation into how the country learns from strange new things, like the Chinese joining the Korean War. These kinds of public investigations simply cannot occur. I still love these stories, but I love them because they tell us what happens when a large organization comes across really weird stuff it has no labels or processes for. There's no conspiracy here, that's my guess. Maybe a conspiracy of human nature. The UFO/UAP story is going nowhere, and it says a lot more about us than it does about anything in nature that anybody might encounter.

The third is that we are already actually integrated into a galactic civilization, we have a secret base on Mars where we collaborate with aliens, etc. reply thriftwy 16 hours agoparentprevMoreover, ridiculous is that aliens would be content with staying in the closet and at risk of be uncovered, like a lover in cheating wife's closet. Whatever the USG wishes, the first contact will be on the arriving party's terms. This is unless they made some very strong agreement with local governments to keep things secret. Which would be a a sign of a very bad thing for us. reply gfodor 16 hours agorootparentMy theory is they are real but they’re not aliens. They are another hominid species who live here on Earth. My explanation is actually pretty good if you condition on the assumption that they are real - if you do that, ET is very unlikely comparatively. I can kind of explain everything you see in various ways, some hard to vary, some not. reply bongodongobob 16 hours agorootparentNo, it's another fish like species and they came from the inside of the moon.

They somehow managed to eliminate enough of the evidence of their development phase on the surface to the point where we have no conclusive evidence. There is glancing evidence that there were advanced civilizations quite a bit earlier than we thought. reply thriftwy 15 hours agorootparentWhere's their datacenters and generation there? If they're in space, they've probably seeding these probes themselves for a long time. If they're on Earth, where would they hide these? Needless to say, any human government will go a great length to do whatever pleases them for peanuts of the knowledge that they have. The issue here is being that humans are catching up and eventually it will all be revealed. reply gfodor 15 hours agorootparentFigure out what physics says about the physical footprint of say 10 million small hominids who want to remain alive but live life entirely in virtual reality pods. I think you’ll conclude that from first principles you can say very well hidden, have a sustained existence as long as you fix the population, if you solve the engineering problems of situating your hardware in a void in the ground. Particularly if you know a priori you only need to do it for a few millennia. reply thriftwy 12 hours agorootparentI'm not sure why they would rule over a small void in the ground instead of ruling over the galaxy. reply gfodor 12 hours agorootparentLight speed can’t be overcome and virtual reality can be made so you optimize for minimizing latency between minds and expanding into space strictly for scientific purposes or safety reasons. (Ie, to probe it for knowledge and danger.) reply thriftwy 12 hours agorootparentVirtual people don't die of old age so they can go from star to star in \"just\" thousand years and would now span a great chunk of spiral arm. Also, since they can be copied over (can they?) they will never have to split up, they will just fork() the whole colony and say themselves goodbye. reply gfodor 12 hours agorootparentThat doesn’t make any sense to me. I would never risk anything someone told me would move my consciousness into another machine since I would have no way to know a priori if the person on the other side would still be me. Ergo I think civilizations probably just take on the precautionary principle and maintain their minimal biological form to ensure a fully linked chain of confidence they will preserve their own consciousness, but that’s the threshold and they virtualize everything else like their incoming qualia. reply zzzeek 17 hours agoprevfrustrating, because on the one hand, the explanation that all the \"UFO whistleblowing\" is all just a self-cycling money generator scheme by cranks with government jobs is the most obvious explanation.

Kirkpatrick has been contradicting himself for months now. Another recent Guardian article is more insightful. There has been a concerted effort to remove very specific parts from a new legislation about the disclosure of non-human intelligence and materials: “If it is the case that there is no substance to the UFO/UAP issue beyond misperceptions, paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, gullibility and disinformation then the government, military and academic organisations need to openly and transparently look under every alleged rock in this topic,” says clinical psychologist Daniel Stubbings of Cardiff Metropolitan University. “But they have chosen to do the exact opposite, which increases the suspicion that there is something to hide.” https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/14/what-happens... reply throwaway743 17 hours agoprevKirkpatrick has been so disingenuous and should not be taken by his word. reply taraharris 17 hours agoprevI don't know what's going on, but it's clear that there are vast sums of money going into illegal black programs beyond congressional oversight. I strongly suspect that Kirkpatrick's role is to deflect public interest and criticism in order to maintain the status quo. I don't trust a single word he says. Regardless of whether or not there is alien life, our government should be forced to open up its secrets, whatever they may be. We don't need any of this to stay safe. reply GartzenDeHaes 16 hours agoparentIn 2009, the black budget was estimated to be over $50 billion [1].

Do you have evidence of Kirkpatrick's role? > our government should be forced to open up its secrets That is generally the law (including the Freedom of Information Act), though there's overclassification by security agencies. Some things need to be classified, obviously, so what exactly are you advocating? How do we improve it? reply taraharris 16 hours agorootparentWe should repeal the National Security Act of 1947. Nuclear weapons have proliferated to nine nations around the world since the passage of that act. The production of nuclear armaments is clearly limited by political will and industrial power, not knowledge. The act protects a foreign policy establishment that has abused its power to conduct dirty tricks against other nations for decades in order to keep American elites rich and in power. No one is going to invade the American homeland, given the vast oceans separating us from the rest of the world. Repealing that act and removing the foreign policy establishment from power would unwind our vast empire abroad and greatly improve our relations with other nations. I would prefer that we do this cleanly, but unfortunately I think our empire will suffer a far messier fall from power over the coming decades. Empires at this stage flail wildly in their military adventures. reply wolverine876 15 hours agorootparentEven accepting what I think are very inaccurate perceptions of US and world international relations needs, what would we replace it with? Also, back to our topic, how do you handle secrecy? Again, obviously some things must be secret, some things public. Absolute answers are too easy - nothing, everything, destroy the entire foreign policy establishment, etc. We need real ideas and answers. reply taraharris 15 hours agorootparentThere's no need to \"destroy\" the entire foreign policy establishment. We just need to force them to operate without the secrecy and privileges they presently enjoy and exploit so they can be subject to the democratic process. Surely this is better than to suffer more wars like Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. EDIT (apparently my responses are being throttled): In response to wolverine876's question below, \"How would secrecy be managed?\" We don't need any secrecy or statecraft. We're so large and established that we can do everything out in the open. Russia and China know where our missiles, bases, ships and submarines are, and we know where their are. The only people in the dark about everything are the citizens in both countries. A similar argument was made against Linux when open-source was new. It turns out you don't need any closed source code at all to run a successful project. reply wolverine876 14 hours agorootparentI'm still not sure what solution you are suggesting. How would secrecy be managed? reply mathgradthrow 16 hours agoparentprev\"ufo detection\" and missile defense are the same technology so you couldnt be more wrong. reply taraharris 16 hours agorootparentMissile defense is a misnomer. The distinction between a defensive and offensive capability is meaningless in the context of arms races and mutually assured destruction. As we pour billions into shooting down ICBMs, China will pour billions into new delivery systems to evade that defense, and vice versa. The net result is that money on all sides is taxed away from things that people actually need and want (food, shelter, medicine, schools, parks, the arts) and directed into things that either rust in silos and bases or kill us all. The only way to stop an arms race is to increase transparency and to negotiate treaties with our peers. reply mathgradthrow 13 hours agorootparentI genuinely can't believe that you're doubling down on the idea that missile defense capability secrecy isn't necessary. Are you an actual spy? The secrecy is precisely what prevents the arms race. reply hackerlight 16 hours agorootparentprevTransparency is a double edged sword. You definitely want to hide some capability (ambiguity) otherwise the opponent can calculate what to do to win, and then just do that. reply taraharris 16 hours agorootparentWhat we need is to minimize or eliminate the adversarial relationships between nations globally. The only winners of the present status quo are the elites in every nation. reply hackerlight 15 hours agorootparentThat's heavily context dependent and it's a perspective that assumes that adversarial relationships emerge because both sides did something wrong. This naive appeasement mindset in the 1930s did more harm than good, for example. If you have a rival that's revisionist and aggressive, sometimes you need less cooperation and negotiation, and more war, in order to accelerate their demise. Of course, you usually don't want that, but as I said, it's context dependent. reply lucasRW 17 hours agoprev“They’re some of the same people that have been working behind the scenes with Congress to write legislation,” Kirkpatrick told the In the Room With Peter Bergen podcast. >> Isn't this a conspiracy theory ? reply jerf 17 hours agoparentThere is no non-\"conspiracy theory\" option anymore.

You're right. Just a frustrating observation though: It is almost never the case that someone willfully lies, knowing they are fabricating everything. They may lie right now believing it will lead to the truth, or they may lie about their motivations in order to get closer to the truth, etc. The \"core group\" TFA discusses almost certainly have been lying. But I bet they do believe they are getting closer to the truth, celebrate the wasted money as \"progress and publicity\" and I bet they don't believe they are lying outright.

Such people refuse to accept new information that might change their beliefs. Even if they might appear to listen, anything that contradicts their world view will be discarded. I would say such people are willfully lying when they promulgate theories that either lack any hard evidence or can be easily disproven. I think this includes a large number of politicians, judges, lawyers, lobbyists, bureaucrats, and anyone else whose livelihood depends on those lies. And that shit is evil. reply jvanderbot 16 hours agorootparentThere was a post on HN about this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38968619 Essentially, they aren't lying. In fact, they're responding rationally because: 1. Anyone can construct a logical sequence of arguments (see: Everyone thinks they are logical) 2. Blindly accepting logical sequence of arguments will get you a lot of incorrect results 3. Therefore, being initially skeptical of even logical-seeming things that contradict what you \"know\" is rational. \"Words? Anyone can say anything with those - why should I believe those?\" reply voakbasda 14 hours agorootparentThere is a big difference between \"humble ignorance\" based in genuine willingness to learn and \"willful ignorance\" based in the unwillingness to change established views even after logically dismantling their beliefs or being shown mountains of contradictory evidence.

Why are they doing it? Obviously, many people participate in the movement to create chaos and a sense of powerlessness through disinformation (the true aim of propaganda), so people don't know what to believe and quit. The Republican Party engages in a lot of it, I assume tactically - always stay on the offensive, keep the enemy reacting, etc. But what about the others? Are they organized? Are they sort-of lone wolves (or small packs) acting on the ideology they learned online? And I think it's been highly effective: I think that two decades ago, taking it seriously would have discredited you for life. Now that we've destroyed institutions and values like science, evidence and rationality, and embraced post-truth, it's within the norm, even encouraged. And almost nobody speaks up for science, evidence, truth. Nobody says it's ridiculous nonsense (for so many reasons); everyone just stands back, reinforcing the sense of chaos and powerlessness. Where are the adults? reply pimpampum 16 hours agoparent [–] From the scientific american article: Second, this narrative has been simmering for years and is largely an outgrowth of a former program at the DOD’s Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which was heavily influenced by a group of individuals associated with businessman and longtime ufologist Robert Bigelow, founder of Bigelow Aerospace. Inopen sources, particularly in records available on DIA’s electronic FOIA Reading Room. After the negative response by SECDEF, Senator Reid then enlisted the help of then senator Joseph Lieberman to request that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) set up an SAP for the same purpose. The administrative SAP proposal package was informed by the same individuals who had been associated with AATIP. AARO’s archival research has located the administrative proposal for the DHS SAP, complete with the participants, which has been declassified and is being reviewed for public release. Finally, the key purveyors of this narrative have known one another for decades. In the early 2000s several members of this small group also participated in a study, erroneously characterized (by the same participants) as having been sponsored by the White House, on the possible societal impact of disclosing the existence of extraterrestrials to the public, with the authenticity of the abovementioned concealed government program taken as its baseline assumption. The think tank in question was a “futures” enterprise that often worked on fringe studies, and many of the individuals involved with the study also worked for Bigelow Aerospace in support of the AATIP program. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originLink": "https://www.e-basteln.de/computing/65f02/65f02/",
    "originBody": "Solving yesterday's problems today Home Arcade Games Vintage Computing Tiny ACE LittleGP-30 RPC-4000 LGP-21 Telefunken Rollkugel Paper Tape Reader 65F02 The 100 MHz 6502 Details and Caveats Files and Links Other Projects About © 1999-2023 Jürgen Müller juergen@e-basteln.de Vintage Computing – 65F02 The 100 MHz 6502 The concept Supported host systems Project status The 6502 was the CPU in my first computer (an Apple II plus), as well as many other popular home computers of the late 1970s and 80s. It lived on well into the 1990s in game consoles and chess computers, mostly in its updated “65C02” CMOS version. Here’s a re-implementation of the 65C02 in an FPGA, in a pin-compatible format that lets you upgrade those old computers and games to 100 MHz clock rate! The concept The idea of implementing a CPU core inside an FPGA is not new, of course. In fact, the CPU core I am using is not my own, but was developed as a 6502 core by Arlet Ottens, and extended to cover the 65C02 opcodes by Ed Spittles and David Banks. A big thank-you to Arlet, Ed, and Dave for developing the core and sharing it freely! Links to their original work are on the Files & Links page. I packaged this in a Spartan-6 FPGA (with 64 kByte on-chip RAM), on a small circuit board which is just the size of a 40-pin dual inline package, with pins matching the 65C02 pinout. I added logic inside the FPGA which can access the external 65C02 bus with the correct timing, based on whatever clock is coming in from the host system. Inside the FPGA, the CPU core runs at 100 MHz. I dubbed this the “65F02”, where the “F” might stand for FPGA or for “Fast”. ;-) The 65F02 circuit board: same footprint and pinout as the original 6502 and 65C02 CPU. The idea is to use this as a “universal” accelerator for 6502 and 65C02-based host computers – just plug it into the CPU socket. The only thing the FPGA board needs to know about its host is the memory map: Where does the host have memory-mapped I/O? Up to 16 different memory maps can be stored in the FPGA, and selected via a mini DIP switch. Upon power-on, the 65F02 grabs the complete RAM and ROM content from the host and copies it into the on-chip RAM, except for the I/O area. Then the CPU gets going, using the internal memory at 100 MHz for all bus accesses except for any I/O addresses – for these, the internal CPU pauses, and an external bus cycle is started at whatever the external clock speed is. Kudos to Roland Langfeld, who suggested this elegant way of integrating an accelerator into almost any host, and has contributed a lot during the testing and debugging effort. Roland’s original interest was in 6502-based chess computers (there were some really nice ones in the 1980s). But we have successfully tested the prototype 65F02s in an Apple II and a Commodore 8032, as well as various chess computers. Thanks go to Roland Langfeld, for the idea for the 65F02 and many hours of debugging and testing in Mephisto chess computers and the Commodore 8032. The first compact 65F02 installed in a Mephisto Milano chess computer. The populated circuit board is less than a millimeter higher than the original chip package, hence also fits into tight enclosures. Supported host systems Chess computers We have focused on Mephisto chess computers first, since these are at the center of Roland’s collector’s interest. But many others are on the wishlist, including Fidelity (Elite A/S Budapest and Glasgow, Prestige, Avantgarde), Novag (Super Constellation, Super Expert C), SciSys (Turbostar), … Mephisto MM II and B&P Mephisto MM IV, MM V, Rebel Portoroz (MM X) Mephisto Polgar Mephisto Milano and Nigel Short Mephisto Rebell 5.0 Novag Constellation Forte A/B Chafitz ARB (various Sargon versions) and MGS Microcomputers So far, we are supporting the two 6502-based members of the classic 1977 “Trinity” of home computers – the Apple II and the Commodore PET series. It may be possible and worthwhile to also support some slightly later machines: The Acorn BBC Micro, Atari 400 and 800, and maybe the Commodore C64 come to mind. I don’t have any of these computers though. Please contact me if you are interested to help with an adaptation of the 65F02! Apple II, including the II plus and europlus, and presumably the //e. Quite a bit of hardware and software trickery by Steve Wozniak, and the older models do not support a real 65C02 – but the 65F02 is a bit more generous in its bus timing and works nicely. The Disk II floppy drive works nicely under DOS 3.3; support for the language card is under development. Commodore PET/CBM up to 8032. A very clean and “by the book” design. The same memory map should work for all models from the PET 2001, the 3000 and 4000 series, and the 8000 series up to the 8032. (But excluding the 8096 and beyond, which require memory bank switching.) So far we have tested this on the 8032 only; the 8050 floppy drive works. A caveat is in order here. The home computers, with their flexibility and expandability on both the hardware and software side, are bound to encounter limitations and incompatibilities: Memory expansion boards and bank switching need to be known to and emulated by the 65F02; and since the 65F02 only has 64 kByte of RAM on board, it cannot fully accelerate the extended memory. Also, while the 65F02 makes an effort to detect the access to time-critical peripheral devices, and switch back to the original slow speed temporarily, there will probably be incompatible software or add-on hardware. And finally, some software you simply don’t want to be accelerated – try an action video game at 100 MHz to understand that concern… The 65F02 supports an optional hardware switch to disable the acceleration. This way, one can still select between accelerated operation and original speed before one starts the host computer. In non-accelerated mode, the 65F02 should be fully compatible with any software or add-on hardware. (Well; unless the software uses undocumented 6502 opcodes…) Project status This is a hobby project, and I have no plans at the moment to take it commercial. Several of the small-form-factor PCBs have been assembled, and have been successfully tested in the above-mentioned computers. The tested computers include environments with TTL and CMOS logic levels, and clock rates ranging from 1 to 5 MHz. IRQs and NMIs are used in the hosts; some of the Mephisto chess computers actively use the READY signal to slow down the CPU, and the 65F02 respects that nicely. We have not used the SO (set overflow) input in earnest, but believe it to work. The chess computer community has put the 65F02 through its paces and found some very nice improvements in playing strength for the old chess computers. Games and commentary can be found in the German schachcomputer.info forum, in particular in the threads here, here, and here. If you have ideas for the 65F02, would like to help in developing support for additional computers, would like to write about it, please contact me via the email address provided in the About section. Update, July 2022: The global electronics supply bottlenecks affect this project too. The Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA (in the required package and speed grade) has moved from a lead time of more than one year to “we don’t know”. The 65F02 will sit on the back burner until the supply situation hopefully returns to normal. The 65F02 can directly replace a 6502 or 65C02 in their 40-pin DIP socket. The bottom side of the circuit board. Left to right: clock oscillator, decoupling capacitors, level converters for 5V input signals, voltage regulators.   Details and Caveats",

You could have these kinds of memory pages: * Fixed ROM bank * Bankswitchable ROM bank * Fixed RAM bank * Bankswtichable RAM bank * IO memory * RAM that's read by external devices * RAM that's written to by external devices (basically just IO) Caching is trivially easy for fixed a ROM or RAM bank which are not used by other devices. Caching a bankswitchable bank requires either invalidating on bankswitch, or knowing the bank switching well enough to just cache everything. Pure IO memory is simple, no caching for that at all. For RAM that's read by other devices, Write-Through caching would work. reply masfuerte 8 hours agoparentThe BBC Master had an even funkier mode. The RAM bank accessed could depend on the current program counter. Imagine a video display taking 16K of RAM. This would be situated between addresses 0x4000 and 0x8000. This same memory range also included non-video RAM. The hardware transparently selected the video or non-video RAM depending on which code was accessing it. Specifically, if the program counter was at 0xC000 or above (i.e. code in the OS ROM was running) then accesses to the video range would go to the video RAM. But if the program counter was elsewhere (i.e. running user code or an application ROM) then accesses to the video range would go to user RAM, not video RAM. Additionally, there was a hardware register controlling this so that user code could choose to directly access the video RAM, and OS code could access the user RAM. reply forinti 8 hours agorootparentI've been looking for a detailed explanation on this, because I would like to know how they read the PC. The New Advanced User's Manual describes the flag at &FE34 on the Master and B+ and I've read this thing about using the PC from a few places but I haven't found any specifics. Could you clarify? How do you know from the outside what's in the PC? reply ddingus 7 hours agorootparentWould they not just mooch the address off the address bus? reply morcheeba 5 hours agorootparentYep. The 65C02 has a SYNC output that goes high to indicate an instruction is being fetched on the current cycle. Since there is no cache, it's pretty simple to use this to determine the PC. reply ddingus 3 hours agorootparentThought so. From there, it is a bit of logic to map the chip selects to make the writes and reads come and go from the intended resources. reply forinti 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's it then. I was missing the sync pin. Thank you. reply rbanffy 10 hours agoparentprevThe article mentions the bank-switching issues and that the FPGA only has 64K, which limits emulation of higher memory configs - it’d not emulate a //e with 80-column display (which requires 128K). reply bpye 3 hours agorootparentYou could plausibly make bank switching work, but it’d take some effort. You’d want your block RAM to act as a write back cache, and then any bank switch must be intercepted and delayed until you can flush the full contents of the cache to memory. Or if bank switching is fast and occurs too frequently for that to be viable, you could avoid the flush across a bank switch, but then you may need to perform a bank switch for an eviction. reply Lio 1 hour agoprevThis sounds like it would be really suitable for a BBC Micro second processor. They had designs for, amongst other, a 64K 65C02 running at a different clock speed[1]. Back in the day I always wanted one for playing Elite[2] (but then I also wished that Acorn had provided an official hardware update for 16 colours instead of 8.) 1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro_expansion_unit 2. https://www.bbcelite.com/6502sp/ reply nubinetwork 6 hours agoprevJust throwing it out there, but I think you can still buy eZ180's that run at something like 133mhz. Edit: hmm nope, mouser and digikey don't have them anymore... fastest I could find was 50mhz and it was marked as not for new designs. Bummer. reply pvg 11 hours agoprevBig previous thread in from 2021: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28852857 reply dmitrygr 11 hours agoprevThere are 300MHz 8051s around in all sorts of unlikely places. Many pocket mp3 players used to be based on them. reply Moto7451 10 hours agoparentIs there an advantage to a 300MHz 8051 vs a Cortex M0? Predated their existence? I know there’s a lot of 8051 tooling but I’m only a dabbler in microcontrollers and it seems like AVRs and M0/M3s have taken the place of PICs and 8051s in hobby world. reply ddingus 10 hours agorootparentThere are a few: If you need rapid, real time responses to external signals, the faster clocked 8 bitters are excellent! Many chips can get into an interrupt service routine in just a handful of cycles. In tandem with this, these devices can pack a lot of logic into a small amount of code. From Dallas Semi: Our 1 clock-per-machine-cycle processors reached a remarkable performance goal—1 clock-per-machine-cycle, currently at 33 million instructions per second (MIPS). From Silicon Labs: The proven 8051 core received a welcome second wind when its architecture lost patent protection in 1998. [...] The original Intel 8051 core took 12 cycles to execute 1 instruction; thus, at 12 MHz, it ran at 1million instructions per second (1 MIP). In contrast, a 100 MHz Silicon Labs 8051 core will run at 100 MIPS or 100 times faster than the classic 8051 at a frequency that is only about 8x the classic 8051’s frequency. That's really fast, when it comes to responding to external events! Say one needs to read an incoming data stream, or control something moving at a high rate of speed. Both of these tasks depend on a device that can sense and respond in as close to real time as things get. Large, production proven, time tested code bodies. 6502, 8051, z80, etc... all have a ton of library code that's not difficult to understand and make use of. Often, these 8 bit designs can run on crazy low power, or operate very efficiently at full speed. Licensing isn't generally an issue. Adding a well documented and production proven 8 bit core to a specialized design works pretty well! Often, the custom hardware on chip does the heavy lifting, leaving UX and control tasks, both of which are easy and lean enough for 8 bits of CPU to make sense. The last thing I would put here is subjective, but ease of development can be an advantage, but it depends on the developer. Once someone has bootstrapped themselves onto 8 bit computing, the constraints on development both limit possible application scope and with that limit comes ease of development. When used to their strengths, simple chips like these are easy to develop for. It's possible for one person to completely understand a device and with that understanding fully exploit it. reply iamflimflam1 2 hours agorootparentInteresting - I’ve been playing with some SD Card to USB interface ICs and almost all of them include an 8051 core. reply nullc 9 hours agorootparentprevI wonder what the limit of computing power per joule is with current technology, assuming you were freely able to change the architecture. For example, perhaps you wouldn't use an integer instruction pointer, because a full adder to increment it is expensive. Instead you could use a LFSR where each increment requires only a couple xor gates and some wires. But it would mean that your code would have to be scattered in memory in a funny order. No problem for a smart assembler. How much computing power could you drive from a device powered by nothing other than ambient RF? reply IIAOPSW 5 hours agorootparent>I wonder what the limit of computing power per joule is Today you're going to learn that the universe puts a hard limit on this known as \"Launder's principle\". To derive it in short, the (information) entropy on the input side of a single traditional logic gate is 2 bits, but on the output side it is just 1 bit. This seems to imply that the (physical) entropy of the computer would go down after the computation, because your computer had more possible physical states it could be in at the time of input than it seems to have at the time of output. But this is impossible as it violates the 2nd law of thermodynamics. To resolve the contradiction, each logic gate must be putting the missing bit of entropy on an untracked non-computational degree of freedom within the physical system. In other words the untracked \"missing\" information is encoded as seemingly random waste heat, and dumped into the environment at room temperature. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle reply ComputerGuru 4 hours agorootparentFrom the linked Wikipedia, as a more direct answer to GP’s question: > Modern computers use about a billion times as much energy per operation [than this theoretical minimum energy per bit of entropy “erased”] reply nullc 3 hours agorootparentprevwell aware, which is why I put the technology limit on it! reply crotchfire 6 hours agorootparentprev... and adding an integer to a pointer would be hellaciously expensive. If you have the foundry SPICE models you can calculate these kinds of lower-limit values. I did this for 45nm a long time ago and vaguely recall getting numbers down in the double-digit femtojoule range for 32-bit addition, measuring only transistor R+C. But the transistors don't really cost anything; all the CV^2 is in charging and discharging the wires. And the \"C\" is totally geometry-dependent. It's not like software -- at least not when you're pushing all the limits -- everything affects everything else. reply nullc 3 hours agorootparent> ... and adding an integer to a pointer would be hellaciously expensive. Fair, though if it were only the PC and instruction memory that were permuted that isn't much of an issue. It's not that bad the circuit looks more like a multiplier rather than an adder. (search term would be LFSR fast-forward or jump-ahead). PC is updated presumably on every cycle, while adding an an integer to it is probably a rare operation (just don't use computed jumps...). reply ddingus 6 hours agorootparentprevI think of this too. And I break it down into ads and operations. An ad is simply summing two inputs of some kind. In operation, might be a change of state or an input coming online or going away. Something analogous to the bit operations and or not exclusive or and friends. With all the physics talk of information being fundamental, I suspect we will find both an upper bound and a lower bound. The upper bound will be something like compute power per volume divided by energy or some similar construct. Basically you can only pack so much information and so many operations into a given region of space and energy level possible for that energy for that region of space to contain. The lower bound might be something like the plank constant for computation. What's the smallest unit of space and energy level that can support an add, for example. It's interesting to think about. Sorry for the typos I used voice dictation on this one reply dmitrygr 8 hours agorootparentprevThe thing you describe about replacing PC with an LFSR has actually been done, to simplify the silicon. Some very cheap 4-bit micro controllers, often used for TV Remotes, in fact, do this. reply addaon 10 hours agorootparentprevBesides the other comments, you can get 8051s at much lower power than M0s... think 1 picojoule per (8 bit) op vs 10 picojoules per (32 bit) op, give or take. It's pretty common to see 8051s in the low power zone of microcontrollers that also have one or more 32 bit cores on them. Generally the low power zone (including the 8051) can be run off an external clock (so 25 MHz - 100 MHz) in the 1 mW range, or can be run off an RC oscillator at a lower speed (like 7 ± 3 MHz) in the 100 µA range, both of which usefully extend the ability of the system to monitor for wake events and decide when to bring those Arm big boys on line. Some can even take the 8051 down to your 32 kHz real time clock for < 40 µA operation. reply pclmulqdq 10 hours agorootparentprevM0s have taken the place of many 8051s in the \"pro\" world as well. There's still the niche that sibling comments have mentioned, but a lot of \"default small MCUs\" for new projects used to be 8051s and are now M0s. reply dmitrygr 10 hours agorootparentprev8051 has no cost to license and if you are mostly using an accelerator to decode mp3, then the servicing of it is simple enough. Why rewrite the code you already have (from before cortex-m0 existed) or redesign the accelerator you already have? reply userbinator 2 hours agoparentprevThe Z80 was common in MP3/\"MP4\" players too. reply Theodores 6 hours agoprevI wish I could go back in time to run Mandelbrot fractals on a BBC Micro with this - think how impressed people would be with instant zoom rather than a half hour wait! reply jacquesm 5 hours agoparentPart of the magic was the half hour wait though. It felt as though you were doing some serious computation! reply ddingus 2 hours agorootparentSame with things like sine plots. The reveal is part of the fun. I just had a thought about what might be really fun at 100Mhz, and that is cellular automata. There are the classic game of life rules. Going fast on those is fun. But, maybe a more general engine is worth writing. I may try it on my 16Mhz 6502 system. reply bitwize 7 hours agoprevPeople write games for the TI-99/4A in TI BASIC (or Extended BASIC) that would be too slow to be any fun on the original hardware, but flip on Classic99's Turbo mode and suddenly you have arcade action! I can see an upgrade like this enabling games, demos, and other software that wouldn't be possible on the stock Apple or Commodore systems. reply ddingus 7 hours agoparentIt does not take 100Mhz to do that. A while back I bought a FastChip for my Apple 2e. That delivers a 16Mhz 65C02 or 65C816 (I bought the latter option) The trick to getting superfast Applesoft is to copy it into the card fast RAM. Otherwise, Applesoft is still faster than stock, but main board RAM is still clocked at 1Mhz. Not enough of a boost to really matter. However, once Applesoft is on the card, the situation is reversed! All accesses to main board RAM are 1Mhz, but that is plenty fast to draw a ton of graphics. Applesoft programs run crazy fast when the 16Mhz 6502 has the job. reply leptons 4 hours agoparentprevThere are demos written for the SuperCPU 20mhz accelerator for the C64. There are also demos written for the Ram Expansion Unit. I think there was one recent demo released that runs in an emulator with no throttling so it's something like a 40MHz C64.

It runs an FPGA-built 6502 with 64kB of RAM at 100MHz. The FPGA knows which memory addresses it has to read and write to the actual memory of the system it’s plugged in, and, when needed, accesses that at the speed the system expects. reply satiric 9 hours agorootparentOh I see, that's neat. That makes way more sense that what I was thinking. reply rbanffy 10 hours agoparentprev [–] It slows down to access the bus when needed.
